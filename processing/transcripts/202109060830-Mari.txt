Thank you very much. And let me say it's a real great pleasure for me to have been invited. Thank you very much. I want to thank the organizer and to be here and to talk about a recent joint work with Jon Bion, Noris Akoma, and Andrea Marchiodi. It will be posted, we hope, by the end of this month or maybe the other. It's coming asymptotically to. It's coming asymptotically to an end, but luckily, probably in finite time. So, the purpose is to investigate the regularity of a quasinar elliptic equation that appears in geometry and physics. In particular, one of the main motivation is a model proposed by Born and Inferred in 34 as an alternative to the approach to electromagnetism. To electromagnetism proposed by Maxwell. E is the electric field and B is the magnetic field. Maxwell's equation, or the Euler Lagrange equation, of an action, which is the integral on Lorentzian space, of a Lagrangian, which is the electrical field squared minus the magnetic field square. It has a problem that violates the principle of finiteness of the energy. What do I mean? Of the energy. What do I mean? In the electrostatic case, so when b is equal to zero and e is independent of time, the Euler-Lagrange equation can be, I mean, the action can be reduced to an action on three space, given in terms of the electric potential phi, whose gradient is the electric field. So, what happens if we have a source which is a point particle? It creates a Dirac delta. It creates a Dirac delta as a charge. And the potential solves the Poisson equation. So it's the classical Newtonian potential. It goes like one over R in dimension three near the punter, near the charge. And the problem is that the point particle has infinite Dirichlet energy. The Dirichlet energy is the Hamiltonian associated to the action I wrote above. So the point particle creates a field. Point particle creates a field that has infinite local energy. It's not a problem at infinity, it's a problem at the puncture. So, Born and Infer, starting from consideration of general invariance of the action by means with respect to general transformation and inspired by also by general relativity, propose an alternative Lagrangian and an alternative action. The Lagrangian has a maximum. The Lagrangian as a maximum is in L infinity, and the maximum field strength we will state it equal to one in this talk for convenience. In the electrostatic case, this becomes the following action acting on electric potential in Rm, in R3, wherever. And so I emphasize that. And so I emphasize that the electric potential have to have associated electric field, that means the gradient of no more than one. Formally, the Euler-Lagrange equation for this equation is the following. d phi square root of one minus d phi square so is equal to delta naught. So you have a pathological behavior in where the gradient is one. The solution for a single charge can be computed explicitly and differently from the Newtonian potential. It has the following behavior: the field potential is bounded in zero. A gradient is less than one, and the gradient goes to one as x goes to zero. And this is called a bion because of the name. Okay, so we have a smooth solution with a conical behavior. Behavior at the puncture. And actually, if you compute the Hamiltonian locally, it's up to some other terms. It's the same as computing this energy. And it's actually finite. So it does the job. And actually, the paper is beautiful, extremely beautiful. So our problem. So, our problem is the following: to investigate the equation arising from the equivalent of Poisson equation. Given an open set, and we will consider a smooth bounded open set, let's say Lipschitz, or the entire space, and given a measure, what can we say about solution, weak solution of this equation that we call the Born-infrared equation in a bounded set with a given boundary value that has to be sufficient. Boundary value that has to be sufficiently good in the entire space under the condition that the field goes to zero at infinity. What do we mean? Weak solution, just to point out, means that the integral du against the eta, the test function eta divided by square root of one minus du square, should be the measure row applied to eta for every eta, let's say, leap sheet with compact support in omega. Sheets with compact support in omega. Okay. Okay. Formally, problem BI, born infant, is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the following action, the born infant action, plus the natural term associated to the measure. On which function space? The restriction we have to put is that the gradient has to be less or equal than one. In the local case, we need to put a boundary value phi in the global case. We have to put a decay at infinity, which is codified by the fact that our set is the closure of C infinity with compass support with respect to a suitable norm. Okay, variationally, the problem is simple. So we can embed into a good Banach space whose dual contains measure our set as a Our set as a closed convex set and the function has a nice variational problem. So the minimizer exists and is unique. Okay. Also, if a function solves Borne infer, so the Euler Ragrange equation, it's automatically the minimizer. But what is the regularity? Well, the minimizer can be wild. And the following simple example shows, you take, let's say, a ball in Euclidean space in a ramp. Euclidean space in Rn plus one, you take a hyperplane with slope one and take as a boundary value the value of the function describing the hyperplane along the boundary of omega. Well, take for instance the distribution to be zero, then the solution Euro is precisely the hyperplane. So the gradient is identically equal to one, so there's no meaning for the Euler Legrand, no hope to have any reasonable sense in which an oil. Any reasonable sense in which an Euler-Lagrange equation is solved. But in this example, the phi, the boundary value, is bad because it has slope one, let me say. A fact is that at least if phi is a good boundary value, let's say delta Lipschitz for delta less than one, but things can be considerably weakened, we have two desirable properties. First one is that the First, one is that the Hamiltonians is occurring bounded, as we want. For a solution of Born inferred, we can define a solution of Born inferred as a function for which the Hamiltonian is locally bounded and the Oral Lagrange equality holds. So this is automatically the boundedness. The Hamiltonian will be later denoted with W or W rho. In particular, this shows that the gradient is less than 1. The gradient is less than one almost everywhere. I anticipate that it's completely open, a kind of partial regularity result for the gradient, depending on row. So it would be very desirable to say something more about the set where the gradient goes to one. And it's completely open. And the other good starting point is that the Neuler-Lagrange inequality holds. Remember that you are making a variational problem on a closed convex. Variational problem on a closed convex set which has a boundary. So it's expected that the minimum satisfies only an Euler-Lagrange inequality. Actually, equality holds if and only if you solve Borne Fat. Okay, this test function does not include all Lipschitz functions. It's not immediate if the boundary is not that good, but it holds. Okay, the equation has a nice geometric interpretation. Has a nice geometric interpretation, which is in the title, because Borne in Fed is actually a prescribed mean parameter equation. We consider a solution with gradients than one, and in our m plus one, we construct this graph. So this is u. And if we endow our m plus one with a Lorentz metric, making the d zero direction space time-like. Well, actually, since the gradient is less than one, the manifold with the induced metric is a Riemannian manifold. There is a time-like uniquenormal upward pointing, future pointing. And the equation says that the mean curvature of this graph should be equal to rho. So, in particular, when rho is a collection. Particular when rho is a collection of point charges, it gives rise to a maximal hypersurface, maxima space-like hypersurface with singularities. And somehow these are useful in string theory. Okay, motivated by this picture, we say that a function is space-like if it's sufficiently regular. It's sufficiently regular, C1 alpha log, and the gradient is less than one. So if the associated graph with the induced metric is Riemannian. So the enemy for regularity are the points where the gradient is one. In particular, one of the problems is to deal with light segments. So segments with So, segments with slope one in the graph of you of the minimizer. Hereafter, with a slight abuser notation, I will say that xy is the light segment. Okay, and a good if you understand the set of light segments, somehow you can start some kind of Start some kind of regularity procedures that are known in the literature. What is known? Actually, the problem does not have a huge literature. And in 82, the foundational work is Bartney Simon's work in 82, which deal with the case row in an infinity. And they prove that Euro is space-like. So in particular, it's Sauce-Born infinity. So, in particular, it solves Borne infant. If it's C1 alpha with radius less than one, it solves the oral gradient point. Just to say, the starting point in their proof, the key lemma making all possible is the anti-peeling theorem that says that if you have a light segment, then it has to extend up to the boundary. So, if the boundary is good, let's say delta Lipsheets for delta less than one, you don't have light segments. You don't have light segments, and it is the starting point for regularity and crucially uses royalty filtering. And the other case has been considered by Klyachin, Mikliukov, and together with the other Kliachin twin brother, Vladimir, in the beginning of the 90s, they have nice works, various nice works on the problem. They dealt with the case, with the maxima case with singularities. So where the distribution is a sum of Dirac delta, and they say that Euro is space. And they say that Euro is space-like outside of the charges. So it's smooth there. And source-born infant always in dimension two, independently of the charges. And in higher dimension, they have, they need a smallness condition on the charges. Smallness, which is explicit, almost explicit, let's say. It's explicit, for instance, if the boundary datum is constant. Okay? It's a no. Okay, it's anticipate it's an open problem to understand whether, in dimension at least three, this condition and the corresponding one in the global setting, so in the setting of the entire Euclidean space, is really necessary. Okay, in the global setting, the problem has been treated in more recent years, and more can be said. Can be said starting from Kiesling 2012, and a series of work of Bonhard and Davina Pomponi, then with Colasson and Folds, and other with Jacopetti, and then also Arada. If rho is bounded in L infinity, then you rho space-like, basically because of Bernie-Seiner. Okay, if rho is a sum of direct deltas, same conclusion as in Same conclusion as in Klyachin Miklyukov. The bound here is different, but it's completely explicit. And actually, they don't prove that it's source-born infant, but with the methods in our paper, we can also prove that it's source-born infant. So we can complement their work. And just to point out here, Kiesling into Here, Kiesling in 2012 claimed that the solution solves born infer for every value of the charges. The proof had a flow, which was pointed out by Bonard, Davini, and Pomponia. And later, six years later, there appeared Aneratum. Personally, I'm not able to follow the argument, but that's my fault. It's rather complicated. I would like to see a different proof. Proof. So the result of casing should be that there is no restriction on the charges. And a remarkable achievement has been done in the last years by Bonoria Copeti, two works and Arala at the same time. They dealt with the case Q bigger than M and they proved that the solution is still space-like. So gradient less than one and C1 alpha. Gradient less than one and C one alpha. And this is sharp, as can be done by the, as can be seen by looking at the radial setting. This LP is just to make raw in the right function spaces. Okay. Another open problem, completely open, is the regularity LQ lock. So put a lock in here, the method fails. One of the main difficulties in this Difficulties in this problem is to localize because cutoff is not easy to localize with standard cutoff. In many cases, they create problems, they create terms that cannot be absorbed. So, localization is the main problem. And here, they get rid of the problem of localization by the decay properties at the infinity of the solution. So, this is So, this is to our knowledge all the results that are known about the problem, the existence problem, which are our results. The first one is an existence result, existence of pathological examples. We can construct a smooth domain, let's say a large ball, and a function which is zero on the boundary of the ball and lies in the right space. Let's say it's compactly supported. Space that says compactly supported in the boss, so can be even extended to a solution in the right function space inequality in the entire space that source born info with a good distribution, which is integrable for any power less than n minus one, but it has a light segment. And the light segment does not touch the boundary. Even more, the Hamiltonian of this solution is much. Of this solution is much more integrable than L1. And also the solution, the Hessian of the solution, is in Lq, even divided by this factor, which is less than one. So we have more than W2 lock regularity. So the solution is rather regular. The distribution is rather regular. But the solution has a light segment, which is the first example of this kind. First example of this kind that I know that we found in the lectures. Arguably, it seems that this condition be optimal. We are tempted to say that if Q is bigger than M minus 1, then actually there are no light segments. We can also construct examples with higher code. example we higher could higher dimensional light segment if you want a light segment of set of light segments of dimension l you reduce by l the the dimension the regularity of q and l can be at most n minus 2 so up to codimension 2 in particular let's say the case the case q equal to n minus 1 is Is really open. And it's in particular the case of m equal to 3, so the physical dimension, and rho in L2. So starting from dimension 4, we can produce solution with a light segment. But in dimension 3, not. And it's, I think it's one of the we have tried to deal with dimension 3, but we couldn't be, we haven't been able to see whether or not it has a light. To see whether or not it may have a light set. What's the point? Starting, building from this example, we can construct also examples that do not solve born inferno. And the second theorem is the following. If we have a solution with a light segment and the light segment is arranged in such a way that the value in y is bigger than the value in x, then for every alpha, we can find, let's say, a perturbation of our distribution. Perturbation of our distribution such that the same function minimizes the functional but does not solve born infant. So we can construct minimizers that do not solve born infant for distribution that are direct deltas, two direct deltas plus an absolutely continuous part which is in L Q for every Q less than n minus one. In particular, the result of Klyachimiklyukov establishing Establishing a threshold for the charges. Okay. Establishing a threshold for the charges to have solvability of born infant cannot be extended by summing an absolutely continuous part in LQ for Q less than n minus one. So we have a first indication which should be Be the right threshold for the regularity to have or not light segment and to solve or not borne infect. What's our existence resulting on the positive side? The first one is for R2 and improves on 3HC nucleoc. Take a Lipschitz domain, take a good boundary value and a measure, which can be decomposed at a singular part whose support. Whose support is in a small set. Small set means that the Hausdorff measure of order t log t of the support of sigma should be zero. This is a condition which is implied by the condition that the Hausdorff dimension of sigma should be strictly less than one. It's in between this condition and saying that h1 of sigma is zero. So that means that sigma doesn't have to contain light segments, should be smaller than light segments. Be smaller than light segments, smaller than dimension one. And the absolutely continuous part is only in L2 lock outside of sigma. Then under these conditions in two-dimensional setting, Euro satisfies Born infield, doesn't have light segments, and for every domain outside of the singularities of the distribution, we have an enhanced, an improved And improved W2 to lock estimate. We have that the Hessian multiplied by the Hamiltonian is integrable, and some parts of the Hessian are even more integrable. And also, you have a higher integrability of the Hamiltonian itself. We cannot raise the power to a power higher than one, but we can add a logarithm to the power that we want. Technically, this is. Technically, this is one of the key points in the proof. And the possibility to deal with singularity comes from a removable singularity theorem. And we can also localize the problem. That means if on a smaller domain rho is in n infinity, then u here is space. And you here is space-like. Basically, because there are no light segments there, it's a more or less direct consequence. What happens in higher dimension in the local case? But then just a couple of minutes and in higher dimension, we have the same setting, still with L2. What can we say now? At least if the dimension is four, is at least four, we can have light segments. So we have a set that calls k, which is the set of light segments. And what we can say is that Euro satisfies Born infer the Euler-Lagrange equation outside of K. That means for compactly supported Lipschitz function outside of K. And also if K does not Does not meet the boundary and neither meets the singular set sigma. We don't know whether this happens or not, may happen or not. We don't have example. But in this case, we can solve boniferon omega, even having light segment. Okay, so this is not true. And this higher integrability for the Hamiltonian is Is restricted to domain outside of the right segments. But we don't have an estimate on the measure of this side of this. And just to point out the last result in the global setting, so our assumption should be compared to that of Bonoria, Copetti, and Aharala. So we assume that the distribution. So, we assume that the distribution is in the right LP space, but if we only assume L2 lock in Euclidean space, then we can prove that you are also born infer and we can prove even having light segments, it's also born info, which is something that does not happen, may not happen in the local setting. May not happen in the local setting. Sorry. I see that I switch back and forth more quickly than the video, so I hope it's not too much messy. So Eurosols born in and three, which is the higher integrability holds on every compact subset. And I just remark that in this case, Euro may have lights. In this case, Euro may have light segments as we as we saw in dimension at the moment at least four. So, this in dimension three, it's open whether it can have or not like seven. We also have a corresponding result for in the global setting when you add a singular measure, which is of more very similar to the one I stated in the local in the case of bounded domains. So, I think I'm over. So, I think I'm over. And but thank you. I prepared a final thanks. Okay. Thank you very much for your attention. And thanks a lot for the invitation.
