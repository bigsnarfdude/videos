So they are real. Um thank you uh organizers for giving the invitation, for the opportunity to speak at this wonderful conference. So yeah, so this is joint work with my colleague Vincent Astier. And so we're trying to develop some kind of non-commutative real algebra, so where there are orderings in the background. And we needed this local global principle for Anzermaya algebra. Principle for Alzheimer, Algebra, with evolution as a tool. And we thought it would be a simple case of lifting the central simple case, but that didn't work. So, in the end, it took us about 30 pages to figure out how to do it, and I will give you in the 30 minutes that I have a very quick synopsis of what's involved. So, first of all, let me set some basic notation. So, R is going to be a community. Basic notation. So, R is going to be a commutative ring, and I'm always going to assume that 2 is invertible. And A sigma will be not an Azamaya algebra with involution over R. And then the usual notation, W A sigma will be the width group of A sigma, so classes of non-singular emission forms over H sigma. And I will think of this as a module over the width ring of that ring. And often I will actually identify forms with their classes without, say, Forms with their classes without saying that that's okay in this context. And of course, Fister's Global Principle doesn't really need an introduction, so the following statement should look very familiar, and you're probably also not surprised that it will work for Alzheimer's algebras. But nevertheless, it required some thinking. So, the assumption we have to make is that R is actually a semi-local ring, because already in the basic case of current forms, there are counterexamples for rings that are not semi-local. That are counterexamples for reeds that are not similar. So, somehow, currently, the minimal assumption we have to make. And so, essentially, the local Google principle has two statements. The first statement is that the torsion of the width group is two primary. And the second statement is actually a characterization of the torsion elements in terms of signatures. And that characterization is over here. So, if we take a non-singular initial form H over H sigma, H over H sigma, then some two power of number of copies. So cross just means that you take the orthogonal sum of H with itself 2 to the n times. So this is going to be hyperbolic, so its class is going to be a torsion element in the Wid group, if and only if its signature vanishes at all ordings of the ring, and it's all equivalent with its signature vanishing at all maximal ordings. Vanishing at all, maximal all lengths of the ring. And so there is a funny little green M here, and I'll explain a little bit later what it actually means. So, what I want to do first is say a few words about orderings on rings. You're probably more familiar with orderings on fields, they're just total orderings, but for rings, maybe you're not so familiar with that, so I want to say a few words about that. And then I also want to say a few words about how to compute this signature object. Objects. So, first of all, you can define objects by a number of properties. So, if we take our ring R, and you can do this very general ring, by the way, you don't need to assume similar. If you have a subset P which is closed under subs and closed under products, and such that P union minus P gives you the ring back, and such that the intersection of P minus P. Of p minus p is actually a prime ideal of the ring, then you speak of an ordering of r. And when you have an ordering, you can actually also define a notion of positivity. You can say that an element r is positive at p if and only if it is an element of p but not in minus p. So this is an interesting situation. So you have positive elements, those that are in p but not in minus p. You've got negative elements, those that are in minus p but not in p. Minus p, but not at b. And then you've got elements that are both positive and negative at the same time. And they live in this in this intersection, they live in that prime ideal. So the prime ideal is usually denoted by soup, and it's called the support of the support of the ordering P. And of course, in the field case, that prime ideal is going to be zero, and you just have positive. And you just have positive elements and negative elements and zero, and that's it. So this complicates matters a little bit. And so the set of all these orderings is then called the real spectrum of the ring. And I think the name is inspired by the ordinary prime spectrum because you can actually show that this description is equivalent with another description. You can think of these as all the pairs. These are all the pairs of the form alpha, where the first entry is a prime ideal of R, and the second entry is an ordering on a field, namely on the quotient field of R module P. And so I guess that's where the wheel spectrum comes from somehow. And so this wheel spectrum is actually a topological space, so the standard topology is called Topology is called the Harrison topology, or also the spectral topology. And it's determined by sub-base with sets of this particular form. So for each element R in the ring, you look at all those old rings where the element is going to be positive. So you look at all those sets, we form a sub-basis. And this topology is quasi-compact. In general, it's not Hausdorff. And in general, it's also not totally disconnected. Are not totally disconnected. And you can improve that slightly. So you can, inside, you can take chains of inclusions and you can then look at maximal elements with respect to inclusion. Then you can look at the industopology on this new set, the Speier-Max of R. And this thing will be compact and Hausdorff. So I talked to Kwasik, so it will be compact and Hausdorff, but in general not totally disconnected. Not totally disconnected. And then you can come to the familiar situation of fields. If your ring actually happens to be a field, then Speermax R and Spear R collapse, they will become the same thing. And then this is usually denoted by x index f. And this is then called the space of order lengths of the field. And the topology there will be compact, Hausdorff, and totally disconnected. And so these properties are useful to know when you're doing certain computations. So that's the situation. So that's the situation for rings, which is a bit more sophisticated in a certain sense, and then for fields, everything becomes nice. And yeah, so that's the real spectrum. The next thing that I want to discuss then briefly is signatures. So suppose you take an ordering alpha on the ring, and we need signatures. The ring, and we need signatures both for quadratic forms over rings and also for emission forms over the Alzheimer's algebra with the Molution. So for quadratic forms, you do that simply. So you have the written over here, you have the integers, and you have a map, a signature map at alpha, and it's simply computed in the following way. You take your product form, and then you, I think I'll call this specialize it to kappa alpha. Called is specialize it to kappa alpha, but then you end up with a product form over a field, and you have an induced ordering on that field, and then you can use the compute usual Sylvester signature. So the difference between the number of positive elements and the number of negative elements at the ordering alpha bar. So you can do that. And for Hermitian forms, you can do something similar. You can take a Hermitian form of Maya algebra resolution. And this time, when you go to And this time, when you go to kappa alpha, the algebra with evolution actually becomes a central simple algebra with involution. So then you can compute the signature of the Hermitian form over the central simple algebra with evolution with respect to the ordering alpha bar on the field kappa alpha. And so this is a computational procedure essentially. I've talked about that on previous occasions in a Wolfak, so I'm not going to do that, but essentially, Going to do that, but essentially, in a number of steps, you can reduce it to computing an ordinary Sylvester signature. But you need to use Morita equivalence at some point, a Hemitical Morita equivalence. And that's why this curly M is there to warn you, okay, there is some Morita theory being used in the background. And if you choose a different Morita equivalence, what can happen is that you have a sign change. However, in the context of this local law principle, it actually doesn't matter because you're computing zero. Because you're computing zero, so whether it's plus one or minus one, no one cares about that. So that means I can essentially ignore this M throughout the talk. But I just want to say there is some subtle business going on in the background that sometimes pops up out of the graphs and that you can need to deal with in your computations. But for the talk, it really doesn't matter. So that's how we compute the signature. So then let me just display the statement again. Let me just display the statement again, and now with the explanations of what I mean with orderings and what I mean with signatures. So, let me say a little bit about the history of this theorem. So, obviously, I mean, the name gives it away somehow. Pfister proved this in 1966 for fields. And then in 1982, Maillet proved this for semi-local rings. And Mae's paper also contains a counterexample, which is due to Claybush, which shows that. Which is due to Claybush. It shows that it doesn't work if, you know, it's an example for a ring which is not semi-local. So this seems to be the minimal hypothesis. And then the extension to central simple algebra with involution, so the two primary torsion bits was actually obtained by Charlau, Winfried Charlau in 1970. And then the characterization in terms of signatures was done by Devil Goose and myself in two thousand three. In 2003. And in 2018, Karen Becker and myself, we actually wrote a paper, you know, doing this more in a more modern treatment and also including a proof for slightly more general orderings called P-orderings. But it's kind of more contained. So that industry you can check that. And so the proof takes about 30 pages, and of course I can't do that, but I'm going to try to give you. To try to give you, let's stop this thing. Okay, that's confusing. So I just want to give you the main steps because, in fact, the timing was very good. It was both fortuitous and propicious. Because in twenty twenty two, three papers appeared that contained an an awful amount of tools that Contained an awful amount of tools that we somehow needed, and they were just there. So, the timing was really excellent, and I will mention that on the following slides. So, the proof consists, first of all, in a reduction to the case where R is semi-local and connected. In the second step, we need to prove Sylvester's law of inertia for the initial forms of sentence simpler, sorry, over the nylon's with evolution. So, we have a version of that. And then there are two propositions. And then there are two propositions that I just call one and two. I'll show you what they look like later. And once you've proved them, you can put everything together and then you can get. Okay, so now before I come to that, I need a little bit more annotation. So when you're looking at Alzheimer's algebra with involution, and in the special case, at central simple algebra with involution, there are a number of orderings. There are a number of ordings that are in a certain sense undesirable, and these are the orderings where the signature map becomes identically zero. So we collect them in a set that we call mil A sigma. And this has also some topological properties, but that's not important for this talk. So for example, if after tensoring with kappa alpha, your Alzheimer algebra becomes a matrix algebra of the field Kappa Alpha, and the evolution becomes a joint. And the evolution becomes adjoint to some skew symmetric bilinear form, in that case, your alpha is going to be a null order. So that gives you an idea of what these null orders look like. And another thing that we need is elements of maximal signature. So again, I choose an ordering, alpha, and then I look at one-dimensional energy forms. So the notations that I guess. The notations, they, I guess, are pretty standard. So A sigma just maps XY to sigma X AY. So we take symmetric invertible elements A, we look at these one-dimensional Hermitian forms, and we can compute these signatures. So these will be integers. And we take the maximum. That will exist. It will be finite and it will exist. It will be finite and it will actually be independent of the choice of the Marita equivalents. And then, so this is a number and this is a set. So, capital M alpha A sigma consists of all those invertible symmetric elements that actually attain this particular value. So, those we call elements of maximum signature. And then some standard notation, just to simplify the statements, H epsilon A sigma will be the category of epsilon H. A sigma will be the category of epsilon emission spaces over A sigma. So I'm assuming that the forms are non-singular. But in fact, for many of the results, they can be drawn. And they will also be true for singular forms. But again, for the talk today, it's not important. And then also, if you look at the center of the Azamaya algebra and you restrict the involution to the center, and you take a Hermitian module or a Hernitian space over that center. Or a remission space over that center. So M here is going to be finitely generated projective module over the center. If you compute H at two times the same entry, then you're going to actually end up in the fixed ring R below. So if you end up in alpha, every time you do this computation, then you say that the form is positive semi-definite at that ordering. So that's the kind of At that ordering. So that's kind of a standard definition. Okay, so these things will show up in the SQL. So the first thing that we need is Sylvester's law of inertia. So here I'm going to assume that R is semi-local and connected. I'm going to take an ordering which is not nil. And as a consequence, you get that the center of the Azamaya algebra is going to be connected. That's interesting for two facts. Interesting for two facts, for two reasons. First of all, if the center is not connected, the bit group actually becomes trivial and there's no work to be done, everything is finished. But secondly, you can then compute the rank of the Alzheimer's algebra over its center, and we need that number. So that number is called t. And I take a Hermitian form. And so the statement is the following. So for every element of maximal signature C, you can find elements. You can find elements W1 up to WT, U1 up to UR, V1 up to Vs, in alpha intersection the units of R. So these are actually really positive elements because they can't live in the support because they're units. So that's good, they're not ambiguous in a certain sense. And then even though H is not necessarily diagonal at all, if you tensor on this chronotic form, you will end up. You will end up, so this is a positive definite chronic form. Am I saying that right? If you tensor this on, you're actually going to get a diagonal emission form. And the entries are very special, namely the first R entries are going to be positive, and the second, all the remaining entries are going to be negative. And these numbers are unique. So the number of positive entries in this diagonalization is unique, and the number of negative. In this diagonalization, it is unique, and the number of negative entities is also unique. So, this is an admission version of Sylvester's law of inertia for emission forms. Of course, this is not there in the traditional version, but this is actually good enough and it works. So, I think it's a unique independent choices. Yes, yeah, yeah. And so, this is this is an important This is an important engine somehow to get everything working. And the proof, so now we come to the first good paper by Nicolas Garel. In 2022, he described a mixed with ring of simple simple algebra in a rule. So that is like a with group on steroids. It's an actual ring that has very nice properties. And to construct this mixed with ring, he uses one of the Is one of the ingredients is a certain pairing. I've distilled that. And I'm calling that the involution trace pairing. And if I need a short word, I'll just call it the Ganel pairing. And I'm going to explain how that works. And so now we needed ideas from this paper, but for Alzheimer algebra with evolution. So what we needed, we reproved actually for Alzheimer's algebra with evolution. We don't need all the We don't need all the everything that you did. So we just picked what we needed. And interestingly, David Lewis in 1980 had a similar idea, but only for quaternion algebras. And he used the norm form rather than the embouched space form. But of course, they will be the same for Quaternion algebra. It's only when you go to higher-dimensional algebra that this is no longer the case. So yeah, that's interesting, actually. So I'm just putting this out as a historical fact. Fact. So, I want to actually explain how to construct this involution trace pairing. And I'm going to assume now that the involution is of the first kind. So, the center and the fixed string are the same. And I'm also going to take epsilon equal to 1. That's just to make the notation easy. Otherwise, I have to throw in lots of opposites and conjugates, and it really looks horrible. So, we're going to need that. So, with the assumptions, we're going to have a reduced trace from the algorithm. Going to have a reduced trace from the Alzheimer Algebra 2 ring. With the reduced trace, we can construct the involution trace form, the index sigma of xy, which is the reduced trace of sigma x times y. And that's going to be, in this case, a quadratic form over R, and in a more general case, a Hermitian form over the center of the Alzheimer's algebra. Then we have, then we need a tensor product, but we need to be a bit careful here. We have a tensor product of two. Carefully, we have a tensor product of two Hermitian spaces, and we end up with a Hermitian space over the tensor product of the algebra and the involution with itself. So that's a standard computation. And we also need the product of sesquilinear forms that you can find in KNUS. That's a kind of a convolution product. I don't know how to describe it in a better way. Describe it in a better way. It looks weird, but it works. And I'm going to denote it by a big black dot. So phi and psi varsis collinear forms. Although I'm just going to use it for emission forms, by the way. But this generality helps me a little bit. So it's defined in this funny way by applying psi to the leftmost entries and then somehow nesting that in sides. And you need a bunch of compatibility conditions between phi and psi need to be satisfied before you can actually make this construction. Structure. So, right, and then let's see. Oh, yeah, and then you also need a twisted sandwich action. So, you want to, you want to, well, you need two things somehow. First of all, this tensor product is going to be a right module over A tensor R A. And we actually want to make A into a left module over A tensor R A, and we do that using the twisted sandwich action. Okay, so A tensor B acting on X is given by A. Acting on X is given by A times X times sigma B. So these are all the ingredients, and then we put them all together. So to define the pairing, the underlying module, which is going to be an R module, I denote this by star. So N1 star M2 is going to be the tensor product over A tensor R A of M1 tensor R M2 and A. That's the underlying module. And then the form that's defined on this module. And the form that's defined on this module, I denote this by a H1 star H2, is going to be big dot of the involution phase form and the tensor product of H1 and H2. And that will give you a quadratic form when you do that. So you have two emission forms, you do this construction, you get a quadratic form. Right? You can correct me if I'm wrong. Okay, and so if you do this in full generality, so remove the restrictions on C. Reality, so remove the restrictions on sigma and epsilon, you actually end up with a pairing that takes an epsilon one emission form and an epsilon two emission form over the Azomayer algebra within Blucher. And it gives you back an epsilon one, epsilon two emission form over the center of the Azomayer algebra. Okay? And so that's really, really a very clever construction. So, what properties do we actually need from this pairing? So, the first one I call the pivot property. And here we actually use three Hermitian forms, H1, H2, H3, and they're defined on H epsilon 1, H epsilon 2, H epsilon 3 of A sigma. And pivot happens around the mid. Around the middle form. So we take the pairing of H1 and H2 and we tensor that with H3. Well, you can actually swap H1 and H3. You can flip this thing around, you can pivot it around the middle entry, which is H2, and you're going to get an isometry. And so for simple algebra with evolution of the first kind, that follows some computations in the paper of Nicola. Forza Maya algebras, there is quite a bit of work involved to establish that. But it may also follow from your very general machinery, but unfortunately we don't understand it. So we have a kind of more combinatorial proof, and that uses a bit more ring theory as well. But presumably you can just do your magic and just say it's like this. But anyway, that's that's that. And then the second property which is useful for what we're doing here. Is useful for what we're doing here, is what I call the PSD problem. Essentially, this pairing allows you to, it's a little machine, you can crank the handle and you get positive seven definite false. And you do that by, so you want to take a non-nil ordering and you take two elements of maximal signature, you take their one-dimensional Hermitian forms, compute their pairing, and then up to sine. So if this thing happens. Sin, so if this thing happens to be negative, you multiply by minus one. But in the end, you're going to end up with a non-singular and positive semi-definite format alpha. So these two properties are crucial in the proof. And the rest is just several pages of Oracle computations. But this is the engine that makes everything work. And so once you've done that, so that that unsettles Sylvester's law of inertia, then you're then you reduce to proving what I call proposition one and proposition two. Like all proposition one and proposition two. And so, proposition one, and you can already see the outline here of the Fistos Local Global Principle statement. So, here we have that R is a semi-local connected ring. We let T0 be the rank of A over R. We take a non-singular Hermitian form over A sigma. And we assume that for every natural number N, this number of copies of H is. This number of copies of H is not hyperbolic. So it's 2 to the power n T0 squared. So we need to bring in this T0 squared, this T0 squared there. So it is, in a certain sense, strongly not hyperbolic, but strongly needs to be modified a little bit by having 2 power and then this T0 squared. So if that's the case, there will be a maximal ordering alpha such that the signature of H added ordering will be non-zero. And the proof is actually inspired by Marshall's proof of this global global principle in the context of abstract literature. So this is a fun thing because my old proof with Dave Lewis of the central simple case uses the other proof, which is in Sharlau's book, which is more field theoretic. But that doesn't work in this case because we don't have fields. But this abstract thing somehow does work with some modifications. So the idea is. So, the idea is that you take a set curly S of elements in the littering of R, and it's going to be maximal and satisfying all these properties. It's going to be closed under product. It's going to contain all the sums of squares, essentially. So, the form 11111 to the n times. And also, the forms in there will not kill damage form H, but you actually need to make them a little bit. But you actually need to make them a little bit bigger. You need to load them up until you've got t0 squared copies of the form. And in fact, this set is going to be non-empty because, for example, all these forms look copies of one, they're going to be an S. So that really makes sense. So you've got the set S. And then you take, essentially these are all the similarity factors, all the units that happen to be similarity factors. Similarity factors of the forms in S, and you call that set alpha zero. Then you can show, and you can show, which is in green, that's a page of computation, but it's actually highly non-trivial. But you can show that in fact this alpha zero is the intersection of some maximal ordering with the units. And then you look at these elements. I think essentially this is the intersection of all the elements. Essentially, this is the intersection of all the annihilator forms in the width group of this form here, T0 squared cross P for all the P in S, if I have that correctly. So we look at all the forms of psi such that these guys become trivial in the with group. Then by property C here, C here are the form H that we have chosen is not going to be in this set. And then finally, you can show, that's another page of computations, that the kernel of the signature map is actually included in this set. And that proof then uses Sylvester's theorem, and that then establishes the statement. So this is the outline of how that proof works. But there is a lot of very, very complex. But there is a lot of this very, very compact fact. And then finally, I think I'm just in timeline still. And then finally, the final proposition, if let R be single or connected, then the torsion W sigma is two primary. And that makes use of another recent paper by Fluke, Fierce, and Barumano from 2022. And there's a nice statement in there that says that there is a connected finite et al-algebra R1 of. et al r algebra r1 of odd rank and another my algebra with evolution a1 sigma1 over r1 such that a tens of r r1 and a1 are raw equivalent over this thing here s1 and also such that the evolution sigma and sigma 1 are both unitary at the same time or both not unitary at the same time. I only need two more minutes. So, with that, you can do a first reduction because there is another result in this paper that says Result in this paper that says that you have an injective map of fluid groups. You can go from WA sigma to W of this new Alzheimer's algebraic convolution. And once you're there, you can do another reduction because now you can use Hermitian-Morita theory, because the width group of this guy is actually isomorphic to W of A one sigma one or W minus one of A one sigma one, so either Hermitian forms over A one sigma one or skewer Hermitian forms over A one sigma one. Or skew an emission forms of the A1s. And at that stage, you actually reduced to a case analysis that again makes use of the theorem in paper by Fierce and Parimala. So either you have skew-symmetric bilinear forms over R, they're all hyperbolic, so they're equal to zero, so we're done. Or you have quadratic forms over R, but then we're done by Mahes' theorem. Or we have Hermitian forms over Hermitian. Hemition forms over S1 with respect to sigma1, but then by resulting in other capacitives, that will inject into W of R1 bit, which we've done before, so that's also done. And then the remaining cases, which are not listing, they can all be reduced to proposition one. So that's the outline of that proof. I'm not sure how useful it is to see that, but anyway, thank you very much. Are there requests? So, what is an example of something where you needed this principle, and you said that it was some tool that you wanted to use? Oh, yeah, yeah, but we could. So, we're trying to hook up with the Trying to hook up with the current generation of real algebra people. And they are interested in, they're not interested in general fields, they're interested in real numbers and complex numbers. And they're looking at free algebras and horribly complicated, infinite-dimensional things. But Azamaya algebras and evolutions show up naturally there when they do quotient constructions and so on. So we wanted to try to understand Azermaya algebra in that context. I was a Mahayalgebas in that context, and then this seemed to be one of the tools that we would need to ultimately do what these guys do. They like to prove positive. And this is related to that very strongly. So this is a test case on whether we can do that. And now we can. I mean, we can now use this as a tool to start proving positive stellarities. So it's a work in progress. Just in the beginning, you mentioned that many. Just in the beginning, you mentioned the maximal orderings. So these correspond to maximal primes or to minimal primes? That's a good question. So if you have a maximal ideal, you're going to get a maximal ordering, but only in that direction. That's not an equivalence. So you can come up with orderings that do not come from maximal ideals. I have an actually have a counter example, if you want. So if you take the polynomials over the real numbers in one variable t, you take this. Variable t, you take the set that contains zero and all the polynomials with strictly positive coefficients, that's going to give you a maximal ordering. And the support is going to be zero. So not a maximal ideal. And let's thank Thomas again. Again. And we resume in five seconds.
