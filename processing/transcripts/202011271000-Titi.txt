I wasn't sure, I haven't been doing much work in Nanitonian fluid for a while, so I had to dig some of the old stuff, which is probably I never spoke about it before. But statistical properties of Navier-Stokes void model. So let's go ahead. This is the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. Probably you have seen a lot of it. So either subject to periodic boundary condition or to Yirichle boundary condition. Yirichle boundary condition. And now, I would like to talk about the concept of averages. One possible meaning of this notion that we see in physics literature is expectation value of a function, of nice function, with respect to some kind of measure, some measured space, for a set of smooth functions which are defined on solution on the Adier-Stokes equation. We consider either invariant measures or supported in the global actor, or one can consider measures. Global actor, or one can consider measures supported on the navigation stock solution path, like for a particular trajectory, and therefore you take a long time average or under some random perturbation. Or one can also consider stationary statistical solution measures notion which has been introduced by players. So I will talk about all these kind of issues concerning what do we mean by average, which we see all the time in turbulence theory. So the spaces of functions in the case of functions in the case of say Dirichlet boundary condition these are the test functions the incompressible function was C infinity the closure I will call it H and in the in the L2 and the closure in H1 I will call it V and the projection on the divergence of free functions from L2 into H I will it's called the LeRay Helmholtz projection so it will be noted by PL the Navier stocks that I mentioned it's there's the stocks operating It's the stocks operator, which is defined to be minus the Lorep Helmholtz projection composed with the Laplacian, and the non-linearity because there is somebody maybe needs to mute himself, it makes too much noise. There is also the non-ER term, the Leiler-Homhost projection is killing the pressure, and the non-NRT becoming like that, and therefore one can think about it as an event. And therefore, one can think about it as an evolutionary equation in the space H d u dt equals to f, where f is the forcing minus the stokes operator minus the non-linearity. This is the equation of motion. So now I'm going to talk about Reynolds equation. So what Reynolds did, he took a long-term average of the equation. And then when you take formally the long-term average and assume and the solution are bounded, so the time derivative disappears, and therefore, Reynolds ends up. And therefore, Reynolds ends up with the following equation for the average quantity, like say infinite time average, assume it exists, which is the stocks operator on the average, bilinear on the average, Navier stocks, so the forcing average, if you are time-dependent, so let's say average. But now, this is a nice equation. This looks like steady-state Navier stocks. However, because of the linearity, and we know that the average. Of the linearity, and we know that the average of product is not product of the averages, there is some kind of leftover, and that's what we teach our students. There is this term, which is basically the fluctuation interaction with the fluctuation average, the dip of that. And this term is called the Reynolds stress tensor. And U prime is the fluctuation, is U minus the average. So, in other words, the equation of the average is not closed. I don't have the equation for the closed. So, in order to basically find the equation. The equation of motion for you, I need to know something about the average of the fluctuation interaction, which is a second-order moment, in order to understand the average. And if you try to see the second order moment evolution, you will end up needing third order. And therefore, there's a hierarchy, and this never stops. And this is called the closure problem in turbulence: that we cannot have a closed system equation. Nonetheless, this is the equation that people are. The equation that people are interested in, all turbulence model is basically about how to model this term, the Reynolds average stresses, in terms of U-bar. And this is based on empirical data or some kind of indicated guess and so on and so forth. So all what people in turbulence modeling doing is really trying to replace this in terms of the average of U to get a close model to get what's happening to this turbulence in the average. So turbulence theory is about statistics and all the one. About statistics and all the models about what's going to happen to average quantities. It's not about individual solutions. Okay, so now what's the Navier-Stokes void model? So, you know, using the Kelvin void, doing some expansions because of all kind of like visceral elasticity effect and doing some expansions with delays. And formally, one gets the following equation, which is like the Maddie LSTOX equation, but you have this. You have this extra term which is alpha squared Laplacian by the time derivative of this term. This is coming from the stress tensors. If you do some kind of like this is some Kelvin-Boyd kind of like approximation model. Some people in viscoelasticity claim this has nothing to do with viscoelasticity to the point that they basically don't even consider it as part of viscoelasticity community. I am not going to put the hat of visco elasticity except that this Of visco elasticity, except that this is supposed to be a non-ternal fluid workshop, that's why I'm talking about it in that context. But I would like to consider it in a different way. What do I mean? So, this is the equation of motion, and I put here alpha to strike that this alpha term here, in addition to the Navier-Stokes. So, this is Navier-Stokes equation plus this particular term. Now, let me stress something very important. First of all, I mean, I will. First of all, I mean, I will mention something. This equation or this model has a global regularity even in three dimensions. So this is not adding hyper-viscosity for the Navier-Stokes. This is just adding this time derivative of the Laplacian. In some sense, this is changing the energy in the Navier-Stokes equation. And you multiply by U and integrate. Instead of being the L2 norm, it will become the L2 norm plus the alpha squared, the gradient norm. In other words, what is concerned? In other words, what is conserved or whatever is dissipated by the viscosity is the H1 norm. And we know the H1 norm is the quantity that we need to control in aviostokes to get global existence. So therefore, this term does not really add a dissipation or regularize the solutions. It basically changes the structure of the equation that now you have a different conservation law or conserved equities. Low or conservative quantities. And therefore, when alpha formally equals to zero, I get Navier stokes. And I would like to think about this as a numerical regularization of Navier stocks when alpha is very small, different than the hyperviscous regularization that people like to put, because hyper-viscous regularization kills the energy very quickly, especially at larger scales. And there is an additional problem in numerical analysis. Additional problem and numerical analysis point of view. In nanular stocks, usually I give you the boundary condition, say u equals to zero at the boundary. If you add hyperviscosity like Laplacian square, then I need additional boundary condition, which means I will need to artificially introduce a new boundary condition there, which means I will affect the boundary layers. And we know that in turbulence, most turbulent flows are driven by boundaries. Laws are driven by boundaries. So, doing something with the boundary condition is a little bit ad hoc and needs interpretation or needs explanation. Now, this term here, which is the time derivative of the Laplacian, it means because I have Laplacian of the term derivative, I need boundary condition on the time derivative. But I don't need to create boundary condition for the time derivative because if u is given at the boundary to be zero, the u sub t at u sub t at the boundary equal to zero. So I don't need to do anything ad hoc to satisfy the boundary condition for this ad hoc or basically a numerical regularization. So this is the model that I would like to think about it as an approximation for the Navier-Stokes equation. So this model we invented it when coming from the alpha models of turbulence but later From the alpha models of turbulence, but later when we dig in the literature, we realized that it was part of the thesis of Skolkov, was used of Ladyzhensky in 1973. We managed to prove all these issues about finite dimensional attractor, and we have to prove a group of a global well-positeness even without viscosity. So, what's interesting about this model here is that even without viscosity, like the Euler, when you regularize the Euler, you have a global exact. The Euler, you have a global existence, but we have to be careful because Euler, the boundary condition, is not about you, it's about only the normal components. So, in periodic boundary condition, this is good regularization for Euler. So, there, even in the Euler case, we can show global existence of this model. I don't have much time to talk about that. What's interesting here is that if I look at this operator identity minus alpha square Laplacian, I and I invert it, multiply, I get Laplacian with inverse of Laplacian. So the viscosity is now no longer viscosity, it's a damping term. In other words, this equation is no longer parabolic, even if you forget about the linearity, this equation is no longer parabolic. It is like an evolution equation, like an ODE. And hence, I don't expect smoothness. Don't expect smoothness property of the solution as in Navier-Stokes as in parabolic equation. So, nonetheless, we have in some sense sort of like damping term due to the viscosity interacting with this regularization. And because you don't have smoothing, if I start with initial data in H1, I remain indefinitely in H1. There is no smoothing effect. But because of the damping, we can show that if the force We can show that if the force is analytic orange of ray class, then the solutions on the attractor are in gevlay class. In other words, the roughness in the initial data will eventually be damped by the damping term and disappears completely when time goes to infinity. And hence the attractors or the element of the attractors are very nice. Why this is important? Because in turbulence theory, when you write the energy spectrum of the solution, there is a scale. There is a scale called the Kolmogorov scale. Below that scale, we know that the energy is exponentially small, which means that the Fourier modes must be exponentially decaying after certain length scale, which is intimately related to the issue of analyticity of the solution, namely, as I mentioned here, some regularity. So, try to connect all these with the theory of turbulence. So, what's also observed about So, what's also observed about this equation, which is puzzling, if I take the Reynolds stresses, sorry, the Reynolds averaging, namely take the infinite time average, the time derivative disappears and I remain with averages of the Navier-Stokes-like term because I have here only time derivative. Hence, the Reynolds equation for this model is exactly the Reynolds equation of the Navier stocks. This is what basically forced us. Basically, forced us to look into the statistical properties of what's happening with this equation, namely that the long-term average of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes and the infinite time average of the Navier-Stokes void model obey the same equation. So, the dynamics maybe is different, but when you go into the long-term statistics, you get the same equation. Of course, You get the same equation. Of course, nobody said that the solution of this equation is unique, but what people observe in averages observes some unique structure. And now the question is: can we say, aha, even though the dynamics is different and the Navier-Stokes void has a global existence, but the long-time behavior or long-time averages or Reynolds equations are the same, can we say something about the statistics of the Navier-Stokes void is an approximation for the statistics of Navier-Stokes? Statistics of Navier-Stokes. That's basically where we raise this question and trying to understand what is going in this way. Now, as I said, the Navier-Stokes equation, if you write it in Fourier modes, and for Fourier mode, the wave number K, this is the equation of motion, and this is the non-linearity. We wrote it like explicitly here. This is the viscosity, this is the pressure, and this is the forcing, and this is the incompressibility condition. So, this is writing it as. Condition. So, this is writing it as an infinite system of ordinary differential equations. Now, inspired by that, a mathematical physicist wrote a simple model instead of having this infinite sum in the convolution, like um and ul summation over all the m and all the l's equals to k. They basically truncated and took that m and l around the Around the wave number k. So they took m up to k minus 1 or k plus 1, and the same with L. So they killed, instead of like infinite convolution, they make it basically like very localized in the Fourier space interaction and wrote a model which is called the shell model as a phenomenological model. And they said it is maybe easier to investigate it numerically and see what happens in this particular. happens in this particular thing. So this is a particular model that I would like to mention here or to talk about. Okay. And this model is called the Sabrashell model, which has similar structure as the Navier stops. And here's the nonlinearity. You see that basically Kn only N plus 1n is now the index. This is also part of the linearity. Kn is like the derivative, one derivative. K square is like the Laplacian. is like the laplacian and this is the linearity and they inserted some parameter here in this equation and now what happens is the following if you look into this model which is phenomenological they realize that it has two quantities which are conserved the first one is the sum of the fourier the equivalent of fourier square which is like the energy and they discover that there is another quantity quadratic quantity which is quantity which is summation 1 minus epsilon minus 1 to the power n u n. So notice that epsilon is a number which is which is a parameter that they have. And now you have two options, either epsilon bigger than one. And therefore you have something which is algebraically with weight in power of n multiplied by the Fourier square, but it is positive. And this is like the anstrophy in 2D. Enstrophy in 2D Navier, Stokes, and Euler, namely the L to norm of the vorticity, which is invariant. And if epsilon is less than one, this is not definite inside. In fact, it's alternating. And there is another quantity in Euler and Navistov, which is formally conserved, which is called the helicity. And therefore, what's nice about this model is in one parameter, you can move by changing the epsilon from... By changing the epsilon from 2D to 3D structurally, not really as far as dimensional, and so we'll have estimates and so on and so forth. Now, why I'm mentioning that? Because I would like to test some of our numerics onto this model. So, what people did, the spectrum of the shell model, they realized that it's behaving like almost k to the minus one-third, which is similar to the one expected in turbulence for Navier-Stokes, which gives people a Navier stokes, which gives people assurance from the argumentation that at least this model in the three-dimensional regime, namely when epsilon bigger than one, it has some of the nicest structure functions like the NIV stocks. And therefore, can we really push and conclude more issues about this equation? Now, even we can see some intermittency, but intermittency is basically the ratio of the mean rate of dissipation of energy fluctuation divided by the mean rate of dissipation of energy. So, this is like what. Of energy, so this is like what causes this kind of like bursts in the flow that you see in the Lagrangian. That once in a file, you see, like, kind of like eruption and eruption. These are basically the spikes, which is the intermittency. They see it also in the shell model, and it is large, like order, this is epsilon prime over epsilon, up to 200, you know, in time. Now, we studied this Sabra model together with Peter Constantine and my former student, Boris Levant, and we proved. Boris Levant and we proved all kinds of like nice properties: the global existence, uniqueness, finite attractor, even inertial manifold. And even in the inviscid case, we can show a global existence of weak solutions in 3D, but we cannot prove uniqueness. And of course, now one can probably try to see if one can use the convex integration machinery, introduce it to this phenomenological model. I am not very certain, but nonetheless, there is none uniqueness. But nonetheless, there is none uniqueness. And the reason we wanted to study the MVIS case because we wanted to prove the dissipation anomaly conjecture, but that's a different story. So now, inspired by the Navier-Stokes void, one can go to the Sabra model and introduce something similar. And indeed, this is the similar thing. On the time derivative, I put alpha square Laplacian. So it's alpha square kn square. And now this is the analog of Navier-Stokes-Boyd Sabra-Shell mode. Cyber shell model. Why I want to introduce that, not to investigate it analytically because I investigated the original one, but I would like to do numerical simulation and to see what kind of features I see and do they persist for Navier-Stokes or not. So to go a little bit quicker, this is some of the simulation for alpha 10 to the minus 6 and this positive 10 to the minus 9. You see like the energy spectrum, but we start realizing that alpha, which is 10 to the minus That alpha, which is 10 to the minus 9, which is relatively not small enough and by small enough in comparison to the Kolmogorov length scale, we start seeing that the inertial range here has some flat part. In some sense, that what inhibits the cascade of energy to smaller scale, and then boom, after what you have the viscosity. If now we take alpha smaller, like between minus, so here's like different values, you see that. Values, you see that the smallest value is almost like Navier stocks. This flat part here starts basically steepening and steepening to become like the Navier stocks. In particular, when alpha is a small, smaller than Tomogorov, then we see exactly the same energy spectrum like the Navier-Stokes equation. So, this is an indication that maybe the statistics of Navier-Stokes void is mimicking the statistics of Navier-Stokes when alpha is very small, because my time is. Very small because my time is almost over. So, we can show also that this model suppresses intermittency. This is what we had in the Navier Stokes. You see, you get up to 200 in this intermittency. These eruptions are very strong. But then with alpha 10 to the minus 7 maximum, you get here into about less than 120 in the intermittency for the seven initial data. And if you take even alpha larger, you even almost suppress it completely, less than 100. So, in some sense, this is a regular. So, in some sense, this is regularizing the eruption of small scales, which is exactly consistent with the fact that you have a global existence. So, now what happens when the limit alpha goes to zero? Do the statistics converge? As I said, we have indication in the numerics. We have theorems. I will go into the theorems about invariant measures for Mergio-Stokes and for the Voigt model without getting into details. So, that's not really important. Uh, that's not really important, but I would like just to mention a theorem that we have. Is the theorem that we have together with the with Fabio Ramos was by postdoc, it's an old result, giving a sequence of invariant measures for the three-denier stops void, which we can establish they exist. Then there exists a sub-sequence, alpha n goes to zero, which is denoted by mu alpha n, such that it has a limit, which is a Borel measure in H1, and this Borel. measure in H1 and this Borel measure because you have convergence weakly in that sense and this Borel measure is a strong statistically stationary solutions of the 3D Navier Stokes equation. Namely it's an invariant measures for the Navier Stokes with statistical stationary solution. So therefore averages with respect to these measures of quantities phi of U of some moments etc etc is good approximation for averages for Navier stocks which is For averages for Navier stocks, which is exactly the theorem that we would like to talk about. And in particular, we have something about the energy. I don't have much time to talk about it. So I will stop here and thank you very much. Thank you, Adris. Thank you for the nice talk. Is there any question or comment? Please unmute yourself. Maybe I will just ask. Yeah, please go ahead. Yeah, Adris, there are also like models which are called second grade. Is this similar? Is it some different? No, no, it is the. I see, I know what you're saying. You see, as I said, at the very beginning, I start working with the Camaso Holm or Mavius Stox Alpha, and we start changing the models motivated by. Models motivated by comparison with experimental flows because we look to the steady state of those models and compare to the steady state, and we realize then we derived what we called Le Ray alpha. By the way, there is a model called Le Ray Alpha, and everybody when they cite it, they cite the paper of Le Ray. Le Ray has nothing to do with Le Ray Alpha. So we regularize the equation in a specific way, and then we realize that this is. Way and then we realize that this is one of the kernels that Le Ray would have used, but this has nothing to do with it, it has extra properties and so forth. So, what happens is that slowly we reached into this model and say, voila, we got a nice model which is regularizing the equations. It's different than the model which is the second grade fluid, because the nonlinearity here is smoother. The nonlinearity here is smoother. It's u dot nabla u. It's not u dot nabla v, where v is exactly u minus laplacian u. So it is more regular than that model. Okay, it's more regular than that model. And this model without viscosity has a global existence. The other one does not have this property. And yeah, so it is different in that sense. And yeah. sense and yeah but but so so so the difference is the non-linearity here is u dot nabla u in their models the line is u dot nabla v and we realize that i don't need this nabla v extra and which is allows you even in the invisit case to
