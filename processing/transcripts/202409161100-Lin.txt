This work is a joint work with my student Wang Se. Okay, let us begin with a very famous equality that called the Hada Little Sobless equality. It has this form that means the double integral with the load H will be controlled by L P for F and L T law for G. And LT law for G. And this P should satisfy this equality. Okay. This equality is very, I think it's universal and you can find many proof for this equality and also have many important application in many fields. But here we emphasize that we want to find the max the sharp constant for this harder nitro sober equality. The sharp constant of The sharp constant means that we want to find the smallest constant that transfers this equality into the equality. So by the holder equality, we can find that the sharp constant we dilute by CHS is just equal to this supreme problem, like this one. If we find the maximizer F for this variational problem, then by the following relationship. Then, by the following relationship, we can find the G. So, we can find the maximizer Fg for this high diagnosis of lift quality. Okay, so we only consider the maximizer for this problem. But how do we find the maximizer for this problem? The usual way we can see that we can find the maximizer sequence. So, by this scanning, we can find that make sure that the LP law for the sequence is just equal to one. Frequency just equal to one. But this is not enough because this is just we only have a weak convergence. So we can use a technique called the arrangement that we can choose the sequence also symmetric and the decreasing. So we can make the weak convergence into the strong convergence. Into the strong convergence. So we can have a limit for this problem. So we can find the max measure for this equality. Okay. But we also have another form of this hard diagnosis over the F quality, like this form. Here we are sure that also belongs to L1 space, L1 space. And we can find that the double integral. integral H will control by this product. Okay, so this we call this H S M is well defined. Here, M we should choose to belong to two numbers. This number M sub sub star is defined by this one and M star equal to two minus two is D divided by D. Here we also choose a lambda equal to D minus two. We call To D max 2, we call this curl by Newton curl. Okay, by the hardened solid quality, we should choose sigma, like equal to this number. So we have met this variational problem. We also want to choose a max measure for this problem. There is a result for it. That means we can find the max measure. V, we denote by v, and also is a radial, and also is a line increasing. And also, it is a line increasing by the same method as I introduced improve of the hard editor. So, but we can also the maximum V satisfy this properties, but also the L L one node and L node is just equal to one. And that attains the very additional problem, say HSM. Okay, you can see this paper for M equal to M star, and say this paper for M belongs to. Say this paper for M belongs to M, these two numbers. Okay, we later I want to use this Hardinita sobility quality to our model. We call it a Kemer Texan model, but it's also called the Kennel Single model because it's proposed by Kenner-Single in 1970s. It models the cells, we denote the density by U move towards the chemical single, we denote the concentration by wave. We denote the concentration by V. Okay, so this is a Kenner single model. We also consider the longliner problem, so we assume that M larger than one. And since the V is just the inequality equation, so they have a fundamental solution. So we gave the convolution of W and U. So W we also call it Newton curl. Okay, so this is a parabolic inhibitor cannot single model. In this cadle, there are two forces. The first forces is a diffusion forces, it comes from this term. And the second forces we call it aggressive aggressive forces from this term. So later, we can find that the competition of these two forces will determine the behavior of solutions. I introduced a powerful tool in analysis of the system. It's called the Nyapo functional. We denote it by E. They have two terms. The first term is we call it G and just the M node for Zoe. And the second term is I. It comes from the aggressive force. And so we call it aggressive term. You can see that the app functional is always line. the the app functional is always line increasing so it is smaller than always smaller than initial free energy and uh after a um very simple calculation we find that the total mass is conserved so we assume that the l1 space just equal to m okay um now i want to show that the competition of competition of the two terms will determine the behavior of a solution so we make a Solution. So we make a make a scanny. This scanny is a math invariant scanny. Okay, we call it the lambda. So E will become by this two target. And we only notice the power of the lambda. Okay, the first power of the lambda is d minus one, and the second was d minus minus two. So you can see that as a line, as m is greater than. the m is greater than m star that as the lambda increasing we can find that the diffusion term will dominate so the solution will be global so we can um so that the solution always uh exists globally but if uh m is smaller than m star i i see that the power of a d minus two will win so the grease of Will win. So the grease of the turret will win. So I think the solution will be unstable. So I can find the blow-up solution. Okay, but I'm interested in that in the final case, that is m equal to m star. In this case, we can find that the two terms will are in balance. But later, I will show that the behavior of the solution will depend on the total mass of a system. Of a system. Okay, so I introduced the final case that m equals m star. In this case, I will show that the behavior of a solution will depend on the dual tooth mass. Okay, we turn back to the near perfectional. And we also know this is a diffusion term and this grease tar. By the hadinitosobolith equality, we can find that the H can smaller than this product. The CHSM is just a sharp. H S M is just a sharp constant. So, both of the two terms we can find also have the M naught for U. So, you can find that the size of the two terms only depend on the total mass u. Okay, so say MC, like this one, we can find the following, we can have the following sharp result. That means if the total mass is smaller than MC, okay, if it is smaller than MC, that means. Is smaller than Fc, that means the E always positive. The Neap functional E is always positive. So we can see that the diffusion wins, so the solution are global. But if the M larger than MC, we have also seen that the greasy water will win, so the solution is stable, so will blow up. But if M equal to MC, we can find the E equal to zero. And the result are more detailed. The and the results are more dedicated that the solution with the violated second mode will blow up at fairly at infinite time, but for those radio solution, the solution will remain uniformly bounded. Okay, this is the result for the m equal to m star. We also call this phenomena as a critical mass phenomena because the behavioral solution are depend on the total mass. Are depend on the total mass. If M because the hard needle sober f quality also holds for M equal to M belongs to M substar or M and M star. So we can also have the following sharp result. That means if we let V be a maximizer for the same JSON M, if the initial frequency is small enough and the alpha beta defined by this one, we also have the four. This one we also have the following shock result that the product of L1 law for initial L1 and Lm law is small enough, smaller than this number, okay, the solution are also stable. So we can get the global existence. But if it's larger, then we can find the blow F solution. Okay, so this is the sharper mass result for the parabolic. Result for the parabolic iniquity system. But we consider about the fully parabolic system in my talk. There is a difference because the second equation just is a fully parabolic equation. So we can't use the method just inferred above to analysis our fully parabolic system like this. But compared to the fu uh parabolic illegal problem. Parabolic edifica problem, we can also decompose the second parabolic equation by two terms, but these two terms will also solve the indifferent problems. So we compose by two terms, weighter, and we hat, but the weight solve this edifica problem, and the weight hat solved this illicit problems. The hair B is the basal kernel. So, our question. So our question is that compared to the parabolic indicum, what's the sharp critical mass criteria for the fully parabolic kilosical model? This is our girl in my talk. So this is also well used than Yapofactional. We also find the Nyapional for this system. Okay? But this is not. This is not enough. We can establish a connection between the YAP functional for the fully parabolic system and the functional of the parabolic ellipse system, like this one. Okay, we can find the YAP functional has this connection. Here, the FO visitor is a Lyap functional for the following harbor ellipse problem, like this. But there is a difference because here the kernel is. Because here the curl is the basic curler. It's lot the Newton curl in our first parabolic innovative problem. But this doesn't matter because I think the basic curl is much more better than the Newton curl. So the result for our first parabolic EDIP problem also holds for this parabolic EDIP problem. This parabolic ellipse problem. Okay, so we have this connection. We find that it's easy to find that if the FU V is larger than zero, then the Nyap function of a fully parabolic function is also larger than zero. But as I see, if the F is larger than zero, it means that in some sense, the diffusion term will dominate, well dominate. Dominate will dominate. So, the solution will be global. So, we can use this relationship and find the full result. That means we can get the same global exist condition for the fully parabolic. That means if M equal to M star and if the total mass is smaller than M C, the Mc is the same as I introduced above in the arbolic inletic problem. So, the solution, the weak. So the solution, the weak solution for the fully parabolic solution will be global. Okay? Later, I also want to extend this global condition to the case M belongs to M substar and M star. Okay, we found that the same global exist condition compared to the parabolic elite problem. That means if the initial data initial data is smaller enough and the product of the L L1 and the L M node for the initial data, then we can get the global solution. Okay, this is our first global exist result, but later I will want to emphasize that the global existence condition is sharp. Is sharp, we can obtain the following result. That means if the total mass is larger than MC. Okay, for the fully power multiple problem, we can find the block solution, but the solution may be symmetric with negative initial energy with block infinite. Okay, this result was observed by Mr. Kus and Hayes group. Okay, I got the following. Uh, I got the following also sharp blow-up condition. That means if m belongs to these two numbers, we for any dimensions in addition, we also find that if the product of the initial data is larger than enough, then the solution will be global. So, compare the group, sorry, compare the global existence result, we also get the sharp constant. But here, we should notice that. We should notice that or without extend this paper, okay? Because this paper they brought up only held in dimensions three and four, but as I see in third above, if M is smaller than M star, and the force of a deficient term will be weaker. So the blow-up is likely to occur. So I think that. So I think that we can extend the blow-up in dimension 3 and 4 to more general case. So we succeed improving this one. Okay? So we also tell the blow-up condition. In those remaining time, I want to give a short proof for the blow-up condition. Okay, we introduce, sorry, I introduced the signal. I introduced the second moment, M2, like this one. And this function is always used to blow up in the chemotexon model. So it's a UUA. Okay, so after computation, we found that the M2 will satisfy this condition. Okay, there are three terms at the right side. The first term is just Nyap functional, but we know that the Nyap functional is long-increasing. Is length increasing, so it's smaller than the initial free energy. So it's finite. And the signature we find that is just the m for u, but the constant here is always larger because we assume that m is smaller than m star. So this term is larger. The constant is larger. So this term is negative. If we don't care about the third term, we can find that. We can find that if the initial flow energy is small enough, and we can find the zoo turbs are always negative. So, M2, the function M2 will be strictly decreasing. So the M2 should be negative after some final time. But the M2 is always positive. This is possible. So the blow-up will occur in finite time. So this is our idea. But you are fully powerful. But in our fully parabolic system, there is a third term that is L2 for the F. Okay, so but this is it doesn't matter if we can give a uniform bound for the L2 for F. Okay, so our next step will I want to give a uniform bound for the L2 for F if the solution are global, okay. Here, I should emphasize that if we concern about the parabolic initial problem, the subject will vanish because it's an initial problem. So, if it's just equal to zero. So, the broad up condition also comes from this equality. I also emphasize that if m equal to m star, so the third term. Stop. So the third term will also vanish. Okay. So if you want to get the contradiction, that means you want to make sure that the red tar be negative, you should assure that the free energy is negative. This is why we need the establishing negative initial energy in this paper. Okay, so our next goal wants to get the L2. So, we want to get the L2 for S. After we establish the following two equalities, the first equality is easy to obtain, and the second is more complex, but no matter we can also get it. So, by taking these two equalities, we found that if the solution are global, we can also get the benefit of the L2 for L2 law for F. So as Two rows for f so as I see the second the first letter is always falling and the third letter is also falling and the second term is a negative so the M2 will be negative after some negative time and so M2 this is this is impossible because M2 will always positive so blow-up must be occur okay so we give a short proof for the blow-up result So, result. At last, I gave some conclusion. The first one is that we found a critical mass phenomenon in the fair competition region. Okay, the second is that the sharp constant, the sharp critical mass is related to the maximizer for the hard data sober liquidity. And last, I wanted to, we operated that this criteria for the fully parabolic. For the fully parabolic model, it is consistent with the parabolic inequality problem. So, this is our book. Thanks for your time. Thank you.
