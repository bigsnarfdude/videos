Tell us about single fibers and algebraic fabrication for the GS2 and college. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot for the introduction and organizing this. It's a great place and this is my first time in Canada, but it's similar to Minnesota, so I'm here for both years. And thanks everyone who's not going to lunch, but being here, I will not take too much time, so it will be a quick short call. And this is a joint talk with Jeremy Vanderbilt Moyes. Jeremy Vander Morris, he's my postcode member and in his work we work with algebraic vibrations having genus2 fibers. And I will try to summarize what we have done. And let me begin with genus 1 vibrations. So let's start with Codaira. And Codira gave the complete classification of all singular fibers that show up in pencils of elliptic cards. Curves, ellipse curves are just genes one, complex curves, so for us they are a curves. And he showed that in such a puzzle each fiber is either a generic fiber, these are smooth fiber, that's a curves, or a rational curve, a scoop, with a mobile cusp on that, or a certain sum of formal sum of rational curves, or certain cross-sections minus two. So this is this feature. Picture and here you see the code 3 class. This is a sphere with one model point on that. All others are configurations of spheres. Each one is a crossphere. And they have different multiplicities or weights, we say. And each irreducible component has a certain higher section minus two. And in here, some of them are easy to understand and how the operation Easy to understand and how do we obtain them topologically. For instance, 203 cusp is well understood, or nodal type fibers, everything is actually one more. But if you want more monodromes, we say this is my first. And how to obtain the tools we cost? Well, we have these curves, this is A curve, this is B curve. When I pinched them to obtain it usually the two T customers. Usually the two or three task. And to get this one, for instance, you are just inching the A curve, so you get a survey with one double point on it. And actually we have the full list of all these monogrammies, and Herrick, Casa, and Kirby gave the full list of monogrammar characterizations of the color fibrisons. And these were quite useful for us. And in the literature, we have lots of exotic format for construction. Have lots of exotic format of constructions going back to Collera and using the work of Perrier, Tasa, and Curry. So, what we do is, in general, we start with the factorizations of the monogramies of our Lafayette variations in our starting manifold. And this is an algebraic information. And from that, we can see what type of form manifold we are working in. And moreover, from the words of from the words of from the global monogramy of your fibration you are able to see what type of singularities you have. So from this observing information you can test the geometry and you can draw your fibers and you obtain the configurations of curves and then we use such configurations in the smooth or maybe symplectic surgeries to obtain exotic farming bulbs. We have a bunch of papers in the literature In the literature, it uses genus1 vibrations. Our theorem here establishes such a dictionary in the genus2 case. So we work with genus2 singularities and for each of them we give a one-to-one correspondence between the singular fibers and their model factorizations. Alright. And let me now talk about genes to fibrisin. So Manica van Uemo gave So Manikawa and Uemo gave the classification of all similarities in Genes II vibrations and they found that there are in total 120 different types. And their similarities are again configurations of curves which are spheres or maybe tori. In this case we also have genus one components with specific salvage actions and multiple cities. And basically we were wondering how we can understand those fibers from How can we understand those fibers from the topological or synthetic perspective? And let me first give the precise picture of their work. So basically, they work with such a map, pi, from x onto v. And this is a small epsilon disk on C. And we are looking at complex algebraic family of curves of genes 2. And the total space X is a minimal surface, which is non-singular and complex analytic. Complex analytic and we have this pi map which is smooth over the puncture disk. From the origin, for each point downstairs, we have the fiber upstairs. These are just genes to remote surfaces. But over the origin, we have singularities. And so for every T in the function, the fiber is a compact non-singular curve of genes 2, as I just said. And so the restriction to And so the restriction to the punctured disc is a small fiber bundle. And the center of the fiber is a singular complex oscillator. And so when you have such a picture in LGBT geometry, we call them, these are the generating families of LGBT curves. So in the base approach origin, upstairs, you start with your generic fibers, genus 2 surface, and you degenerate them in And you degenerate them into a simulator. And so, this is the name. We say degenerating families of algebra. And naturally, we have another notion defined. It is by Shaw or Raid. I don't remember which one, but atomic singular fibers. So these are defined as the singularities that you cannot split by any perturbation of the degenerating families into fibrations with. This into vibrations with multiple but simpler singular fibers. So when we say atomic, these are the simplest possible pieces. And Shaw and Great, Myers Raid, they asked this question, can you determine all atomic singular fibers in AGEMSG fibris? And then in the JUMS II case, it was studied by many people, Shah, Orikawa, Person, and more recently by Orikawa and Tashikaga. Chicago and also from topological perspective some special cases were studied by most motomocinos and also issues like it. And here I just wanted to mention my another work related to mammicaueno fibers. On my thesis with my advisor Ahmedov, we also work with such the list of mammicaboeno and in this file the setup was different. We worked with closed form and false and these are Form and poles, and these are total spaces of the algebraic vibrations over the two-sphere. And we have no boundaries in this case, and the closed manifolds are emitting two singular fibers. And these singular fibers are showing up, of course, in the list of non-microcarbo gamma. And then we studied those fibers and we analyzed them from, again, symptomatic perspective. And then by using them also with synthetic surgeries, And also, with synthetic surgeries, we constructed exotic farming balls. We made exotic CPU to blown up at 677 points by working on them. And then, but the list is very long and it is natural to consider what happens in other singular fibers, how can we understand them, how can we reconstruct them maybe, and how can we find modern factorizations of each of them. Alright, and let me start. And let me start talking about our work. So, one more terminology, more simplification. So, if you decompose your singularities, let's say we have a more complicated singularity, I call them compound singularities. If you decompose them into their atomic pieces, then this process is called morcification by rate. Or here we want to be even more specific, and rather than just atomic, we want them to be of We want them to be of lab chest type, singularities as this. And we wanna start with some more complicated singularity. This theory is a Musching graph, but previously we have even more complicated one. And then we want to form them into Lebscha-type similarities. And I'm gonna call this process Morse simulation. It is due to ray. And in my work, we first construct in Koenal. We first construct the non-coin of fibers in a different way by using Nemetis algorithm. And then we give the explicit morsifications of each of them. And therefore, we were able to give the native structuralizations of these singular pipes. And we have three different aspects of our work. So, algebraically, we resolve the similarities and we reconstruct the Monikauena fibers. So, in Monikau and So in Manicabonia paper, they have a different construction, they work with or default quotients and they have a different resolution process and they obtain those fibers in a different way. And in our work we are able to obtain them by using another approach and it is the objective part. Holomorphically we have complex deformations. In fact we have flat deformations. It is due to Flat deformations, it is due to lava. And when you do these deformations in the complex world, it gives us, we were able to give the explicit dentist factorizations. And moreover, our deformations are actually deformations of the underlying complex vibrations on the resolution spaces. And here I'm just going fast, but if you are wondering, of course, I can give you more details. Moreover, our deformations give Moreover, our deformations give the compositions of the singularities into their atomic pieces. And why do we need flat deformations? Well, in general, when you start with a manford and then you do deformations, the resulting one may not even be homeomorphic to the starting one. But here we want to do that in a careful way. So you start with some forman fold and you do flood deformations, and the resulting one is diffeomorphic to the starting man fold. Moreover, the vibrations structure. Moreover, the vibration structure processes. So we don't, for instance, we don't mess up with the sections. We still have a nice vibration structure at the end, but we are only changing the central vibration. And to ensure that we don't mess up with the vibration, we did need this spatial deformations in the complex work. And symplectically, we formed the modern factorizations of our lecture vibrations. And so our And so our results give us characterizations of the symplectic vibrations that underlie these algebraic families and moreover also the characterizations of the symplectic structures of the underlying algebraic surfaces. And we access them by the plumbing diagrams that we obtain in the resolution process of RCKS. This is some brief background and then I will give the setup and try to give more details. And try to give more details. So, these are the polynomials in C3, f of x, y, and t, and vf is the zero sets of these polynomials. We have these algebraic varieties. And each of these Vfs has a five-range myalgebridic curves, and they have only one singular fiber. They are again more complicated than a depth of simulative. We call them compact simulatives, and the genetic fibers are. And the genetic fibers are genus to Riemann surfaces with one or two barbaric components. So this is just notation. Two is the number of genus and one is the number of barbicomponents. And we have different types of vibrations, depending on what type of polynomial we have. And in general, these zero sets are singular varieties, and we resolve them, and we call the resolution surface exact. call the resolution surface xf and we show that the vibration lives to these resolution surfaces and the singular fiber leads to its resolution graph and this is the first result that I wanted to discuss so let's say f is one of these following for uh polynomials, for different values of k's, we have four different groups. We have four different groups, and Vf is the zero sets of these polynomials. And we look at their resolutions XF, and we show that these XFs admits an algebraic vibration by hyperaliptic curves. In particular, they admit genus 2 vibrations, and in genus 2, everything is hyperhyptic. And every curve is smooth here, except when t is equal to 0. So, here, when I say vibration, we consider the projectional. We consider the projection onto t component. And when t is zero over the origin, we have the similarity. And for other values of t's, we have the generic fibers. And in this first result, we have constructed these central fibers. And I'm going to show them in a second. We have a bunch of tables, some figures. But we construct these central fibers. And from those, we are able to obtain the monocaulino fibers also, with the correct sub entire step. With the correct intersections and multiplicities of each component. So we have directly started the same polynomials as when we call in the hit, and we obtain them in a different way, but we have one-to-one matching with the pipe or some r pipes. And I just wanted to show you a picture, but it is not possible to go over them. But in the first one, we have P1. P1 is the corresponding to the first one, when k is equal to 1. And k is equal to 1, and then we look at its powers basically for different values of k's. We take the kind of range cover of the resolution graph, and we obtain other fibers. And the first one is V1. Step by step, we show the resolution process, but at the end, you get a 2,5 cusp. And the second one is V mass squared. And we have such a configuration at the end. These are again spheres. These are again spheres. In some of the configurations we have also 4i, but in this case we have just spheres, with these weights or multiplicities and certain cross-sections. And we gave the full list in fact in a table. If you are interested in, you can look up the paper. And we also have others, P3 group, P3 group is. Let me go back. So now I'm talking about the second group, which is P3. We call these groups. We call this group P2 and P4. There's a reason related to making for those groups, but we chose both names. And in the P3 group, the first one is fiber. By the way, the arrowheads are showing us that these are the starting singular curves. And these arrows showing us the proper transforms of the original curves. And other ones with more arrows With more arrows in here, for instance. So these are coming from the exceptional divisors, but this is coming from the original single arrow. So pre-star we know which one is which. Okay. And then V3 family, we did all of them. And then we look at V2 family. This is the third group in my polynomial list. And we have again tables. And P2 and P4, they are constructed. Before their construction is a bit different, there are differences between the first two and last two groups. And again, let me know if you are on it. I'm brushing up here. And then I'm gonna show you our next main theorem. So after doing that, after constructing those central fibers, we simplified our fibration connect F's into Lebscher's divisions and we gave their non-linearness. And here the main ingredient is blowers. Main engraving is Rawford's work, I would say, and also we use GOMS D3 formula. It was quite useful. And this is the second one. So the setup is the same. We have again the resolutions XFs. We know that they admit genes 2 vibrations. By the way, how do we see that they are genus 2? Well, previously we have in the closed case and you can just use a junction formula. When you apply, you see that your 5. You apply, you see that your fibers are optional. Anyways, so we obtain the erson of fibers in the previous result, and then here we do some specific thing, and we show that these vibrations are splitting into red-chest vibrations. And for each of them, we give the specific descriptions of them. So they are described by one of these following positive marks. When I say positive, we mean we are taking the right-handed paint to. We are taking the right hand of the interests in the mapping class group. And here the mapping class group is of the group of the generic finder, which is a Genus2 surface with either one or two binary components. And we have a long list of words. I'm going to show you those words in a second. But again, let me repeat that. So, what we are doing is for fixed k here, we take the polynomial, and in the first result, And in the first result, we define the central fiber of that corresponding to the polynomial. And in here, for that vibration, we slip it into a left-s vibration. And for that, we determine which verb is corresponding to. So for those configurations and these verbs, we have a one-to-one matching. One-to-one correspondence, therefore we call dictionary. We have a dictionary in Jim's 2Ks. Alright? And for each of them, we made computations. Let me Made computations and let me mention what those words are. Well, some of them are showing up on the genus2 service with one boundary component, or the others are showing up on genus2 service with two boundary components. And so here, this first group, P1, P2, P2, Tilda, P4, Tilda, I, these are happening on the one boundary component case. And let me show you the pictures. This is the first picture here. This is the first picture here. So we have the danger around these curves. It goes up to 1, up to 4, 5 and 5 prime. We take the dangerous around those curves. And by using them, we have those words. And these are the first group. And I is just the hypothetical involution. And in the second group, we have q3, q4, and two different words with more complex. Different words with more complicated curves. And they are showing up on the surface with two boundary components. Yeah, two boundary components. And let me show you the picture again. Now we have the second picture with two boundary components. We have the curves from 1 up to 5 and we work with them. And we also have some more complicated curves in that second group with two valuable component case. We have different curves that Different curves that we obtain them and we give the computations for each of them, but these are curves. Again, it's not possible to follow what is going on, but I just wanted to give the full description here, but these are all happening in this group. We also have boundary, these are the boundary twists or multitudists, depending on what kind of fiber you have. And let's see. Here I just gave the description of the mapping cluster. And yeah, I think I gave the full description. And great. And lastly, our monogrammies have these orders from P1 up to P4. They are of order 10, 8, 6, and 5, which is great because these are matching up with our resolution graphs. For instance, if you look at the Graphs. For instance, if you look at the P1 payload, we obtain that P1 to the 10th powers is giving us the generic powers and the 11th power gives us the P1 configuration again. So we have such a modular relation. And they are matching up with our computations here. And orders are also important. And yeah. So by such a dictionary, it's going to be possible to do maybe more examples. It will be possible to do maybe more exotic format called constructions. And with related to singularities, we have other open problems that we are currently working on. But I'm going to stop here. Thank you very much. Any questions for Sumer? Is there any progress on the I'm just doing five follow-ups and I'm trying to improve that further. But we see that. Any questions about the sync questions you mentioned about singularities? Yeah, great question. So there are certain examples in which we have a special resolution graph, let's say, and they are coming from different colonies. So we say algebraic, they are different, but their graphs are the same. But their graphs are the same. And related to taught similarities, we are interested in: you know, can we distinguish them by other means? Or some of the other neighborhoods are the same or different. So there are some interesting things related to thought similarities and again related to the alpha spark. And we are working on some specific examples right now. Can you remind us? Can you remind remind us again your result? What what's the correspondence between those two left genus two vibrations over two sphere and what's at the other side? So in my thesis I work with left-generation over S2, with genus to pyrus. In this web R pyramids are over D2, to this, and we have boundaries in the pyrus, either with one boundary or two boundary components. Did you want to see the theorem here? Let me show you. So, this is one of the natural expiration picture for each of them, and we have rewards. And in the previous one, we constructed those fibers by using algorithm, resolution algorithm. Yeah, actually there are others that have papers. I'm also looking at them. So there's like, that's not how many. There's a specific list actually. Uh for genus for I don't know. I haven't seen much, but yeah. Any other questions? Well let's thank Samaria again then the next talk is in another thirty minutes. I would get a seat.  I just want to do that.  Yeah, I don't know any such instances. I was still thinking about the neighborhood of DIDI and that seems to be. Are you ready for a talk? But I mean, it's probably not objective. But you look on the screen for sure, like, right. I never saw the book like checking up the point if you're talking about actually a mortification process. You have to know the explicit. Yeah. I think it's actually something. Maybe you can also do that. Because second Sierra, we mostly use branch cover techniques. But maybe you know like each component of these five sections. That is important. But if you know the amount of five sections I was trying to draw the picture too that we got This just both in this case the genus is falling.
