To talk to us about Ragnus's conjecture and the cozial dual of the Steinberg module. Well, thank you for letting me speak here. I would have really wished to come in person, but it was not in the stars for me, unfortunately. But I'm happy to talk online as well about Rognes's kind of. Online as well about Rognes' connectivity conjecture and the Kuzul dual of all of the Steinberg modules together considered as a ring. That's why I just wrote Steinberg. But it's not the Steinberg group or anything. Anyway, this includes joint work with Jeremy Miller and Roy Nakpal, as well as joint work with Jeremy Miller and Jennifer Wilson. And R will always denote a PI. Will always denote a PID and F will always denote a field. I will sometimes write something to it and sometimes don't, but keep that in mind. So this is really a talk about two results and how they're connected. And I hope I will get to the connection, but let's start with result number one. Result number one is about Rognis conjecture. Rognis conjecture and algebraic K-theory. So let me just first say quickly Kr will denote the K-theory spectrum of R. And you should just think of this as being a space if you want to. And the homotopy groups are the algebraic Algebraic k groups of this ring R. And Rognes introduced, I believe, a so-called rank filtration. So this will be a sub-spectrum of the K-theory spectrum, and it's going to be a filtration for all n and it will take into account Into account only the rank at most N3 R modules. And for PIDs, this is the same as projective. But even if this is not just the projectives, this will tell us a lot about the K-theory. Anyway. So, having this filtration, we get a spectral sequence. Can you have a little bit give a little bit more details how Fn of K is defined? Because I'm confused how you manage only rank smaller than N, free modules. So, if you will, K of R is defined, you could define the case theory spectrum of R as a are as a the a you sorry a k theory of a category with um um uh co-vibrations and weak equivalences and so for for k of r you use the category of projective finitely generated projective r modules where weak equivalences are split injections and sorry where co-vibrations are weak where covibrations are weak, co-vibrations are split injections and weak equivalence isomorphisms. And in order to get this subspectrum, you take the subcategory of only the rank N3R modules. Yeah, but it's important to say that there are lots of different rank filtrations, and this is the stable rank filtration. Rank filtration. So if you use the sort of iterated S dot construction model of K-theory, that's the thing you want to filter by rank. But yeah, but you could get a different rank filtration by just saying it's the group, it's the, or you know, it's BGL infinity plus and fixing a finite n that should give you, you know, a different rank filtration. That's like one of the. Rank filtration. That's like one of the unstable rank filtrations. And this is a. Yeah, I'm confused. Sorry, I'm confused. If you take two rank three modules. Could I interrupt you? Sorry, can we talk about this maybe later? I don't really want to focus too much on the exact definition of this. I will give you a way of thinking about the quotients of this in different terms that I understand better. But maybe we can talk about this after the talk. About this after the talk, what FN is concretely to connect this to what you know. But for right now, this was defined by Rognes in his 92 paper called rank filtration. Maybe we can talk about this later. So, I want to talk about this, I want to quickly just set the scene of what I really want to talk about. To talk about, and so using this filtration, you do get a spectral sequence that converges to the homology of the k-theory spectrum. And then, using the atom spectra sequence, maybe you can compute And compute the actual K groups. I'm simplifying here because I'm naive, but you can use that to compute some algebraic K groups, maybe, which are the homotopy groups. So, I will want to compare this with the so-called common basis complex and this common basis complex I will denote. Common basis complex, I will denote by DRN. Please notice that if you have read Rognes' work, this is the desuspension of what he calls DRN. But for this talk, I'll define exactly what this is. This is a simplicial complex where the vertices are proper. A proper non-zero summons and they're automatically free because we have a PID free summons of R to the N and a set of such summons is a P simplex. If it has a common basis, and I'll explain what that means: if it has a common basis I B Is a basis of Rn such that each Vi is the span of a subset of the spaces, subset of V. So the V and I's are allowed to intersect it, right? Say that again? Say that again. The V eyes are allowed to intersect, though, so they're not they're absolutely allowed to intersect. So, in particular, you have that the dimension of D is going to be 2n minus 2, because basically you have to the power of n many choices to subsets, but you can't take the empty set, you can't take the full set. The empty set, you can't take the full set. Uh, oh, so actually, 2n minus 3 is the dimension, then. Sorry, okay. So, and Rognes proved in the paper in which he introduced this rank filtration that the quotient Is related exactly to this common basis complex. And so on the right-hand side, I'm going to take the suspension spectrum. So just think about it as the space that's in the middle of the cone of the following map. Um I take a free space on which G L and R acts freely discontinuously and properly discontinuously and take the fiber product over the suspension of DR. suspension of dr n so this acts on the summons by multiplication and i can map this down to instead of taking this space i can take a point and then this is nothing else than the classifying space of glnr and this is G L N R and this is in other words the homotopy quotient of this space mod G L N R. You don't want suspension of BGLNR? I'm confused. You might be right, but. I am not sure. I think this is what I extracted. I think this is what I extracted from his paper. In particular, there might be a shift of some kind. I'm not 100% sure about shifts. In particular, this means that we get that this homology here, this E1 page, is just the relative homology. Just the relative homology between BGLNR and this homotopy quotient. So the main The main conjecture due to Rogness is that DRN is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of two n minus three spheres. So let me unpack some of this and give a few. Some of this and give a few remarks. So, first of all, as I already said, the dimension. There's a question in chat. Also, you missed hypotheses on the ring. So, the ring, yes, the ring should be, sorry, you're absolutely right, should be Euclidean or local. Local. Otherwise, this is unlikely to be true. Local actually doesn't require that's a PID. Yeah, we'll talk about that question later. And so, this simplicial complex, as I already said, I can Complex, as I already said, I can take any kind of subset here. So those are two to the n many subsets, but I can take the empty subset and I can't take the full subset. So that's minus two. And then dimension is even one lower. So this has a really large dimension, but it actually gets down to something that's only 2n minus 3 dimensional. And in fact, Rognes already In fact, Rogner's already proved that you can bring it down to something that is only 2n minus 3 dimensional. So it's left to prove it's enough to show that. That drn is n minus four connected. So, but the main point is why is this conjecture important? Well, the conjecture now implies that the E1 page is zero. The E1 page, as you can see, is this relative homology, but Homology, but if DRN, sorry, I'll let me just add this. If this space is highly connected, then it is very similar to a point. And in that way, this map becomes highly connected. And so the relative homology becomes zero in a range. And I believe that is this range. And I believe that is this range, but please we can double check that at some other time after. But it is what the range definitely does is that it's linear in P and with slope one. So on the spectral sequence, you would expect, at least due to the conjecture, that all of these values would be zero and that would massively Zero and that would massively simplify the computation of the k-theory homology. So let me quickly say some progress on the conjecture is first of all very recently Galatia. Very recently, Galatius Coopers and Randall Williams proved that this map is highly connected and just as highly as the conjecture would imply for certain fields. And semi-local rings, which I will not talk about in this talk. So this map that I'm considering here as well and in this relative homology is 2n minus 3 connected for infinite fields. And our theorem that I want to present in this talk is, or that I am presenting in this talk with Jeremy Miller and Jennifer Wilson, is that we prove that df n is 2n minus 4 connectors for all fields. That's for all fields. Which implies their theorem. Sorry, I may have missed something. You told about semi-local rings in the above conjecture, right? The conjecture says that this is. says that this is this is true for our euclidean which is a subset of pid or local um and they they prove this yeah fields yeah and for uh semi-local uh rings with uh infinite residue fields okay thanks uh but i don't like i want to ignore those uh we can we can show uh We can show for those as well. Any other questions about result number one? So result number two is quite different in style, and it is about the kazulness of Steinberg. And it's and it's dual. So let me first introduce Steinberg. To do that, and Avnar has already in a previous talk, but I'll just quickly repeat. You take the Tietz building, which is also a simplicial complex, and it's in fact a sub- And it's in fact a subcomplex of DRN, so where you take all flags. So flags of again, free is automatic in this case, but you would want to take free summons of R to the N and just sure. Just sure you visualize what a flag is. I'm going to object to the claim that for a Dedican domain, you would want to assume that they're free. I believe for the TITS building itself, you would want to assume that. But maybe you can. Wouldn't you want it to be isomorphic to the building? You feel the fractions, and then when you intersect, you get things that aren't free. Ronnie, we can talk about this later. I think I agree with that. So I think I agree with that statement. Andy agrees with me. Well, you overruled me then. Two against one, democracy. As I said before, I'm only considering PIDs and there's a reason for that. In any ways, this simplicial complex was shown by Solomon and Teets to be a wedge of A wedge of n minus two spheres. And they didn't actually show this for rings. The way they phrased it was for fields. But it's not hard to see that if you take the ring of fractions of R, then these two Tietz buildings are the same or isomorphic. And then the Steinberg module is simply Is simply the free abelian group of these spheres, or another way of writing that is it is the reduced homology of the Tietz building in that dimension with coefficients in Z and so we do get a G L N R action. In our action on this module, because we have that on the Teeth building, and so it functorially gets down to the homology. This module is important in many fields. I just wanted to list this, rep theory, algebraic K-theory, cohomology. Comology of arithmetic groups. Just to name a few things, I'm sure there's more ways that this Steinberg module is very important. And let me tell you how some of these spheres would look like. And they're so-called apartment classes. And an apartment class comes And an apartment class comes from a basis of Rn and I will denote it with such a double bracket. That's going to be my apartment. And it is the full subcomplex of the T. Of the T building on spans of subsets of B. This is not hard to see that this will be the boundary of a subdivided n minus one simplex, and thereby is an Sn minus. Is then Sn minus two. And so this will also give us an apartment class, a class in Hn minus two of the Tietz building, which I said was the Steinboff module. It's a little hard to see the bottom line. Bottom line? It's blocked by the zoom window. Yeah. Either close the zoom window or maybe don't write on the bottom centimeter of the paper. I think we can see enough of it. Apartment is now blocked by your face. Yeah. Okay. So let me just quickly. So let me just quickly draw. We can't see the top. I know, I know. I was going to go down again. The European paper is too tall. That's the problem. I believe that American paper is actually wider than European paper. But it's not as tall. But I'm using it. There's plenty of room on the sides. There's plenty of room on the sides. I would like to continue with my talk, Jeremy. Thank you. Anyway, as an example for n equals 3, for those that like to see an example, you just take all, so I take a basis b1 through b3, let's say b1, b2, b3, and now I could take the span of these vectors, but I. of these vectors but i could also so these are three points but i could also take a point where i take b1 and b3 uh b1 and b2 or b2 and b3 and now because i'm in a teats building inclusion gives me a line so this is included in here and by like this and so as you can see now i get the boundary of You can see now I get the boundary of a subdivided simplex. So Soler and Tit actually says a little bit more, and maybe even more than what I'm stating here, but for a field, I can say that the Steinberg module is generated. Module is generated by apartment classes. And I will use that to define Steinberg as a ring. Namely, I can take the direct sum over all Steinberg modules for a fixed. For a fixed field f. And that's why I'm maybe reluctant to say the Steinberg module as a ring. But this is what I mean. This forms a ring using the following multiplication. I take one Steinberg module, an element in one Steinberg. Module: An element in one Steinberg module. So, here this is generated by apartments. So, I take one of these generators, take one of these generators, and I will get out an apartment of fm plus n by putting these two basices together. In the sense of that, I view this as Fm plus Fn, and then I have this as the basis of the first summon and this as the basis of the second summant. Now, this ring is unfortunately not commutative. So, the problem here is that if I Problem here is that if I switch these two factors, these two apartments here, then suddenly these B's here will not span the first M, the first sub module of size M subspace, but the last one. Last one. And so we have to somehow take into account the inclusion that we use. And this will lead us to the notion of G L rings, which is an equivariant notion of rings. This is similar to This is similar to Sam and Snowden's notion of twisted commutative algebras, just with just for the general linear groups instead of the symmetric groups. So, Peter, I'm a little confused. Isn't it just aren't there just, don't they just introduce signs when you predict the i's and the i primes? They do introduce signs, but the problem, as I said here, is you, as I said, this these if I I said, if I include the B1s into here using Fm in the front, it's a different B1 than if I include it into the back. That's really where the non-commutativity comes from. But you are absolutely right that if I was going to also include these into the front, but just switch them around in this bracket, then there would only be a sign. only be assigned but they actually you have to sort of uh say how do you include these vectors into this big one and that's that's suppressed in the notation here sorry does that make sense any i think it makes sense so they're literally different vectors you're sort of giving them as different blockers yeah yeah yeah i think there's some suppressed notation that's blocking but i think i'll pick it up later so yeah Yeah, this was a little bit confusing to me as well. And I try to explicitly say why this is, but I can also very much relate to not immediately seeing that. So now, what am I doing? I'm on the wrong page. I'm sorry. I'll start this page later. So, in order to So, in order to introduce GL rings, let me first introduce GLR modules. And this is nothing else than a sequence of modules. So, where MN is a Z G L N R module. And so, in other words, this is the same as a functor from the category GLR to Abian groups. What do I mean by the category GLR? I mean the category of this joint object where each object has the object has the endomorphisms equal to the group GLNR or equivalently I don't know if this is the right symbol for equivalently but this is what I mean by that symbol the category of finitely generated free R modules and isomorphism And isomorphisms. And so now we get a category of GLR modules, and this is actually a symmetric monoidal category by the following monoidal structure. Structure. Namely, I want to define what is the tensor product of two of these GLR modules. And for that, I will tell you what it is in each n. And the way I want to define it is by saying I take all possible direct sum decompositions of Rn into Of Rn into two, yeah, in this case, free summons because it's a PID, and say M of V tensor, M of W. This is called the day convolution or induction product. Now, a GLR ring is Is simply a monoid object in this category, which means which means a GLR module A with a product A A tensor A to A and this product is associative and has a unit. And one can also, I don't want to go into the details of this, but define modules over this, over such rings, tensor products and TORS. And the torsion over the GLR rings. Now that I said what a GLR ring is, I can tell you why Steinberg is a GLR ring or how, and I just define it as a module, a GLR module. GLR module by taking all the Steinberg modules. So now GLNR acts on this. And because this is actually the same as the Steinberg module of the fraction field, we can define the multiplication as we did earlier here. Earlier here. And this turns out to be giving us the structure of a GLR ring. And now, because this is a symmetric monoidal category, we can define a notion of commutativity. And this is, in fact, skew commutative. So now what Andy said is you get a sign if you commute in a certain way. So I will denote. Notice that I write the ring R in here, even though I define the multiplication using the fraction field. And in each degree, the module is the same, but the module structure is a little bit different because I'm here, I'm only taking into account. Here, I'm only taking into account the GLNR action. So, I want to now tell you what I mean when I say a GLR-ring is Kuzur. So, for this, I take a Take a GLR ring which has the property that in the zero entry it is only z and then I also want to define z this is a abuse of notation of course to be the GLR ring that has in degree n In degree n has in degree 0, it has z and everywhere else. I'm sorry, this is small. Let me write this again. Z n is defined as in degree 0, it is z and in higher degrees, it is just 0. So we, in this case, we'll get an augmentation of or a surjection of A to Z. Rejection of A to Z as GLR rings. And in particular, we get that Z is an A module. And we say that A is causal if the Tor groups. Now, if I take a Tor Take a tour of two GLR modules that are actually A modules over A, I will get back a GLR module. So I get something out in each degree, and I want that this module is zero unless n is equal to i. Then this is called Then this is called Kuzur. And the upshot of being Kuzu is having a minimal free resolution. Namely, if A is closure, then I get the free resolution of Z tor. Tor zero z z zero multiplied by A. So this is the free A module generated in degree zero by this is just Z and this is this is also just going to be Z but Easy, but in general, we get a free A module generated in degree I. Now, why is this interesting? Well, because as Jeremy Miller brought As Jeremy Miller, Rohit Nakpal, and I have proved. If F is a field. Peter, there's a question in the chat. Yes. No, it's after the talk, please. Oh, after the talk. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Then Steinberg F is causal, or is let's say is a causal Cozul G L F ring. So, in particular, we can find such a minimal free resolution. So, it would be important to us actually to find what are those Tor groups. And these Tor groups. These Tor groups could be, depending on how you want to view this, be said this is the Kozule dual of this ring. And Jeremy Miller, Jennifer Wilson, and I have now proved that these torque. Uh these Tor groups are actually the tensor product of two Steinberg modules. So, where again here it is important that GLN acts on this and missing here because it's in the end part of a Part of a GLF module. Now, I believe I have one minute left. And if you want to, I will say thank you for your attention right now, but I do have something to say about the methods as well. Let's thank Peter. Can you tell us in one minute about the methods? Well, no, let me try. Let me just use some prepared notes. So the methods are. I will upload the. I will upload the notes as well for those who are interested later to read this. But in principle, there are some so-called higher teeth buildings, and these are related to the common basis complex. And our main theorem of the methods is that That we prove that a higher tits building is actually connected to a sort of bar resolution or a bar construction on a lower Tietz building. And using that theorem, That theorem, one can then use connectivity of the T2 building for fields to immediately say something about the connectivity of this. And one can also use this T2 building and knowing what the homology of it is to say what the Say what the Tor is of the Steinberg, which is captured by the bar construction of the Tietz building. That was roughly one minute. So, Peter, is there a reason you have quotation marks around theorem there? Is there a hypothesis that you do something? Can you say that again, please? Go back. Go back, remove that, pull that off, and so we can see what you kept before. You have the word theorem there has quotation marks around it. Are there hypotheses missing? Marks around it, are there hypotheses missing or something here? Um, what B means? I think that B is in quotation marks here. Like, I didn't really explain what the bar construction of a Tits building is. Ah, I see, I see. You should use a different model if you want to take B of the Tits building. Like, this is a nice small model. It's good for doing connectivity arguments, but isn't good functorially. Rogness and Sandersorn and Oscar in their paper have. Oscar in their paper have models which are suspensions of it, but then have good functorial properties. I see. So you wanted to sort of change models and then B is what you think B should mean in the category of B V modules. I see. Okay, that's fine. And I'll upload those for the interested reader as well. This is now using that theorem. These are very short proofs. these are very short proofs to um to to the main big main theorems and um yeah maybe interesting for Oscar this theorem also implies that actually the E1 page is equivalent to the E infinity homology of these chains. These chains because these are iterated tors. Anyway, thank you so much again for your attention and the patience. Oh, I think there might be more questions. Are there more questions in person? Yeah. What did you say was the action of the DLN on the Tor N was a diagonal? So So this is a GLF module. So in the nth degree, it has to come with a GLNF action. And the action is just the diagonal action on these two Steinberg modules. And another question. In the first half, you were saying that That the filtered quotes of the rank filtration were some cone of a map of a suspension go plane. Is there a reason why it's not expressed as the double suspension of the first complex? I don't know. Maybe somebody else has a better answer to this. Answer to this. Or maybe one thing you could think of is. Maybe Oscar has a better answer for that, Jeremy. I mean, you can take the double suspension, but then you have to take the homotopy quotient in the category of pointed things. That's more or less the same as what Peter did. I'm really not an expert on this spectrum side, so I apologize for any. I apologize for any inaccuracies that I brought down here. Sorry, can I have a question, please? Why are we struggling for the connectivity theorem? I'm just wondering if, as an application, possibly one can recover Sutton's stability theorem for homology of general linear groups. Or it's not known. So this kind of So this kind of it's definitely related to the connective to the stability of general linear groups and it is in fact the range in which it is stable is very much connected to these zeros. So we do know that DRN is automatically is automatically n minus um let me lie four connected um uh with with a coefficient one here instead of two um but that's not what we want to to have a higher slope here is uh maybe the answer to your question yeah it would be an interesting application that you can recover that theorem by using this technique You should go to Oscar's talk if you're interested in how this stuff is connected to homological stability. Are there any more in-person questions or any more? Or any more virtual questions? All right, let's thank Peter again. Thank you. Maybe, maybe after. Maybe, maybe after letting everybody leave as they want to, Jeremy and Oscar can help me to answer any questions that we always have. Sander's also here. Oh, yeah, Sander.
