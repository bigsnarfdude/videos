Okay, we can start a few seconds earlier before if you wish. So it's my pleasure to introduce our next young speaker, this CÃ©dric Letissier from where are you in Oslo, University of Oslo, and on hyperbolic plane curves near the non-singular tropical limit. Please, Teresa. Thanks for the introduction and thanks to the organizer for inviting me to this conference. Me to this conference. So I will start by recalling the notion of hyperbolicity in the case of non-singular curves. So the geometric definition is that a non-singular, real algebraic curve is hyperbolic with respect to some point P if there exists a totally real pencil of lines through that point P for that curve C. And equivalently, we can see topologically that See topologically that the real part consists of a maximal nest of ovals and possibly a pseudo-line if the degree is odd. So this was known to Rocklin in the case of curves and then to Alton and Vinnikov in the case of hypersurfaces in general. Our goal for today is to give some family of real algebraic curves with a parameter T converging to some non-singular algebraical curve C. Into some non-singular tropical curve C to determine if the curves are hyperbolic and to characterize the hyperbolicity loss in terms of the tropical curve and the sign of the monomules of the family. Okay, so a family of real algebraic curves tropicalized to something like this, which is a one-dimensional polynomial complex. And this is associated to a so-called tropical polymer. It to a so-called tropical polynomial, so that we can study its Newton polygon like this. And the period structure of the tropical curve gives you a dual subdivision of that Newton polygon. And in order to have the real structure, you need to take the sign information from the family that we see on the diversity division here, and then we can unfold the picture. Can unfold the picture to obtain the real part of a tropical curve like this. So each edge of the real part corresponds to an edge dual, to something like this with distinct signs here. And by Vero's patroling theorem, we can in fact just take a tupacle curve and a distribution of signs, and we recover families of real algebraic curves with the good topological properties. Topological properties, so we have a nomeomomorphism of pair between those two things here, and we can also equivalently look at amoebas around our tropical curve like this, which gives an equivalent description of real part like this. So, for instance, if you take some arc of the real part inside an orton here, you A Norton here, you get that the amoeba associated to a curve neonotropical limit gives you something like this with a note information noted here. And we see here so-called precedes, but I will give more details on. So, for a curve near the tubercle limit, the amoeba will look like this around the vertex, so three distinct arcs, and around Arcs and around each bonded edge, you have two possibilities: either two non-crossing arcs like this, or two crossing arcs like this. And in this case, we say that the edge of the tropical curve is twisted. And if you have a tropical curve and an admissible set of twisted edges, then you can recover up to symmetry a real part of the tropical curve. And so then a family of real geopolitical. A family of Euro geovaic curves with good topological properties. So, the first idea for our study is to look at the topological properties of hyperbolic curves. So, we will say that a non-singular real tropical curve, so we take a tropical curve C and the distribution of signs, is hyperbolic if it is the tropical limit of some family of non-singular hyperbolic curves. And we take a And we take a topological description, which is equivalent to the first one I gave, and which has been given by Revkov. So in the case of tropical curve, it is we need an even number of twisted edges on each cycle of the tropical curve, and we need that the real part as the expected number of connected components. So this can be computed in terms of Computed in terms of the twisted edges thanks to a recent flop from Renodin and Show. However, we do not obtain any information on the hyperbolicity locus this way. So we need to look at the geometric description instead. So we will say that a non-singular real tropical curve C delta of dq d is hyperbolic with respect to a real hyperbolic with respect to a real tropical point. So v epsilon is v is some point in the complement of the tropical curve and epsilon a choice of Hortand. If for every real tropical line through this, every realization of the intersection like this consists of d distinct real points. So by realization here, I mean I have a family converging to this. Converging to this, I have a family converging to this. I look at the intersection of elements here. And the tropical hyperbolicity locus of my rotupical curve is the set of points V such that there exist some atoms and so that the rotupical curve is hyperfic with respect to the rotopical point. So up to some generic CT condition, generic city condition we have three kinds of intersections to look at so take your point v here we have some parametrization of the pencil of triple lines through v and we need to look at transverse intersection at a first kind of non-transverse intersection like this that contains Intersection like this that contains an edge on such a proposal curve, and finally at a second kind of non-transferous intersection which contains a segment strictly inside the bounded edge. Okay, so in the first non-transverse case, locally it will look like this. And if the edge here is twisted, Here is twisted, I obtain that every realization of the intersection consists of two distinct real points. Otherwise, we have three possibilities, either two distinct real points or two distinct complex conjugated points or a real multiplicity two point. And in the other non-transverse case, we obtain a similar result, but I introduce the new notion of relative. A new notion of relatively non-twisted or relatively twisted. So we need to keep track of the ortant information like earlier with the ANIBA. In this case, here it will be relatively non-twisted. And this is the case where every realization consists of two distinct real points. So thanks to those results of real tropical intersection theory. Of real tropical intersection theory, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for hyperbolicity with respect to a real tropical point. But I will not state here because I don't have much time. But it is in terms of the direction of the edges of C, the twisted edges of C and the relatively non-twisted intersection components on C. And it will depend on the regions of the complement of the parametrization here. Parametrization here. As a corollary, we recover Spiral's results saying that a family tropicalizing to a non-singular real tropical curve C delta is stable, so each element of the family is stable, if and only if the tropical curve C is a honeycomb and the distribution of size delta is constant. So what is this honeycomb here? Well, it is a tropical curve. It is a tropical curve that looks like this. So every edge is of direction either 1,0 or 0, 1 or 1, 1. And we can go further in our hyperbolicity result by looking at multi-bridges on OneCon. So a multi-bridge is a set of parallel edges that disconnects the tropical curve, and no proper subset disconnects that tropical curve. So for instance, So, for instance, these three edges form a multi-bridge, and in the dual subdivision, the dual edges are contained in a line like this. And so, in the case of only cons, we get the following. So, we get that a connected component of the complement of a tropical curve, say this one, is inside the Is inside the tropical hyperbolicity locus of this. If every multi-bridge on the left, like this, below, like this, and diagonally above, like this, is twisted. And we can see here on the dorsal division, this on the left below. On the left, below, diagonally above our dual integral point here. So let's look at an example. So if we choose this connected component of the complement, then we need that every multi-bridge diagonally above that connected component is to see. This gives you each of these here. Each of these here. And up to symmetry, we obtain the real part like this, which is so this is a degree six tropical curve, and we obtain as real part an hyperbolic curve like this. This blue thing here is a tropical hyperbolicity locus, and we get as a real part here, something which is only. Something which is homeomorphic or isotopic, even to the standard hyperbolicity locus. And we can prove that this as an open set is syntropically convex. So we do get a notion of convexity. And we can also say that, for instance, for that connective component, the choice of multiple I twisted here is minimal. That I twisted here is minimal in the sense that I can twist any other multi-bridge, and this will still this connected component will still be in the tropical hyperbolicity locus. And what I think will happen is that this real part here will enlarge more and more until you twist everything and then you get up to symmetry, the stable case. And I think I can thank you for your attention. Thank you.
