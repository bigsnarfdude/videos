Thank you very much for the introduction and the invitation to speak, I guess, sort of in banff. So I just, you know, this is a new event for me because I've never spoken sort of to periodic and almost periodic people. So hopefully I've pitched this in the right place, but I'm happy to have the opportunity. Place, but I'm happy to have the opportunity. But and thank you again to the organizers. I'm going to be speaking about some work joined with Leonard Parnovsky and Roman Scherenberg. I think you're going to be hearing many of their joint works today, as far as I understand, where we're dealing with classical wave methods and modern gauge transforms. So you just heard a nice talk by Jean-Lagassé about gauge transforms, and this is the same concept here. Concept here. I will remind you, I guess, towards the end how that's going to look in this context. And then I'm also going to tell you about classical wave methods, which are sort of methods which were built to handle high energy spectral asymptotics. Now, some of you are certainly going to wonder, at least for part of the talk, why I'm giving this talk in a periodic and almost periodic conference. And I promise you at the end that. I promise you at the end that, or at least I hope it will become clear at the end. The point is: at some stage, everything is going to become periodic, and we're going to use this gauge transform, which was built for periodic methods. And the other thing is, of course, this is going to be a talk about high-energy spectral asymptotic. So, this is not a talk about discrete, almost periodic operators. This is a talk about, as with Jean's talk, about continuum. About continuum operators and in the high energy limits, rather than, and certainly, so one should not think about the large coupling constant or anything like that. Really, we should be thinking about a continuum problem with the high energy limit. And so the first thing I want to do is try to sort of motivate this problem and tell you a little bit about the history of high-energy spectral asymptotics. Spectral asymptotics. So, this turns out to be one of the most classical problems in modern spectral theory, and that is you put yourself on a compact Riemannian manifold, or indeed if you prefer, say, in a bounded domain in Rd, and you look at the Laplace operator on that manifold, and you ask yourself the following question: Well, what does its spectrum look like? And of course, this is a nice. This is a nice elliptic operator on a compact manifold. So it certainly has a discrete spectrum starting at zero and tending to infinity. And this is the whole spectrum, right? Everything is eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. And then you might wonder to yourself, well, what does this look like at high energy? And indeed, about 100 years ago, a little over 100 years ago, actually, some famous Some famous physicists/slash mathematician Sommerfeld and Lorentz made a conjecture. And what they said is they said, Okay, well, I'm interested in the number of eigenvalues below lambda. Okay, so just let me point this out once and for all. I'm going to normal take the squares of eigenvalues. So lambda squared is rather the eigenvalue, not lambda itself. And I'm interested in the number of these eigenvalues with lambda j less than a certain lambda. Less than a certain lambda, and they conjectured that this number was equal to some first term, which basically depends on the volume of the manifold times lambda to the d, where d is the dimension again, plus a little o. So in other words, this is the main asymptotic term about how many states there are with a certain energy, right? And this was an important question. And this was an important question. This was raised at some meeting in Germany in 1910, and David Hilbert was also in attendance. And he said, this conjecture will not be proved in my lifetime. I mean, he said it in German, so I don't have a direct quote, but this was the gist of it. And fortunately for us, he was wrong, and his student Vial actually proved it the next year. So he thought this was rather. So he thought this was rather difficult, so but he had a very good student in Weil, and Weil managed to prove this in a slightly different setting that indeed this is the main asymptotic term. Okay, and so one might be interested in a bit more sort of how far can you push this, right? I mean, and indeed, this is a classical question in spectral theory, which is we know the main term. Know the main term. Can we say anything more? Right, and okay, this is connected, for instance, to the Gauss circle problem if you take the manifold to be the torus. So even Gauss was sort of interested in a similar or a question which can be phrased in this language. And another place where high energy spectral asymptotics come up is in heat traces. So, I mean, it's a little bit, you know, it doesn't necessarily look like this is a It doesn't necessarily look like this is about high-energy spectral asymptotics at first, but of course, you can take the heat operator, the solution to the heat equation, you can look at its trace. This makes sense because the heat equation is smoothing. And you know, of course, it's the sum of some eigenvalues. So certainly this should be related to the distribution of eigenvalues. And, okay, in the 40s, Minak Shisundaram, I apologize for the pronunciation and play L. For the pronunciation, and Pleiel gave a complete asymptotic expansion for this heat trace in powers of t. Okay, so they were able to show that on any manifold, you have this complete asymptotic expansion near zero in powers of t. And it turns out that this theorem about high energy or about excuse me, heat trace asymptotics implies the theorem of Weil. So you can implies the theorem of Weyl. So you can make some sort of transform type argument and go from heat trace asymptotics to the theorem of Weil. And again, you recover, of course, the main term plus small O of lambda to the D. And now you might wonder to yourself, well, the heat trace has a complete asymptotic expansion in powers of t. Can I do better? Can I do better than this little of lambda to the d? And indeed, you might make what turns out to be a very naive conjecture that because I have a complete asymptotic expansion in powers of t, I should have a complete asymptotic expansion in powers of lambda for the counting function. Now, of course, this has an obvious problem, which is that the counting function is integer-valued, and that's already a problem. Already a problem, but actually, there are bigger problems here. So, this conjecture is obviously false, first of all, because the counting function is integer-valued. But second of all, if you consider the round sphere, then we know the spectrum of the Laplacian on the round sphere. It's given exactly by L times L plus one, where L is an integer. And each one of those eigenvalues has multiplicity to L plus one. So, this is a classical. Plus one. So this is a classical computation. You get spherical harmonics and so on. And now you can go ahead and look at what you could possibly have in terms of asymptotics for the counting function, right? And so you go ahead and you suppose the naive conjecture was true, or indeed some even weaker version of the naive conjecture, and you start computing, right? So you know that there's these big clusters. That there's these big clusters of eigenvalues, big multiplicity of eigenvalues exactly at L times L plus one. So no matter how small epsilon is here, I get 2L plus 1 for this number. And okay, you use your conjecture and you say, okay, well, as long as I have a second term here, I know that 2L plus 1 is 2 epsilon times whatever the B0 is plus big O of 1. Well, obviously, this is a problem if L is big. This is a problem if L is big and/or epsilon is small. So, you really can't have even one more term in the asymptotic expansion when there's the sphere. So, there's no way of doing better on the sphere than n of lambda is like, okay, that constant, which I won't write again, lambda to the d plus big O of lambda to the d minus one. That's the best you can do on the sphere, and there's nothing more you can hope for. You can hope for. Now, this is important to know that the sphere is a counterexample to having deeper asymptotic terms, but it doesn't give us a whole lot of information about, first of all, what is true, but second of all, why is it not possible? So, before I talk about that carefully, I'm going to generalize my situation slightly in that I'm going to allow myself not just to In that, I'm going to allow myself not just to have the Laplace-Beltrami operator, but to have a Schrödinger operator. And so, I'm going to consider the same question. I have again a smooth compact Riemannian manifold. I take this Schrödinger operator on that manifold. And again, it has a nice discrete spectrum going off to infinity. And again, you can ask about the counting function for the set of eigenvalues. A set of eigenvalues, and you can guess that the first term is not going to be changed because, after all, v is you know a very small perturbation of the Laplacian in some sense. And indeed, it's not hard to check using, for example, heat trace asymptotics that again, this thing is small of lambda to the d, but much more is true. And in the 50s, Leviton and Ivakimovich proved that this remainder is actually. This remainder is actually one power down. And now, if you remember what I just said about the sphere, that's really the best thing you could hope for in general. And it was in this paper, I believe, that Levitton actually introduced the wave method, which I'll talk about a little later. So they were able to prove this sharp result. And then a little, you know, 15 or so years later, Hormander came along. Years later, Hormander came along and he actually introduced the theory of Fourier integral operators to study this problem, right, in some sense. And he again reproved this estimate, but with a much more, with a systematic application of this theory of Fourier operators. And that development then led to many, many future developments, including the work of Deutschermach-Gilleman. So, Deutschermac-Gilleman are going to explain to us why it is that the sphere can't have a Sphere can't have a second term. Why can't you do better than lambda to the d minus one? And the first thing, or one of the things they say in this paper, is that if there are few periodic geodesics, in a sense that I'm not going to make precise, then you have an improvement in the remainder. It's not big O of lambda to the d minus one, it's little o of lambda to the d minus one. And perhaps more importantly for us right now, For us right now, if you have only periodic geodesics, so in other words, if the manifold is what's known as a Zoll manifold, so as the sphere is an example of one of these things, then there is no remainder, or there is no improvement of the remainder, and indeed there is no improvement of the remainder with any asymptotic term. The spectrum looks a lot like that of the sphere. It has these big clusters at certain points. Okay, so immediately one can see that at least One can see that at least the first obstruction to having further asymptotic terms in the counting function is periodic geodesics. It's periodic geodesics. And indeed, you can do a bit better. With Shaiza-Kanzani, I proved recently that if there are, in some sense, very few periodic geodesics, you can do a bit better. You can get a quantitative improvement here. So these are really starting to look like the obstruction. Starting to look like the obstruction to having deeper asymptotic terms. Okay, so this is all based on Leviton's wave method, which again I promised to explain later. And if you maybe, you know, if you remember nothing else from this talk, I hope that I can explain at least roughly what goes on with the wave method, because it is an important sort of technique in spectral asymptotics. Unique in spectral asymptotics. But now that we know periodic geodesics are the obstruction or an obstruction to full spectral asymptotics, full asymptotics for the counting function, we can make a second naive conjecture. Okay, and that conjecture is if there are no periodic geodesics, then maybe this thing has a full asymptotic expansion in powers of lambda. Okay, unfortunately, we Unfortunately, we immediately have a problem. And that is that, at least, okay, I'm not 100% sure whether it's a theorem, but I don't believe there are compact manifolds without a closed geodesic. And if there are, they would be very, very strange. Okay, so you have to do something to deal with that. Well, one thing you can try to do is you can move to non-compact manifolds. And indeed, we know. And indeed, we know of an example of a non-compact manifold with no closed geodesics. It's Rd. Rd is maybe everybody's favorite example in this crowd, I would guess. So we certainly have an example of a manifold with no closed geodesics on Rd, but we still have a problem. And it's a different problem, but it's a problem. That is, this counting function doesn't really make sense, right? I mean, you don't have discrete spectrum. You don't have discrete spectrum, so what are you counting? And many of you would say, well, Jeff, you should be using the integrated density of states, but this also doesn't always make sense if V is not highly structured. So you need to do something here to make sense of an analog or something like this counting function. And to do that, I'm going to introduce a replacement. I'm going to introduce a replacement for the vial asymptotics, for these high energy spectral asymptotics, where we're going to consider what's known as the local density of states. And what I'm doing here is I'm taking this function of the Schrödinger operator, which is, of course, the spectral projector onto energies less than lambda squared or eigen spectrum less than lambda squared. This is a nice This is a nice smoothing operator. So I can restrict it to any points I like, and I'm going to restrict it to the diagonal, some point in the diagonal. That's going to be called the local density of states. Okay. And you, in a situation where maybe you do have an integrated density of states, of course, you can average this thing over bigger and bigger boxes, and that will give you the integrated density of states. Give you the integrated density of states. Okay, and once again, you can ask the same kind of questions about this new object, this local density of states, which is what are its asymptotics? And indeed, the theorems of Levitan and Vakomovich and Hormander actually studied really this problem on a compact manifold. And what they showed is that this local density of states, again, has the main term, which looks like some universal constant in d dimension. Universal constant in d dimensions times lambda to the d plus big O of lambda to the d minus one. And you might say, okay, great, maybe this is a thing that I can hope for full asymptotics in powers of lambda. Okay, because once again, you can do what's known as the pre-trace asymptotics for heats, heat expansions, and again, they have full asymptotic expansions of the power of t. But alas, you can check on the sphere. You can check on the sphere once more that you can't do better than this. This is the best you can do in a general situation. And once again, you should wonder what are the obstructions. Okay, so Safarov in the 80s and then Sog Zeldich much later proved that if there are a few loops from X to itself, so geodesic loops, what do I mean by that? I mean that if I start at X here and I walk on a geodesic, And I walk on a geodesic, I should come back to X, but not necessarily in the same direction. So this is a geodesic loop, right? If this is X. A periodic geodesic, of course, is just a closed, smoothly closed, smoothly closed loop. So this guy is periodic. This is a loop. Oops. This is a loop through X. So if there are a few of those, Those loops through X, then Safarov and Sogzevich tell us that indeed there is an improved remainder here. And once more, you can ask, is that really the obstruction? And you can check at least if all the geodesics through X are periodic with some period, then this remainder is not little of lambda to the D minus one. And indeed, no matter what big O of lambda to the D minus one term you add. The d minus one term you add if you have one more term in the expansion, this is never a little over lambda to the d minus one. So, what we see then is that, okay, we found something which at least in principle makes sense on a non-compact manifold. And we know what the obstructions are, the naive instructions to develop. To deep asymptotic expansions. They're the loops. We paid the price that we had to go from closed geodesics, which are certainly more rare than loops. But nevertheless, we have a candidate for something we could ask about complete asymptotic expansions. And so we make a third naive conjecture. So what's the natural thing to do is to say that the only obstruction to full asymptotic expansion. Obstruction to full asymptotic expansions are geodesic loops. So, if there are no geodesic loops at x, let's say, then you might conjecture that this local density of states has a full asymptotic expansion in powers of lambda. Once again, we have a sad problem if we're working on compact manifolds, which is I certainly don't know of any compact manifolds without a loop, and I doubt that they exist. It's a theorem that there's not a loop. Is it a theorem? Okay. There's not is it a theorem? Okay, there are no compact manifolds that without a loop. Uh, so again, we have to move to non-compact manifolds. And now we're starting to be in good shape, right? Because this object certainly makes sense on a non-compact manifold. It's just something about the kernel of the spectral projector. And we certainly have at least one example. We certainly have at least one example with no loops, that is Rd. Rd certainly has no loops. And so now everything makes sense. Okay, but alas, we still have a problem, which is that if v is like absolute value of x squared, so I'm talking about the operator which is minus Laplace and on Rd plus epsilon value of x squared, of course, this is the hard. Value of x squared. Of course, this is the harmonic oscillator. And it's very easy to check that, in general, you don't have full asymptotic expansions for the spectral projector or the spectral projector on the diagonal, this local density of states for the harmonic oscillator. So, this conjecture is still too naive. So, let me finally make a less naive conjecture. So, the problem with the harmonic oscillator is that the potential is growing quite fast towards infinity. So, let's get rid of that, right? So, not only let's get rid of that. So, we ask that the potential be certainly in L infinity, but more, we want it to be smooth with all derivatives in L infinity. So, this is a reasonable class of potentials which you might consider. So, by the way, if somebody So, by the way, if somebody in the room is asking a question, it's very unlikely I'm going to be able to hear you. So, just please make yourself loud somehow. So, this is a reasonable class of potentials you could consider now Schrödinger operators on R D, which are smooth and all derivatives are bounded. So, this is known as the uniformly smoothly. Known as the uniformly smoothly bounded class of potentials, and of course, all many of your favorite examples live there, right? So, periodic, smooth, periodic potentials, of course, live there. Quasi-periodic potentials, smooth, quasi-periodic potentials, almost periodic potentials, which are under some reasonable assumptions. These all live in this class. Okay, and in 2016, Parnovsky's journal. 2016, Parnovsky and Sternberg made a conjecture, which is that if you have one of these USB potentials, then there's a full asymptotic expansion in powers of lambda for this local density of states. Okay, so okay, this is at least a precise conjecture which you could hope to be true. And it turns out to be equivalent to another conjecture, which, you know, it's maybe at first a little surprising that these things are equivalent. First, a little surprising that these things are equivalent. But if you take two USB potentials, and if you know they're equal in a neighborhood of x, then these local density of states agree modula lambda to the minus m. And it's possible to go back and forth between these two conjectures once you know some additional information. But okay, so now we have this conjecture. We have this conjecture. I'm not going to tell you that this one is false for an obvious reason because we don't know. But when do we know that these things are true? In what subclasses of potentials maybe do we know when these are true? And why is it complicated? So let me first start with why this is a complicated conjecture. It's complicated because the spectrum of a Schrödinger operator, as you Schrödinger operator, as you well know, can be extremely wild. Even in one dimension, this spectrum can be extremely wild, right? It can have dense pure point spectrum. That can happen. It can have positive but arbitrarily small Hausdorff measure the spectrum. Why not? Absolutely continuous. Certainly, that's the region where you might expect something like this, a priori. Singular continuous. I mean, more or less. I mean, more or less, you know, if you think of a bad behavior, it can probably happen, right? I mean, it's really a zoo out there. But nevertheless, there's this conjecture. And okay, so let me just address one reason why you might not worry, for example, about dense pure point spectrum or even sort of lots of eigenvalues. Eigenvalues? Well, in the case of the counting function, we had something which was integer valued. But now, if you're talking about, say, dense pure point spectrum or indeed the eigenvalues, you have a gain from somewhere else. You're counting up values of eigenfunct at a point x. And those things, in principle, can be very small as lambda goes to infinity. And we're going to see that that is indeed what happens in some circumstances. In some circumstances. But just be aware that this is, in principle, a rather complicated conjecture because the spectrum is quite wild. So, when is this thing known? Well, it's known in certain cases. The first thing is if V is periodic, then in that same paper where they made the conjecture, Parnovsky and Scherenberg proved that you do indeed have this full asymptotic expansion for the Expansion for the local density of states. In the same paper, they proved that under some reasonable conditions, similar conditions to what John mentioned, that you have complete asymptotic expansions for this local density of states, provided you have some diaphantine condition on the frequencies. Another case where this is known, and it's actually much. Case where this is known, and it's actually much older, is when the potential is compactly supported and smooth, and that's due to Popov and Shubin in the 80s. And here, the world is very different. Somehow, this is the world in which scattering theory lives. So, the method, of course, in the first two cases was the gauge transform. So, that's this idea Jean spoke about, and I'll rehash towards the end, that you want to conjugate your You want to conjugate your operator by some unitary thing to reduce it to a Fourier multiplier, or at least as close to a Fourier multiplier as you can get. On the other hand, in the compactly supported case, you use this mysterious wave method, which again, I promise I will explain. But what I want to say is that these two methods come from really quite different. you know from really quite different uh quite different ideas and they've been they've proved rather hard to combine the gauge transform is really designed for and used in periodic and almost periodic situations and the wave method at least in the setting of non-compact manifolds comes as i said from the world of scattering theory where you expect your potential or your perturbation to be in some sense small at infinity let's Small at infinity, let's say. And that's why these two things have proved a little difficult to combine. So there is one paper by myself where I managed to combine these things, but it was a little, admittedly, a little ad hoc. And one thing it lets you do is to do on the real line compactly supported plus periodic potentials, and you indeed get this complete asymptotic expansion. So that was some kind. Expansion. So that was some combination of the wave method and the gauge transform. But it was, you know, it was a little ad hoc. Okay, so what's the goal then? Well, the goal is, well, to prove the conjecture, of course, if you can. And the idea is just maybe we can find a better way to combine the wave method and the gauge transform. And maybe if we need to, we can modify the gauge transform. We can modify the gauge transform a bit to make this happen. Okay, so what's the theorem then? The theorem is that the conjecture is true in one dimension with no extra assumptions. So you take any USB potential, any smooth bounded potential with all derivatives, then you have a complete asymptotic expansion in powers of lambda for this local density of states. And okay, using the heat trace, Using the heat trace and some arguments to Pushnitsky, I believe, you can then realize that actually these coefficients can be determined from a finite but j-dependent number of derivatives of v at the point x. And that's actually how you can go from one conjecture to the other. Because once you know that these coefficients actually depend on only a finite number of derivative at x, of course, they only At x. Of course, they only depend on v in a neighborhood of x. And so if you have two USB potentials which agree, then they must agree, the local density of states agree. And you can go the other direction by comparing to a compactly supported potential. Okay, so now how should I think about this theorem? How should I think about this conjecture even? I want to try to convince you that what this says in some sense, This says, in some sense, is that although the spectrum cannot, is not definitely not absolutely continuous in full generality, it wants to be in some sense. Okay, it wants to be absolutely continuous at high energy. So let me give you a few corollaries, which I hope will sort of convince you of that. So, one thing, the first one I want to talk about is if you have this full asymptotic expansion, If you have this full asymptotic expansion, then the gaps in the spectrum at high energy are very small. So if you have a gap in the spectrum, then it must be of size lambda to the minus n for any n, right? So there's some constant so that this thing is super polynomially small as lambda goes to infinity. So again, the spectrum is definitely not, in general, the whole, it doesn't contain array, let's say. Say. But nevertheless, it's very close to doing that because, in any small interval, you hit the spectrum. Okay, let me say something about why you should think it wants to be absolutely continuous, not just containing a whole array. So we have a corollary again, and this is a little bit harder to see, but is nevertheless true, which roughly speaks. Which roughly speaking says that solutions to the Schrödinger equation with energy lambda look like plane waves with frequency lambda, or energy lambda squared look like plane waves with frequency lambda squared. How do I see that from a statement like this? Well, this energy here, I think of this as the energy of the solution or the energy density of the solution at a point x1. And of course, if you have no v whatsoever, then this energy. Then this energy is constant, right? This you have sine or cosine, and this energy is constant no matter where you look. Now, it's easy to see that if x1 and x2 are, say, a bounded distance apart, then an estimate like this is true. And that's easy to see. But now what we're saying is, even if x1 and x2 are extremely far apart, lambda to the n far apart, Far apart, then nevertheless, the energy density at the point x1 is very close to the energy density at the point x2. They can vary a little bit, but not very much. So what does that mean in terms of sort of the solutions? Well, it certainly allows them to be in L2. That can happen. And it better be able to happen because we know it does. But they must sort of look like this. But they must sort of look like this. If you have a solution at lambda, which is in L2, some small lambda, then yeah, maybe it's exponentially localized and it just sort of lives in a small set. But now I increase lambda just a little bit. Well, what happens? What does the theorem say? Well, it says that this, again, you might have a localized, I mean, an L2 solution, but it has to be spreading out a lot, right? It has to be much more. A lot, right? It has to be much more spread out than the one at small energy. It has to be spread out very, very far and oscillating at scale one over lambda. And if you again increase lambda a little bit more, you get even more spread out. So again, it could be an L2, nothing rules that out, but it looks a lot like a plane wave on these very, very large scales. So again, in some sense, this is telling you. Sense this is trying telling you that the spectrum wants to be absolutely continuous and the generalized eigenfunctions want to be like plane waves. Okay, and there's a final corollary, which is about if Lyapunov exponents exist. So, okay, Lyapunov exponents may not always exist, but if this thing makes sense, then at high energy, it's bounded by an arbitrary power of the energy. Power of the energy. And this was actually proved in the 80s by DeLiona Fulon as well. But the moral of all these stories is that the spectrum wants to be absolutely continuous at high energy. I mean, a more precise way of putting this is that if you have glasses with some dirt on them, so what does the dirt do? It makes everything a little bit blurry. How blurry? So I can't tell the difference between two points. So, I can't tell the difference between two points, which are, say, lambda to the minus n far apart. Then, if you do that, you can't tell the difference between this thing and having absolutely continuous spectrum. So as long as you're willing to blur everything by lambda to the minus n, you give me any n, I really can't tell the difference between what I have in reality and having absolutely continuous spectrum. And that's sort of the moral of this story. Okay. Okay, so now I've told you what the theorem is. I've told you, I've tried to motivate why you might think this is true because there are no loops. I'd better tell you something at least about the proof of this theorem. Okay, and here is now, you know, if you've fallen asleep, this is the thing I promised you that hopefully you can remember if you take something away. This is a relatively simple idea that I think is nevertheless. idea that that I think is nevertheless very important. So what is the wave method? And this is due to Levitton in the 50s. So his idea was, I'm interested in this spectral projector here, right? I want to know about the spectrum up to, well, lambda squared or up to lambda for the square root of the operator. Operator. And what he realized is, of course, I can use the Fourier transform to write the indicator function as, well, some integral of e to the i tx or e to the i t times the operator like that. All right, so I've just written the Fourier transform of the delta function and then integrated it. Okay, so. Okay, so now what have I managed to do? I've managed to write my spectral function, my spectral projector, in terms of the half-wave group, right? So it's e to the i t squared of minus Laplace plus v. Okay, at first this may not look particularly useful, but you can ask yourself, can I in some way get my hands on what the half wave group? On what the half-wave group looks like? And well, okay, the answer is going to be in some sense yes, but if you could, if you could write down, say, a parametrics for this half wave group, modulo sufficiently good things, then you could just take this thing, restrict it to the diagonal, and there you would have a formula for this local density of states. Now, the trouble with this. Now, the trouble with this is that it's actually rather difficult, if not impossible in general, to write down a pair of metrics for this half wave group for arbitrarily large time. I mean, you can do it for any bounded time, but the estimates will get much, much worse and in sort of an uncontrollable way as the time goes to infinity. So, what can you do? Well, you can say, all right, I Say, all right, I can't compute this thing, it's just too irregular. But if I smooth it out, maybe I can compute that. And so what do you do? You take some Schwartz function with compact support, whose Fourier transform, excuse me, has compact support. You smooth out this spectral projector. So this is a convolution in the argument, and I evaluate the whole thing here at this operator. And what I get instead of, sorry. And what I get instead, sorry, I dropped the 2π, but we can pretend 2π is 1 among friends. And instead now, I have an integral like that. And the advantage now is that row hat is compactly supported. So I'm only interested in having a pair of metrics for the wave group here to finite times. And that's something you can do. That's where, if you like, one way of doing this is to use. You like one way of doing this is to use Hormander's theory of Fourier electrical operators and really write down a very good approximation of this kernel and something you can really work with and compute. So by doing that, you can get your hands on this object, on the kernel of this object. So now we did that by writing a parametrics for this thing, and now we have asymptotics for the smooth version. And the question becomes, And the question becomes: well, how close is this to this? How close is the smooth version to the unsmoothed version? And okay, there are methods for dealing with this that go by the name of Tauberian methods. So those are working in sort of pretty general circumstances. Or if you're in the situation where, for example, V is compactly supported, then Supported, then you can actually observe that at least for some fixed x, these two are almost the same. So Tauberian methods typically give you an estimate modulo, for example, this big O of lambda to the D minus one. If you're willing to use more structure, then you can see that at least when you evaluate at some point, these are very close indeed lambda. Uh, indeed, lambda to the minus infinity close, but that really requires structure on V, it should be small in some very real sense near infinity. So this is the wave method, and this is how you can get, for example, the first term in the Weil law. Now, what about the gauge transform? So, fortunately for me, you already heard a whole talk about this, but I remind you in But I remind you, in any case, how this works. So, this is a method which, as far as I'm aware, was introduced by Alex Sovolev to deal with periodic problems. And the idea is to use what's known as Moser averaging to reduce your problem to one which you understand better. So, Moser averaging is just this conjugation by e to the i phi, where phi is some pseudo-differential operator. And the goal. And the goal, as Jean said, is to get something which is, well, Laplacian plus a Fourier multiplier plus some error, right? The error is hopefully small enough. And we learned an hour ago that the way you do this is you have this nice formula in terms of the adjugate operator of phi and Laplacian. And the first term is this commutator. And what you want to solve is more. Commutator, and what you want to solve is morally the commutator equation minus Laplace V tilde is V, and then you sort of do an iterated version of this. And of course, you can write down what this V tilde should be if you want to do that. If V is an e to the I theta X, then V tilde is just e to the i theta X over 2 x theta. So, okay, I should warn you that I think in the physical space, Not in this Besikovich space. I really think of these things as pseudo differential operators which are whose symbols are functions of x and z, not of theta and c. Okay, and as usual, you run into this small divisor problem, right? If x is orthogonal to theta or theta is very small, then this thing is very, very big. And so the commutator, the successive commutators may not get smaller. Commutators may not get smaller. And that's one of the main problems with doing the gauge transform. Okay, but if you can do this, then you can write down the spectral function, the spectral projector for a Fourier multiplier. It's very easy because Fourier transform reduces you to a multiplication operator. And of course, then you can write down this is the kernel of the spectral projector. This is the kernel of the spectral projector, and it's done. You have to undo the conjugation by these e to the i phi's, but other than that, you're in business. So, the gauge transform here is built to deal really with periodic problems because if you have a continuum of thetas, then typically they're going to get very close to zero, and getting very close to zero is very bad for you. But if you can make this work, then Work, then you can get your hands on the spectral function. So, this is a very different method of getting your hands on the spectral function from this wave method which I described a moment ago. Okay. So now we want to try to glue these together somehow, right, in sort of a systematic way. And what I want to tell you first, so everything I've said up to this point, by the way, is valid in D dimension. By the way, it is valid in d dimensions, but now I'm going to have to do some things in one dimension, and I'll tell you when that happens. Okay, so the next slide is in D dimension still. And the idea is that the wave method actually lets you say that the spectral function, this local density of states, for two operators, are very close to the same at a point. At a point, if the two operators are very close to the same, in a huge ball, a ball which now depends on the energy. So, how does that work? Well, remember, the wave method was about computing this smooth spectral function. So, okay, I sort of specialize to the case where rho has even, so instead of having an e to the i square root, I have a cosine square root. That's not much of a problem. Much of a problem. And what I'm doing here is I'm smoothing now, but at very, very small scales. So scale one over t. So this thing as t goes to infinity gets very, very close to the delta function. And what's the point? Well, the point is that this cosine of this object has finite speed of propagation. And because it has finite speed of propagation, if you start with something which is physically localized and evolve the equation, it doesn't matter what happens with V outside of a big ball, outside of a ball roughly of radius t. So I can do whatever I want outside a ball of radius t. I can stick in the harmonic oscillator. I can stick in a boundary. I can do whatever I want, no problem. And I won't have changed the spectral function. I won't have changed the spectral function very much. And more precisely, I won't have changed the smooth spectral function at all. So, what we can do then, because, well, this is a crowd of periodic people and it's also very useful, we want to use the gauge transform, is we can use this to replace any potential by one which is periodic. Okay, it'll be periodic on a huge with a huge period. Huge with a huge period, a lambda-dependent period, lambda to the n roughly, but nevertheless, a periodic potential. Okay, so what does that look like on the Fourier transform side? So originally, my Fourier transform can be fairly messy, but certainly it can have things like this. And what I'm doing, roughly speaking, is I'm taking all of the mass of the All of the mass of the Fourier transform in some rectangle like this, and I'm squishing it into a delta function. Okay, and by doing that, I arrive at something periodic. I mean, this is not quite how we do it in the paper, but this is morally what's happening. Okay, and so by doing this, I make a very small change on a big ball, and that's enough to compare the two smooth spectral functions, and then I use some. Functions and then I use some Tauberian theorem to get back to the original thing. Okay, so the moral of the story here is that this wave method can let you make very large perturbations as long as they're very far away. Okay, and then the last thing, sorry, and I should point out again that the lattice here, the periodic lattice is gigantic, right? So these frequencies. So these frequencies are very, very close to the origin. So that's going to be important on the next slide. So I can reduce my problem to a periodic problem, but with a gigantic lattice. Okay, so now we need to deal with the gigantic lattice. So I've reduced my situation to a periodic one, but with a very large period, again, I remind you. Now, I want to do the gauge transform. I want to. Transform. I want to reduce to a Fourier multiplier. And the main issue here is again that if theta is much, much less than one, then this thing is much bigger than one. And so, of course, e to the i psi is very far from the identity. I mean, it's very, very far from the identity. And this sort of successive, this approximation by successive commutators becomes a very common. Of commutators becomes not very useful if you're not careful, right? So, you heard about the weak gauge transform and the strong gauge transform. So, the weak gauge transform says phi tilde itself should be small. The strong gauge transform said the commutator of the Laplacian and phi tilde should be in some sense small, or any successive commutators should be small. This is going to be a version of a strong gauge. Be a version of a strong gauge transform, but we need a bit, we need something more than the standard one. And the hope here is that although this phi tilde is very, very large, it varies quite slowly in X, right? Very slowly in X. And so the hope is that you can use that to improve commutators. And indeed, you can, provided that. Provided that, okay, again, I'm working near x lambda, that's where the energy surface is. So, provided that both v is varying rather slowly, like r, and psi is varying rather slowly, or in this case, v tilde is varying rather slowly, then the commutator is not just gaining a power of lambda inverse, that would be sort of the strong gauge transform, the normal strong gauge transform, but it's gaining r lambda inverse. So, even though this inverse. So even though this phi tilde might be as large as R or R inverse, excuse me, the commutator is nevertheless going to be relatively small. Okay, so this is the thing that you can hope to save you. But in order to do this, it's crucial that dxv be small, so that v varies slowly in the physical variable. Variable. So the question then becomes: how do you work with v's which vary slowly? And the way it works is like this. So we want to peel off layers of the Fourier transform of V. So the trouble is V is USB, or V is periodic and smooth, periodic with a huge lattice. So in general, V, of course, has derivatives which are roughly like one. You don't have Roughly like one. You don't have a small derivatives. You have to work to get there. And the way that goes is like this. Okay, maybe this is too small. So hopefully it's semi-legible. So the idea here is, okay, so this is frequency lambda to the minus a quarter, these two lines. And here are my frequencies of the potential, which are larger than lambda to the minus a quarter. So these are the Fourier transform of the potential. So, these are the Fourier transform of the potential. And the idea is to do what? Well, the idea is to remove layers of the Fourier transform. So I do that by making a gauge transform, which first removes this outer layer, this frequencies above lambda to the minus a quarter. I don't do anything, or I try not to touch as much as possible frequencies which are very small, like lambda to the minus n. And if I do that, And if I do that, remember I'm gaining lambda inverse here, so I can afford to gain, I can afford to lose some power of lambda. I'm only ever working with phi tildes, which are a little bit big, but not really big. And so I can make that process go. I can do the gauge transform. Okay, and what's known, you can do it all together, and you can get rid of all of the frequencies which are bigger than lambda to the minus a quarter. So now, if I'm up here in If I'm up here in this new situation, what do I know about dxv? Well, I know that dxv is like lambda to the minus a quarter, roughly speaking. So now I'm in a position where v is varying slowly in x. So this means now that I can get away again with more growth, more this phi tilde being larger. And so now I can think that I'm going to cut off. Now, I can think that I'm going to cut off, peel another layer. And so, what does that look like? So, again, the first layer is peeling everything here. At this point, dxv is like lambda to the minus a quarter. Then I can do the process again because now I've gained something. And again, I peel away a dyadic layer. So now up here, dxv is like lambda to the minus a half, and so on and so forth. Dxv is like dxv is like lambda to the minus three quarters, et cetera. And the upshot, because v was periodic to begin with, is that, and it's periodic with lattice at scale lambda to the n, that if you do this enough times, finitely many times, eventually you end up with nothing but the frequency zero. Or in other words, eventually you end up with a potential which doesn't depend on x at all. And so now you're in the position where you have a Fourier multiplier and you can compute the spectral function. Okay, there's one additional complication, which is you remember I mentioned that we knew how to compute the spectral function for minus Laplace plus m of d, but what we really wanted was the spectral function for this thing conjugated by some e to the i size. And so we have to undo this layer feeling, and that involves another. Feeling. And that involves another. So we have to sort of grow the onion back. And that involves another sort of step, but it's handleable using semi-standard methods from semi-classical analysis. Now, okay, this is the step. This last step is the thing that works only in one dimension, as far as we can tell at the moment. And that's because I'm really using crucially that I've gotten rid of all the free. That I've gotten rid of all the frequencies here, which are larger than lambda to the minus a quarter, right? All the frequencies. And if I can't do that, then I don't know how to make this onion peeling argument work. Now, there are some directions which we're hoping to go with in higher dimensions, but at the moment, at least, we believe we'll need to make some additional assumptions for the potential. Okay, so I think I will stop there and thank you for listening. Stop there and thank you for listening. Do you have a clear idea of what kind of assumptions are at least naively needed in higher dimension for this question? Okay, so the thing we're thinking about is that the Fourier trans. Fourier transform, okay. Let's stick to the case where the Fourier transform of V is a measure. Then we believe that in some sense, if the measure has at least dimension one, roughly speaking, everywhere, then maybe we can make something work. So, dimension one, in the sense that it sort of assigns measure R to an A. Measure R to an annulus of width R, roughly speaking. Maybe I asked a question. Is there a relation between reducing to a periodic operator and working in the physical state? So, I mean, I don't know how to make this finite speed of profit. Finite speed of propagation argument makes sense on the periodic side. So that's for that. I really need to think about things in the physical space. There may be some way, of course, but I don't know how to do it. But if you cannot reduce it to other case, then you're kind of obliged to witness. So I can't really hear you. I'm sorry. If you cannot, let's say, if you cannot reduce. If you cannot reduce to the periodic case, then in some sense you need to work in the basic order space or the uh no I mean you can make everything you can really work in L in L2 somehow you you can work in the physical space it's not an issue um because okay I I think about all these gauge transforms as solving solving sort of transport equations uh in the physics Equations in the physical domain. So you can think of everything that way. And in fact, somehow we did need to think of things that way in order to sort of get the full class of potentials, not need to make some assumption on the potential like, for example, that the Fourier transform is a measure. So, I mean, you don't really, you're not obliged to go to Vesubovich space, at least I don't think so. One last question for the question for technology. So, in the case where you have the Deutschemat at the very beginning of the customized case where you have automatic, this is also a case where it's called supersymmetry, right? Sorry, I really am having a hard time hearing you. At the beginning of your slides, you have a case where you have no remainders, right? Just the noise that you're. Remainders, right? Just the noise of the mods. It's not that you have no remainders, they're just smaller. Oh, it's smaller. Okay, so here, let me find it for you. Sorry, it's going to take me a little. This is the thing you're talking about. It's not that it's no remainder, it's just a little bit smaller. But in case where there's no remainder, that is what's supposed to be. That is what's supposed to be. Okay, I know of no examples where there's no remainder, but maybe there exists. Okay, okay. Well, thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much for your nice talk.
