Welcome back, everybody. So it's a pleasure to me to introduce Javier Fernando de Gomarida from Bilvao, our last speaker from today, who is going to talk about a community of families with constant real transport. Thank you very much. Well, thank you very much. So I am really pleased by the invitation. By the invitation, but I will not talk about the key multiplicity of families of constant Milner numbers, so I should have updated the abstract. So, we have created some technique to prove a key multiplicity of families for constant Milner number, but I have been talking about this for more than a year, and I see that most of the faces that are present have. That are present have heard the talk. So, what I am going to do is to explain another recent application of the same technique with the same co-author. So, my co-author is Thomas Felka. And now, unless you insist, if you insist, I can talk the usual lecture of the last year, but I think this is a bit more novel. So, let me. More novel. So let me let me talk about Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Calabiyau manifolds and orus agrangium vibrations. Okay, so this is the title, but the technique is the same. So essentially, I'm not cheating too much. I am talking about the same thing. And so this is motivated by By a conjecture by Konsevich and Sogelmann. So there were two approaches to mirror symmetry. One is the Stromenger-Jau Faslov approach to mirror symmetry. So when you have maximal calabillia degeneration, you try to create some Lagrangian vibration that fills most of the many. Most of the manifold. And then there is the homological mirror symmetry approach by Konsevich. And in 2001, Konsevich and Soyelman wrote a very influential paper in which they tried to merge or they tried to build a relation between the two approaches and using this relation, they prove homological mirror symmetry for... They prove homological mirror symmetry for a billion varieties. But the paper has kind of two parts, and one part formulates two very concrete geometric conjectures about maximal calabiote generations. And the second part goes on and proves homological mirror symmetry for abelian varieties. Varieties. I want to focus on the first part on the geometric conjectures. And so I can say that we didn't prove them, but we did something that resembled them. So at least we are able to create Lagrangian vibration and to create some Keller metric in such a way that the Gromov Hausdorff limit is the expected one. Is the expected one. So normally when you have a projective variety, you think of the variety itself and you think it's embedded in Pn. And then in Pn you have a Fubinius to the metric, and you can restrict the Fubinius to the metric to your manifold and the Fubinius to the metric. If you put the J on the right-hand side, it gives a Riemannian metric. So your algebraic variety has a shape. So it has curvature, and you can imagine it as a Riemannian manifold. And usually, when you do algebraic geometry, you never think on the Fubinius-2D metric itself. You think on the class. But on the class of the Fubinius-2D metric, But on the class of the Fubinius-to-Dimetric, you can have many representatives. So you can have another representative. So you can have another Keller class representing the same homology class and two such classes. So it is well known by the DDC lemma. the DDC lemma that they differ by the DDC they disappear by the DDC of a potential. And now you can take another Riemannian metric. You can take this other Riemannian metric and you can try to think what is the shape of the so as a manifold, the Riemannian manifold is, well, it is the same, a smooth manifold. It is the same, a smooth manifold, but it has very different geometric structures. And it is a game that is being played a lot in the recent years. Try to study how the shape of your algebraic variety evolves when you move. Perhaps you can move the class. You can move the class in the ample cone. You can move the representative of the class. Move the representative of the class, or you can even vary the variety in a family. Okay, and now there is a theorem that is very tempting, that tempts you a lot to pick a canonical choice of the Keller class. So if your variety X If your variety x is Calabi-Yau, what means Calabi-Yau? It means that the first gen class of the tangent mandatory of X is zero. Then Yao's proof of the Calabi conjecture, so then Jao's proof of the Calabi conjecture tells that there exists a unique pillar class. There exists a unique color class, but such that class. I will get lag will force me to make many mistakes like this. This is Richie flat. So, this means that if you have a Calabilla manifold, it has a fabric shape. So, it has a unique shape in such a way that the metric is rich flat. And now you can consider the following problem. So, now you consider a family. Let me call X. So you take a family, you parameterize it over a disk. Actually, what is important here is the family over the punctured disk. It is not so important what projective model I use to compactify. You assume that X is Calabia. Is Calabi Yao Calabi Yao Yes, Calabi Yao smooth and yeah, and now you fix. So let's embed this in some Pn and when you embed this in P n, you have some you have a Keller class. And now To us. And now you can pick omega calabaya t. So you pick omega calabia t. This is the unique representative, the unique reaching flat representative of the Representative of the Keller class. And then each of these fibers acquires a shape. So this is a Riemannian manifold. And now a shape that is canonically defined. So let me So, let me put two shapes to this. So, I am going to spend most of the talk in the motivations. I think I will be able to state the theorem and probably I will not be able to say much of the technique, but time is it gives what it gives. So, I can take also Fubinia's study. Each fiber has its own Calabilla representative. Yeah, but I mean you have the Fubini stoimetric and you restrict that to the Fubinius to the metric is not the Calabilla and now you will you will see why. Okay, so I have two geometric shapes and now there is the theory of the the the theory of uh gromov there is the of uh limits of metric spaces so there is a notion that is the gromov house of convergence and so you would like to understand what what is this limit so this limit can be made uh now first you want to see if this limit can exist at all or All. So it could be a point. So imagine that the metric has a smaller and smaller and smaller diameter when t approaches zero. Then this limit is stupid. It is a point. But if the diameter goes to infinity, it is also not very meaningful. So what you do is you rescale. The metric Yeah, but for Gromov Hausdorff convergence, you're interested in diameter more than volume. And volume and diameter doesn't go well in limits. So you rescale the metric so that the diameter is one, or if you want, put bar. You want put bar finite, finite non-zero. Then you have to change the color class. Then you have to change the color class. And so the rescale I put with a bar. And then I can make sense of the limit. So when I put a bar in this class, in this lecture, I mean rescaled. And often I will forget to put the bar. But you can try to compute. But you can try to compute the shape of this limit. And Konsevich and Seuberman conjecture concerns the shape of this limit and the existence of a certain Lagrangian vibration. But in order to motivate the conjecture, let me try to explain what you expect to see here. Okay? So imagine, and you can always imagine. And you can always imagine this: that your family has a central fiber that is a strict normal crossings. So, in the central fiber, what you are going to see is some variety with singularities. And I think I better picture something like this. Let me picture some realistic example. And this is. And this is P1, this is P1, and this is P1. And this, you is better to picture this example, therefore, like this. And what is this example? This example is xyz plus t x cube plus y cube plus z cube. into two and this depends on t is the is the is the elliptic curve degeneration and it is Calabio uh well now notice that the Fubinius 2d metric exists in radius zero so it is easy to to to guess that what you see in the grom of house dark limit is just the central fiber so in the central fiber so in the grom of housdorit So, in the Gromov House Door limit, you see your model is highly unique. So, it will depend a lot on the model that you pick. And it has some singularities. Well, let me state Konsevich and Seugelmann conjecture. Uh-huh. So this is a conjectureman, but more or less at the same time, Gross and Wilson stated the conjecture and proved it for the generations of. proved it for the the generations of Calabilla surfaces, of K3 surfaces. So it says that the limit when t approaches zero of X T omega T bar J is some compact topological space. With some metrics, some distance functions that have the following properties. So that compact topological space contains a very big set, which is a Riemannian manifold. So, this distance function comes from a Riemannian metric. And what means big means that the house of God I mentioned so means big means that complement has gotimension two. Hasco dimension too. But this y is a manifold that has an integral affine structure. So, what means an integral affine structure? It means a flat connection such that Flat connection such that the holonomy is in SLDC. But it also means that you can make coordinate patches in such a way that the changes of coordinates are integral affine matrices. So this means that it is a very tight structure. And when you have an integral affine structure locally, you can give You can give so for the for the calabio, for the limit the autonomy is in the SU. So before the limit, the autonomy of the galavier are SU. Then in the limit, you have this. Yes, but this is a Riemannian manifold. So let's say this is complex dimension n. So let me write real dimension 2n. dimension 2n this Riemannian manifold is of real dimension n so this is a very it's a very sharp difference of what you see here here the limit has real dimension 2n but if you take the column the rescue calabiometric the limit should have real half real dimension okay and this and yeah and and integral affine structure gives you some Gives you some system of coordinates that is unique up to a fine change of coordinate. Okay, and now you can say something very specific, very specific. So the metric GI locally has a potential. So the metric Gi locally can be written as the Hessian. So this would be. So, this would be. So, if you write your metric in terms of an affine system of coordinates, it has a potential, means there is a smooth function such that you can write the metric as the Hessian of the smooth function, which is a miracle. But there is even another miracle is that the determinant. Is constant. And this is a difficult PD. This is called a real Monsan-Perequi. Okay. Well, this is this is the structure. This is the structure that the Gromov household limit should have, according to Konsovich and Sauermann. But now you see that there is a big collapse. So you have a manifold that has dimension 2n, and then at the limit, you see some manifold of real dimension n. So what is being collapsed? So, and now so there is a conjecture too. So, there is a conjecture two. So, this is conjecture one in Konsevich and Seuermann. And in conjecture two, I will not state the conjecture in full terms because this could take the rest of the talk and a little bit more. But I can state what is the message of the conjecture. Conjecture? And it is well explained in the original paper if you want to have a look. The conjecture 2 means that if you have, so how I have called the fiber, x means that x t x t is a smooth manifold, but let me use the same notation that they use. Splits in two parts. And this does not mean singular set. It will mean the singular set of some conjectural vibration. And XT admits a vibration over Eurafan manifold. So this is a So, this is a fibration whose fibers are Lagrangian tori. So, tori means S1. And now, to which dimension you have to put, you have to put dimension n, because y has half dimension. So, the fiber needs to be half-dimension. So, they are Lagrangian tori and they're Lagrangian. So they are Lagrangian Tori, and they are Lagrangian for which form? For omega calabilla. So the fibers need to be Lagrangian Tori. And moreover, if you take the limit when T approaches zero of the volume and you divide by the total volume. And you divide by the total volume. This limit is one. So in volume, and I am not completely sure that this was stated by Konsevic and Sojourban, but this is so this conjecture has been revisited by many authors. So some authors want this. And I want to state it because it conveys the geometric meaning of the conjecture. meaning of the conjecture very well. So the conjecture tells that most of your manifold is something like this. So you have some space, why? Y? Y bar. And you have a bad set. And that bad set, let's say, is of local dimension. On top, you have your Calabio manifold. And for each point here, you have a Lagrangian torus. Here you have a Lagrangian torus. So you have Lagrangian torus, except some bad fibers. Okay? And the place where you have Lagrangian torus tends to fill most of the volume of the manifold. So this means that the Konsevichan-Seuberman conjecture gives a very good structure theorem for a Calabio manifold. So it is a torus vibration. So, and now I am going to state what we were able to prove. What we were able to prove. So we did not prove this conjecture, but we did something that we believe is not trivial. So let's see if you find it trivial. We don't know. So we have to tell it to people because we are new in this topic. Yes. What shape do you get? What's the limit? The limit, what is y is a sphere. Y bar is a sphere in that case. In fact, there are also conjectures on what the limit should be. So why some people Some people conjecture that if the Calabio Merifold has the simplest possible topology, means that some betting numbers are zero, then the limit must be a sphere. But this is unproven. Okay, so now I have to state theorem 1-1 in our paper. So one of the difficulties of this conjecture. One of the difficulties of this conjecture is that it is very hard to touch the Calabi-Au form, because to touch the Calabi-Au form, you have to solve partial PD. But so when you have something that you know is that the calabia form is the form. Is the Fouvinius to the form plus DDC of a potential? Okay, so what we have asked ourselves is if we can create some omega, let's say fake that is Fubinius 2D plus DDC of a potential. Of a potential that satisfies the conjecture. So, this is the problem. Well, this is a problem that we never posed to each other, but it was the opposite. So, we did some technique to solve the Sarisky conjecturing family. And that technique, well, it didn't produce such a potential, but we noticed that we improved the technique a little bit. Improve the technique a little bit, we could produce a potential that was creating some Lagrangian tori. So we were seeing Lagrangian tori very easily. So we didn't know how large would be the space that we would fill by tori, but we clearly saw some Lagrangian tori. And then this came to the question whether we can create a potential inside. A potential in such that this such that this omega fake T has all the properties. And all the properties means to read these two blackboards and try to satisfy everything step by step. And the short answer is that we succeeded with some little modification. Little modification of the base of the vibration. But as an extra bonus, we can identify very well what is y-bar. So y-bar is something that is called the essential skeleton of the central fiber. So now I am going to explain. So now you should know how much time do I have because I am speaking half an hour. Speak half an hour. So, before I enter into details, I want to say that to create a potential is not so easy. So, what you have to do to create a potential, so you have to write a smooth function. So, if you write a smooth function, you can say, I take a smooth function and I ask myself if this is a positive. If this is a potential, and how do I check if this is a potential? Well, this must be a Riemannian metric. So this must be positive. And now we know that this is positive. But if you write a function, so you, well, you will know that this is positive. You will know that this is positive if the function is strictly plurisubharmonic. Or you know that it will be semi-positive if it is plurisubharmonic. But by maximum principle, the only plurisubharmonic function that you can write in a compact manifold is constant. And if it is constant, you will not modify the metric at all. So if you want to change the shape of the manifold in the limit, The shape of the manifold in the limit in some areas you have to write down a function that is going to be negative, and this negativity needs to be compensated with the Fouvinius to the positivity. And this is hard because you have to detect how positive is the Fouvinius to the metric at some point. And so, creating a potential that gives you the geometric properties that you want, if you try, at least if we try. If you try, at least if we tried, it would be very hard. But it was given to us by another problem. So now I want to explain a little bit what the limit will be. Okay, so let's go back to let's go back to this. Let's go back to this situation and introduce what is the dual complex. So you write x0, which is the central fiber, a sum of m i di. Okay, and I also want to write the canonical divisor. Let me write the canonical device for in the whole x. This is going to be OX of sum of AI DI for some coefficient. So this is just the total transform. And now another Calabilla condition tells you that the canonical device is supported in the center because it is zero in the fibers. And now this AI. And now, this AI, this AI, so you can assume the minimum of the AI is zero. And this you assume multiplying the canonical divisor by a metamorphic function in the disk. So we will assume this. So we will assume this. And now I am going to take a so and I want to count how many divisors I have. So I have n big n divisors. And now you take the simplex. You take the simplex of dimension n. You take the simplex of dimension n. So you take the simplex with n vertexes. And vertexes, and now I want to take a simplicial complex that is definite inside the simplex. So I define xi as the intersection when i belongs to i of the device or the i. Okay, and if xi is not empty, Is not empty, then I take the convex whole of the vertexes represented by the device or the i. So each of the vertexes is represented by one device. Okay, so each time that I have a non-empty DI intersection, I put that phase. And this gives us simplicial complex, which is a sub-complex of this simplex. And that simplicial complex is the Simplicial complex is the so is the dual polyhedron. And so let me call it like this: dual polyhedron of x0. This is delta to the power n. This is the dual polyhedron. This is the dual polyhedron, and I want to, and the usual simplex, delta n, is in here. delta n is in r actually let me do it from zero because it is otherwise it's not of dimension n is in r n plus one and i can put coordinates omega one omega omega zero omega n so let me take a usual system of coordinates and let me let me put a Riemannian metric in I can metric in I can put the Riemannian metric g is sum of the wi squared. By the way this simplex is defined by the question sum of wi equal one. Okay, this is the definition of the simplex. And now in this way I have given a Riemannian metric to each phase of the simplex. So therefore the dual polyhedron has a Riemannian metric. And now I want to define something even smaller that Find something even smaller that is called the essential skeleton. Essential skeleton of your degeneration x. So for this, I need more than x, I need x0. So I say that xi is essential if or all i belong belonging to. I belonging to I, this discrepancy is the minimal one. And well, I have, and now the essential skeleton is defined in the same way. So you take the phases associated to essential XIs. So it's even smaller. Okay? Well, it is general. Well, it is general theory that the essential skeleton does not depend on the model. So you can blow up further, but the essential skeleton will always be the same. And now I want to say more. A simplicial model has an affine structure. It is a linear subspace of some affine space. And so each of the phases. That affine structure also does not depend on the model. So, the essential skeleton, the essential skeleton has at least a piecewise affine structure when you restrict to each phase. And that piecewise affine structure does not depend on the model. And one of the possible, so all this depends on many authors. So colour. Colar indicates su okay, and and it's a chapter in minimal model program and also a little bit of Berkovich geometry. But it's very good for us. And now I can tell you that in our case, y bar is going to be the essential skeleton. So in our in our solution, So, in our solution, y bar is going to be the essential skeleton. Well, you see an integral affine structure, and the metric is it has a potential. What is the potential? The potential is k. Here is the potential. So, um the determinant is constant. The determinant is constant. So, once we prove that the Gromov Hausdorff limit is SK together with this metric, parts B, C, and D of the conjecture will be granted. This is the definition that's related to this effect. No, no, no, this is now it is. Well, no, no, no, this is now it is a definition. I decide to take the standard metric in Rn, and I do have to prove, and this is the content of our paper, that I can find a family of potentials in such a way that the Gromov Hausdorff limit is going to be this. And now I state it. But before I state it, I want to explain something else. I want to explain what is the I want to explain what is the expanded dual complex. So we have a notion that is dual complex. Now I want to say what is the expanded dual complex. And let me do it in this example. Okay, so what is the dual complex? The dual complex is the following. You put a vertex for each divisor, and when two divisors meet in a point, you put a face. In this example, the expanded dual complex is the following. Let me separate these faces and I pin this in pink. Let me Pink. Let me join them by some intervals. So this is what we call expanded essential skeleton. In this example, this is the essential skeleton. Skeleton. And the expanded essential skeleton keeps the topology, but it puts some interpolating piece to join the vertices. So what is the general construction of the expanded essential skeleton? So the expanded essential skeleton is a construction that you do in codimension two. But let me say, imagine that the essential skeleton would be this state. That the essential skeleton would be this tetrahedron. Then, what I can do is to put each of the triangles of the tetrahedron separated from each other. So, I would like to put. And now you put some interpolating band. So, you take the maximal phases. So, you take the maximal phases. I want to say a bit more information on essential skeleton. So, work of these authors tells that the essential skeleton is a pseudo-manifold. It's a pseudo-manifold. And now you need to understand, I didn't define what is maximal calaball degeneration. So, I only said calaball degeneration. All these words for maximal calaball degeneration. What means maximal Degeneration. What means maximal calories of the generation? A general theorem tells you that if you take the nilpotent part of the monodromy, the Jordan blocks of the monodromy has size at most the dimension of your manifold. A maximal calabio degeneration is a calabio degeneration such that there is a block of size n. Okay? And there are two equivalent formulations. One formulation is in terms of the logarithmic expansion of the volume when Q approaches zero. So you can expand the volume in a series that involves powers of t and powers of the logarithm of t. And well, the maximal power of the logarithm of t is an invariant that does not depend on the model. And maximal calabillau means that the Maximal Calabilla means that you get the maximal possible power, but there is another interpretation. And the interpretation is that the dimension of the essential skeleton is the complex dimension of your manifold. So these are three equivalent conditions, and we are going to exploit this. So we are taking a maximal Calabio degeneration. What is expanded dual complex? Generation: What is expanded dual complex? So, you take maximal phases, you put them apart, and if they intersect by a submaximal phase, you multiply that submaximal phase by an interval and glue in that way. So, glue in that way and glue glue this glues with this and this glues with this. So, you create some holes. I think I was not completely. So, you have to create some. So, if you want to understand this better, what you do is to cut with planes here. So, you create something like this. You create the same here. And now you cut like this and you create some kind of truncated complex. But we don't want to lose a space. But we don't want to lose space, so we expand it so we feel the original phases. Okay, but there is a notion of expanded dual complex, and the expanded dual complex is going to be the base of our vibration. So, what is our theorem? So, now let me let me change this into a theorem. Let me change this into a theorem. Well, there exist some omega t that we can write. Such that this is essential skeleton. This is essential skeleton. Okay. And now I don't need to say much more. So this is piecewise. So we are working in giving a natural piecewise, a natural interal affine structure. So the idea is the following. When you see Following. When you see like this, two planes like this, you unfold, put them straight, and then you can continue your integral affine structure. So let me not say too much about integral affine structure in the whole essential skeleton. I want to say about piecewise. By the way, the essential skeleton. This is this the essential skeleton is a manifold in co-dimension two because it's a pseudo-manifold. So, actually, you see that this is a topological manifold. In this corner, this is a topological manifold. And I even told you a phase of so this follows this philosophy. There is a bad set that is called three. Otherwise, it is a manifold. The integral affine structure by now is piecewise, but this is a work in progress. progress and the Montsen-Pere equation the metric is a potential and it satisfies the complex Monsamper equation. So the real Monson-Pere equation. So this is something that happens. And now I want to speak about conjecture two because we also have a version for this conjecture two. Uh-huh. I think let me call it, let's say, fake canabiyam. Yeah. And now I'm going to explain you why it is fake, why it can't be a good approximation to the Calabi geometric. But still we have the same situation so let me let me denote SK bar expanded dual complex. And now I want to convince you that the expanded dual complex is a good substitute of something of co-dimension 2 in the essential skeleton. And I want to And I want to convince you by looking at this picture. So, what I have to remove of the essential skeleton to create the expanded dual complex, I have to remove some vertices. I only have to make holes in codimension two. And then I do some very innocent modification. So, if I have a Lagrangian vibration on top of the expanded dual complex, if I define a non-canonical isomorphism, I would have so there is. have so there is there is a there is a homeomorphism from the spanded dual complex to the dual complex minus minus co-dimension two phases so if i have if i if i have a lagrangian vibration over an expanded over the expanded dual complex then i do have a lagrangian vibration over the the co-dimension a co-dimension um over the dual complex except a co-dimension two subset Except a co-dimensional two subset, as Konsevich and Schuylermann expect. But we insist in writing expanded dual complex because we feel that it is more natural. Well, we have such a vibration. Fibers are Lagrangian for which form for our omega t. Fake, so this fits exactly like in Koncevich and Seuermann conjecture. And now there is this thing. There is this thing. And now it is at this moment that I am going to tell you what is the partial differential equation that the Calabillao form satisfies. The partial differential equation is the complex Monson-Pere equation. The complex Monsanto equation is omega Calabi Yau to the power n is equal to C omega which omega bar, where big omega is the Calabia form. And C is a constant. This is the way that Yao resolved the Calabi problem. He started with some omega, let's say Fubinius 2D, then he writes DDC. And DDC is some constant del del bar. Well, you know it, d dc. D D C Pi, you put to the power n, and then you put C omega wedge omega bar. And now, if you look at this equation, this is God-given, this is the Calabi-Jau form, this is the Fubinius-Tudimmetric, this is the indeterminate, and this is a elliptic PD of order two, a non-linear PD elliptic PD of order two. And what Yao did was to solve this elliptic PD. And well, the fact that the solution was unique was already known by Yao. Solution was unique, was already known by Calabi, but he showed existence. And this is omega Calabi Yau. So, what is important is that omega Calabi Yau to the power n is a constant times big omega h omega bar. So, I can reformulate this equation by writing omega wedge omega bar. You write omega wedge omega bar because the constant goes. Bar because the constant goes off in both sides, and you have this limit equal to one. This is one way of writing. And this is a good way of writing because it says that the Lagrangian vibration fills most of the volume with respect to the Calabio volume. So in order to know the Calabio volume, you don't need to know the Calabio form. So you don't have to take the Calabio form to the power n. You only need to know the complex n. The complex n form because you have the complex motion per equation. Well, this is a part of our theorem if I formulate it like this. So, the vibration is Lagrangian for our form, but the vibration fills most of the volume. Fills most of the volume for the Calabio volume. It would be very unsatisfying that it fills most of the volume for the fake Calabio 4 because this is chosen by us. So it fills most of the volume by the thing that is chosen by God. And well, why the metric should be called fake? Because our Lagrangian vibration does not fill the volume. So our Our form does not satisfy even asymptotically the complex motion per equation. So, one could say these guys have found some asymptotic solution to, but we didn't. And the reason why we didn't is now looking at this example is very interesting. So, what the FUBA. So, what the Fubini S2D metric does, the Fubini S2D metric puts the volume on the devices. And here it puts no volume. So what the Calabi-Yau form does, the Calabi-Jau form has the volume concentrated in these corners. So if you take the limit of the Calabi-Au form, if you take the limit of the Calabio volume, when Of the Calabio volume. When t approaches zero, in this picture, what you get is an atomic measure that is supported in the corners. So let's use this combined picture. This combined picture appears in the work of Thomas and me and is the radial part of something that is called the Acampo space. If you take the Calabio form, what you get is symmetric. What you get is a metric. So, what you get is a measure that is concentrated in these edges. So, each of these vertices is substituted by an edge in the essential skeleton. And the calabiao volume gives a measure that is evenly distributed here. Now, if you think in the limit of the Calabi-Au measure, in this limit, it distributes. In this limit, it distributes the measure here, but it puts measure zero here. And now what is going to be the volume of our form? The volume of our form is a Radon measure in the whole expanded essential skeleton. So it's something that, so we are not yet there. Not yet there. So if you want to pass from the Fubini studi to the Calabi Yao, you want to take all the volume, all this white volume, and pass it to pink volume. So what we were able was to take part and pass it in such a way we get a radon measure. And if we want to continue the program and succeed, and this is something that we don't know how to do now, but we now suspect that we cannot avoid PDE. That we cannot have about PDE, so we are very frightened. So you have to still decrease more volume in the white part until you put all the volume in the pink part, like the Calabio metric does. And problem over time, even like three minutes. Three minutes. So the three minutes, there is no chance of explaining the technique. So I think I'll stop. I'll stop. Thank you very much. Any questions or comments? Can you say something about the dish? So So skeleton? Yes, when but this is not proven by us. This is studied widely. The problem is that I don't remember the condition. So you have to put, so for example, you shouldn't regard an abilion variety as a calabillo. You want to put the ban, you need to put the vanishing of heart. To put the vanishing of some Hodge numbers, and when you put the vanishing of those Hodge numbers, then the essential skeleton has the rational homology of a point. And even, so there is work of many authors, Colar, the Fernix, and in low dimensions, not only the homology, but even it is known that it's a topological sphere. And in dimension three, you don't know that it is a topological sphere, but I think it's integral homology. But I think it's integral homology sphere, or even you know things about the fundamental group, and I think higher dimension, but I don't know the current state. But I know that people have looked at this, and this is an active question. Thank you. Any other question? I actually do have a question. So, you mentioned that there are some results for these conjectures in the case of abelian varieties and the K-trees. Abelian varieties and the K-3 surfaces. The case of abelian varieties is homological mirrorsymetry. Homological mirror symmetry. I see. So I was wondering if there is some kind of result in the case of hyperkiller manifolds. I don't know. If we can discuss, because we are also new. So we came to this problem because we saw that we could do something, but not because we know the literature and know exhaustively. So I don't know. So, I don't know. I also did a note. There is a question about that. Sorry the word dual makes me think of a duality that you can go from one to the other or something. A vertex corresponds to a divisor. And now, when you have a face, this is the maximal intersection. So you see it here. So, okay, can you see a duality? If you accept that the pink triangle is dual to the white one, this is. Triangle is dual to the white one. This is the reason of the name. So, maybe we can thank again Javier for his talk. Thank you.
