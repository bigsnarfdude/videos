Josh Shelton Both will be talking about the instability and time revolution of water waves with vorticity and point windows. So I wrote this title before I had actually made the presentation. So I'm just going to begin by outlining the structure of this talk, of which only one bullet point which corresponds to one slide is going to reflect the actual title. So I'm going to start by just talking about steadily travelling gravity capillary waves. Both numerical solutions of Both numerical solutions of these and also asymptotic solutions that are valid in the small surface tension limits. And then I'm going to extend this to consider problems with both constant vorticity and point vortices within the domain. And I'm going to develop a time-dependent formulation for these and then also study these numerically with surface tension in as well. So the starting point for both of these sections of the talk is just Of these sections of the talk is just the Euler equations within the fluid domain and then dynamic and kinematic boundary conditions at the surface. And here, gravity enters the formulation through the Euler equations and capillarity enters in through the boundary condition. And I've made some assumptions here. Firstly, it's two-dimensional, and I've also neglected the effect of viscosity. And then we want. And then we want to solve for the location of the fluid surface as well as the internal velocity field. Although, numerically, I'm going to be simplifying this formulation before solving it. And then the domain here is dimensional, but on all subsequent slides, I'm going to consider the non-dimensional problem for which lengths are just non-dimensionalised with the assumed periods of the wave. So I'm going to start by considering just steadily travelling gravity capillary waves. Steadily travelling gravity capillary waves. Experimentally, steep surface waves are seen to contain highly oscillatory ripples ahead of the wave crust. So this is really the motivation for the work that I'm doing here. And I'm going to make an additional assumption in that I'm just going to neglect the effects of vorticity to begin with and assume that the solutions are steady in a co-moving frame. So this just yields a two-dimensional Yields a two-dimensional non-dimensional boundary value problem for the rays. So, I'm not going to tell you how I'm solving this numerically, but you can just pretend you're using your own favourite method for this. But I actually just use a conformal mapping method to solve for surface variables with a spectral approach. So this is just the formulation I'm going to be solving. It's non-dimensional and it contains two parameters, which are the bond number b and the food number f. So here, sigma is the constant coefficient of service tension. Is the constant coefficient of surface tension, rho is a fluid density, g is a gravitational constant, lambda is the wavelength, and c is the wave speed. And when I've solved for these solutions, I'm going to fix an amplitude condition and then find the food number f as an unknown of the problem. So the amplitude I'm going to consider is just going to be an energetic condition, which is a time-conserved quantity. For steady solutions, it's not too important there's a time-conserved quantity. Not too important that it's a time-conserved quantity, but it's nice when you start to study the instability of them. So, just as an example, before we introduce the effect of surface tension, I'm just going to show you some plots of surface gravity waves. This is a small amplitude one. That did not play. Wait for it. This is what happens when you use a Mac, but you can imagine that this happens. But you can imagine that this amplitude is getting progressively larger in real time, and it eventually reaches a maximum amplitude, which gets pointed. And numerically, when I fix the amplitude of the wave, I'm just going to select essentially one of these as the leading order solution in the numerical solution space. And I'm just going to pick an amplitude or a wave energy that essentially has half the amplitude of the limiting Stokes wave. Of the limiting Stokes wave. So I'm still going to be in a fairly or very non-linear regime. So in the service tension and essentially wave speed solution space, there is one solution when the service tension is equal to zero because I fix an amplitude condition. One can then search for numerical solutions with non-zero surface tension. And you find that this bifurcation structure emerges that accumulates. That accumulates as you take the small surface tension limit of b to zero. And I can only numerically compute a finite number of these, so I stopped at a certain value. This is just the location of the solutions. Now I'm going to show you the solution profiles. At the top, in solutions A, B and C, they look very much like the leading order gravity wave, but with some oscillatory ripples in the With some oscillatory ripples in the domain. And then along the lower parts of these solution branches, the solutions are very highly oscillatory. And this continues to occur in the small surface tension limit if you were to continue to compute these solution profiles. And the asymptotic design I'm going to show later corresponds more to the solutions at the top, which are standard perturbation expansion about this leading order gravity wave. This leading order gravity wave. The others are more of a multiple scales approach, which I'm not going to consider further. So, this is just the oval bifurcation picture. I'm just going to focus on one of the branches, just to show you what happens as you transverse along. So, at the bottom right, in solution G, we have a highly asymmetry profile with maybe 10 pickles in the domain. The energy is fixed, so as you move up the right of the solution branch, the amplitude of the The amplitude of the oscillatory apples decreases, but then you gain more gravitational energy because the gravity wave amplitude increases. As you move across the top of the solution branch, it looks reasonably similar, except an extra wavelength of ripple has been generated, such that when you move down to the bottom left of the solution branch, you again recover a highly oscillatory profile, but with an extra ripple. And this just keeps repeating to the point at which you can essentially. To the point at which you can eventually just generate an oscillatory profile with, say, n peaks in the domain. So this is the numerical studies that I've computed. There have been people who have studied these in the past, but with slightly different amplitude conditions. And you might be able to spot an issue with these amplitude conditions before I explain it. Conditions before I explain it. So, some early studies from about 50 years ago fixed conditions such as the coefficient of a cosine profile in the Fourier series expansion, or just the difference between the wave crest and the assumed wave trough. And just as an example, this is a bifurcation diagram obtained by Schwartz and van der Brock when the assumed wave displacement was fixed. Wave displacement was fixed to a non-zero value. But there's some issues that emerge from this bifurcation, if you were to try and capture it, in that these highly acidic profiles have a first flow coefficient, which is zero, and this assumed wave height, which is the difference between the value at the center and the end, can actually be zero. So that is, if you fix either of these amplitude conditions to a non-zero constant when trying to derive the solution space, Trying to derive the solution space, you can't really capture these bifurcations between adjacent branches, and that just made it very difficult for previous authors to obtain this full structure. So this is just one of the main challenges that previous people faced. It was more the assumed amplitude that was fixed to a non-zero boundary. These types of solutions appear in many other mathematical formulations of the Euler equations. You can have Have time dependence, vorticity, extremely high amplitude, or even solitary waves instead of a periodic profile. Of which I've considered a few of them. So I'm now just going to talk about the asymptotic theory that I've developed that describes this regime. So we want to find solutions in the limit of small surface tension. Small surface tension, so you might just start by assuming the solution takes the form of an asymptotic expansion. But then, when you actually measure the amplitude of the capillary ripples, it's not algebraic, but rather it's exponentially small. And this poses a difficulty in that the amplitude and the classification of the ripples is actually exponentially subdominant with respect to the main expansion. So you really have to use some fairly advanced techniques to actually be able to derive them. To actually be able to derive them. And you need to understand singularities in the analytic continuation of the leading-order solution, asymptotic divergence, as well as the Stokes Manor. So I'm going to describe this, but I'm going to save you the pain of describing it for the real problem, and I'm just going to show a toy problem for generalized solitary weights, where you can think of epsilon as just being a small surface tension parameter. So here, this is just a second-order ODE with a forcing term, and there's a behavioural condition. Term and there's a behavioural condition which is just going to dictate the bikes. So there's a few steps. The first step is to just expand in the limit of small epsilon. So this is all just formal asymptotics. This step is fairly simple. You just get a series of equations. The second step is then to study the divergence of the nth order solution in the expansion. This doesn't give you the oscillatory ripples, but it's a step required to resolve. It's a step required to resolve that. And essentially, the leading-order solution here is such. It's got a singularity in the analytic continuation, whether it's got a countably infinite number of them. I'm just going to focus on one, which is why I've replaced x by z. And because subsequent orders of the expansion rely on differentiation of previous orders, the singularity grows in strength, which is why you get singularity to the power of m. And also, To the power of m. And also, because you're differentiating the previous term in the expansion multiple times, you're differentiating a singularity to a large power, so you keep getting n's, n plus 1's, n plus 2s, and n plus 3's, and so forth coming down as coefficients, which leads to factorial divergence. So, this is an intermediary step. It doesn't really make sense at the moment, but when you go to the third step in which you want to study the remainder to a Study the remainder to a truncated expansion to obtain the exponentially small components, the equation that governs the remainder is just forced by the late orders of the solution expansion. So I'm not actually resolving it here, but the particular solution of that equation will contain the Stokes phenomenon and will also contain the highly oscillatory component of the desired solution. So these are just some of the three steps. You can imagine there's a few different Some of the three steps. You can imagine there's a few difficulties that arise when you try and do this for the full water rate problem. One of which is we don't have an exact solution for a non-linear gravity wave. The second is we have to find singularities of that non-linear gravity wave in the analytic continuation. And there's more as well. So I'm just going to tell you the result of the asymptotic theorem. And here I've just reformulated it in a Q-theta formulation, just for simple. Q-theta formulation just for simplicity. Q is the speed of a streamline on the flea surface, and theta is the angle. So this is just a boundary interval formulation. And the explicit asymptotic solution for the ripples contains the exponential scaling for small bond number. It involves integration of the leading order solution from a complex valued singularity. It then contains the amplitude function, which modulates the bipple. Function which modulates the bipples across the domain. That contains a few more junk terms from the early orders of the expansion. And then it also contains a Stokes phenomenon, which I've just written here as a composite solution, which is valid both in the outer domain and within boundary layers near the crest where the Stokes phenomenon occurs. So this is just an explicit asymptotic solution, but it's not too helpful yet because you still have. Not too helpful yet because you still have to just plug in the numerical values for all of these terms to actually get to compute it. Another interesting thing that happens is that there's essentially an insolvability condition, or rather this function in the denominator can be zero. And this just turns out to happen at all these points between adjacent branches of solutions where perturbation solutions were non-existent. So I've called this an insolvability condition. I've called this an insolvability condition. It's actually not an insolvubility condition. It's more just a sign that the asymptotic series is reordering as you go down at this point, and it's meant to be a multiple scale situation. So this is just the result of the asymptotic theorem. Now I'm going to go on to the problem with vorticity and vortices within the domain, as promised by my earlier title. My earlier title. So I've just re-shown here the governing system of equations, the Euler equations, as well as kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions at the surface. And I'm going to just perform a Helmholtz decomposition to investigate surface wave formulations with different types of vorticity. Because it's two-dimensional, the vector potential A just has one non-zero component, and you can just specify. And you can just specify it to be whatever you want. So I'm going to be specifying A and then formulating the problem for an assumed background vorticity. So the simplest thing you can do is just set A is equal to zero, in which case the vorticity omega is also zero, and the velocity field is just given by the gradient of the potential. You can also consider a linear shear flow, which gives a constant vorticity, and you can also consider point vorticity. And you can also consider point vortices within the domain. So, for point vortices, they don't contribute to the vorticity field, but rather you just extract out a single component of the velocity potential, and then just follow through with the derivation of a Bernoulli equation from the Euler equations with that decomposition. And really, the goal of this study is to be able to study the instability of known exact solutions. Of known exact solutions to this formulation, of which many have recently been obtained. And these have both vortices within the fluid domain as well as background fluid vorticity. But these are known exact solutions that are steady, and the stability is just not commonly known. So I'm now just going to talk about the formulation that involves a single point vortex within the periodic dimension. Point vortex within the periodic domain. And just for simplicity, I'm just going to do it in complex-valued coordinates. So the effect of a single point vortex, the complex velocity, is just given there. But this is actually a periodic domain, so there's an infinite world of vortices. So you have to consider an infinite sum of these. But luckily, there's a very nice expression for this infinite sum, which just simplifies to a single analytical term. So, this is the decomposition that I'm essentially going to be using for the velocity field. It's got an irrotational part and then a component associated with n vortices within the periodic domain. It looks a bit ugly, but that's just because I took the previous expression on the previous slide and separated it into r real and imaginary components. Real and imaginary components. And ultimately, you can now just go through and derive evolution equations for the vortices. These are just ODEs for each vortex, and they're just influenced by the background velocity field from the function phi and all the other vortices. And you can also just derive kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions. These super. These superficially look a bit uglier than they actually are. So, this is really just the governing system you obtain when you use this decomposition and derive the result of boundary value problem. So, this is the one slide in my presentation that actually relates to my title. And ultimately, you can solve this by using your favorite numerical method. I've just been conformally mapping this to then solve for solutions along. This to then solve for solutions along the surface for which these equations for each vortex can still be found by just analytically continuing the quantities within the fluid. Next slide. Exactly what I just said. I'll note two subtleties. One I just noted, which is that if you're trying to solve for values along the surface only, you have to think a little bit about how to satisfy evolution equations. About how to satisfy evolution equations within the fluid. The other subtlety is with regards to subharmonic instabilities. Because this decomposition I've used assumes that each vortex in the infinite row has exactly the same displacement with respect to one another. So for modulational instabilities, you have to slightly change the initial decomposition to allow multiple vortices in the infinite row to be able to vary independently with respect to one another. But that can also just be. With respect to one another. So that can also just be done. So this is the time-dependent formulation. I'm now just going to talk about steadily traveling solutions with surface tension as well. So here I'm only going to have surface tension, and in one, there's going to be constant vorticity, in the other there's going to be a single point vortex. So I'm just going to show you a plethora of numerical solutions. So for the linear shear flow, you can just obtain a boundary value problem which contains A boundary value problem which contains the effects of surface tension and constant vorticity. And it contains a non-dimensional, that's either a Weber or an inverse Weber number, and a non-dimensional shear. There's also the formulation for the point vortex, which I've neglected to write on the page because it's not very nice. But this contains a Weber number as well as a non-dimensional circulation. And the reason I focus on both of these formulations is. I focus on both of these formulations is because, in the absence of surface tension, they both have exactly the same exact solution. One is just essentially the Crapper profile for a constant vorticity flow, the other is just a Crapper profile for a waterway with a single vortex in the domain. But it's interesting to understand how these exact solutions change when you start to introduce surface tension into the formulation. Tension into the formulation. And I'm going to show you some numerical plots. And I'm just going to fix an amplitude condition and then treat the vorticity parameter as an unknown. And just to show you how the value of this amplitude condition relates to the constant in the Crapper solution, I'm going to show you some solutions that are non-linear but not quite overturning, and then very non-linear. And then very non-linear and also significantly overturning. So I'm going to begin with the slightly smaller amplitude solutions. You can find solution branches that exist at a small service tension limit for both of these regimes. And the bifurcation pictures look very different, but the actual solutions associated with them are very, very similar. They differ by about 10 to the minus 5. And I'll And I'll start in the bottom right as an example. So solutions B3 and B6 are essentially just perturbations of the leading order Krappen wave with small ripples. Solutions B2, B5, and B1, B4, they have much larger amplitude ripples. And these ones are a bit strange because here this is essentially a A well, I'll start with that one. This is essentially a constant vorticity crapper wave with pure capillary waves riding on top of it. So this is just crapper waves travelling upon crapper waves, which is a bit weird. Hopefully they're unstable because you're never going to see this in real life. These are ones which are non-linear but still not extreme amplitudes. You can then go to even higher amplitudes. I'm just going to show you these on a single solution. Going to show you these on a single solution branch. And just note, I've ended the solution branch when the solutions become self-intersecting. You can go beyond that if you wish, and then adjacent solution branches actually connect. So these are solution branches for two very non-linear solutions. And I've actually overlaid both the solutions for a linear shear and a point vortex on top of one another here, but they're so similar, you can't distinguish them. And once again, these are very similar. It's essentially These are very similar. It's essentially a crapper wave with oscillatory capillary components on it. But the capillary components just influences the location at which self-interception occurs. And this occurs in different places depending on which branches you want in the domain. So these are just a lot of numerical plots. So, really, the main takeaway here is that for non-zero service tension, the solutions Surface tension, the solutions are very, very similar, but they actually occur at different physical values of the surface tension. So, physically, you'd actually observe things that look different. So, thank you for listening. Thank you very much. Nice talk. Time for first tests and problems. Thank you for the nice talk. It was really, really interesting, some of these solutions. Was really, really interesting, some of these solutions. I actually have a question on one of the first couple of slides when you were showing sort of that limit as the surface tension goes to zero, that bifurcation branch. Yep, yep, I'll get that soon. That's okay. I'll continue talking. I'll distract them while you're getting there. So, I mean, it's well known that for, let's just say, small amplitude traveling waves, that there are certain choices for the bond number that give you Wilton-Ripple solutions. Give you Wilton-Ripple solutions, where you have just extra harmonics in your leading order behavior of your asymptotics. So, and generally, in infinite depth, I think the special bond numbers where that happened look like 1 over n, where n is a natural number. Maybe in finite depth, you might have to play around with that a little bit more. So I'm wondering if these little things that you're seeing here, are you coming from a solution branch of like a Stokes wave with just one harmonic, and then you're kind of very quickly. And then you're kind of very quickly for certain bond numbers bouncing to a Wilton-Ripple-like solution and then kind of coming back. So they do relate to that. So, this analytical expression that was found from the asymptotic theory, which is just these points, if you just sub in essentially linear solutions for each of the quantities, take the linear limits, you recover the predictions by Wilton. Right, so I guess what you're getting on is. This is more a non-linear analogue of that? Right, because you're fixing an amplitude and then you're sending a limit, so you're probably. And then you're sending a limit, so you're probably jumping onto a bifurcation branch of a wilden ripple that has already kind of grown up to a certain amplitude. Okay, okay, that makes sense. That's very cool. So, I mean, these things keep getting easier as you go to zeroing, right? So, but you actually started from there, right? You started with one theory, the bond number is zero, right? To motivate it. That's how it. To calculate them numerically. That's how I to calculate them numerically, I typically start with a linear solution with a non-zero value of the bond number, and then pump out the amplitude. Yeah, yeah, it is. Start from there, okay. So, so regardless, this is a place we'll talk about about this. This is for the analysts, right? So, the conjecture is that it's reached equals zero. The solution is not unique. And you have these foamy solutions, right? Solutions that are. uh solutions that are that have these infinitely a lu fi infinitely long free surface that there's a sort of a bunch of delivery form. The issue is if you were to just keep computing them and look at some around here, all of the solutions along the branch are just going to be self-intersecting so you kind of get garbage if you start to study that limit too deeply. I have a question. So I have a question. So you mentioned the challenges with fixing something else than the energy, for example the wavehack, right? So the figure you showed from the old paper 45 years ago is not so clear to me. So my question is, did you try with the newer methods to sort of redo the first case where Z plan is zero and Z found and what happens then when the bond number approaches zero? The bond number approach is zero. I understand that you don't regain this to an extent. So I said here that there was an issue in that the center minus half is zero. That's true for one of these. It's actually not true for this bifurcation point. So if they had studied with more Fourier coefficients and a better computer, because that was in the 1980s, the computers practically were non-existent, they would have been able to calculate. They would have been able to capture one of the bifurcation branches, but not the other. So they would have been able to capture every other bifurcation. Because essentially, this one is 0 minus 0, but this one is like 0 minus 0.1 or something like that. So what do you see in the limit? Is there a similar conjecture than this photo conjecture? I didn't recompute it to that extent. But I mean, But I mean, maybe just to make it clear, what they computed, the bifurcation branches wasn't continuous, right? So it were just different pieces of branches here and there. Whereas if you do it our way, you get a continuous bifurcation, right? Yes, yes, no, I was more interested in the, I mean you fix some way, right, which is far out to to the to the right in the x-axis, low bar axis, and then what happens to the backward. If you can continue, right, the If you can continue, right? It's a different thing because now because the end of this sort of force is following somehow, right? Yeah. I mean, in their paper, I think what... There's also something that I didn't show, in that there's other solution branches that these bifurcate from, which are just highly occilative. So if you did start off at the right and tried to come to the left, you might just latch onto one of these other ones, which eventually does just continue in a straight line down to the zero surface tension limit. But there's just, it's just. Limits, but there's just highly periodic, and you just get like a thousand copies of the same wave, and then a million copies of the same wave. Those are non-uniqueness. Yes, okay, then I think we thank all the speakers.
