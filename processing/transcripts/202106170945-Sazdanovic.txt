Okay, hi everyone. My computer restarted twice in the past five minutes. Can everyone see my screen? Yeah. And then yeah, we can see you. Okay. Well, the screen is more important, but it's good to see me, I guess, too. Well, we can see the screen and you even better. Yeah. All right. Just give everybody one more minute to come back. I'm not sure how to see the chat. Oh, here it is. Okay, perfect. Oh, here it is. Okay, perfect. Welcome back, everybody. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being here. And it's my pleasure to introduce Professor Rodmila Sazanovich, who will talk about NOTs and their invariance topological data analysis perspective. Thank you, Mariel. And I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to Banff. And it's good to be there. It's good to be in BAMF virtual space too. And of course, thank you all for coming. So today I'm going to talk about not Today, I'm going to talk about NOTs and their invariants from a topological data analysis perspective, which is a project that's very, very exciting for me because it sort of brings together my sort of background in low-dimensional topology and my sort of more recent interest in sort of topological data analysis and applied algebraic topology. But I do want to sort of start with sort of saying that we're using NOTS as our As our running example, please sort of feel free to imagine how these methods I'm going to talk about today sort of could maybe apply in different settings that include nots or not. So what's the big picture? But kind of zoomed in, so I don't want to go too broad. So topological data analysis is just one of the big data analysis tools, and it's the one that's And it's the one that's been developed and based on the ideas from algebraic topology. And again, algebraic topology has this very convenient notion of local to global principles. So somehow the idea is that you can sort of look at things locally, but you're kind of zooming here and you're zooming there and zooming and zooming in. It could record or measure some local property. And then you apply the algebraic topology method. You apply the algebraic topology magic, and it sort of gives you some sort of global value or global descriptor of whatever is the space that you were looking at. And of course, this principle is not sort of unique to sort of knock theory since, so for example, I mean, maybe mentioned like the statement in graph theory that sort of says that a graph has an Eulerian circuit, which is a global property, if and only if every node has even degree, for example. So you can sort of tell. So, you can sort of tell whether there exists an Eulerian circuit just by looking at every particular node in your graph. And of course, I guess a geometric theorem, right, says the Gauss-Bonnet theorem sort of says that you can sort of be looking at the Gaussian curvature. That's like a local geometric property. And then you can compute Euler characteristic, or it relates it with the Euler characteristic, which is like a very global topological property. Okay. Okay, so what's the usual TDA pipeline? So, even if you don't know anything about topological data analysis, the idea is that somehow, either from some measurements or by sampling from a manifold or whatever, you're going to have some sort of data, preferably in the form of a point cloud, but there might be an extra processing step there. And they're going to apply a TDA tool. So that's my first arrow here. And two most famous and most. And two most famous and most widely used TBA tools are persistent homology and sort of map retype algorithms. And whatever those are, you can just think of them as a black box for now. They will sort of provide some topological summary. So they will provide a number or a function or a collection of numbers or collection of pairs of numbers or something like that, but some sort of summary or topological. That, but some sort of summary or a topological descriptor, then hopefully, if you did your work right, it will be meaningful and it will provide some insight into whatever is the problem that you were looking at, whatever was the idea, whatever was the question that you wanted to sort of have answered about the point cloud. So again, the words that sort of are maybe a must to mention is that the idea behind this is that data has shape and shape has meaning. And shape has meaning. So, what are we going to do today? So, again, among these two big classes of TDA tools, we're actually going to focus on mapper type construction. In particular, we're going to talk about ball mapper that was recently, fairly recently, introduced by Pavela Dlotko and its generalizations. And again, there's nothing specific about Bullmap or specific to NOTs. So this is like a general tool. General tool. And in particular, we're going to talk about a mapper-based way of visualizing maps between high-dimensional spaces. And then a sort of hybrid construction between the standard mapper introduced maybe like in 2008 and the bow mapper introduced by Pablo recently that sort of plays off their both of their strengths. And again, don't worry if you don't know what these are. I will introduce them in a minute. In a minute. Another idea that's going to be relevant for this talk is how to get a point cloud out of a shape. Again, for me, the shape is a knot. But, you know, knots are sort of hard to think about, right? Because there's many different realizations of any particular knot type. And, you know, therefore, like whichever code that you want to use to sort of denote your knots, there's going to be, you know. You know, turnots, there's going to be, you know, one-to-many relations. There's going to be many equivalent codes for the same knot. So, again, you can try to use those codes. You can try to use the actual embedding themselves. Or you can construct a point cloud vector out of numerical descriptors. Again, this can be applied to other data, but in our case, our numerical descriptors will be not invariants. So, again, our example will be example will be um sort of to sort of try to you know again this is like a big big picture kind of address the the the the idea of classifying and characterizing knots which is like a very difficult problem uh because very hard to tell when when two knots are um as a topic but again the first obstacle um is how to find representatives for knots and links and we're going to solve that by looking at a particular invariant or At a particular invariant or several invariants of a particular knot as a representation of that knot. And the other thing that, again, I looking forward to talking to some of you here and get some help is how to sample the space of knots. And we sort of did maybe the most natural, but probably the simplest approach here. We sort of are filtering it by the crossing number. Okay, so. Okay, so this is joint work with Pavel Vlotko and David DeGurnari. What we're going to be getting out of this TDA approach on the knot theory side is a way to compare NOT invariants, hopefully and probably down the road, improving the knot type identification and providing experimental evidence for conjectures. As like a small kind of illustration that these methods That these methods are not restricted to not data. I'm including a reference to the paper that's in material sciences that sort of is done by Pavlo Blasko and his collaborators in 2017, where they're basically looking into the porous structure of these nanoporous materials. Materials. And it's my understanding that sometimes this pore structure is as important as the sort of chemical composition of these materials when you're looking at the performance, right? If you're interested in how the materials are going to perform, then again, this kind of pore structure is, and geometry is very, very important. And the diagram that you're seeing here in the top left corner. That you're seeing here in the top left corner is a sort of a topological data analysis magic working there to kind of group materials that have similar properties together. And in addition, you sort of get like a very convenient representation here. So anyways, I hope that you're going to enjoy learning about more details about our approach. But again, please do keep an eye on where they could be applied. On where they could be applied. And of course, please do let me know if you have a data that you would like to see analyzed using these techniques. So, what are the techniques? So, let's go back to the standard notion of a mapper. Again, you have a point cloud that's represented by these dots and kind of looks like it could have been sampled from an annulus, could it be sampled from a Taurus, could it be sampled under-sampled from some who knows what, right? But the idea is that you're The idea is that you're going to cover the line here, the vertical line, with some number of elements. So these little intervals that are kind of show alternating color between gray and, I guess, light red. And again, you have a choice of how long they are and how much they overlap. And then you sort of have a choice of a lens or a filter function. Of a lens or a filter function and a clustering algorithm, but the idea is that somehow by looking at how these points in the data cloud, if you wish, are mapped onto this vertical line, you can sort of pull back and sort of construct this graph here. And again, the graph is color-coded, so you can sort of see that these vertices of a graph correspond to the way that, let's say, this top vertex corresponds to the way that this. The way that this top interval sort of interacts with the point cloud. And then the next is the red one. And then we sort of see that this middle gray one actually intersects our point cloud sort of twice. That's why we have two vertices here. Okay, again, this is not a complete explanation, just to give you an idea of what the process is like and what the output is like. So the output is a graph. And then, of course, all these choices that we're making sort of affect the Sort of affect the outcome. So, in particular, the choice of this lens or filter height function does affect the connectivity of the output map or graph. And then, depending on all of the choices you've made, interpreting the graph that you obtain is sometimes complicated and what's of course tricky is that the results might not be stable depending on how we choose this cover by this. Is covered by these red and gray intervals. Okay, so again, there's a lot of parameters here. Pavel's idea, to the best of my knowledge, was to construct a mapper-like algorithm that he sort of named Bull Mapper that's conceptually simpler, but sort of it's based on a similar idea and it's based on the geometry of your point cloud. It's based on the geometry of your point cloud. And it can be used as an alternative to a mapper. And as we'll show today, it can be used together with the original mapper. But again, let's sort of look at things here. So let's say that my point cloud consists of these black dots and they are maybe sampled from somewhere. So the first step, I kind of go to the right and then I'll go down. So the first thing you do, you're going to choose. thing you do, you're going to choose some number of points that are denoted here with like different colors from your original point cloud. And you're going to choose them in such a way that for, again, a chosen radius, the well in this case, two-dimensional disk, but in general, n-dimensional balls with the fixed radius and the center in one of these points, when they're all constructed. Points when they're all constructed together, they form a cover of your point cloud. So there's no point in your point cloud that doesn't belong to one of these disks. Okay, and then basically you can kind of forget about your point cloud, right? So what you do next is you sort of just look at the ways that these disks in this case intersect. And then you sort of say, well, if two disks intersect, then I'm going to connect. Then I'm going to connect the vertices that correspond to these disks by an edge. So, again, each disk here that corresponds to the choice of these centers is a vertex in our ball mapper graph. And then the edges of the graph are obtained by connecting the vertices that correspond to disks that have non-trivial intersection. Okay, so this is the output for the full mapper. And again, not to go into too much details. Again, not to go into too much details, but this is a geometrically stable version of Mapper. It's an exploratory tool. It does have a, it's based on nerve complex construction and it does feature the nerve lemma. But there's only one parameter that you choose. Well, the radius of the ball, right? Or the disk that you have. So again, for more details, please check out Pavel's. Again, for more details, please check out Pavel's paper. It does provide all of the details for the construction, but it also provides a fairly detailed analysis of how Ball Mapper compares to the mapper and what are the sort of advantages and differences. Okay, so again, this is one of the tools that we're going to use on our data. So let me sort of quickly describe the data that we're going to be using here. And in particular, let me try to Particular, let me try to convince you that knots are indeed big data, right? So, as Ernest and Sumners proved in 87, the number of distinct knots grows exponential with the crossing number, right? So, again, you can compute also. That's a lot of knots. And therefore, like it makes sense to use big data analysis techniques to sort of analyze them. And there's several fairly recent papers by Mark Hughes. Recent papers by Mark Hughes, Mark Ward, and Eric Radon. And then a group of physicists from actually UPenn that sort of addressed, using neural networks, addressed the very famous hyperbolic volume conjecture for knots. So basically, knots are complicated to study. And if you think about everything that I've explained to you, you sort of say, well, you know, knots are embeddings of a circle in R3 up to isotopy. Up to isotopy, it's hard to determine them. It's hard to sort of define the distance between them. So the way that we sort of decided to kind of address this issue is to actually look at knot invariance. So various quantities that were invented for the purpose of distinguishing knots. So something is a knot invariant if two knots that have the same type. Two nodes that have the same type. Sorry, that if a knot invariant has different values for two nodes, then you know that these two nodes are different. However, these knot invariants are not perfect, right? So it may happen that two nodes that are really different have the same invariant, but then you can apply many of them and so on and so on. So there's more than 50 different invariants of nodes, and they have different types. They're numerical, polynomial, algebraic, quantum, and so on and so on. So what we're going to look at, we're going to So, what we're going to look at, we're going to actually look at some of these invariants and we're going to try to construct point clouds of them. And we're going to succeed at least in constructing the clouds. So again, these are just some numbers that actually tell you what the recent status of knot tabulation, right? So it starts with Rawfson's table, of course, through first million, well, almost 2 million knots by hosted this within weeks. There's two. Weeks. There's two freely available and fairly up-to-date Notiary databases online by Robert Natan and Chad Livingston. And then more recently, Benjamin Burton using his software Regina constructed, well, this many knots under 20 crossings. And again, it's hard to do things. So for example, Adam Shikor and his student Tujan actually just test. You know, just tested that the Jones-Andnaught conjecture. So, conjecture, the Jones polynomial detects the unknown up to for all knots up to 23 crossings. But that actually required checking this many different knot diagrams. Anyway, so in this study, we're going to be looking into approximately, well, just about 10 million knots. Okay, so how do we get our point clouds? So, we're going to get a point cloud for So, we're going to get a point cloud from a polynomial invariant, and the polynomial invariants that we're going to be looking at are those that are kind of depend on the scan relation. I'll be looking at the Alexander polynomial, a Jones polynomial, and then a two-variable home-fly PT polynomial. And actually, I'm going to reduce Kovano homology to a Kovano polynomial. And in that case, if it's computed over Q, it's just a sort of standard two-variable polynomial, but you're kind of losing the torsion information. The torsion information. Okay, don't worry about these things. So, why does it make sense to look at these polynomials and how are we going to turn them into vectors? Well, we're going to look at their coefficients. And again, this is my slide that sort of says, well, the coefficients carry meaningful information. They encode meaningful information about knots. So coefficients of the Jones polynomial can be used to determine the lower bound on the crossing number, whether or not it's alternating, and its conjecture to determine the hyperbolic volume of the knot complement, which is. One do not complement, which is the conjecture that was addressed in the paper I mentioned earlier. Homphalapiti polynomial coefficients are related to topological properties such as homology and branch covers. And what's interesting to sort of say is that the home fly PT polynomial actually specializes to both the Alexander and the Jones polynomials. So that's very interesting to know. And all of these are hard to compute, so maybe they're not the best choices for. Maybe they're not the best choices for your point clouds, but that's what we did. So, how do we get our point clouds? Well, we chose a variable, and in this case, I'm going to sort of describe the process for a one-variable polynomial. So, either Jones or Alexander, but you can sort of see how it generalizes to two variable polynomials. So, you know, I have a finite collection of knots and I have their polynomial invariant that I'm denoting by I. And then what do I do? I take the What do I do? I take the polynomial and I extract a vector coefficients. Maybe do some pre-processing there to just sort of make things more consistent so that when I filter by the number of crossings, I get the meaningful containment of data and from the computational point of view. But then you can sort of see that that's the power, the minimal, the maximal powers over all of these polynomials, for all of the knots, will actually give you. knots will actually give you what the dimension of your vector space is, right? So it's going to be the difference between the maximal power of t and minimal power of t if t is your variable plus one. So again, to get the meaningful embeddings of lower crossing data into higher crossing data, we're actually going to look at the dimension of the largest one. So for 17 crossings, and then we're going to pad by zeros. So here's what we do on an example of the Jones polynomial. I've just Of the Jones polynomial. I've just shown the first few. These are the Jones polynomials. I turn them into vectors, and in particular, I sort of center them so that the free term has the same position in every vector, and then I pad by zeros. If you want to look at how would the sample vector look like for either a knot or a trefoil for the Alexander Jones homphypedia or anophomology, well, you know, here's your example, and the only Your example, and the only kind of caveat here is that, again, if you have a two-variable polynomial, you actually have a matrix, and then you need to flatten it. Okay, so here are the results. So, I'm going to apply ball mapper to all of these point clouds. Okay, so what you see here is, well, pictures obtained by all of the pictures that are in. All of the pictures that are in this talk were obtained either by Pavel or David, and their software is available. So, what we have here is we're showing that, again, the issue, potential issue that arises with sort of choosing the radius in ball mapper is actually not an issue. So, here we're sort of seeing that we get kind of similar looking pictures from the Jones polynomial data for not up to seven. Data pronouns up to 17 crossing, no matter what kind of radius we choose. Okay, and what we see here is that we kind of have some sort of core and then we have these flares sort of branching out from that core. And then you might say, well, okay, well, can you tell me something more? So another feature of ball map is that you can actually color, and this is what we're doing. We have some, in addition to We can have some, in addition to having Jones polynomial data, we have some other numerical invariants like is the node alternating or not. We, of course, know what's the number of crossings, we know what's the norm of the Jones polynomial, and so on and so on. So, in particular, what you sort of see here is the ball map graph of the Jones data, which is colored by the fraction or percentage of alternating knots in each one of these clusters. Okay, so what this is telling me is that the There's more alternating knots at the tips of these flares, and then there's a mixture in the core, right? So somehow there's no non-alternating knots on the flares, right? And so similarly here, we're actually coloring the ball map or graph by the size of the cluster, right? So, and what this is showing is that actually these clusters that are in the center, they contain That are in the center, they contain many, many, many more knots by the order of magnitude, right, than the ones here at the very tips of the flares. So somehow the center is heavy, and that's not a good news. Here we have it colored by the norm of the Jones polynomial. So we sort of see that those polynomials with higher norm are also here, which sort of makes sense. Those are the non, those are the alternating knots with a higher crossing number in this data set. And this is again by the span. And again, we know that the alternating nodes have the maximum possible span for that crossing number. So it makes sense that they're all here. And the span of the Jones polynomial collapses for non-altering nodes. So they will sort of be more towards the center. Okay, so here's another thing that one could do. We could sort of just say, okay, I'm just going to do a ball map for on just alternating knots or just non-alternating knots. And again, ball maps. And again, WorldMapper is an exploratory tool. And what you can sort of see here is that this messy core actually is appearing there due to non-alternating knots, right? Anyways, one thing to point out here is that we have the alternating knots colored by signature. Okay, here, so you know, different layers have actually different signature. Okay, the reason why we're looking at this is because we sort of wanted to. we're looking at this is because we sort of wanted to sort of see how well does the uh does just the Jones polynomial do uh with respect to um Kero Fadidi's conjecture which actually says that the the color Jones polynomial determines the signature of a knot and and he proved it computationally for all knots up to eight crossings uh but it's conjecture for all simple knots in general um so what we sort of do here is you know we have a What we sort of do here is, you know, we have a hint that, you know, the Jones polynomial sort of colored by signature, well, it won't kind of do very well in the core, but these flares will be monochromatic. So that means that the knots that have the same signature will be somehow clustered together in these flares. Okay, so since I'm not doing so well on time, I'm going to skip the potential counterexamples for the Examples for the Gero-Folidis conjecture. So, those are the dots where the Jones polynomial fails to determine signature. So, those are the dots that have the same Jones polynomial but different signature. And you can kind of see not surprisingly that if it fails, then the signature differs by four and not by two. Okay, so again, these are all of the reasons why we sort of care about comparing these polynomials and these invariants and calculations. And these invariants and kind of looking more closely into their structure. So, for example, if we know there's a class of knots called thin knots for which a random homology is determined by the signature and the Jones polynomial. So if we somehow knew that the Jones polynomial of those knots determines the signature, then we would know that that in particular means that the Jones polynomial contains, that coanohomology of these knots is sort of determined by their Jones polynomial. Determined by their Jones polynomial. And again, this collection of thin knots contains the alternating knot, but there's no complete characterization. Another thing to kind of point out, I'll skip through these two, but there's this structure of ball mapper where these flares are monochromatic when you color the graph by signature, actually sort of exhibits the folklore results. So if we did not know, the result that's attributed to many, that both the Jones. Many that both the Jones and the Alexander polynomial actually know about signature mode four. We could actually sort of see it from the ball mapper, we could obtain that one using ball mapper. And what I'm going to briefly now do is actually show you how ball mappers look for the Alexander data, Homplapiti data, and Khovanov data. So now you can see that the structure of the Alexander polynomial data is actually very simple. It's sort of linear. And here again, I have a coloring by the normal. Here again, I have a coloring by the norm. I sort of see that there's only alternating knots at the two ends. So you can kind of think of Alexander data as a thing that has just two flares. It kind of looks linear. Here's colored by signature, which is absolutely not useful for anything. And here's sort of signature mod 4. So you sort of see that if you're thinking about signature mod 4, the nodes, there's like a little bit of messy thing in the core, but then it's monochromatic. thing in the core but then it's monochromatic in both of the players. This is the home plan PT data. Again, that's two-dimensional two-variable polynomial that we had to sort of flatten. This is the structure that we get. Sort of looks more like the Jones, but that's what it is. And here's the command of data. And you can sort of see that if you look at this, it really, really colored by signature. So you can sort of see. So, you can sort of see similarities between Hovanov data and Jones data. So, in the remaining time, what I want to do is I want to give you like two options of comparing these results. So, one is because we have the database here, we can kind of compare the data by just by going to the common database and then go from one to the other. You also know that these are the specializations that are used from HomeFlow IPT to Jones. Oh, well, I guess there's a picture that got strayed. Okay, move to the other. That's not good. Okay, so the idea is that if you look at this picture, this is the ball mapper for the Alexander polynomial, and this is the ball mapper for the Jones polynomial. And they are actually colored consistently. So basically, that's what I have here. So they're sort of colored so that the They're sort of colored so that the corresponding regions have the same color. And basically, this is a way that you can, in some ways, obtain more information about this map. You can visualize the map between these high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. And just to sort of remind you, Jones data for this collection of knots actually lives in R to the, it's like 51 dimensional, and this is 17 dimensional space. Okay, so there is actually a Okay, so there is actually a really beautiful construction that, anyways, don't have the time to cover. That's not the time is up, Mila. Sorry? The time is up. Yeah, yeah, so I'm just going to finish. Yes, so I just said I don't have the time to finish this. So I'm just going to tell you that there's a way to not compare these variables directly, but compare them by using their ball mapper graphs. And I'll be happy to sort of talk more about it. Happy to sort of talk more about it, but that's the way that you can take the ball mapper for the Johnson polynomial and pull it back to either Havana data or to home fly PT data. And that will sort of tell you a little bit about how these knots compare. So I would like to thank you all and show you a photo taken in banff two years ago. So thank you all for attention and sorry about the time.
