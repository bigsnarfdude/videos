Thank you. Firstly, thanks, organizers. It's been a wonderful conference. Thanks for inviting me. So today I thought I'd talk about some of my recent work with a lot of people on some bio control problems and applications to sort of airflow. So let me just acknowledge everyone very quick. So Urgashi Varma is a current grad student at Iowa State. Mike Ad Panji is a former grad student. He's currently a postdoc at Par 6. Currently, a postdoc at Par6. Sereni Vikramsuria is a former grad student, currently postdoc at UC Davis with Greg Lanzaro. She moved into some vector disease problems. And collaborators at Ohio State are Andy Michael and Margaret Lewis, they own the Department of Enomology. Matt O'Neill is the collaborator at Iowa State, and I think he deserves most credit for his stuff because he introduced me to Sora Bina to come. He introduced me to soybean problems, you know, some years back. So, this brief outline, I'll talk a little bit about some biological background and EFID. So, the AFID dynamics is not really modeled in here. It's mostly motivational. And the biocontrol models are all ODE models, so there will be nothing specially explicit. And so, I'll talk about. And so I'll talk about some older work and moving into the more recent work with Verma, last five minutes or so, with dispersal or drift. So let's begin with a definition of invasive species. We all know what these things are, but just to define, an invasive species refers to a non-native organism which is introduced into an ecosystem and causes harmful effects. And causes harmful effects to that ecosystem. The picture here is actually the soybean aphid. This is like the middle of the summer season. That's when populations really build up and can reach several thousands on one leaf and maybe tens of thousands on one plant. And controlling them is a big issue. So traditionally, we rely on pesticide. Rely on pesticide kind of control. Oh, sorry. Usually there's a maybe misused my mouse. So typically we rely on pesticide kind of control, but they are several harmful side effects, right? Detrimental to the environment is a common one, but then the insect also gets resistant over time. Also gets resistant over time to the pesticide, and that's another big one. So, more fancy approaches are called for better pest management tactics and on its bike control. So, the picture here is a bike control agent which is depredating some aphid population. This is not soya bean, essentially, most crop will have some aphid. Will have some effit. And so you can actually define it that way: the reduction of pest population by introducing natural enemies. And this requires active monitoring by humans. There's a management involved. There's several benefits, being non-toxic and self-sustainable. There's drawbacks, like non-target effects. What if the predator starts to attack other things? Have other things, for example. So, if you want to use biocontrol and it's predator-based, then the mathematical model will be predator-prey model. Everyone knows classical predator-prey model. Let me spend 20 seconds on it. This is pretty gauss type, what is called gauss type because the functional and numerical responses of the prey are symmetric essentially. So, the prey has some logistic control. So, the prey has some logistic control and is consumed by the predator at some rate. The predator grows, you know, essentially at that rate, modulated by some constant. And then there's some death term. And this catches lots of dynamics. So this particular Rosen Schweik-MacArthur, it will catch the limit cycle dynamics or cyclical behavior, which is seen in many predatory populations, but it also catches coexistence. Systems and for certain parameter regimes, you can see that as well. Of course, the one state it does not catch is zero y star. The pest extinction or prey extinction, right? If there's no prey, if there's no X, Y will decay and actually 0, 0 is unstable. So if you are interested in biocontrol, then of course you're interested in that state. That state. So, the pest of interest is soil bean AFID, and we want to get at the biocontrol for that. Right now, we are not really implementing soil bean AFID dynamics into the model, but let me just briefly tell you a little bit, you know, spend a few minutes on the aphid biology. So, earlier, I mean, about 25 plus years ago, there were no soyer bean aphids. Years ago, there were no so airbnb fits in the US according to USDA estimates. This is sort of zoomed-in right version. Don't worry, they're not that big in reality. And they were first detected in Wisconsin about 20 years ago. So the home range is Asia, so China, India, Indonesia, and released accidentally. Released accidentally in the US about over 20 years ago, and within about five years had spread to much of the Midwest. If it is an interesting pest, so it is an example of a pest that reproduces asexually or orthenogenetically. So the female does not require a male to reproduce. She has carries many. Right, she carries many females. Each of these females inside is carrying more females. And so you have got several generations, and that's how you see the population explosion. The dynamics is boom-bust. So they come in at some rate in the middle of the summer season. They will boom, and then they will crash towards the end of the season. They get completely defoliate. Sorry, beans crash. And then at this point, they will overwinter, go to a wintering host, like buck. Host like buckthorn where actually sexual reproduction will take place. So there is asexual reproduction on the summer host, but on the winter host, there's actually sexual reproduction, depending on which type is there. So it's interesting. Now, in the line of some fancy management strategy, Fancy management strategies, or you know, better integrated pest management strategies. One tactic is the rag plant. Okay, rag stands for resistant to aphysical issues, resistant to the aphid. So the plant itself has seeds which have genes which make it resistant to the aphid. Okay, so you don't have to spray, really. And this is just some data. Some data showing that if you have a susceptible plant and you've got aphids, then yield is really low. But on rag type, if it's rag 1 and rag 2, it's lower. If it's rag 1 and 2, the yield is a little better. But then in response to this, the aphid also evolves two biotypes. So there's a virulent and an avirulent one, and virulent ones can actually survive on the resistant plane. So that is the On the resistant point. So that is the development of resistance. And there are several ways by which they will defoliate about feeding facilitation. Anyone, avirulent or virulent, can eat. And oviational resistance is when virulent aphids will reduce a resistant plant's level low enough such that a virulent aphids can also colonize. So, this is when we got interested in this. About five, seven years ago, Matt O'Neill conjectured. Years ago, Matt O'Neill conjectured that virulent and averant aphids, because of this obviation of resistance, could coexist on so every plant. And the conjecture was there's this within plant refugees. Arni Kanergy looked at it and did some numerics. And based on numbers at the end of the season, you can see some evidence of that. The current direction actually has to do more with climate change and amount of rainfall. Amount of rainfall in the Midwest is supposed to go up. And so this is going to make for the wetter summers. And so the question is: what does this increased rainfall and increased flooding from that, what effect does that have on the infant population dynamics? So experiments with Ohio State people are looking at soya bean plant in flooded conditions, okay, and then both types were. And then both types, virulent and avirulent, and then control. And if you look at the virulent aphid, whether it's a control or a flooded plant, whether it's a rat type or a susceptible, there's not much difference. But the avirulent aphid on the flooded plants populations fall quite a bit. On rat type, I believe it's more than 40%. And on the susceptible plants, also about 30%. So being Being on a flood, you know, more floods will have much more of a drastic effect on the aviaront. So, when you model, that's the way to think about that. So, around the same time, I was working completely different direction on some of these additional food models. I had no idea about aphids, so I was introduced and started thinking about aphids. Now, what is the additional food model for biocontrol? Let me give you some. For biocontrol. Let me give you some background. To the best of my knowledge, the first ecology papers were by Benry and Sabellis, and then another one in Amnet by the same group in Vlad Simuk Creevon is involved here. What they say is that if you use a biocontrol predator, which is after some target test, you can improve its efficacy if you give it some additional food. Okay. And the math literature took a while to catch up, maybe, you know, 10 years, but the first additional food model, mathematical additional food model, to the best of my knowledge, was proposed by an Indian group led by Sire Vasu and others in a series of papers between 10 and 15 years ago. So it's a change. Ago, so it's a change, little perturbation of classic predator prey. The functional response alpha is additional food, everything is constant here. And the functional response of the predator goes down a little bit, and the numerical response increases, but there's this non-linear term. So it's not quite classic predator prey. But Shinivasu's original idea is very good. So if you Is very good. So, if you recall classic predator prey, if I call Y is predator and X is prey, and this is prey, null coin predator, null coin, classic case of additional food, there's no additional food. Now you start to increase additional food, what happens? This null coin starts to move to the left. So, you see the pest level is pushed down a little bit when you increase the additional food. So, his original idea is. So, his original idea is very good. Okay, and what was claimed is with this model, you can get extinction of the pest in finite time if the additional food is large enough. So, several issues with this. One is pest extinction is not achievable in finite time. You might think, you might have some intuition, this is ODE, right-hand side is C1. Why should there be finite time extinction? Actually, that is. Finite time extinction, actually, that is not a sufficient condition to knock out finite time extinction. They are harvesting models from the Fishery literature, constant harvesting, C1, right hand, sorry, you can get finite time extinction. So things have to be proved. And the other issue is if you actually get pest extinction, predator populations blow up. But this happens in infinite time. Okay, so we worked a little bit on this. So, we worked a little bit on this, just give some ideas about some proofs. There was some work with Vikram Surya earlier, and we showed that to have large additional food, finite time extinction is not possible. The idea is to use blowing up solutions. For example, you can use standard quadratic, what you teach in ODE 101, separable, you have blow-up. You have blow-up in finite time. So, supposing the pest population went to zero in finite time, then we can make some simple change of variable. And if x goes to zero in finite time, then v must blow up. But the equation for v, you can do some chain rule calculus and easily derive some bounds. So, v can never blow up in finite time. So, of course, x cannot go up x. Time. So, of course, X cannot go extinct till pointless time. So, we also looked at some theoretical ecology directions. They derive another derived functional response using theoretical ecology approach where they look at search time, handling time, how those things are put together. And so we play around with that a little bit. Classically, search time, people will say scales like one over cray, right? Prey, right? If there's little prey, it takes very long for the predator to search. Prey is large, ones are quick. And so you can change the search time if there's additional food at because if you model in this way, the search time will be much lower. So it's a little more efficient. And then if you cook up the right ages, you can break the C1 hypothesis and get finite time extinction. Of course, the Of course, the bigger issue is the blow-up of the predator. So, with honey head banana, we show that if you give large enough additional food, then if pest extinction is happening, if x is going to 0, y is actually going to infinity. Of course, this happens in infinite time. So, the blow-up really looks like this, right? It's not. It's not x squared, so it's more like e to the t. And so we think, well, are there ways to damp that? One easy way is to put predator competition, right? So if you, I'm sorry, this is why. So if you put the additional logistic damping, of course, you can damp this. So that is not very interesting. From dynamics point of view, it's very interesting. Once you now start to bend these malt lines, things can be quite. Bend these nalclines, you know, things can look like this or like this. Things look more interesting, even without additional food. There's several high-dimensional bifurcations done very recently, Jikai Huang and others. You can look at his JDE paper. There are other papers and some very interesting higher codimensional bifurcations have been found, and you can find similar things in the additional food model. In the additional food model. So, if we do something with pH4 transcritical using some symmetries, I'll go through, I'll skip this because I think I have to wrap up in 20 minutes. I want to talk about the last part, dispersal and drift. So, there's very large literature on dispersal and drift, you know, in the ODA settings of patch models. Right, there's picked a few papers, many members of the audience have worked on this. Audience who worked on this, and I might miss some people, so please forgive me if I do that. I don't know the literature so well. We have been reading the work of Yoon Kang and her students because she did this in Freder Pre case. But the fact of the matter is, if there's patches and there's dispersal between, then there's well-known technology. We don't have to do everything from the beginning again. Beginning again. Okay, so what's our motivation here? So the motivation is Iowa Strips Project, led by Lisa Schultz and others. She's a professor at NREM in Iowa State, so natural resources ecology and management. And what they show is in crop fields, the soybean crop fields, if you plant strips of science-based trials or raw crops, it is Or row crops, it is better for biodiversity, helps the soil, prevents water runoff, and essentially increases crop yield. And so it's a clear patchy structure, if you were to use this as a reservoir for additional food. And so you can think of two patches. You got a patch where you will give the Where you will give the predator some additional food and allow it to drift or disperse into a crop field where there's classic predator prey and see what it does. Now, in classic predatory, if this is one patch setting, all this is going on in one patch, classic predator prey, there's no way you can get a test extinction. You know that what happens if there's some patch structure. So we work on drift and dispersal. We work on drift and dispersal. For this talk, I just showed drift. So, patch one is the additional food patch. Predators leave this at some rate, enter patch two, which is predator predator. We change carrying capacity because the patch is, the strip is supposed to be much smaller. Can't wrap up in one day. And so, blow-up can be prevented. This is academic interest. I would be interested to see if. I would be interested to see if it can be done for C smaller than one. But the interesting result, let's end with that, is the patch-free state in the crop field, the 0y2 star, now exists and is at least locally stable. So simulations point to global stability, but the classic Eyapunov function of ZBZO does not work here. And that's because of the asymmetry in the functional and the numerical responses. So something else has to be done. So, something else has to be done, and we use some comparison arguments in conjunction with over work of Brower to show the following. That is that the pest-free state under certain restrictions on the drift actually can be globally stable. And the idea is that we show coexistence in patch one using. In patch one using a sub and super solution, and then get these to converge onto you know the solution in between using a sequence argument. You have to choose the sequence a little cleverly. And so this auxiliary theorem from Perco comes in where you've got C1 right-hand side, but the C1 needs to be an in-parameter as well. And if you do that, you will have the coefficients. You will, you know, have the coexistence. And so, in the second patch, if you treat that just as a predator stocking, then Greg Bauer's stuff gives you a condition for the extinction. Okay, so you can actually get, with this fat structure now, you can actually get pest extinction in the crop field of interest. This can be globally stable. There's many, many questions next. I'll end with that. One interesting one is predator versus. Interesting one is predator versus paracetoid because most of the literature on EFID says predators don't work so well. Current experiments show parasitoids do much better. So how to think of housing parasitoids here? That's one question. Of course, the spatially explicit problem and critical pet size or periodic predator or AF introduction. You're thinking of all this. But yeah, so I'll end with that. Thanks. I'll end with that. Thanks for listening. Thanks for funders to meet collaborators. Thank you. I have a quick question regarding an excellent presentation. You said.
