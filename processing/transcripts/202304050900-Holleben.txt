And so let's move on to our first talk and then first and only talk and actually our last talk right with Andrew Holman will be talking about homological invariant code for narrowing graphs. Okay, so thanks for the introduction and for the opportunity to give the talk. So first let's set some notation. So given a graph G, we're going to write Given a graph G, we're going to write I of G for the edge ideal. And given a simpl complex, we're going to write I delta with the subscript for the only rising ideal. And the main tool that we're going to use to go from algebra to incumbent arts is Hawkster's formula. So when we have a simplicial complex, what we know is that the multi-graded Baying numbers of the Snowy Reisner ideal are actually equal to some dimension of some simple. Of some simplicial homology group of some restrictions of the simplicial homology. So we take a place and then we take a restriction, and then some homology groups are going to be the mutified number. And that's how we go from one to the other. So given a graph G and all the location there's a polynomial range and the standard ideal, we're going to define the independence complex of the graph by looking at, so it's a simplicial complex where the vertical side So it's a syntlu complex where the vertex side is the vertex side of G. And the faces of this syntaxial complex are going to be exactly the independent sides of the graph. So it is a face if we don't have any edge between the atom and the side. Here we have an example. So for example, B is not adjacent to E in the graph, so B is adjacent to E in the independent context. Okay, some useful facts that we end up using a lot. So, for example, if G has an isolate That's so, for example, if G has an isolated vertex, then the independence complex of G is a cone. And the edge ideal of the graph is equal to the Stony-Reiser ideal of the independent complex. And I feel like this is a, it's easy to prove this equality, but if you look from the edge ideal perspective, it's more of a combinatorial thing. And if you look from the Snowy Riser one, it's more of a topological one, since you can use Hawkstridge formula. And the result that we're going to use from combinatorics is exactly our result. Parts is that exactly a result that bridges the gap between topology and combined parts. So that becomes very handy. So a ternary graph is a graph that doesn't contain any cycle of any induced cycle of length equal by 3. And so here we have an example. So this is a 9th cycle, but it has a core. So the 9th cycle is not induced. So it is a turnaround graph. It can have 9-induced. You can have non-induced cycles, for example, but then the theorem that we are going to use, the recent theorem by Jing Kim, and it says that a graph is ternary if and only if the independence complex is either contractible, the independence complex of every induced subgraph is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a sphere. So, this is a very strong topological condition, it's a very simple combinatorial description, and since combinatorial description and since it's for every induced subgraph of our like big graph we can apply hoxter's formula to it because on this side we get the independence complex of all the induced subgraphs then on that side we get the multi-graded value numbers so a corollary that we get just by applying hoxter's formula to the theorem is that the value table of the edge ideal of a ternary graph does not depend Turnary graph does not depend on the characteristic. So, all the homological theorem is by contradiction. So, I don't think they have a button is that the value table of the edge ideal of a ternary graph. Edge ideal of a Turner graph does not depend on the characteristics of the base field. So, many of the homologic invariants that we care about, like depth, projective dimension, regularity, they're not going to depend on the characteristics of the field. And then one question that we can ask is, well, can we describe those invariants in terms of the breadth? So, a few questions that we can get from this theorem is: okay, so we know it's either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a sphere. When is it contractible? When is it contractible? And when it's not contractible, what is the dimension of the sphere going to be? And this dimension of the sphere, if you're looking from the three resolutions, the dimension of this sphere is going to be amount-zero baryon. So if you know the dimensions and when they are contractible, you know the whole bidding table. And the question from conditive algebra is: okay, so can we describe the projected dimension, the depth, the regularity of the quotient? Of the quotient of the edge I yield in terms of the graph, right? And because of what I just said, these invariants are going to be characteristic of G. So now we set some notation from the more notorious side. So given a graph G and an independent subset of the vertices, we're going to call n of x, like that, the closed neighborhood. So I pick all the vertices adjacent to the elements in x. To the elements in X and the vertices in X themselves. And then, given a graph G and two subsets, X and Y, such that X is independent and they are disjoint, we are going to denote by G of X Y is right. So we remove the total neighborhood of the seven the left and just the elements on the right. And so our whole whole idea is we want to take a ternary graph, make it simpler into something that we kind of already know how to compute the things, or at least it's easier. And to do that, we can use, for example, this theorem that essentially answers the questions that we're looking for, but for forests on a tournament graph. So if you have a forest, then there's another theorem that says that the independence complex of the forest is going to be independence complex of the forest is going to be irremotable or amount of the equivalent to a sphere and in this case we know what the dimension of the sphere is we have like a clear dominatorial description so in this case the dimension the dimension of the sphere is the lower dominating number which is multiply like the smallest set of vertices such that everyone's either in the set or adjacent to an element in the set and just by this theorem most of what we did for tonerographs we can already do it for forests the point is we want to Forest. The point is, we want to kind of know: okay, so when is it contractible and when is what is the dimension of the sphere for ternary grips? Yeah, and then the question that it's also not here, but I think this people knew before, is so for first, do we know when the independence complex is contractible? So I'm going to do two examples, which I think are very clear, what determines if the independence complex is going to be contractible or not. So let's say we have this forest here. Have this forest here, then we know that the P is adjacent to an E. And then what we can do is we can remove everyone adjacent to B and B itself. And then we get a new graph. And now, well, it's still forest, so it still has a leaf. So now we can pick E, for example, which is adjacent to a leaf, and then we can remove all the vertices adjacent to V and E itself. And then, well now we have three connected components and we can repeat the process. We can pick a vertex statue adjacent to a leaf, remove the closed neighborhood, pick a vertex statue adjacent to a leaf, remove the closed neighborhood, and so on. And then at some point we get the amateur correct if we keep doing this. So the theorem that we have is, okay, so given a set of subgraphs like this, so we start from the whole graph, we delete the whole neighborhood of a vertex. Whole neighborhood of a vertex statute adjacent to a leaf. Then we pick a new vertex statute adjacent to a leaf. We repeat the process until we get an empty graph. And we call this a leaf filtration of F. And then the theorem that we have is that a forest F admits a leaf filtration, so it's possible to do this if and only if the independence complex is not contractible, the independence complex of the forest. And in that case, we can write the empty graph like this. So it's F, and then you remove the closed neighborhood of all of the variants. neighborhood of all of the vertices in X where they are the vertices that are adjacent to a leaf stat and in this case the dimension of the sphere is going to be the size of x minus 3 so I kind of recover the lower dominating number like this so this is a case where it works now I have a case where that doesn't happen but let's see we can try to do the same thing and see what happens so if we start from picking out Start from picking a vertex that's adjacent to a leaf, F, then we can remove all the closed neighborhoods of this vertex. Then we get this one. And then, well, now you can say D is adjacent to a leaf. And then we can remove everyone that's adjacent to D. But when we do that, we see that this edge here, PD, both of the endpoints of that edge are adjacent to these. So what happens here is that after you remove the closed neighborhood, you end up with an isolated vertex. Adjacent vertex. And what that means is that, well, that vertex is not adjacent to any. So in the end, if you keep doing this, you're never going to be able to remove that vertex. So you never get the empty graph. And essentially what we can prove is that if you have a forest and you find a subgraph that looks like this, so you have an edge such that both of the endpoints of the edges are adjacent to these, then the edge rendering independence complex is contractable, and that's kind of the only thing that can happen. And that's kind of the only thing that can happen. And if this is interesting because the reason we started looking at this is because if you look at the restriction of the Taylor complex or the edge covering complex, and you have something like this, then that complex is going to be a cone. And then if you keep looking for things like this, so you have a a graph, you reduce it, and then you keep reducing it, and at some point you find something like this. That's the only case where the original graph had a contract point in samples. And I contract for independent samples. So we kind of find a cone somewhere, which is stronger. Yeah, and then what we call this is an SPL because it is stuck between leaves. So the edge step between these? Yeah. So now we can go back to ternary graphs. So given a ternary graph G and a subset of the vertices such that you kind of break all the cycles. So when you remove all the vertices in S, you get a force. Then whenever you have an independent set, this graph, where you remove the closed neighborhood of A and just divert the rest, not the neighborhood, acts like a subgraph of this one. So it's also going to get forced. So, it's also going to be a force. And then, well, given a set S and a terrible graph G, we can count the number of forests that we have like this, that have an uncontractable independence complex. And then we take a power of this number, so we take minus 1 to the k, and we call this the sine of the graph. And then the theorem that we have is that the independence complex of a ternary graph G is going to be contractible if and only if. Is going to be contractible if and only if the sign is positive. So when you count the number of forces that you have like this, you either get an even number or an odd number. And if it's even, the independence complex is contractible. If it's odd, it's not contractible. So here we have an example of how do you compute the sign. So let's say we have this ternary graph, when we had the example. We can take these two vertices. Vertices, they kind of break up the cycle. So when you remove them, you get a forest. Yeah, so since we have two vertices and they are both, like they are independent, there's no light between them, we end up with four forests in total, right? Because we can remove just E and B, we can remove the closed neighborhood of B and E, we can remove the closed neighborhood of one of them and just the other, and so on. So the first one that we get, when we remove the closed neighborhood of both of them, Removes the close neighborhood of both of them is a star, so it has a non-contractable independence. That's one. The second one is this graph. And you see that we find this graph here. So this H, H I, the edge, both of the endpoints are adjacent to these, so it's contractible. This one has an isolated vertex, also has the SPL, so it is also a So it is also contractable. And the last one, the fourth one, we also have this edge here. Both of the endpoints are adjacent to an east. We have something like this. So the independence complex is going to be contractible. And so we only have one of those forests. So the sign is going to be minus one to the one. So the independence complex is not contractible in this case. And so now we know when it is contractible and we're going to determine what the dimension of this sphere is. And what we're going to do is, so we fix a ternary graph G and a set of vertices such that G minus S LaForest. And then we can think of all the graphs G, A, B, where A and B are disjoint subsets of S. We can think of them as vertices in a rooted binary tree, like this. So we can kind of Like this. So we can kind of give the labels as so we start from G, empty set, empty set, and then we go to G V1, empty set, and on the other side we go to G empty set V1 and so on. So if you go to the left, you add the vertex to the left. If you go to the right, you add the vertex to the right, and so on. In the end, you got a tree. Then, if we have a path from the root of the tree to one of the leaves, such that every vertex in the middle represents a graph that has a non-contractable independence complex, then we call that path a filtration of G. And we call it a filtration because we have something similar for the forests. The thing is for the forests, we always go to the left. We always remove the total. And we pick like a specific cell for the C. And pick like a specific server for the sys product. Okay. And then, well, now we have the main definitions. So given a ternary graph G with a non-contractable independence complex and we have a filtration of G, so these are like the vertices. The binary tree, the labelings. Then we can define these three numbers. So we can define the vertex division number of the filtration. Vertex deletion number of the filtration, which is going to be the number of times you went to the right in the path. You can define the deleted neighborhood of f, which is going to be at which steps did you go to the left? Because what we want to know is that we have the vertex itself. And then you can define the depth of the filtration to be the number of times you went to the left. So the like the combinatorial version of the theorem that we have is that the independence complex of G, the Turner graph, is going to be homotopy equivalent to this here. So it's like a depth minus one. And then like in particular, we can also do this for forests, for example. And the algebraic version that we have is that the projective dimension of the quotient of the Of the portion of the edge ideal is going to be the division number plus this sum of degrees, and the depth of the portion of the edge ideal is going to be the depth of the filtration. And in particular, it's nice because we have a vertical description of both, and we recover the projected dimension plus that number. And the algebraic part of the theorem is interesting because Is interesting because what we actually did here is we prove that the top on the top 20 degree in the resolution is actually coming from the top monomule in the LCM lens. There's nothing like weird happening. Yeah, and that's it. And well, just like a comment, this whole idea of the filtrations, similar things people have done before, just like in a different language. So for example, there's a I think like Kimura. I think by Kimura on bouquets of graphs, and then you get the non-vanishing of bary numbers. And then the bouquets, you can think of them as a filtration where you want to go to the left. Because you're kind of collecting the close neighborhood of birds. Thank you very much. Are there any uh questions or comments? I think an easy one. You gave an example where you removed two vertices and showed how everything worked. In that same example, you could remove one vertex and get a tree. Did you just pick the more interesting one to show the example? Yeah, because if I only picked one, it could be very simple, but no, no, it just depends on the set of vertices that you choose, the order, or anything. That is the question. Thank you. I have a question. So have you looked at the regularity? So we've looked at like the regularity and like so far we know for the regularity is just like we translate the Bay numbers to the homologies and then take a maximum. Can you describe it in terms of the majority of the just not like very clear what it is like just by looking at the graph. The theorem is for ternary graphs with non-contractable independence complex, but it can do the same thing for any ternary graph and just take a maximum. And just take a maximum.
