So, thanks for this invitation. I'm very sorry not to be able to be there. I had other conferences. One was in Canada and the previous week I'm in US now actually because of another duty. And I thought I could have come, but probably I'm too old to travel so often every week to change. So often every week to change the continent, and I'm very sorry. So I had to, I hope next time to arrange my schedule better and being able to come very soon. So what I want to talk about today is work which we are doing with Martin Atzista, my PhD student. And well, it's likely different from PDE. In some sense, it's completely different and is related how to control. Is related how to control the spring, well, the evolution of set in some sense. The problem is called blocking fire problem, but okay, let's see. So the idea is that you start with a region which is here is omega zero, and the fire is spreading from omega zero with speed one everywhere. I don't know if I can. Okay, it's not working the time. Work in the time. So you start with omega 0, is the reason at the center, and then with speed one, the fire moves in every direction, but it cannot cross a barrier. And the barrier are these black lines. And the control you have on the fire is the way you build the barrier. So you see that there are some, so for example, the blue curve is the time the file arrives to. The fire arrives to some point. So in time t, it arrives to, it burns the region, the dashed region here. And you see that the time that it takes to arrive to the border of this region is equal to t, but the curve have to avoid the black barrier, the black wall. So and the the the green the green part of the barrier is the bar. Part of the barrier is the barrier that you need at that time in order to have T shape of the Barnet region. Omega T is the region which is Barbara time T. So you see that the other part of the barrier, the barrier which has not been reached by fire, is in some sense free. So this is important. In some sense, there is some part of the barrier which is really needed and the control you have to choose what to do with the next time. What to do with the next time. Okay, so this is a way of presenting the mathematical situation. And the goal is whether you are able to stop the fire in finite time, or the fire is going to spread in the whole plane. Okay, now we have to put some constraint because, of course, so far you can do that, you just build a ball. So the thing is that, so let's start with mathematics. So let's start with mathematically. So the barrier is a Borel set with finite length in R2, and the fire propagates in every direction with unit speed, starting with the set omega zero, which is the initial region which is in fire, but the curve, I mean, the direction it can take, they cannot cross the barrier that you are building. Okay, let me say that you can generalize. You can generalize the problem by taking, for example, that the speed depends on the point and depends on the direction. But here is a very specific question that we will say later. So the Bernard region is the open set, relatively open, which is reached by fire at time t. So at the point in omega t, it means that there exists a curve which connects to the initial phi region. Initial phi region and as length less than t and it does not cross your your boundaries, your wall. And finally, this is the point. So in some sense, you can build the wall with a finite speed. You cannot build the wall with infinite speed. In that case, clearly, you can close the fire immediately. So the thing is that you have a fine. Is that you have a finite speed of construction of the wall? The general setting is that this speed depends on the place. So, for example, in some parts, it's more difficult to build it, you are on a hill, or if you are instead in a flat plane, it is much faster. But here we simplify the thing. I mean, the conjecture relates on to the fact that the speed with which you can build the wall. With which you can build the wall is constant, and let's say is equal to sigma. So the condition is that the length at time t of the battery that you can build is less than sigma t. That's the condition. And now let's say the problem, the problem is with this condition, so the file propagates with speed one in every dimension, and the length of the barrier you can build at time t is less than sigma t. Is it possible to block? Is it possible to block the file or not? So this is the so let's question is which is sigma t, the minimal sigma t. Okay, let's start with some example, of course. So the sum example was done by the sun and then, okay, the sun and the Lelis and Roby, they get more general situation. So if the sigma, so the speed with which you can build the file is greater than two, you can block. file is greater than two you can block the file and the the the explicit construction is okay apart some some initial segment which is this non-saturated part that you have on the right okay what you take is some two pieces of a spiral logarithmic spiral in in polar coordinates and either computationally explicit in the sense that I give you explicit the angle Give you explicit the angle between the normal direction of the ray and the normal is this alpha over there. And this alpha is computed by the formula sigma is equal to 2 over cosine of alpha. And you see immediately that you need to have sigma greater than 2 in order to be able to close the file because the alpha cannot be zero. So this is an explicit example and it can be proved that it is optimal among simple curves. Among simple curves. Okay, so sigma greater than two, there exists an explicit construction which shows that you can close the file. And then once you have at least one solution, you can ask which is the best one, giving some functional with some cost, which is the area, the burn area, and for example, the cost of building a fire. But we are interested in the problem if there exists at least one strategy closing the fire. Closing the fire. Okay, there is another strategy you can invent. So, here the idea you see that the green part is the part where the fire has already arrived. And in some sense, you see the fire evolves along these orange lines. And you need two guys at a time to close the fire. So, you need two people that are working to the two sides of this shape. Well, one can think that. Well, one can think that one guy is just running around the origin, and at some point is able to close the fire because of the spiral-like shape that they have here. So, the black curve at some point is closed itself. And so, Bressan, Befo Bressand, he did some numerical computations, some idea. So, let's assume that the idea is that you have looked idea is that you are looking whether for which sigma you have for which speed you have a self-signal solution. Cell signal solution, they cannot close, of course, because it's a cell signal. So and he discovered that when sigma is less or equal than a number, a specific number which is computed is the eigenvalue of an operator, then It terms out that you can close for sure if it is greater than this number, you can close. It is open if you if it is less than this transcendental number, it is not close. So, okay, let's see that. Okay, so this is more or less the two situations. So, one situation is sigma greater than two, and with the strategy we have at least two branches. Two branches, and now the wall is built by a spiral act. And if it is larger than some number, you can close it. Otherwise, you cannot. Okay. Otherwise, it was open, you cannot. So let's see, just to have the feeling why. So now the conjecture is what happened when you are below this two problems. To problem. So, in general, the conjecture is if sigma is less or equal than 2, then the phi can be blocked or not. So, what is the minimal sigma? And the conjecture is that it is true. So, it's very easy to prove, for example, if you assume some structure on the barrier, then that sigma equal to is the critical value. Sigma equal to one is very easy because. To one is very easy because you build the barrier with the speed of the fire, and if you think a little bit, it's impossible that you can block the fire. I mean, when you arrive, when the fire burns with you, you cannot do anything else that just run away. You cannot try to close and circle the fire. And another thing that was done by Alberto Bressan is, for example, to prove that if the barrier is a simple If the barrier is a simple close, a simple curve, then you cannot close it unless you have a sigma greater than two. And okay, I did some comments here. More or less, the idea is you can always improve the barrier. It says you have a barrier with a shorter length, and at the end, this barrier is convex. And okay, do some of my, I will not enter into the details, but you can prove at the end you get a contradiction. You get a contradiction. So, this is the conjecture that is now opening, unfortunately. And what is missing is that you can build some barrier inside the region just to slow down the evolution of fire. So, that's why the proof here is not complete. Another thing is what happens now if you assume that the barrier is spiral-like, so it's a Is spiral-like, so it's just a simple connected curve. And there was a proof by Klein, Langepe, and Lev Copoulos. And they proved that if sigma is less than this number here, then you cannot block the fire. Okay, here is a short proof, but basically, the idea is that the fire is always sufficiently fast to burn the previous. So if the points P. So, if the points Pi are the points on the axis and/90 degree from the origin, and they check that if sigma is less than that number, the fire is always arrived to the previous point. So it's impossible to block the fire because it has already been outside the barrier. Okay, so what we did basically is to try to get to prove the conjecture for Prove the conjecture for a spiral strategy. So we want to prove if we arrive to the critical number, and the critical number is 2.61. Well, it's a precedental number. Okay, for this problem, well, since at the beginning, the idea is that the barrier is some borel set with finite length, it means they can be extremely complex. So the the the my I Yeah, our idea is that you start with a complex situation, then you prove that if the barrier is admissible in the sense that it's built with a speed less than sigma, you can improve the regularity until you get a situation where you can do the final computation proving that you can close the file or not. So in this case, some simplification is... Simplification is that the file started in just one point and the barrier is outside the unit wall. Okay, these simplifications are completely trivial because they are based on the fact that the problem is scaling back. There is nothing else here. So the important quantity, however, is how to tell that the barrier is admissible and the admissibility. And the admissibility, I remember, it means that you build the file, the length of the barrier is bound by sigma time. And so we introduced this admissibility function, which is the function which tells you if whatever you are building is good or not. And so exactly for any given point x in the barrier is exactly the time that the fire takes to arrive to that point minus the length. Minus the length of the barrier burn until to that time. And this is the function which tells you which barriers are okay or not. And another important thing is that if you remember at the beginning, I told you there is some path which is burned by the fire, which is not burned. So there are some points in the barrier where when you arrive there, is exactly the function is zero, which means that at that point. Is zero, which means that at that point, exactly, you cannot touch the barrier because the barrier is, I mean, is you are on the boundary of the admissibility set in some sense. So you should need to have that A is larger than zero, larger or equal than zero. So when you are exactly zero, you have to be careful. On the other hand, where you are in a point where the admissibility function is greater than zero, you can perturb it. So this is another simplification, which tells you that. So, this is another simplification. It tells you that whenever you are not in the saturated set, but you are in the unsaturated sets, you can perturb the barrier and get maybe something better. More or less, this is the idea. So, now in which sense you have a better barrier? The barrier is better. Okay, there are several functions because you can say the cost of the region which is barn, and then. The region which is barn, and then the cost of building a barrier. We are interested only in the existence of a strategy because the optimality, once you have at least one admissible barrier, for sure you have an optimal barrier. So for us, the functional is the length. We want to have a barrier which is our minimum length. So the trick from now on is to simplify the To simplify the structure of the spiral barrier in order to get a barrier which is better than the other, in the sense that the length is lower. Okay, so now some definition. So, okay, this definition is just technical is how to write the spiral barrier. But the important thing is here. So the spiral barrier can be, you can change coordinates instead of writing well a function of. Writing well, a function of the length from s into r2. So you can write like phi. So you give the rotation angle around the origin, the blue quantity, and then the length of the ray between the tangent at that rotation angle and the next point of the spiral. So what did I just keep? I just keep some tagging apart. Trust me that you can rewrite the this change of coordinates is okay, just describe all the spiral stuff you can have in mind. So with this in mind, the advantage of this is that you are able to rewrite the spiral, the equation, I mean the evolution of the spiral like a delayed differential equation. Differential equation and okay, the lead of differential equation is here, and the control parameter at time is the so at the end of the gray array, you can decide the slope of the spiral, and it is this angle beta. However, the evolution of the spiral at the time depends on what happened at the angle before, which is this phi prime, and there is a relation between phi prime and b. is a relation between phi prime and beta and phi and you see this delayed ODE because delayed the differential equation because the value the evolution depends on the previous value but is really is quite difficult because the delay depends on the solution itself which is well is more complicated than the standard one okay but this is the case I mean there is nothing else so This is the case. I mean, there is nothing else. So, what we did today is to up to this point is to rewrite this very general problem, which is, I mean, I give me a Borel set with finite length compute or in this case, a spiral, and compute if it is admissible, non-block the file. We are able to rewrite into a delayed differential equation, which is much better in some sense, because it's. Better in some sense because it is, I mean, you can do something, and now you can also rewrite the admissibility function explicitly in this coordinate. And this is the formula. It's a complicated form, but this is what it is. Okay, when we have this in hand, now we have to ask what to do with this two, the constraint, which is the admissibility function and the delay differential equation. Okay. What I don't like is the problem. Since we don't know if there exists an optimal spiral, because we don't know if the spiral, if we are able to close the fire, we prefer to change the problem and say, give me an angle, phi bar, and you want to ask which is the barrier, the barrier, such that the R at that angle, so if we come back, R is So, if we come back, R is this green length, is minimal. So, essentially, you say at that rotation angle, I want to find the barrier which minimizes the distance. I mean, this distance between the point where R starts and the endpoint. And the advantage is that I'm not talking about empty sets because a priori so far since we don't know if there exists or not a barrier. Exist or not a barrier, to say which is the barrier which closes the minimal length is like talking with a set which is empty. So it's difficult for me to touch. I mean, I mean, touching something which is empty. But certainly instead this question is clear. And indeed, if I get from the delayed ODE that the minimal R is negative. R is negative. What it means is it means that at some previous point R was zero. And if you come back to the picture, when R is zero, it means exactly that the next branch of the spiral touches the previous one. So the file is blocked. So the advantage is that with this minimization problem, I'm not talking about an empty set. I'm talking a set which is not empty, and then I feel better. I feel better. Okay, so an example of a specific barrier which is admissible is when the control parameter is constant and this is an angle which is computed by the speed that is the only one. So, okay. And I have to assign the initial data for Andy Laod and this is done by computing what is the spiral for the first round around the origin. And okay, this is the explicit formula. Okay, this is the explicit formula, you can compute it, and uh now we get that when this is a specific OD, well, it is an operator, but the delay is linear, and the delay does not depend on the solution because I fixed the angle alpha. So you can do the math and say that when this blows up or closes, well, it turns out it depends only on the equation at the bottom, so the eigenvalue equation. So, the eigenvalue equation, and now you see that there exists a solution only when you have some critical number, and the number was this 261 number that I told you before. Okay, so this is the reason why 261 is the number that you get. So, how we approach the problem? The idea is, are we able to give a guess of what is the best closing spiral? This was more or less the idea. Was more or less the idea. And indeed, we were able to give what is the best closest viral up to a number which is 2π. The construction, well, is some sense delicate. I try to picture here. So you have some part which is a circle, an arc of a circle, then a segment, and then the saturated spiral. But okay, in any case, it is explicit while complicated formula. And then we prove that this is really the optimal one up to some angle. Up to some angles. However, we hoped would be optimal. We proved also that it is not optimal for some angle larger than 2π. So at this point, how to manage the stuff? So the idea, and here I'm just closing the stuff. So the idea is that we don't need actually to have a precise guess. We need to have a guess which maybe is not admissible. Is maybe is not visible, which is this black curve. You see, at some point, I introduce a perturbation, and well, the choice of perturbation is really depends. Here I decided to subtract a piece, but actually at the end is slightly more complicated. But okay, you can think like instead of a heavy and admissible spiral, I say some spiral which is not admissible, which means it closes faster. Closes faster, but still diverges. And I can prove that it is inside all other spirals which are missing. So, in some sense, I have a lower bound. And the key point is to give the right guess. It's not that the difficult part is to give the right guess. Okay, so how to prove that the and well, we did the right guess for up to some, well. Some, well, I will tell you in the end, but okay. So we gave a guess, and how to prove that this guess is optimal? The idea is that, so you give me an admissible spiral, which is the black part, and then at some point I switch to my guess. So I say that from that point only, you follow this gray curve, which is built, you see. Curve which is built, you see, resemble the structure here. So I have some admissible path, and then I subtract something with the jump. So this is more or less, and the computation are explicit, however complicated. So what, because it is in any case a retarded DOD, so we put the guess into a computer, and the computer will tell me if the idea is correct or not. So, and so let me conclude the talk, which is The talk, which is how the proof works. We are not able yet to arrive to 261, but we are able to arrive to 2.4. And the fact really depends on the way we perturb it. So I believe that if we are very careful, we could read to the limit to the critical case. But okay, let's say tonight, up to t Okay, let's say tonight, up to today we have 2.4. So the idea is that we guess what is the best closing spiral, but it's impossible to guess it because it's a complicated object, not explicit. But we really don't need to be that precise. We need to get a guess which is almost the good one. And the almost good one means that you Good one means that you have you perturb what you think would be the good one, and then certainly you have a family of curves which can only be worse and worse. So the idea was this one. Whenever I start from one point, the next one will only get worse. So in some sense, this is like to say that among the family of these perturbations, the first one is the best. First, one is the best. All the others, they are just larger. Then, if I have this family, I have to check that the first of my perturbed spiral, which here is this black one, is really blowing up. And to do that, we have to check that, well, it's quite complicated. We have to check that some conditions on the eigenvalue of the operator is. eigenvalue of the operator is verified and indeed what at the end we put into mathematica which checks that some function is positive or not and finally so we are able to well we reduce to some thing that we can really compute actually we cannot compute it so what we did is that we arrived to some quantities for the perturbable spiral which have to be analyzed by Which had to be analyzed by a computer because the expressions are very complicated. But after all this stuff, we are able to prove that the gas, the black gas, which is over here, so the first one bounds all your admissible spirals. The black gas is not closing, so you cannot close whenever the speed is less than, in this case, unfortunately, we have. This case, unfortunately, we have 2.4 and not 2.61. The last comment I want to say about this approach is that, okay, some quantities, so let me say the TTIS problem is there is no a clear mathematical setting. So one of the difficulties were really to arrive to this retard delayed differential equation, which gives you some setting and then to be. Use some setting and then to build upon it the proof. However, once we found this setting, some definitions can be extended to the general setting where the barrier is not a curve, but is just any boreal set. However, it's already complicated here, so we didn't have time to analyze if the thing. if the thing works. So I think if I'm not wrong, my time is finished. So I was very sloppy in the presentation because unfortunately some part is done with the computer and I don't know how to present this part here. So thank you your attention and forgive me if I couldn't come there. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you.
