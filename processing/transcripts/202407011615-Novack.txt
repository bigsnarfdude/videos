 Sorry, I think so you can see less favourite. Sure. Yeah. So after five to yeah, right before two o'clock. Yeah. Professor Bell, could you tell us about all these other events that are happening? Which other events? There's all these events, like, especially in round tape balls. Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, but you know about it. I know about this, yes. What do you want to know about them? Oh, yes, you have to prepare, yes, you have to yes, yes, so fully participating. So fully participating. Yes, we can. I got a really great. Okay, let's start again with Mike Novak. We can speak about the Parisian model for 3D features in film telephones. Thanks for the introduction, and thanks to the organizers for this invitation to speak at this very nice conference. I'm going to be talking about some work I've been About some work I've been doing on soap films and soap foams and the like. And the talk is essentially going to be divided into two parts. In the first part, we're going to look at a sharp interface model, variational model, for soap films. And the key feature here is that rather than imagine the soap film as a surface, we're going to imagine it as an object with small but positive. Object with small but positive volume. And this is going to allow us to capture features of cell phones that you can't with this zero volume point of view. I'll tell you what some of those features are when we get there. And then in the second half of the talk, I'm going to tell you about a diffuse interface approximation of this problem that we've done. And the goal here is going to be to have a nice PDE or diffuse interface model that approximates. Interface model that approximates singular soap films or singular minimal surfaces. And everything I'm going to talk about is based on joint works with Francesco, my former postdoc mentor, Daniel, who is his student, now is postdoc at Johns Hopkins, and Anna, who just finished her PhD at Princeton and is starting her postdoc at Berkeley. Okay, so I have a little bit of fun before we start. Alright, a little bit of fun before we start. Here's these two positions. On one hand, you have Lord Kelvin allegedly claiming that you can spend a whole life studying a single soap bubble. And then in response to that, we are in Hustler said that, well, the students of Plateau's laws will need at least two bubbles in contact to progress beyond the obvious. The boy here in this picture, in this painting, appears undecided. It's a little bit hard to tell, but that's a double bubble and that's a single bubble. That's a double bubble, and that's a single bubble. So he's torn between the two group here. I can't make a career out of one bubble problems. So we're going to be looking at multiple bubbles or singular structures in surfaces. And the starting point of our analysis is the famous Plateau's laws. So take a wide Take a wire frame, dip it in soap, pull it out, you find a surface. And he posited the following rules that govern these silk films. So you have actually not a single surface maybe, but a union of smooth surfaces. And on each of these smooth surfaces, at the points where you're sufficiently regular, you have vanishing mean curvature. Of course, that's just the minimal surface. Of course, that's just the minimal surface equation. And then, when these surfaces meet, they can only meet in two prescribed fashions. One is along a curve of so-called Y points, where you essentially have three sheets meeting at a 120-degree angle. And then curves of Y points terminate in the interior, so away from the wire frame, at a so-called T-point. frame at a so-called T point. So the T point is, if you zoom in there, what you'll see is this cone over the regular tetrahedron. So you take each pair of vertices of this tetrahedron, connect it to the centroid, form this triangle, and then you look at the cone spanned by all those triangles. And then, of course, in 2D, the picture is a lot simpler. You just have segments because of the vanishing curvature. Because of the vanishing mean curvature, that meet at equal angles in these Y points. Okay, and I should say that, to my knowledge, the possible singular structures that you get on the boundary, so at the wire frame itself, are not even known at the level of conjecture. So that's an interesting open problem. Okay, so mathematically speaking, the way we talk about this is Plateau's problem. This is the plateau's problem. And the problem is to find the surface S of least area spanning a given bound of W. So W is for wire. Because I can only usually draw in 2D, it's usually going to be a couple of dots. And you're sweeping massive amounts of mathematical detail under the rug here in this statement because what you get out of this problem crucially depends on the way in which you interpret. Depends on the way in which you interpret the concepts of surface, area, and spanning/slash boundary. And I'm not going to get into the whole history of the plateau problem. I'm going to totally skip some of the ones with Gilt Metal. But there's these very nice articles, one by David and this other one by DeLullis that contain descriptions of the various versions of this problem that have been put forth. Okay, now. Okay, now we're going to be interested in a version of this problem, or a starting point of our analysis, is the version that captures the plateau-type singularities that I showed you. And this began with the work of Angren and Taylor in the 70s. So, what Angren did is he figured out the right local minimality condition that will lead to plateau-type singularities. And the correct condition is that minimality. And the correct condition is that minimize this Hn minus 1 is the surface area in Rn. Locally minimize the surface area amongst all Lipschitz deformations of your surface. You're not going to demand that it's a Lipschitz diffeomorphism. You are going to require that this identity outside of a compact set, so local deformations. And in this picture, I can explain to you why you get plateaus laws out of this. Get plateaus laws out of this. So, why should a quadruple junction split into triple junctions? It's because the fact that you've allowed Lipschitz deformations that are not Lipschitz diffeomorphisms means that you can smash the X down onto these down onto this green segment. So the map is not one-to-one. And this is the only way that you're allowed to split this quadruple junction into triple junctions. If you try this with a diffeomorphism, If you try this with a diffeomorphism, it won't work. Okay, so this is the fundamental observation of Waldbren: that this notion of local minimality is the right one if we want to talk about Plateau's laws. And then Taylor, in her seminal work following Algren, showed that in the physical dimensions, this notion of local minimality does, in fact, force surfaces that satisfy. Surfaces that satisfy Plateau's laws. So the only admissible singular structures are indeed the ones that I showed you on the previous slide. Okay, now we have our right notion of local minimality, but we haven't specified our notion of spanning the boundary. And it turns out that this is a highly non-trivial problem and was only solved about 10 years ago by Harrison and Pugh. So they figured out the right notion of span a wire. Of span a wireframe that leads to long-run minimizers. Okay, and their notion is really elegant and simple, and it goes like this. You fix a wireframe, so the three dots in the picture on the left, and then you fix what's called a spanning class, and it's simply a family of smooth loops that's closed by homotopy relative to the wireframe. So on the left, everyone that's homotopic to one of these three blue circles. Three blue circles. Okay, and the idea here is that, let's say you imagine the problem in 3D, you have a simple closed curve that's your wire frame, and you look at all the loops that loop through it exactly one time with linking number one. You demand that your surface intersects all of these loops at least once, which is like saying that none of these loops can puncture your surface. It has to indeed span the wireframe. Frame. Okay, so this is the notion of spanning and boundary that leads to longer and minimal sets than the plateau problem. And this was proved by Harrison and Pew and then also reproved and made more flexible by Dorelis, Geraldine, and Maggie. So you make a compactness argument, you prove that the object that you get out of this is a long renewable. That you get out of this is longer than minimal. Therefore, you plug into the Taylor theory and you know that you have a formulation plateaus problem in the plateau type symbol varies. Okay, now the downside of this very beautiful condition from the perspective of analysis is that it's extremely fickle. So if I remove even one point from this S, I fail the spanning condition. So it's highly unstable, which is not going to make it amenable to, let's say, compactness. To make it amenable to, let's say, compactness arguments. Because, how am I going to know that some limiting object satisfies a condition that's restrictive? Okay. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, we're interested in features of films and foams that can't be captured by this 2D idealization. So, there's lots of interesting properties, stability properties, drainage properties that are related to these 3D structures. Can't be captured by dry surfaces. Dry is the terminology in the literature when there's no volume. And an example of such a structure is what's called a plateau border. And it's a thickened tube of liquid that wets a line of Y-point singularities. So the picture on the left, you can see if you zoom in close enough, that it's not really a Y-point there, but it's a little bit of extra liquid. And that's the plant of Hork. And that's a plateau border. That's a picture of it. This is just one from a multitude that you could pull off Google if you Google plateau borders. And what we want to do is formulate a plateau type problem with minimizers that A exhibit singularities obeying plateau's laws, where here you're going to have to be careful that you're looking at the distance that's sufficiently large with respect. That's sufficiently large with respect to the volume of the film, right? Because if you zoom in too close, that doesn't look like a Y point, but if you zoom out, it does. And second, we want to be able to capture these plateau borders and other related features. And we want to try and identify mathematically what's happening that contributes to these structures and anything else that we can say. Okay, so the Okay, so the main idea of what's happening when you add in the volume can be captured with this really simple example. So imagine you're in the picture on the left, and you have, in this case, maybe you can imagine it's a foam inside this ball, and the purple interface divides the ball into these four chambers. And if we're imagining that there's a very small amount of liquid. There's a very small amount of liquid contained in the interface, then there's surface tension energy on either side of all these purple line segments. So the total surface tension energy in this ball B, rather than just measuring life, we're going to just double it and sum the relative perimeters inside the ball of all these chambers. Okay, and with this point of view, it's really simple to see why these plateau borders are. See why these plateau borders arise. So let's say you're standing here with the liquid and you get to allot it, move it wherever you like. Where are you going to move it so that you decrease this sum of the perimeters the most? Well, each of these A1, A2, A3, A4, there are zero mean curvature, except at the vertices where they have infinite mean curvature. And so you want to put the liquid there, because that's like pushing inward from the point of infinite mean curvature. From the point of infinite mean curvature, it's going to decrease the length the fastest. And you can actually indeed show that. So the optimal wet configuration is simply the one that wets all these triple junctions. And this is completely explicit. It's three circle arcs that meet these dry parts tangentially, and they have to be the same, form these little triangles of the same volume, and you can compute exactly what curves. And you can compute exactly the curvature and how much energy you're saving, et cetera, by doing this. Okay, so that was something I proved about a year ago. It was actually in the context of a different problem, but this was a byproduct of the analysis there. And then this picture leads to the following conjectured local equilibrium rules for wet films. I'm going to state them like an analyst. Like an analyst. You can find them also in this really nice book, The Physics of Foams. It's right after Plateau's laws. So, Plateau's laws is equilibrium rule A, and then following it is equilibrium rule B, which in mathematical parlance is the following two conditions. First, that your surface S, so the purple set, is its boundary is either Its boundary is either locally a minimal surface, vanishing mean curvature, constant mean curvature surface, so either the line segments or the circle arcs. And when the line segments meet the circle arcs, they do so tangentially. And so you say to yourself, what's the regularity that you get when you take a straight line and then glue a circle to it? And it's C11. Okay? The physicists would say that the normal makes a continuous transition. Normal makes a continuous transition across the transition region between the wet and dry regions. And then, also, based on this picture, you would conjecture that this transition region between the wet region in the middle and the dry region on the outside is n minus two-dimensional. And then in 2D, this is indeed easy to verify simply because you're fooling around with curves. But in 3D, it's much harder, and it was essentially open. It was open. The previous two works that I want to mention in this direction are the works of King, Magi, and Stuvard first. So what they did is they looked at a plateau type problem, taking that Harrison Q spanning condition and minimizing perimeter among sets with a fixed positive volume. Okay? And what happens is it And what happens is exactly what you would think should happen based on the previous slide. You have this phenomenon of collapsing, meaning that all the liquid accumulates in some given region and leaves you with this so-called dry part elsewhere in the film. Okay, so they studied this problem. They proved that as the volume parameter goes to zero, you recover the pliteau problem of Harrison and Pew. Problem of Harrison and Pugh. So, this should indeed give you a good model if you want to capture Plateau's laws. But because of the difficulty of this collapsing feature, there were a lot of open questions. So, the existence of minimizers is open. This is related to the delicacy of that condition that I mentioned previously. And the regularity and size of the transition region, so those equilibrium rules, are also completely open. Okay, and then the Okay, and then the foam version of this problem was studied by Bracchi and Morgan. So they did the same thing, but now with chambers. And they say, let's minimize the sum of the perimeters relative to this ball, subject to a volume constraint on the purple region, plus some boundary conditions that are the boundaries of each of these chambers. And in R2, they can recover the existing sharp regularity that I mentioned. Sharp regularity that I mentioned, but in R3 and above, it's completely open. And from the perspective of analysis, what's happening here is that the object that you get out of this minimization procedure is not one to which the known geometric regularity criteria easily apply. So that would be Alex's theorem. Okay, so what's our problem? We're going to minimize directly in this collapse class. So we look at wet salt films. Look at wet silt films that contain an interface K, so that's the blue set, and a wet region E, that's the purple set. And then the surface tension energy is twice along the dry region. So that's, in terms of mathematical terms, that's K minus the reduced boundary of the purple set E, the reduced boundary simply being the boundary minus the three points. And then along the And then, along the boundary of V or the reduced boundary, technically speaking, you only count surface tension with coefficient 1. And then, okay, you demand that the volume is V and that you span the film in this sense of Harrison EQ. And so what we were able to show with Francesco and Daniel is that, okay, you have existence, you have convergence as it goes to zero to the plateau problem, meaning that at a length scale, Meaning that at a length scale sufficiently large with respect to the volume, you will see plateau type singularities. And then you have the sharp regularity and dimensional estimate on the transition region that you would like to have, that you would conjecture based on the 2D toy problem. And that's that K is locally either a smooth minimal surface, a smooth CMC surface, or two tangentially touching C11 surfaces. And this away from a small singular set. And this is away from a small singular set that's empty in physical dimensions and of the type that you can't avoid in these geometric variational problems. Then, lastly, you can verify that the transition region between the wet and dry parts of the film, so this is the topological boundary minus the reduced boundary, so that's just the three points of this little curvilinear triangle. It's codimension 2 in some nice sense, n minus 2 replifiable, so finite length. Okay, and I'm not going to get into the guts of the proof, but I want to give you the most important idea. And the idea is to reformulate that delicate condition in a way that makes it not so delicate. In particular, we'd like to make it compatible with compactness and lower semiconduity. And the idea is the following. So on the left, we have Harrison and Pugh. So you have the fashion. Harrison and Pew. So you have the family of loops, and your surface S must intersect all the loops homotopic to that blue one. Okay, we have to throw away loops. They're measure zero objects. Let's give ourselves instead a tube and ask ourselves what's happening topologically on this tube when the surface S cuts the tube. Well, it's not disconnecting the two by itself, but if I give myself any other Any other slice of this annulus, the union of S-intersect the tube and the red set does disconnect the tube into two pieces. So there's some sort of disconnecting that's happening here. And that's going to work for every little red segment except the one that overlaps with the purple one. So for almost every segment, you say that, well, this S unit. You say that, well, this S union that said there is disconnecting the two. And that's the idea. Now, disconnecting is still something that's topological. We do analysis, so we're going to formulate this in a measure theoretic sense. So what you do is you translate all that topology into measure theory. You say to yourself, what does it mean for a Borel set to disconnect another Borel set? And it doesn't, I'm not going to get into what that does. And it doesn't, well, I'm not going to get into what that means, but the key features are: A, that it's now stable with respect to the energy, which is great. It agrees with the Harrison T definition on closed sets, so you've not ruined anything. And now you have a partition of this tube in the sets of finite perimeter. And sets of finite perimeter are the easiest type of class to work in. Compactness and lower summit time it would be comes for free, essentially. Essentially. And so, okay, I'm swooping an analysis under the rug. But the point is that with this definition, you can indeed prove that you have existence, and this asymptotic convergence is the high-to-travel. Okay. Now, one slide on the verification of the equilibrium rules. Okay, so first step is to again. First step is to again observe that there's some partitioning problem going on here. So, if you look at this soap film spanning the wireframe with the four dots, and you zoom in at that ball B, you again have three chambers, A1, A2, and A3. And now, this part is new and it's actually very simple. What you do is you say to yourself, well, I want to make some comparison argument based on minimality that allows me to deduce some regularity. And so, what you do is you leave A1 and A3, and you perturb A2 by itself. And that gives you a new wet salt film that you see on the right. And the difference in energy between these two, because you've not touched A1 and A3, is simply the difference between the climators inside B. Between the perimeters inside B of A2 and A2 prime, the perturbation. Okay, you have to account for the error that you made in changing the volume, but that's a lower order term. And the point is that this picture tells you that up to this lower order term, each of your chambers locally minimizes perimeter. And then you quote the classical regularity theory for such objects, and you deduce that you have C1α interfaces. C1 alpha interfaces. Okay, so these competitors are new, they weren't known to Bradley Morgan, they'll go to KMAG Stubar. If they were, then you could have gotten the regularity. Okay, so then we're not quite there yet. We don't have the optimal regularity of C11, and we don't have an estimate on the size of the transition region between the wet and dry parts of the film. But luckily for us, the three boundary people have been hard at work for decades doing this. And hard at work for decades doing this. So, here we're able to just quote: so, this is the two-membrane problem. So, you have surface area, some of the surface areas of these two-order graphs. So, u and v, and then you have some Lagrange multipliers. So, when u and v separate, that's the constant in curvature. And then some results from the mathematical literature on this problem allow you to upgrade C1 alpha to C11. Alpha to C11, and they tell you that the transition region between wet and dry is indeed n minus two-dimensional or color dimension two. Okay, so some work in preparation. These singularities should act as a selection mechanism for plateau problems that have non-uniqueness. So, meaning if you consider the configuration of four dots as your Configuration of four dots as your wireframe and your loops that are these dotted curves. Then there's two configurations with equal energy, the two disks, and then this other configuration. And at the level of the dry problem, their energies are equal, but at the level of the wet problem, this one is going to cost less than whatever it would take to wet. Than whatever it would take to wet those two segments. So you're able to approach in energy from below if you have singularities in a limiting minimal surface. So this is a more robust formulation of the toy problem where you're able to decrease the energy by allocating an extra liquid to the singularities. Okay, we also like to show that these wet regions converge uniformly to the limiting singular set of the Limiting singular set of the minimal surface on the right, if there is one, and that if the plateau minimizer is smooth, then you can't have collapsing. So in this picture here, what's the best way to approximate this segment by two circle arcs? It's just this fattened picture here. And you notice that there's no collapsing here. The entire fill is wet. Okay, so I want to talk a little bit about the Allen-Kahn equation and Plateau's laws. And actually, this is the problem that we wanted to start with, but realizing we had to rework the whole dry, wet dry, sharp interface theory to solve it. And the problem is the following: you have your classical Allen-Kahn energy, so the epsilon times gradient U squared plus. Epsilon times gradient u squared plus a double well potential u, which we'll take to vanish as zero and one. So u here is thought of as the density distribution of soap. So that's why we take the Wells as zero and one. Okay, and then you have your Euler-Lagrange equations. And as epsilon goes to zero, it's been studied to depth in mathematical literature that the energy of minimizers or even critical points concentrates on minimal surface. Concentrates on minimal surface. So this is a diffuse interface approximation of minimal surfaces. Okay. Now, the point that interested us is that despite the fact that Alan Kahn approximates minimal surfaces and minimal surfaces can satisfy Planteau's laws, there's an incompatibility between Alan Kahn and Planteau's laws. And the incompatibility is that if you look at a C. Is that if you look at a sequence of stable solutions to this PE and you send epsilon to zero, you actually get a smooth minimal surface in the limit all the way up to dimension seven. This was proved by Tonagara and the Sekara. And so that then leads to our question, which is, given the correspondence between the Allen-Kahn equation and normal surfaces, can we modify it somehow to resolve this incomplete? To resolve this incompatibility, so to allow us to approximate minimal surfaces with singularities like this y point. And the structure that we're after is basically just the diffuse interface approximation of the picture on the right. So u should be approximately one living in one of the wells on this purple set. Then there's a diffuse interface and it's zero elsewhere. Notice that it can see heuristically should be possible. Conceive heuristically should be possible if you give yourself a Lagrange multiplier here and you let that go to infinity. But with the bounded Lagrange multipliers and stable solutions, you can't have that. Okay, so our main theorem in this direction is an existence and asymptotic convergence result. So we minimize this diffuse interface energy, the allaton energy. We demand that the volume Demand that the volume of your diffuse interface silt film is in fact V, and then you add the spanning condition on the part of your density distribution that represents silk. So that's U equals 1. And then using the compactness machinery that I alluded to earlier, you can show that there exist minimizers. And that formally, so assuming all the regularity that you want on the solution. Regularity that you want on the solution and the set u equals one, you derive the following criticality conditions, which give you a free boundary problem. So away from the spanning set, you have the usual volume constraint Allen-Kahn equation. And then on the spanning set or the free boundary u equals one, you have this transmission condition between the normal derivatives coming from each side. On each side. Okay, now the other part of this result is that as epsilon goes to zero, we can prove that the minimizers to this problem actually do converge to minimizers for that positive volume plateau problem, which answers the question that I posed on the previous slide, namely, can we approximate singular minimal surfaces with minimizers for some Allen-Kahn variational problem? And more specifically, And more specifically, how does that go? Well, you travel along these asymptotic limits in epsilon and v, and if you do it in the right way, then you get the following picture. So you send epsilon to zero first, and you get that the picture here on the left converges to the wet silt film in the middle. Then you send V to zero, and the wet silt film converges to the dry one, satisfying Plateau's laws. Satisfying Plateau's laws, which means that if epsilon and V are small enough in the right way, then you do indeed have a diffuse interface approximation of a singular limit surface. Okay, so we did what we set up. Okay, and then those of you that are good sports and have already seen this talk twice, this is new for you. So with Daniel and Anna. With Daniel and Anna, then we set about to analyze this free boundary problem that you get. Okay, so you have your Alan-Kahn formulation of plateau, and you take a minimizer U. What we proved is that it is indeed locally Lipschitz, and that the free boundary, so the set U equals 1, has this decomposition into these two disjoint sets, a singular part and a regular part. A singular part and a regular part. The regular part is a nice hypersurface, and the singular part has codimension 2. So in the plane, what happens is that you basically have some CK alpha curves that meet at these singular parts. So we've characterized the possible blow-ups there at the junction. So they do indeed look like that. Although we don't know. Although we don't know, it is possible that there are quadruple junctions in this model. So we're currently thinking about that. But this is essentially the best you could hope for given the formal criticality conditions from this slide. Because with this condition on the normal derivatives, you're never going to get anything better than what's just. Okay. So it So, in the remaining five minutes, I want to tell you a little bit about the proof of this. Okay. So, you have your minimizer for this free boundary problem. The first step is to prove that it's C alpha for some alpha. And you say, well, why isn't that trivial via appeal? Trivial via appealing to some known theory. And the problem here is that you're really arguing with your hands tied behind your back because when you drive the usual Euler-Lagrange equations, you use outer variations. So you perturb your function u by some test function phi. And the problem is, if you do that, then you're liable to screw up this condition pretty badly. And so you don't have the usual. And so you don't have the usual Euler-Lagrange equation. So the argument has to proceed down a completely different route. That's what makes it kind of interesting. Okay. Now, how do I get from C alpha to Lipschitz? The idea in 2D is the following. If you look at blow-ups of If you look at blow-ups of 1 minus u at a point in the free boundary, then with the right assumption on the potential, you should blow up to a harmonic function and the harmonic away from the free boundary. Okay? And the possible functions that you can get like this are of the form r of the k over 2 times sine of k theta over 2 up to. k theta over 2 up to rotations. Okay, so for k equals 1, 2, and 3, your blow-ups look like this. Now, if these are your blow-ups, that makes the enemy of Lipschitz regularity the one that has r to the one half. Because anything else, r to the k over 2 for k at least 2 and sine k theta, is going to be Lipschitz. Okay, so the case that you want The case that you want to eliminate in these blow-ups is the case where k equals 1, which corresponds to the scenario in which your free boundary, when you zoom in at this point, just terminates in the middle of nowhere. Okay, and so what you need to do to get this Lipschitz regularity is eliminate that possibility. And the reason it shouldn't happen is the following. What is that little tendril doing? What is that little tendril doing to help me with the spanning condition? Nothing. I could chop that tendril off and still satisfy the spanning condition because if it terminates in the middle there, it can't really be disconnecting any of my tubes. Okay, so you can indeed turn that intuition into a proof. This is like the same reason the minimal surface in the plane can't just terminate somewhere. It's the maximum principle. And then you can eliminate. And then you can eliminate this possibility from your list of possible blow-ups, and then that's enough heuristically to believe that you should indeed get the chest regularity. And then lastly, how do we get this decomposition of the singular set and the description of the regular and singular parts of the singular set? So, the regular points, there's a really nice There's a really nice reflection argument where you take that free boundary problem and you reflect over the free boundary and then use that to show that this reflected function solves the usual PDE everywhere and that your free boundary locally is just one of the level sets of this function, at which point you can use the implicit function theorem and Theorem and under the right non-vanishing conditions on the gradient, derive that you have a smooth surface. So, this reflection argument is, you know, it's the first thing you would try, and it goes back to the perhaps the first version of this problem study in the literature that we found. So, it was, I think, in 1940, someone named Evans studied the minimal capacity problem. So, he wanted to find the minimize the Diraclay energy among Among sets whose one level set spans a given boundary. Okay. And then lastly, these singular points, how do we prove that they're a codimension two-set? Well, in 2D they're isolated, and then there's some sort of classical crank that you can turn that allows you to upgrade that to the dimensional estimate in all dimensions. All dimensions. So I think I'm about out of time, and thank you for your attention. So but thank you very much for this very, very nice talk. So I'm going to ask a very easy question to ask for me and probably a very hard for you and audience to ask. How do you know anything about higher code dimension? Have you ever heard of it? So, yeah, so there is a version of the Harrison Q problem that is formulated for the higher codimension Planteau problem. And instead of using linking curves, use linking spheres. The problem, as I see it there, is that the codimension one case is special in that it's going to give you the connection to sets of finite primitive. To give you the connection to sets a finite primitive. Yes. So if you wanted to solve a version of that problem, let's say, other than the plateau one, and you needed this weak notion in that case, I don't know how that would look. Maybe there is one. It's not obvious that we know. So the difficulty will be at the level of the measured theoretic version. Exactly. So for just the plateau. For just the plateau problem, no volume, just curves, let's say, and 3D decimal solved. Thank you very much. I think that's the last result that you have. Thanks. Thank you very much, Ethan. This estimates you do them for fixed epsilon, right? Yes. But do you have some rate with epsilon, or are we just? No, so that's a really natural question. In what sense do these free boundaries, what are their properties as epsilon goes to zero? I mean, you'd like to show that they converge in some sense. They look like they should be converging to a limited minimal surface. So you'd like to have curvature estimates, convergences verifolds, a bunch of other things. And a bunch of other things. That's all way ahead of us at this point. But yeah, there is the next natural question. Yeah. Might just be a terminology question, but Alan Kahn with the constraint of conserved volume, do you know if that's the same as what we call Pon Pilliard? And then what would the standing condition look like in a dynamical minimization? Dynamical minimization of proceeds here. At the level of energy, yeah. I think the difference between the terminology there is in the gradient flow. So yeah, at the level of energy is the same. What would the spanning condition look like if you were evolving some object like this? I mean, I'm not sure. So, from the perspective of numerics, I don't know how you would enforce it if you were to try and simulate this. From the perspective of analysis, I haven't really thought about it either, but that's an interesting question. I'll just say one thing about that. What I think could be cool would be to go back to the West Soul films. Back to the West Soul films and try and then take what we know about them and study the fluid flow through these plateau mortars. That'd be a time-dependent problem. It could be fun. We have next feature of the date.
