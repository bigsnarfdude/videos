Our hyperbolic navy stock system with small JRE class to data. This is based on joint work with Maurice Platku. So let me first give an informal derivation of this hyperbolic Pranter system. The Navier-Stock system governing the evolution of Newtonian viscous fluids is obtained from the momentum equation partial T of U. Partial t of u plus u dot gradient of u equals divergence of tau, coupled with Fourier's law to describe the first tensor, like tau of t equals minus p times identity matrix plus nu times gradient of u plus the transverse matrix of gradient of u the time t. So in this way here, this u. Way here, this U stands for the velocity field, P the scalar pressure function, and this nu is the viscosity coefficient of the fluid. However, these equations 1.1 and 1.2 give rise to a physical paradox. The heat transfer has infinite propagation speed. So to avoid this non-physical aspect, Aspect. Catanell in 1949 also, one note in 1961, proposed to modify the heat equation in a hyperbolic version known as Catanio's heat transfer law. And this leads to hyperbolic version of Navy stock system. So here, compared with the classical Navy stock system, we have a term like Ika, partial. term like eta partial t square of u in this in this evolution quotient of the plastic field so because here we have partial t square here for the initial data not only we have the initial data for this u we also have to propose initial data for the time derivative of u so there are already many results concerning the well postedness Concerning the well-postedness of this system, so for instance, we might check the following paper and for the reference therein. On the other hand, in order to describe geophysical fluids on the Earth, it's usually assumed that vertical scale is much smaller than horizontal one because the fluid layer dips is small compared. Is small compared to the radius of the Earth. So, in this situation, we just consider the system in a strip, a very thin strip like S epsilon, which equals R times zero to epsilon, and with a vanished viscosity nu equals epsilon squared. We complement this system, hyperbolic navier spec system, with non-sleep abound condition. with non-sleeper boundary condition like u on the upper boundary, lower boundary, y equals zero, and u on the upper boundary also equals zero. And with the initial condition, like u at time equals zero equals u zero x y over epsilon, y epsilon v zero x y over epsilon and we did not initial data by u zero epsilon on this small strip. On this small strip S of Yepshma. So, this in this situation, motivated by similar works by like Pierre Leance and myself and Pierre Leance and also my joint work with Maurice Peikou and Hi Vi Zhang for the classical nav structure system. In order to study this problem, we scale the solution U T X Y as U epsilon T. u epsilon t x y over epsilon and epsilon v epsilon t x y y over epsilon and the pressure function equals p of epsilon t x y over epsilon because we already scale the y variable like y over epsilon this scale the sin strip scene strip as if slam now becomes this s which equals x y e r 2 which equals xy r2 for y between 0 and 1 and because of the equation for this u we find this equation for this scaled u epsilon and of u epsilon as follows so for this u epsilon here satisfying this equation partial t squared of u epsilon plus partial t epsilon plus u epsilon partial x u epsilon plus v epsilon partial plus v epsilon partial y epsilon minus epsilon squared partial x squared u epsilon minus partial y squared u epsilon plus partial x p or epsilon equals zero with the space variable on the strip s and with time on zero to infinity and we also have this involution equation for this wave shown here and because of this scaling we also have this divergence Have this divergence precondition for this last field, Yuing Shan and We Shan. So with the niche data, t at time equals zero, and we also have this time derivative of this velocity field equals u1, v1. And we also have this homogeneous bound condition on the lower boundary and also on the upper boundary. So formally, as epsilon goes to zero, the second equation. goes to zero, the second equation, this term, epsilon square times this term, will disappear. So the second equation will become like partial yp equals zero. So in this situation, formally, as each one goes to zero, we obtain this hyperbolic Prano equations with like partial t squared of u plus partial t of u plus u partial x of u plus v partial y of u. plus v partial y of u minus partial y v squared of u plus partial x of p equals zero on this trip with specific variable and the time from zero to infinity. And the second equation will become like partial y of p equals zero. We have to determine this v by this divergence condition of this u and v. Okay? So compared with the classical Prano system here, system here we have this partial t additional partial squared of t okay so before i present the main result concerning the rigorous rigorous justification of this procedure let me give you a short review for for the corresponding result for the classical planner system so as i mentioned before compared with this Compared with this classical Prano system, this hyperbolic version have this partial t squared of u. For this classical Prano-Prano system was derived by Pranto in 1904 in order to study this vanish viscosity of a 2D navist system in the upspace in this situation, in a very single strip, like we like with length of like square root of Ypshalam, if the viscosity is Ypshalam, he proposed this boundary layer flow should have satisfying this Parallel system. So here this UV represent this tangential and normal velocities of this boundary layer flow. And here we also have this W and also we have this P here. Have this P here. This W and P are traces of the tangential blasting and the pressure of the outflow of the boundary, which satisfy this binary flow. So here, because we don't have this involution question for this V, how to determine this V? We have to determine this V by this divergence free condition and also with this bound condition. So formally, this V is like minus. is like minus u now minus y times partial x of u and there is no viscosity in the x direction in this evolution equation of this u so that's why when we perform classical energy estimate one derivative will be lost in the process of the energy estimate that's why even today for general data we still don't know if it's well Still don't know if it's well posed in sublive spaces. WinAE and Inquist proved like they constructed a class of niche data. Like if this class of initial data generates a local solution, that proves this solution must blow up in finite time. And David J.K. Muha and Doc Min proved the sort of Proved a sort of EU posedness of the linearized Planar system around non-monotone shear flow, like this share flow, the linearized solution like have exponential growth with this wave number. And they also have sort of a non-linear E-posedness in the sense of non-Lipschitz continuity of the flow, not like classical continuous depend on the initial. Continuous depend on the initial data in the sense of a damma. So there are some positive results in this direction, like under a monotonous assumption on the tangential velocity of the outflow, Orlinik first introduced clock transformation and then transformed the original problem to a nonlinear possible equation. And then he proves the local existence of uniqueness. Existence of uniqueness of classical solution to this classical planet system. With an additional favorable condition on the pressure, Zhou Bin Shen and Liu Quinzhang can prove the global existence of weak solution to this system. And very recently, by two groups of people, they do not need to use this Crockle transformation instead, they use classical weighted NHS. Classical weighted energy estimate to prove the local well-positance result of Ordinik in 1963. So, for analytic data, the first result is due to Samartino and Catholic in 1998. They prove the local repulsiveness of the system with this data, which is analytic in both x and a y variable, because in this equation, we already have viscosity in this y-direction. Viscosity in this y direction. In fact, this analyticity in the y variable is not needed. And this result is proved by Lombaku, Canon, Nasamatino in 2003. So the main argument used in both papers is to apply this abstract Coch-Cover-Left-Stayer type of theorem. And on the other hand, David J. K. Vohan and Masmodi can Have a hard mass moody can even prove the local reposedness of planet system with class data in the Java with Java regularity. And we and Tungyan proved sort of optimal Java Java regularity in this data, but with non-degenerate critical points. So the general result was proved in the sense of Sense of by Diadect and David J. Have Ha only very recently with niche data in the class of JRE2. So for initial data, for small niche data, long time existence result for the classical planar system was first obtained by myself and Juvie Jung. Like for analytic data of size Islam, we can prove the lifespan Islam. prove the lifespan is like epsilon to the power minus four over three and this result soon after this result was published this result was improved by ignatova and weco like in this situation for analytic initial data of size each line they can prove almost global existence of solution to the problem Of solution to the Planto system. So, on the other hand, in the famous book by Arlenik and Samo King, Mathematic Models in Boundary Layer Theory, 1990, on page 15, they listed many open questions. Like open question four is as follows. It has been shown in chapter four that under certain assumptions, the Under certain assumptions, the system of non-stationary two-dimensional boundary layer admits one and only one solution in the domain D. Okay? Either for small enough T or for any X greater than zero or small enough T and any capital T greater than zero. So what are the conditions ensuring the existence and the uniqueness of solution of non-stationary plano system? Of non-stationary Prano system in the domain D with arbitrary X and T. So, in order to solve this question, this problem, we first simplify the original problem, like we assume the far field velocity w is independent of the tangential variable, which equals epsilon f of t. And for simplicity, we assume this f0 equals zero in this situation. zero in this situation by Binut's law we find a partial x x of p equals minus epsilon f prime of t so in order to get rid of this far field we introduce a necroman function chi which equals one for y greater than two and equals zero for y less than or equals to one and we denote this capital w equals u minus epsilon f t times chi y. times chi y. So this w should satisfy an evolution equation like this. For this equation, we are going to use analytic energy estimate. The difficulty lies on the right hand side of the term, which depends on Ty only. In order to get rid of this term, we introduce a shared flow like US, which is defined by this linear equation. Then we define this small u equals capital u minus u s small v equals capital v. We find that this u we satisfy an equation like this. Now, we do not have this additional additional source term on the right-hand side and the subfield equals zero. Okay. On the other hand, due to this divergence free condition of the velocity field, in two-space dimension, we can find a potential function such that this u equals partial. such that this u equals partial y phi, we equals minus partial x of phi. And then we by integrating this u equation with respect to y variable from y to infinity, we find this evolution equation for this potential function, but with a term which depends on t and x. Because we are going to look for solution of this system which decays to zero as y approaching As y approaching to plus infinity, in this situation, when y goes to plus infinity, the left-hand side tends to zero. So this tells you q, tx has to be zero. So then we got this involution equation for this potential function. So in order to globally control the evolution of the analytic band, we introduce this good function g. introduce this good function g equals u plus y over 2 times t times phi and the small g equals y derivative of this capital g. So the quantity of this g and g are in spite of this good function which was introduced by Vico in 2016 and also by Max Modi and Wong in 2015. So the reason why Vico can prove this almost global existence is because Existence is because they can prove like this wave energy estimated for this G of T decays like T to the minus 5 over 4, okay? Which decays much faster than this U itself. So here, by comparing this good function, this difference between this G and a G equals phi over 2 times T. So we can prove, in fact, there is this good function G here. There is this good function g here can decay like t to the minus seven over four. So with this decay rate, we can prove this global existence of solution to this classical panel system with analytic data. Okay, so that's my first result with Maurice Precou. In this situation, on assumption, on smallness assumption for this good function, then we can prove this classical plano system has Plano system has a unique global analytic solution. And moreover, we have this propagation of regularity. Like initially, this analytic radius is delta. We can prove for t equal to zero, the analytic radius like delta over two. Okay. Here, the weighted function is like e to the y square way eight. And here this weighted function is e to the power of y square over eight times t. eight times t and then in fact we can also prove the decay rate for this u t like t to the minus three over four and this good function decays like five over four if we replace this good this weighted function here by e to the gamma y square over eight we can also prove this ut also with the same decorative okay here this gamma between zero and Here this gamma between zero and one. As I mentioned before, this local exit local positness of this classical primary system was already proved with niche data in JVRI class 2. We can in fact also prove the global repositiveness of this classical plano system with niche data in the JV class 2, in the JVRI class 2. In this situation, for simplicity, In this situation, for simplicity, we assume the fast field, this velocity equals zero, and this pressure, stress of the pressure also equals some constant. In this situation, the classical Plano system will becomes like this. So by Majority class two, we mean this Fourier multiplier, E delta T times absolute value of this D square root act on this function belongs to On this function belongs to some base of space. So, here, like initially, this JB radius equals delta as times involves, this J radius will decrease. Okay. We also need this weighted anisotropic soplef norm. In this situation, we need like k derivative with respect to y variable and s derivative with tangential variable. So, here again, this sine t y equals y. This sine ty equals y squared over 8 times t. So, joining work with Chao Wanna Yuxi Wang, we can prove like you will define this energy functional E of t like t to the power 1 minus e to the power 4 times times u phi, which means this every norm with this decorate in terms of this H 11. This H 11 over 2 in its congestion variable and the new derivative in the Y variable. Okay. So with the same scenario with like a decay rate for the classical n-stock system, if you decay like this, the y-derivative should have additional minus one half decay. Okay. And this good function will decay like this. And the y-derivative will have additional minus one decay. Because we will use. Because we will use commutative estimate like E delta D with power product for the high derivative of this good function. We do not need to estimate this partial y square of g in this JV class. We just need to estimate this high derivative of g in classical any tropical subject space. Okay, so that's energy functional. So that's energy functional corresponds to this energy functional. We also have this dissipation of this energy, like u here corresponds to this partial yu here, partial yu here have corresponds to this partial yu square of u here. Okay, so in this situation, if we assume this u5025 over 4, 0, plus the initial energ to be sufficiently small, we can prove this class. We can prove this classical Plano system has a unique global J-V solution. Moreover, this NH functional plus this dissipation of this NH should be less than or equals to C time epsilon squared. Okay. So we have some remarks like initial data, we should assume this U5 belongs to H25 over 4, but we can only prove the solution equals this. And moreover, we have This and moreover, we have a decrease of the Java values. All this is because of this instability of this system. And compare my previous work with PECU for analytic data. Here, this decay rate, we have like eta over four over four loss for the decay. Okay, so the main idea of the proof, we have to combine the method of de-addect of jihad. Of the dict of Jihad Wahi, which is based on both a tricky change of unknown and inappropriate choice of test function, and also the time weighted energy estimate proposed by Merse Peku and myself in the analytic setting. Okay, so I don't think I have time to explain the main idea of the proof in the JRI class. I just show you. I just show you with one technicality, we have to prove this commutative estimate between this E5 with this power product. Like with this commutation, we gain half derivative. So with more tele expansion here, like we have additional more term here, we can map this from HS to HS. So in this situation, instead of studying classical Instead of studying classical Prano system, we study this linearized paralinearized Plano system. Okay. Then we use the approach we just explained. I'm going to skip this detail here. Okay. So this already tells you for the classical planet system with initial data in this JLV class 2. In this geometry class, too, even to prove the log coexistence, it's very much complicated. Now, for the hyperbolic version, we also have exactly the same difficulty as the classical Prano system. Namely, we have this loss of one derivative. But in this situation, we can also prove this global velocity of this hyperbolic. Of this hyperbolic panel system with small niche data in the JV class 2. And moreover, the proof is much more easier compared with the proof for the classical Prandtl system. So the first result is like follows with niche data in this GFB class 2, and it to be small in this base of In this base of half, which means one half derivative in the tangential variable, but we do not have any derivative in the y variable to be sufficiently small, then we can prove this part system has a unique global solution. Moreover, this energy of this U in this JV class 2, JV class 2, and with and with this decay rate e k times t prime u phi partial y u phi partial t u phi l infinity to base of one half here and if you replace this weighted function e to the k t prime by e to the three over four k times t prime we have this additional one half derivative okay so i'm sorry it's title So, I'm sorry, it's typo. It should be 3 over 4. If we replace this weighted function by e to the 1/2 k times t, we gain this like one-half derivative. Okay, we also have the dissipation of this partial t of u and also this partial y of u. So, furthermore, here this u phi equals this Fourier multiplier e phi t d at t d act on this u. So this phi t cosine the symbol equals a minus lambda theta t times square root of cosine u. Okay, we can also have this propagation of this regularity of this solution. And firstmore, we can estimate if this quantity to be such a small, we can also estimate this vorticity of this hyperbolic prime system. This hyperbolic plantal system in this way. Okay, so the first result is concerning the global well-postedness of this hyperbolic plantal system. Okay, so the second result we can also prove if this initial data satisfy this smallest condition, we can prove this scaled hyperbolic name stock system has a unique global solution in this GIV cluster. Okay. Okay, so the last result, we can in fact prove this convergence for the scaled hyperbolic planar system to this hyperbolic planar system in this sense. We have this explicit estimate for this difference in this E01 norm. Okay, so I have two remarks. First remark is like similar result. Is like similar result from classical scale Navy stock system to hydrostatic equations has been proved in the analytic functional framework by Maris Peku, myself, and Juvi Jang in 2020. And a similar result like this from hyperbolic navy structure system to hyperbolic hyperstatic equation has been proved in the analytic functional framework by. By a rush, by modifying the method in this paper. Okay. I think I have several minutes. I'm going to explain you why we could simplify this improve in this hyperbolic planner system version. So here I have to recall you this space, like Shaman-Lechnet type space. Space like Shiman-Lechnet type space. So compared with classical space here, we integral with respect to time first, then make this summation. In order to overcome this difficulty, like one cannot use groundwater type argument in the Schumann-Echnotype space, in 2011, Maurice Pekko and myself introduced the further version of time. Version of time weight of time weight Schman-Lefnet type space. So compared with this space here, we have this f of t in this integral. Okay. So let me explain you, outline you why in our situation, it could be easier, the proof, than this classical panel system. So here we first act on this free multiplier, e phi. Free multiplier E phi to this evolution equation to this hyperbolic Pronto system and then perform energy estimate with delta K H partial T of U. So this delta K means frequency cutoff in the tangential direction such that this frequency is concentrated on annulus with radius like two to the top of k. Like two to the top of k here. Okay. So you can already see here, if you have this multiplication theta dot t, you gain like one over four derivative. Okay. So by this partial y u equals zero, you find this term, this term equals zero. Okay. And when we, by definition, By definition, of this Fourier multiplier, act on this partial t of u, which is in fact equals partial t u phi plus lambda theta dot t d d of x square root of d of x times u phi. So in this situation, you'll find lambda theta dot t times this normal square equals lambda theta dot t, then you gain one over four derivative. Because here, Because here you already have this one over four of this dx here. But here, you also have the square root of d of x here. So if you substitute this term to be here, you find here, another term should be lambda to the cube to theta dot cube. But instead of this dx one over four here, now you have three quarter here. So you when you have this multiplication, you gain You gain like three or four derivatives. Okay, and this term we can write it in this way. So eventually, by this energy estimate, we can have norm for this u as follows. Like we have this weight, e to the k prime t prime, this. prime this derivative like b one half if you replace this e k t prime by e to the three of three quarter kt prime then you gain one quarter derivative if you replace this three quarter by one half here then you gain another one of quarter derivative so n so up with square root of lambda here you gain like one quarter with lambda here you gain one half Lambda here, you're gain one half, and when you have this lambda to the three, three, three half, you have this b to the five or four. Okay, so because of this scenario, our proof for initial data in the geometry class, we do not need to use this duality argument proposed by Die Decht and David Jake Bocha. I think it's already time out. It's already time out. I don't have time to explain the detail. I'm going to stop here. Thanks a lot for your attention. Professor Jahar, I'm going to stop. Yeah. Thank you for the very interesting talk and pleasant results. Are there any questions? Let me ask. I guess you've set it equal to one, all these estimates. So you had a. So you had a you had um in the original hyperbolic system there was a parameter eta that's that's one if we're in these uh so there was mainly this is because of this term this square I just explained okay like here partial t u phi because that's free you multiply you act on this could be written like take time Written like take time derivative, one derivative take directly on this u here, and the other derivative is taken on this Fourier multiplier so that you have this lambda theta dotted dx square root act on this u phi. So in this situation, you'll find if you substitute this partial Tu phi to be here, then you take square for this term, partial Tu phi. Partial T of phi, you have the same derivative to be here. But for u itself, because you have this dx to the one quarter here, multiply this dx one half derivative. So you have this three over four derivative. This already tells you you can by perform energy estimate with weight. With weight, like sigdot to the cube, you gain one derivative. And this one derivative is what we need to solve the well postedness for the plano system. Professor Jaha, I think that's the main idea of the proof. Okay, thank you. We have time for one more question, if there is another question. Maybe due to time restriction, I don't have time to explain more detail. It's difficult to thank Professor John again for very impressive results. Thank you very much. Thank you. And then we'll.
