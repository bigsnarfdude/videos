Maryland, yes. Okay, good morning, and thanks to the organizers for invitation, for bringing us back to Bath. It's always beautiful to be back in Bath. It's one of the nicest places ever. Great to see all so many friends and say former friends as well. No, no former friends. Yeah, it's great to be back here. Future friends. Future friends also. Okay, current friends, former friends, and future friends. Yeah. Why not? And pretty coffee. Why not? Yes, let's do that. So, the talk is on malaria transmission dynamics. The reason for the motivation for this is malaria is one of the most terrible infectious diseases of mankind. And the reason is so important because the majority of the people dying of malaria are children under the age of five. Okay, so before the year 2000, we used to lose like one to three million people each year to malaria. And 80% of those are children under the age. But 80% of those are children under the age of five because their immune system is not well developed to deal with. Great things happened during the years 2000-2015 that led to a dramatic reduction in cases and mortality and hospitalization due to malaria, prompting now a new quest to actually eradicate malaria. And there are problems related to that. So the focus of the talk is how best we can use existing resources to determine whether or not we can achieve the objective of eradicating malaria. Eradicating malaria. There are two main initiatives. One is to reduce malaria burden by 90% by 2030. Okay, so cases hospitalization mortality is reduced by 2030, 90% by 2030. And the second one, the more ambitious one, is to eradicate malaria by 2040. Eradication is global, meaning no one on banidas is infected with the disease. And elimination is local. So about forty-three countries have already eliminated malaria, including China, including three countries in sub-Saharan Africa in Africa. In Africa. So, anyway, that's the objective. But before going into that, I need to quickly. Okay, so how does this work? Okay, oh, I forgot to thank. Thanks. To give a big picture, think about vector bone diseases in general. Not only malaria caused by, I know it's mosquitoes, but vector bone diseases, these are diseases caused by insects. Malaria has been the most important one, so they constitute about 18%. So, they constitute about 18% of all infectious diseases of humans, causing about 1 billion cases each year, about 1 million people dying of vegetable diseases in general. So, the deadliest ones are malaria, dengue, 400 million cases, about 100 million of those are symptomatic. 40,000 people dying of dengue on average each year around the world. And there are many others. I highlighted West Nile and Lyme disease. West Nile is important here in Canada as well. It's very much important in the US, huge. The U.S. huge outbreak in North America in 2002. We didn't used to have West Nile until 99, okay, 1999. So it's directly related also to climate change and other factors in North America. Lyme disease is important. Here highlighted some of the outbreaks. The point of this slide is to show that many of these diseases are actually zoonotic diseases. These are diseases that were otherwise spreading only in animal populations. Somehow spillover happens to jump to human. What happens to jump to human populations? So, the emergence, the re-emergence, the resurgence of this disease is directly related with the interaction between the pathogens, between the host and the natural environment. So, climatic and non-climatic factors play here, so like land use changes, human migration, animal migration or human movement, rural urban migration, and so on. So, let's go back to malaria. Just a quick overview of what malaria is. Overview of what money right here is. Uh, so it's oh, this is okay. Yeah, so it's caused by this parasite, so it's a parasitic disease transmitted, okay, so between humans, human to humans, through the bite of a mosquito. So it's not directly human-to-human transmission. So if a mosquito is infectious, carries plasmodium, you know, and bites a human, that's susceptible as some probability transmission can take place. And the other way around. Transmission can take place, and the other way around as well. If the human is infectious and susceptible mosquito bites the human, that mosquito can get infected. And only female mosquitoes bite humans. The female needs the protein in our blood for the process of development and maturation of eggs. Male mosquitoes do not interfere with us at all. So there are five main species of the parasite, palcychroma, and the vibrato has been the deadliest one accounting for more than 95% of all malaria infections. They are most fatal. And there are also about five. They're most fatal. And there are also about 400 species. The mosquito itself, anophilus, 450, but only 45 efficient vectors. To be an efficient vector, it has to satisfy three things. So the anophilus species has to be able to habitually bite humans, has to live long enough to complete what's called a sprogonic cycle, and also has to be able to have a plasma. Sprogonic cycle is the time delay between the initial infection of the mosquito to when the mosquito becomes infectious. Overcomes infections. Okay, so those three things are satisfied, then 45 of those vectors can transmit humanly. Others just don't bother humanly, right? Non-human private and so on. And the whole dynamics of the adult mosquito is governed by what's called gonotrophic cycle, which I'll talk about later. Gonotrophic is Latin for gono, meaning questing for tropic food. So the adult female mosquito looking for food from the host. The parasite may have evolved like under. The parasite may have evolved like 100-30 million years ago, ancient malaria spreading mostly in non-human primates, lizards, and so on. But then crows happened about some 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, directly related to last ice age, leading to this era of global warming and then the advent of human agricultural circulation, creating brilliant habitats for all sorts of species. That's what happened. So before 12,000 years ago, we didn't have. Talks out years ago we didn't have human malaria there's only malaria in non-human violence. So the crossover happened directly related to human action, direct last ice at the ice was melting, global warming, and agricultural civilization. Climate, well all aspects of the parasite, life cycle and the mosquito as well are greatly dependent on climate. So I'm going to talk about some of this a little later. For example, the mosquito sentibio. The mosquitoes tend to bite more. The temperature is suitable. Blood milk is digested at a much faster rate at suitable temperatures. Development of immature mosquitoes perhaps at a faster rate at suitable temperatures and so on. Survival. But let me ask you something. Sure, good. The previous one. Yeah. 130 million years, there were no humans. No humans. So what was how did they? Only biting. Only biting non-human primates they couldn't skin animals with fur. I don't know what animals they're biting, but they have somehow a source of blood milk. They're biting lizards and I don't know. Chris got one. He's got one here. Chris Gill's got one. He killed one, yeah. One was good. More question. How do you know that it's under 31 years ago? I don't know. I think they did this where anthropologists did some carbon dating kind of analysis. Carbon dating kind of analysis to determine. They have a way of dating diseases, history. But yeah, that's what they stated. But they must have some host that they're right and not humans. But 130 million. Okay, so going back to history, when did we start modern humans? When did we evolve? We can go back to evolution by natural selection, but when did we have humans in our current form also? Another thing is that strikes me that. Another thing is that strikes me that one out of six people has malaria. Yeah. One out of six people has live in the world. Currently. You said one billion. Yeah. Well, all the people living in tropical, subtropical regions of the world are supposed to be there. So yeah, if you look at the population, half the world's population, essentially, I would say. Dengue is the same thing. If you live in tropical, subtropical, you are supposed to own. So half the human race are affected. Half the human race are affected, or live in geographies that are affected, potentially affected by it. I would say even more than one in six, I'll say probably 50%. Yeah. Okay, excellent, very good. Anyway, so parasitic disease, five different species, spread by adult female anophilus mosquitoes, about 45 different vectors, anopless species that can transmit with it. Gonotropic cycle cross-happened a long time ago because of our A long time ago, because of our own action. That's the whole point of this slide, really. To say we are responsible for if we left them alone, if we didn't start, I don't want to say if we didn't start agricultural civilization, we wouldn't have people malaria, but if we didn't do some of the things that led to bringing humans closer to non-human climates, we may not have been as vulnerable to some of these diseases. And climate is at the heart of all of these. So the life cycle of the parasite has been greatly influenced by changes in local climate. Influenced by changes in local climatic conditions, microclimate. Okay, so this does start actually, the main control started a long time ago with the work of Sarona Rose. So he came up with a simple system of two equations, a rate of change of impacted humans, a rate of change of impacted mosquitoes, just two equations through which actually he calculated the R0, the reproduction number for the disease, and he showed one parameter was particularly important, M, which is the number of mosquitoes. And M, which is the number of mosquitoes per person per unit time. And he said, well, okay, it's in the numerator of RNO. So focus on reducing AM and then you reduce mosquitoes in Western Europe. And that was what happened actually. The WHO was implementing that strategy to say the best way to control an area is to do habitat destruction by trying to reduce what GAMP is, the value of GAMP. And he also laid a really important foundation, actually for the point of view of us here. I think was the first to lay, excuse me, the The first delay, excuse me, the threshold theory of epidemics. Compelling part of his work actually was to say that we do not have to kill all mosquitoes to get rid of malaria in Western Europe or in the world. All we need to do is reduce the mosquito population below a certain threshold. I think that's pretty linked also to the notion of R naught. R naught length of one is what you need. You don't have to make R naught zero, but let's one is usually what you need for effective control. So, threshold theory of epidemics started by saroneurosis work. By Sarona Roses, work in the early 1900s, and he was the first actually to provide a complete life cycle, the lucidation of the life cycle of the plastic empiric. He did the work sequentially to the US, to the UK Army, I think in India, and then in the Senior General later on. But he did really fundamental work on malaria control. But his model assumed that once the mosquito is infected, that mosquito is instantaneously infectious, it's capable of transmitting infection to a susceptible human. And that's not the case, that the notion of some sort of Not the case that the notion of some sort of incubation period or sprogotic cycle for the sporozoids in the mosquito to actually grow to mature before the mosquito becomes infectious. So, George McDonald came along like three decades later and said, okay, let's include a time delay between the initial infection of the mosquito to when the mosquito becomes infectious. And that led to a big change in the strategy implementable by WHO, which then focused on keeping the mosquitoes, focusing more on adult mosquitoes rather than immature mosquitoes. Immature mosquitoes because they are harmless to you until they become infectious. So the focus since then was on adult mosquitoes, meaning to try to kill them at adult stage rather than at immature stage. At immature stage, it's almost impossible because there are just infinitely many brain habitats for the mosquitoes. So to look for all of these brain habitats and spray which lymicites try to build them, it's just not logistically feasible. And the good thing also is that DDT was invented in 1939 and then because of the And then, because of the really effectiveness of DDT at the time, there was this quite a global malaria eradication program to try to eradicate malaria, started in 1955, but had to be disbanded in 1969 because of resistance. Why is there resistance to the DDT? I think DDT is now outlawed, is banned in pretty much all countries. I think in the US, 1972 was banned publicly, or you can use that because of this. Of his toxicity to humans and also problems with the environment as well. Anyway, so that was where we were. So the strategy then, just like with COVID essentially now, is to landolibuous malaria. We cannot eradicate it, but unless lantilibus reduce, try to reduce the number of cases of post-production and so on, but we cannot eradicate because of wide-scale resistance. The mosquito becomes resistant to DDT. The DDT was the best we had at the time. So there was nothing else we could do. Okay, so by then 2000. Okay, so but then in 2015, the Gates Foundation and many other non-governmental organizations and some governments in endemic areas came up with excellent insecticides that were used to control malaria mosquitoes. These are five of them, pariseroid being the dominant one. In the form of bednets, so human infected in endemic areas sleep under a bednet at night. The mosquito doesn't have access, the bednet doesn't have holes. And the bednet has some chemicals embedded in it, such as around the mosquito lens in the bednet, the human, the The human, the mosquito can potentially be killed by the killing efficacy of the petina and so on. So, this and also strain indoors. So, during the second stage of the gonotropic cycle, when the mosquito has successfully taken a blood mill and is resting on the wall for the digestion of the blood milk, that's when the mosquito is most defenseless. Okay, and then you can have entomologists coming into the homes spraying mosquitoes. And this IRS indoorcidual spray has a residual effect such that if it's sprayed once, you know. Such that if it spread once, you know, for the next maybe months or two, you know, the mosquito landing on the same wall, same location can still get killed because of the residual effect of it. So the use of lung glossy insect sidelines, these guys, and endo-residual spraying led to a dramatic reduction in malaria cases and more importantly, mortality across endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and South Asia, and so on. To the extent that it's 43 countries, as I mentioned before, have 43 countries, as I mentioned before, have eliminated malaria, including China, which is a very good success story. And now there's a renewed quest to try to get rid of malaria. But then the main stumbling blocks for eradication are the usual suspects, so including resistance that I've just mentioned. It's also climate change. So a key question with respect to climate change. We have started seeing already in places that in tapil area before, especially in highland areas. In highland areas in sub-Saharan Africa to see mosquitoes and also malaria in those areas. So, is climate change going to lead to a shift or a range expansion of malaria vectors and disease? There's also evidence of resistance to atomicinis. So, atomicin is a drug that's being used to treat children that are infected with malaria. It's really, really effective. But data from Cambodia, Laos, and some parts of South Asia has conclusively shown widespread resistance. Widespread resistance of the parasite to atomicinine. And this could be a game-changing moment if we have the same situation in sub-Saharan Africa as well. Because the best we have, if the kid is affected, is to treat them with atomicinin. But if atomicin is no longer curing or helping kids, then there obviously more mortality. So migration, rural urban migration, land use changes. But there's also this point of residual malaria transmission. So despite the wide-scale use of in Despite the wide-scale use of insecticides in endemic areas, we still are seeing malaria in endemic areas despite resistance. And one of the reasons is mosquitoes have figured out a way to survive, to evade the killing efficacy of the insecticide by choosing to bite maybe instead of indoors, they try to bite outdoors. So instead of being endophilic, they are now exophilic, they write outdoors, and then they also rest outdoors. Instead of resting indoors, Outdoors instead of resting indoors on the wall where entomologists can come and kill them through IRS, now they rest outdoors. Okay, this is more than problems. And if they bite in and resting outdoors, then bedness will not help them, will not help us at all. They're a bad and they're not coming indoors. That's why humans sleep under bedness. They don't sleep under bedness outdoors. So some of this behavior traits, I mean, it's causing a problem, a big problem as well with respect to elimination. And sometimes they bite in earlier. So typically malaria, mosquitoes, bite or in the alien. Malaria mosquitoes bite during the early hours of the night, but now they bite from earlier, just like Edis mosquitoes like Coles 90C, Katykimunia. They bite during the day, they don't bite at night. So they're changing their behavior to evade the selective pressure of insecticides. So this is a big problem with respect to okay. So quickly, I don't know how to do time. This is the male life cycle of the adult mosquito. So let's say this is an adult female mosquito. The first order I business after mating was a male. First order of business after mating was a male. So, is to look for a human host to take protein from the host. This is the first stage of the bonotropic cycle. So, if it succeeds, it goes to the second stage, which is to rest on the wall for digestion of the blood milk. And when that's completed, it looks for a breed of habitat. That's stage three, which is body of water, lay the eggs. Then the eggs hatch into larvae, sitting inside of water, feeding up algae and other nutrients. Feed them up algae and other nutrients, and they get bigger and bigger, and then they become poopy, and then adult mosquito and the cycle continues. So, this is basically the gonotropic cycle for the adult mosquito. And at least two of the three stages are directly related to temperature. Second stage is and the third stage, and also precipitation. This is done inside water. So, if there's no precipitation, of course, you don't see atmospheres. So, at least one of the problems with small areas is it has to be. One of the problems with Smalaria is it has four cycles. I've given you two cycles here: the immature cycle here, the X, Li B, 2P, and then the conotropic cycle, which is the host questing cycle. There are two other cycles that I'll talk about later on. So a basic model for malaria should have at least those cycles. So some of the questions that we're interested in, actually three main questions. Will climate change lead to a shift or range? It's one of the really important questions in the malaria ecology community right now. And the second question also is whether or not. And the second question also is whether or not we can achieve eradication using excessive resources. So, does insecticide resistance, not parasite resistance, insecticide resistance, does it lead to more malaria or less malaria? They're very interested in this question. And more importantly, can we get rid of malaria and using the existing resources? The five chemicals. It takes like three, four years to develop a new chemical that the FDA can approve for use against mosquitoes. So we don't have that time. If we want to reduce cases by 90% by 2030, we're only like six years away. By 2030, we're only six years away from that. Or if we want to eradicate by 2040, we don't have time to wait for new insecticides to be developed. So, can we use existing resources? Or if not, can we then do something else? Can we play nature? Can we use some other biological controls to try to reduce either to through the release of genderized, for example, or some transgenic mosquitoes to come up with a way of suppressing or reducing or replacing even the mosquito organisms? Replacing even the mosquito population, the wildly mosquito population. So, these are some of the questions that I would like to address in today's talk. But to do this well, I think we need to take into account the fitness cause of all of these things. When you have insecticide resistance, you have two types of mosquitoes, one that are resistant to insecticide, one that are not. The two are not the same, that's heterogeneity. So, what is the penalty? What is the cost of developing resistance to insecticide in terms of your ability to fly, your ability to survive, your ability to bite, your ability to lay eggs and all those things? The X and all of those things. So, the fitness codes. And this we work in collaboration with entomologists who do the experiments in the lab and in the field to collect the data that we need to come up with functional forms for this fitness-related parameters. And the same would say climate change as well. So, the lab, the entomologists carry out experiments in the lab and the field, subjecting mosquitoes to different temperatures and counting how many we survive and all that. So, we work with them to do it. Okay, so let me give a simple model and yeah. Yeah, for our general believer, I think it's to understand what's going on with malaria, we need to understand what's going on with the mosquitoes first. So, follow the mosquito kind of strategy. So, let's understand the population dynamics of the mosquito without disease, first of all, and then we add disease, and then we see what's going on. So, the simplest model for the immature dynamics is given by the C E for X, L for L B, P for P, M for the proportion of new mosquitoes that are adult female. So, M is not males. So, M is not males, it's adult female mosquito. So, initially, female mosquito lay eggs at this rate, which depends on T and R, T temperature, R, precipitation. That's logistic carrying capacity here, which depends typically on precipitation. If there's no rainfall, there will not be eggs laid. And the eggs will hatch into larvae at rate Fe, again, depending on temperature and precipitation, and they can die naturally or through the use of larva sites and larvae. And larvae mature to Phupi at rate FL, and they also die. That's this term here, which is important, it's density-dependent lava mortality, because the larvae are sitting inside water. They're competing with themselves, okay, for space and for nutrients. So there's density-dependent lava mortality. And the addition of this parameter actually really causes important considerations. It causes important challenges actually with respect to the analysis and also new dynamics because of that. But I think it's really important. Of that. But I think it's necessary to include that. That's to depend on level mortality. Okay, Pupi becomes adult mosquitoes. It's a proportion sigma that are females, and that's another one we care about. Mu M is how long on average adult female mosquito is. So the R naught is this, and we have, for this simple model, we have basically two equilibria, the trivial one where averaging is zero, and the non-trivial one, which exists only if R naught is greater than one. The reason I'm showing this, so for R naught, The reason I'm showing this for Arnold, we have this global stability result for the trigonal equilibrium. The proof is using this Lauffenno function, is quite straightforward, really. And if R node is greater than 1, we have downput oscillation, which is what the data also shows. We have downfall oscillation for small enough R node, but as we keep increasing R node, we have a hot radiation. So this stable spiral loses stability to an isolated closed cartridge, a stable liver cycle as R node. A stable Liverpool cycle as R naught increases. This is for R0 equals 7, this is 0.7 or 7. So, yeah, we have a sustained oscillation as R naught increases and we have a stable Libert cycle. So, the point of this is that only transcritical verification from the trivial equilibrium to the spiral, okay, at R0 equals 1, and then we have a Hawk biification later on, and that's it. That's all we see. We do not see any other qualification for this simple model. But when we change this model, Model. But when we change this model, when we extended the model to include disease, oh, okay, so here I just need a tissue. So here we use data of QLEX data for the Till region. At the time we're doing this work, we had really good data for the QLEX mosquito that I call this Westnar. And we showed the optimal temperatures for maximum abundance of mosquitoes to be when temperatures are 25 degrees Celsius and precipitation is about 30 millimeters. And this is from April to November, actually. You can tell what the To November, actually, you can tell for the period when they need to intensify and spray and try to get rid of mosquito. Anyway, with this kind of model, you can obtain optimal temperature. You see that the optimal temperature, the mosquito abundance increases with increasing temperature until you reach a peak around 25 degrees Celsius for Culex. For anophilus, it's higher, slightly higher. But then, as temperature increases above the threshold, then you see that abundance comes down. That's what we see. So, when it's too hot, mosquitoes do not survive. It's too cold, they do not survive. Mosquitoes do not survive. It's too cold, they do not survive. Okay, that's it's a cold de-lock phenomenon. The temperature has to be just about right in order for you to see maximum abundance. So the effect of temperature could clearly show that there's optimal temperature range within which you see maximum mosquito intensity, which then correlates with maximum disease intensity as well. The more mosquitoes, the more disease, of course. Anyway, so when you add humans or disease, this is susceptible to humans, exposed humans, infectious humans. Exposed means they are infected but not infectious. But not infectious. Infectious, we mean the infectious are recovered for humans, and then we do the same thing for the vectors. Okay, the R0 is in square root because it takes two generations to come back, vector, human, by vector. So it's a geometric mean. That's all straightforward. Nothing really to add here, except maybe the byte rate and beta, B8 is the probability of transmission from a bite from a vector to the human. So if the mosquito is infectious, the bite is subtle. Mosquito is infectious, bytes are susceptible to human, this is the probability that transmission takes place. And the key thing in this model is to ensure that we have to have the conservation law of bites. That's very important. So when you're modeling mosquito-borne disease, the number of bites made by adult human mosquito has to be exactly equal to the number of bites received by the host. So once you do that, necessarily, you normally add the host ratio, but the host population, normally total infection ratio with the total host ratio. So if it's West Nile, this would be total number of people plus total. This would be total number of humans plus total number of birds because the mosquitoes bite both humans and birds. So, anyway, the conservation law is important to you. So, unlike in the previous case, with the mosquitoes only, we didn't have this verification. We have a backward verification here when you added humans and malaria, the disease. Here, backward verification is associated with the coexistence of two stable attractors once the production number is 1.1. Okay, so here in this region, the Bako ratification region, we have the disease-free equilibrium and the stable endemic equilibrium separated by this separatrix. So for all initial conditions below the stable manifold of the saddle point, we have this convergence solution to the disease for equilibrium, but for above we go to the endemic equilibrium. So the reason, and this happens only if delta H, the disease indices mortality, is large enough, is greater than some threshold. That's the reason. That's the reason why this is important. I think this was showed first. We showed this first, I think, in 2008, why models for vector-borne diseases that have disease-induced mortality naturally have back-load ratification. And further than backlog ratification make the effort to control the disease more difficult because it's not just enough. It's necessary to bring RNO to level 1, but it's not sufficient. You have to really reduce RNO much, much farther below 1 to somewhere here outside the biased old gene. Okay, so anyway, so. So, anyway, so this we so the point again: if you study only the mosquitoes, you only see transcriptical bracation and hog biification. But by adding from the mosquito population dynamics model, adding disease and humans, now we see a different biification which makes it disease. Okay, so I'll skip a lot of this because I have only two minutes. This is objective one. I'm going to skip a lot of this and show to you the effect of temperature, climate, and to answer the first question. Climate to answer the first question. Okay, malaria under climate conditions. So, this is the baseline. So, we plotted here, this map of Africa, we plotted parasite rate taken for children between the ages of 2 and 10 in the year 2000, and plotted the parasite rate, which is the metric most entomologists actually use. They don't use R0, but we want to use R0. And we show that they correlate. Actually, the places where you see red is high parasite rate. Rate, okay, number up. So they test the blood and see presence of plasmodium in sample. And it correlates nicely with R node. So in other words, we can use the R node that we calculated from the Xender Ross-McDonald model to try to check, okay, what would happen under various climate change projections. Okay, so instead of using parasite rate, I would have one console. So for the worst-case projection, the RCP 8.5, which is the most consistent. Which is the most pessimistic projection, which says by 2030, based on our current emissions strategy, global temperature is going to increase by 1.5 degrees Celsius in comparison to the pre-industrial era. If that happens, what we see that, so most of the action, this is the baseline, this is where we are now, okay? Most of the action is in Western and Central and Western Africa, very little in Eastern and Southern Africa. But if we have a 1.5-degree increase, we see that with actually. Increase, we see that we've actually seen not only a shift to Eastern Africa, to mostly Eastern Africa, some parts of Southern Africa, but we're also seeing a range expansion. So the answer to the first question is actually both shift and range expansion of malaria due to climate. So the other scenario, also, if you have by 2080, I think it was 4 degrees Celsius, even more pronounced, you see a lot more cases in eastern and southern Africa. And in fact, this is what we're seeing now. Seeing now. I like that. Where the action is. So I'll skip all this. I was going to do something on resistance, but I'll quickly tell you what we're doing now with humans playing nature based on this sterilized insect technology approach. The idea is to release genetically sterilized male mosquitoes such that when they mate with females, the females will lay eggs out from her hatch to come alive, so on and the question is: what we're asking is: since that's why. What we're asking is: since there's wide-scale resistance to the insecticide that we currently have, insecticides, because of insecticide resistance, and we're trying to eradicate it by 2040, can we do something else? Can we genetically modify mosquitoes to produce ones we want, once with certain properties that could lead to effective control of mosquito? So, the first part here, you release these guys here. This has genetically modified males, and the green ones are the females. So, what we want is this guy is to mate. What we want is this guy is to mate with the females, and the brown are males that are wild males, meaning they're not modified, they're just standard males. So, and then they mate. After mating, we produce purple females. These are the females that will lay eggs that will not hatch. So, after the mating, we assume random mating and the hardy wine bag, all these kind of conditions. Anyway, so after mate, we have this, you see more purple, purple lay eggs, dead end, the green will still lay eggs. The green will still lay eggs as the females, the wild females, they'll still lay eggs at all hatch and so on. So, the point is: can this work? And if yes, how many do we need to release per release periods and what's frequency of release? And for how long do we need to do this? For how long? Can we surprise the population down to maybe only 10% in endemic area using this? If we run this course, yeah, and we show that actually this works. Oh, okay. Oh, I thought it was forget. Okay. Yeah, this is the model basically. So, MS is a sterilized male mosquitoes that are released, and Epsoms could use these are females that are unmated. So, if they mate with the good guys, they become females that are metal sterilized, and this is the metal rate, mating function, which depends on many things. But if they mate, if the metal females mate with wild males, okay, then they become here, females that have met with wild, this one's collected, that become live. There are four larval stages. That become lively. There are four livable stages and could be unsold. This is a mechanism for SIT release. And we showed that in practice this can work. Unmated females mated with wilds. So these are the ones we want, the females that have mated with. If we do it only once, we release 100,000 only once. This is what we have. But if we do it for three years weekly, every week we release 100,000 for three years, we show that at steady state, actually, we see more of the good. We see more of the good guys suppressing the bad guys since I'm here. So we do not wipe out the wild female mosquitoes, but the population of management is great to reduce. So only this can work in principle. But for how long do we need to do this? That's the problem. So temperature, optimal temperature for malaria mosquitoes, 28 to 30 degrees Celsius. Backward modification makes your life difficult. It does not control. We can actually surprise mosquito population using SIT. Of race mosquito population using plus IT based on this is from data from Kenya. I will stop right here. I'll talk to you later. Professor Gribert takes a couple of questions and then we move on to all the hard questions go to Argonaut. There, Thomas. Yeah, thank you for the introduction to this Malaria problem. So it's also a spatial problem, right? There are huge areas and and so how do you get all the transgenic uh mosquitoes into these big areas? Mosquitoes in these big areas. Ah, very good. Okay, so currently I'm working with people who are doing this SIT release in Ecuador and in South Africa. So in South Africa, there are only three provinces that are prone to malaria because they are next door to three endemic countries. Mozambique is one. I cannot pronounce the country. Anyway, so they have an area, okay, that they are allowed to. One of the problems they have when you leave them this must be that's coming. Leading these mosquitoes, that's a communication problem. So the local community thinks, oh, you come in, dumping lots of mosquitoes that can give us malaria or disease. Okay, so the government, that's legislation, government telling them, okay, this is the area that you can use. They give them a, yeah, and you cannot just learn. But then, of course, the mosquitoes do not obey borders. I mean, they can fly away, especially at wind speed. Google tried to do this a long time ago during Zika outbreak in the US 2014. They dumped the mosquitoes in location. Mosquitoes in location, but then we took the mosquitoes away. To do it optimally, you want to dump them in the location where you have maximum awareness of females, because the whole point is for mating to take place. So if you're not careful, if you do not add diffusion, for example, if you don't understand diffusion or wind speed and all that, so with Google, the mosquitoes are just taken away and dumped somewhere where they're normally a total waste of money. And you release them from a plane, I guess. Yeah, exactly. So they use draws for that. But the point is, yeah, for spatial, there's government legislation that's For spatial, there's government legislation that's needed to make sure that you do not dump them in the wrong places. And there's also another point that's important: the sex separation they do, before they irradiate the male mosquito, they have to check the sex, say whether it's male or female, because you do not want to release females. And unfortunately, the sex oppression is not 100%. There's recent evidence which shows sex oppression is like 95% practically. So there are certain females. In fact, that's one of the projects that we're working on, what is the impact. One of the projects that we're working on is what is the impact of these escaped females that are lumped into the ones that are actually released as males, you know, in terms of malaria. So sex oppression is 100% effective. That's a problem. But yeah, we have to do it properly. But there's also the fitness cost issues. When you sterilize, the males, they're just not the same as the males that are more sterilized. In terms of longevity, in terms of survival and so on, and mating. Survival and so on, and the mating and the females also there's also they pref they prefer to mate with wild males rather than with generalized customers. There's all these issues that we have to take up. Yeah. Mike. During the stage where they're laying eggs, how do mosquitoes choose their water source? Like, is there some criteria based on how much water is available in the species? Yeah, depending on the species. So now they need plant. They need clean, shallow waters. Edis doesn't really care, doesn't need a lot of water at all. But yeah, it depends on the species. Some just need very little amount of water.
