Pleasure to have Shandar Kovac who talk about rational singularities 2.0. Hi, thank you for the invitation and the introduction. So let me start. I'm afraid maybe at the beginning it will be a little bit boring, but I kind of want to collect all the background. So if you're bored, then. If you're bored, then I apologize for that. So let me start with Growth Endic. I guess pretty much everything in modern algebra geometry starts with him. So at the ICM in 58, he ended his talk by proposing a couple of important open questions. Questions and so his problem A from that list was correlated, meaning curio vanishing in all characteristic. Now, we know that that's not, that doesn't hold, but it's kind of interesting that at that time they had no idea. And I was also kind of surprised about his problem B because. Problem B because anyway, so here's problem B. And I'm pretty sure many of you, or most of you, know this. So if X to Y is a proper birational morphism, X and Y are non-singular, does this imply that the higher direct images of the structure sheet vanish? Vanish and what I found surprising was that this was not known because I sort of in my mathematical life this had been kind of a effect. And so it's interesting that in 58 this for Grotendic, this was actually one of the most important problems, which of course it makes sense if, you know, at that time resolution of singularities was not known yet. Resolution of singularities was not known yet. So, you know, maybe in that view, it's not so surprising. And then, actually, Hironaka, when he proved his resolution of singularities result using that, he confirmed this. So he proved that this holds in characteristic zero. Okay. Okay. And so then there wasn't much advance for a while. You could actually mention the grower remention idea or anything, which is essentially the dual statement of this. Let me put a date to that in 70. In 70. So it says that under the same assumption, so well, and not exactly the same, actually lesser. So if f is proper by rational, this is over C and X is non-singular, then the higher direct images of omega X. Of omega x when okay, and just as a note, you know, this actually implies a problem B using rotanic duality, but it's not a new proof because they used Hironaka's resolution. So it's sort of not an independent proof. But anyway, we have these two statements. Anyway, we have these two statements, which, so the second one, so let me let me put some mark here. So I'm going to call this star and this one two stars. So I don't have to repeat writing them. So the second one actually says that if you have, if y is arbitrary and you have a resolution of singularities, then this holds. So we often This holds so we often kind of don't even mention it because it's there. But if we wanted to do this in positive or mixed characteristic, then we actually need that assumption because just as we know that clear vanishing fails, from that failure, you can actually, I mean, sorry, I'm being a little sloppy here. So this is fails in positive characters. In positive characteristic. So using that, we actually know that this fails in positive characteristic as well. So we can't just assume this for an arbitrary y, and that's sort of part of kind of the focus of my talk. So, as I said, you know. So, as I said, you know, all of this happened in the 50s, 60s. Nothing much happened until rather recently. So, then came, let me see if I can spell this. So, consistent you and ruling. Ruling You might be more familiar with this spelling. They proved so they first proved that if X and Y are If X and Y are smooth over a perfect field and later that if X and Y are excellent regular schemes and F is projective, then problem Problem B holds. Or, you know, in other words, star and two star holds. So let me remind you, this star and two star were these two vanishing statements. Okay. And they asked the question: what kind of singularities Maybe allow on why so that this vanishing result remains true. And of course, in case there's a zero, we know the answer that's how we define rational singularities, and that's again the goal of this. Again, the goal of this talk. So let me make a side trip to Littman and TCA. So in A1, they defined pseudo-rational singularities going to I'm going to abbreviate this as PRTL. And so we say that Y has pseudo-rational singularities if, on one hand, Y is normal and call my colleague. And let me add that. And let me add that it admits a dualizing complex. They may not have added this, but today I actually want to assume everything that every player, every scheme that I work with, I want to assume that means a utilizing scheme, a utilizing complex, right? X, right? And such that for every X normal and X to Y proper birational morphism on that every such morphism is a pseudo-rational modification, and I'm giving you the definition. And I'm giving you the definition for that. So, pseudo-rational modification is such that the natural morphism from the push forward of omega x to omega y is an isomorphism. Okay, so just to recall, there's To recall, there's always an atomorphism from the dualizing complex of X to the dualizing complex of Y. And if Y is Comic Colli, then this is actually just omega Y at, well, you know, I can choose one that looks like this and, you know, let me. You know, let me assume that let's just say why is irreducible. So, and there are some issues with this, but I don't want to get into the technical details. But the point is that when you take the appropriate cohomology of this morphism of complexes, then you get this morphism of shapes. So, you always have such a morphism, and the assumption is that it's actually an isomorphism. Okay? And so, then going back to Hatsitamatis and RÃ¼ling's question, one could ask what kind of singularities can we allow on why? And Lippmann thesis, pseudo-reaction singularities, were an attempt to Rational singularities were an attempt to extend the definition or the notion of rational singularities to a realm without using resolution. So you could ask, is it true that we can replace y with pseudo-rational symmetries? If you also ask, so another reasonable question. Since, in the definition of pseudo-rational singularities, x is normal. So, we could ask whether we could actually replace x with just normal. So, instead of in the original setup, both x and y were assumed to be non-singular. Assumed to be non-singular. So what if we just assume? So could we simply assume that x is normal? That is, that is, we don't assume the x is non-similar. So, and then, of course, you would add some conditional. Condition on y. So, condition on y. So, I'm not saying arbitrary y. But nonetheless, this doesn't go anywhere as Kutkowski showed an example that there's a normal threefold Z over the complex numbers and And a projective birational morphism from Z to C3, such that not all the higher direct images are zero. And so this says that. And so this says that this one doesn't even fly in kft60, or even if we assume that y is non-singular. So we really need something more about x. Okay, now we're coming to the 2.0 part of my title. So on So, a couple of years ago, I suggested that X should be comical. And that's kind of a nice assumption because we actually know that my codification exists. So, this is very nice. So, now I have to make a I have to make a public service announcement. And this is part of the reason for this talk that unfortunately this is actually still not good enough. So turns out this is still not good enough. Not good enough, and there's actually an embarrassingly simple counter example that I will show you, or an example. So, start with a non-singular surface and blow up this point a couple of times. Namely, blow it up once, then blow up. Blow it up once, then blow up another point, an infinitely near point on that, and then blow up yet another point. So let's say I have E1, E2, and E3, and then glue E1 and E2 together. So, kind of like you know, folding the circuit. You know, folding the surface and gluing them transversally. So locally, it would look like two non-singular surfaces meeting. So this is the glued E1 glued two E3 and then And then what happens with E2 is that, so the E2 becomes a nodal curve. And both of, so it's actually on this surface, I just not very, so this is the image of E2. And you can probably see relatively easily that if this is X, this is Y, and this is F. x, this is y, and this is f, then r1f lower star o x will not be zero. It's because if you want, there's a short exact sequence that R1F lower star OX maps onto R1 F lower star OE2 bar, and this is not zero. And this actually continues to zero, so this has to be subjective and uh. And so this guy is not zero. Okay, so that's not good. Now, the good news is that there's a simple fix to this. So good news. Everything is okay if we If we assume x is also normal, x is normal and go-macaulay. Okay? So instead of just assuming that it's go-ma-cauli, we need to assume that it's normal. In retrospect, it's sort of natural that this should be. That this should be. It's just sort of kind of embarrassing that it took me so long to realize this. The bad news is that we don't know if normal my qualifications exist. Exists, at least not in general, right? So, um, so what's a macholification? Well, uh, it's kind of like a resolution of singularities. So, uh, is a maccolification if uh If of y if f is proper and birational and x is called and now what would be a normal maccolification is that let's say f is a normal maqualification. If X is normal and call Macaulay, of course, we have normalization and we have McCullification, but unfortunately, both processes can screw up the other one. So the normalization of a comical is not necessarily a comical. The maccolification of My colleague, the my codification of something normal is not necessarily normal. So simply that doesn't work. Let me mention some names. So my qualification, so this exists in pretty wide range. So essentially, anything that's finite. Essentially, anything that's a finite type over new theory. So, this is by work of Faltings, Kawasaki. And we even have a stronger qualification due to work of Czesna Vicius. And actually, normally. And actually, normal nucleification exists. We know that it exists in some cases. So exists if the so actually, so over an infinite field of arbitrary characteristic, if the non-comical locus. Non-comicoly locus is at most dimension one, which means that this is okay if the dimension of y is at most four, right? Because you can start with the normalization and then normal surfaces are comacli. So a four normal four-fold will be comacline. Forward will be comical in co-dimension two. So the non-comical locus is co-dimension three. And so this is okay. And also with respect to, yes. Sorry, would you remind me what was the strong comicalification of just navigation? Oh, it's that you can do it without disturbing the locus that's already coma colli. So kind of like, you know, Already come accoli, so kind of like Hironaka's resolution that you only change the scheme where it's non-come accolad. Thanks. So the previous ones, Faultings and Kawasaki, their resolution didn't didn't, or their macroification didn't know what happens to that. So for instance, in this case, just avicci uses would only change it in dimension one. One. Okay, any other questions? Okay, so actually, maybe also on the good news side, I can say, so I actually went through and tried to find all the applications of my preprint from a couple of years ago. And as far as I could tell, And as far as I could tell, this does not alter any of the applications. So the good news is that applications are still okay. Now, of course, I can't say this for 100% because I can't say that I know about all the applications, but the ones that I know about are The ones that I know about. So I think, for example, Yakub, you guys used resolutions, right? Right, yeah. Okay. Anyway, so let me go on. There's actually maybe also some positive that I can report, but I thought that maybe, and just for the record, I haven't updated my The on my paper on the archive, but I will soon. So there will be soon a version. But I thought that since it's been quite a while and quite a few updates, this might be a better way to let people know that there's this change to the statements. So actually, let me actually state the main result, which is sort of, if you're familiar with my earlier If you're familiar with my earlier paper, then it looks very much like the one before with one added burn. So, this is a Kempf-type criterion. So the theorem is that if X and Y are excellent normal Komakali schemes. And f from x to y is a locally projective birational morphism. And assuming that if y has pseudo-rational singularities, then we have the We have the two finishing statements that we wondered about. Let me actually write it that then the natural map from OY to the right push forward of OX is an isomorphism and similarly the same for the Ising sheets. Since both X and Y are comically X and Y are comically. I'm not writing the Jesusian complex. And I guess I should actually assume that, as I said, that they both admitting the dualizing complex. Okay, so this is still okay. And now. And now this leads to a proposed new definition of rational singularities. So let me recall that the sort of the traditional definition is that y has rational singularities if there exist resolution of singularity. Resolution of singularities such that these two. So let me call this three star for one star and two star together. So such that three star holds. Okay. And if we want to do want this to work in arbitrary characteristic, then we actually do need both. Actually, we do need both. Usually, the definition might include that y is normal, but that's actually part of this package in this notation, because if x is now singular and y is isomorphic to its push for the push forward of the structure sheet, then it's normal. And in order to distinguish this from my proposed definition for rational singularities, I'm calling this. It is, I'm calling this resolution rational. So assuming that there's a resolution. And I just said there exists. Now, Atsutomate's and Rulings Result actually says that if there exists one. If there exists one, then all of them are. Now, there's a little bit of issue with proper versus projective, and this goes back to the existence of my qualifications of or normalifications or the existence of resolutions. If there is a If there is a resolution or these my qualifications, then one can actually go from projective to proper relatively easily. Without that, that's not so much. So that's sort of one place where this change actually affects the results. So the suggested definition then for why has rational singularities Rational singularities is that so first of all, y is normal and connect only. Now, this one I didn't assume in the resolution rational singularities, but that assumption, actually, the assumption of a resolution rational singularities implies that then y is normal and come like away. But in this case, But in this case, I want to actually assume that, and such that there exists a proper birational amorphism such that X is also normal and colony, and this vanishing holds. Okay, and so this theorem above here says that pseudo-rational singularities have rational singularities as soon as they admit a normal myqualification. Okay, so that's that. Now I want to Now, I want to go to some applications, and in fact, there will be something new there, also justifying the 2.0 part. But if there's any questions about this part, then I'm happy to answer that. Sorry, just to make sure. So, at this point, it's not clear that this is independent on F because of this issue with normal Macqualification? That's right. That's right. So exactly. So if there's no normal qualification, then it is independent of F. If not, then it's not clear. So I guess if you don't believe in resolution of singularities, then you could try to find a counterexample this way. But I sort of don't really expect it. And also, I think it's still a normal qualification. A normal qualification, I kind of expect that might be proven earlier before resolutions. Of course, there's actually a, I think there's a paper on the archive that claims resolution singularities, but I don't know the status of that. But up to dimension four over an infinite field, we know that it We know that it exists. So, you know, at least up to dimension four, we know that. So maybe I'll write it here. So if dimension of y is at most four, and y is over an infinite field. And when I say over, I mean finite type. Then there is such a Well there is such a f if and only for every f and I guess one would need to know that this normal My qualification is at least locally projective, but the known macholifications are such because they're all defined as a sequence of They're all defined as a sequence of blow-ups. And so the actual proofs produce projective macqualifications, not just proper ones. Okay. Any other questions? May I ask a question? Sure. Me? Okay. I just want to clarify that when we say there exists and then for all, so doesn't mean. All. So does it mean when there exists an F such that that's proper and birational? Or do we need the rest of the condition in part two that X is also normal plus qualification and blah, blah, blah? Or I guess I just didn't, I wanted to clarify what does it mean that there exist an F. So what's the condition for F? So when I say this, I mean an F that says An F that satisfies what's here. So, you know, take this sentence and replace the there exists with every. Oh, okay. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Anything else? So, yeah, I have a question. Maybe you already said this. You said the normal qualification is known when the dimension of the non-qualification. of the non dimension of the non-kuma carni locus is at most one is that in is that in uh sesnovich work or in in faultings or in who who who is oh this is in um in broadman's work sorry i i should have um so this is this is broadman ah okay yeah i'm sorry about that i had that in my notes i just uh i somehow skipped I somehow skipped over that. So, yeah, so this was before Kawasaki and Chestnut V cheese. I'm not entirely sure if it really needs that infinite field part. So I think it might be okay for arbitrary schemes with that locus being at most the measure one. And also, And also, I'm kind of hoping that with the newer methods, one can actually prove this in arbitrary dimension. Because when he did this, he only had faultings proof, which so faultings had the same assumption that the non-CM locus is at most one-dimensional. So, I just haven't had time to dig into that proof. But what I'm hoping is that combining Broadman's method with Broadman's method with Kawasaki's and Chesnavichius's actually could lead to a proof of the existence of normal macodifications in arbitrary demand. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Any other questions? All right. Then, so let me talk a little bit about applications. And so, as far as I could tell, the most applied consequence of my earlier paper was what the corollary that KLT singularities are called Macaulay. And this still is okay. So, let me recall. So let me recall. So if let's say x is normal, oh, I'm switching to x instead of let's go back to y. So if y is normal and ky is q Cartier and you look at the resolution of singularities say pi and we may And we may assume, let's assume that the exceptional set is actually a divisor, but you could just say, let's just take the divisorial part of the exceptional set. And then Kx can be compared to the pullback of Ky, and we know that the difference will be supported on the exceptional locus. And x has, sorry, y has KLT singularities if all these AI are larger than minus one. Okay? And then the theorem is that if x is KLT and co-mech only, then x has Then X has rational singularities in the above sense. Well, let me say this way that actually let me revise this to say that then if pi is a resolution, sorry, and I'm in my notes I switched X and Y and so. Switch to X and Y, and so now I have to work on not doing that. So if pi is a resolution of singularities, then star holds four pi there are. There are, you know, instead of resolution of singularities, you can actually assume that it's a normal McCullification and that pi is a locally projective pi-daciomorphism. And you can actually define KLT singularities without resolutions because everything is just about divisors. So you only need things to be Regular in codimension one. So there's a pair version. So there's a definition of a pair being KLT. And I don't really want to get into the technical details. So if you never heard of a KLT pair, this will not be illuminating. So and if you have. Be illuminating. So, and if you have, then you know the definition. Essentially, you can add boundary divisors to the canonical divisors and do a similar comparison and have a similar definition. And it turns out that I keep falling back to calling it X. So So there's a notion of a pair being KLT, and the conclusion is again that, and let me be a little bit sloppy here, so then why has special singularities let me note that you need to assume? Shandor, do you need to assume leader too? I'm sorry? Do you need to assume that? Yes, thank you. Of course. Yes, thank you. Well, okay, maybe I should say the pair is KLT and Y is Come-Con. Chandor, in your definition of KLT, are you assuming a resolution of singularities exists? Right. So I. On, I, in order to kind of okay, okay, so the answer is no. So, for the purpose of this talk, yes. And otherwise, I would have to adjust this statement. Does this answer your question? Was it Carl? Yes, that was Carl. Yes. And yes, to answering your question? Yeah, so you're saying you have to adjust it if you don't. So, you're saying you have to adjust it if you don't assume like a log resolution exists or something? That's right. Yeah, so I think in general, in order to define KLT, you only need a proper birational morphism from something normal that's the strict transform of delta is not contained in the singular locus of the. Singular locus of X, right? I think Carl is right. I mean, you can also just define it overall proper by rational maps from Y normal and just look at the discrepancies overall. Right, right, right. That's what I'm trying to say, yes. Yeah. Yeah, so in that case, so if we define it that way, then I would have to assume that. then I would have to assume that there's a normal myqualification. And this is kind of the better statement that if you take one morphism where X is normal and Macaulay and Comacauli, then the vanishing And the vanishings hold. Okay, so maybe I should do that here too. So for every pi x to y, locally projective and x normal and conca star holes. Are we happy with this? Yeah, Carl's happy. Okay, that's good. Okay, so we have this, and the kind of an important detail is that the delta here is not really playing an important role, other than to making the definition of KLT. The definition of KLT possible. So the delta, as far as the implication goes, the delta doesn't do anything or not much. And then, so one could ask, and Cola actually did ask this. So Cola posed this question to me not too long ago, maybe a year ago. Maybe a year ago, that can this be extended to DLT pairs? So DLT is yet another class of NMP singularities. And so, well, I already didn't do. Well, I already didn't do a lot of detail for KLT seniority. So it's sort of essentially DLT is, well, is approximately the following that there's some part, some parts where Where Y delta is an S and C pair, meaning Y is non-singular and delta is an SNC divisor. Yet outside of that locus elsewhere It is KLT. Okay, so sort of we want to extend KLT to allow, for example, coefficient one in delta. So in the definition of KLT, delta has to have coefficients strictly less than one. And now if you do, if you work in MMP, If you work in MMP, then this DLT is not such a big difference because minimal models and in most of the proofs, you always work with KLT singularities. But in moduli theory, DLT is very important because in moduli theory, you look at degenerations of KLT pairs. Pairs. And so at the minimum, you have to deal with log canonical singularities, log canonical pairs. And log canonical pairs can have coefficients that are equal to one. So for example, an SNC pair, Y is non-singular, delta is an SNC divisor. So SNC stands for simple neural crossing. So that pair is DLT, but it's not KLT. And so it's also. And so it's also a little canonical. And if you have a low canonical pair, then you can resolve that to a DLT pair, but you can not expect to resolve it to KLT pair because you cannot get rid of the coefficient one components. So this is actually important for applications in moduli theory, and the answer is yes, this can be. The answer is yes, this can be extended. So, basically, the same statements, you can put DLT instead of KLT. And let me mention briefly how this is done. And as I mentioned, As I mentioned, the data is sort of there to ensure that we can even talk about KLT or this type of condition. So for example, if Ky is not Q Cartier, then this whole business doesn't make sense because then you cannot pull it back. And you cannot pull it back. So you need to have a delta in order to make it a QCAT divisor, and then you can ask these questions about the coefficients. So in general, we have this notion of Y being potentially KLT or DLT or any of the notions of minimum order program. Notions of minimum order program, we can say that y is potentially KLT-DLT if there exists a divisor, a boundary divisor of Y such that Y delta is KLT or DLT or whatever your heart desires. So So, potentially means that you can find a boundary that makes it that. And the point is that we don't really care what this delta is. If there is such, then we're still focusing on why. And having rational singularities or these vanishing statements, these have nothing to do with the delta, but we need the delta so that they that. Delta so that they that we can prove this so potentially means this and um you can actually do this for for a pair so you can say that um and actually let me put a comma here so you can say that a pair is potentially KLT DLT if there's a delta prime such that when you add it to delta That when you add it to delta, then this is KLT or DLT. Again, this is not a big difference, so we can actually concentrate on the first one. Okay, so now here's the thing. As I said, this delta doesn't matter, but it's sort of when you do this proof, or when you're trying to prove this. Trying to prove this theorem. So, this is about the morphism. And the morphism kind of tells you what this delta should be. So, you might get a delta just from being potentially KLT, but you might also need to add something to that for the proof to work. And I know I'm being vague here, but my time is almost up. My time is almost up. So basically, the point is that there's an issue that, so what happens if the delta depends on pi. And so then it's kind of hard to say that something is potentially KLT if this delta is not. KLT if this delta is not independent because for every morphism you might get a delta but then it's not going to be you don't have a pair that's going to be KLT it's just for every morphism you have a delta that works but it turns out that for the proof this actually is fine so um so that led me to introduce the the notion of y being weakly potentially KLT. Potentially KLT or DLT if for every pi there's a delta pi in Y such that Y delta pi behaves as a KLT or DLT pair with respect to pi. Pi. So we're not asking that this would be actually a KLT or DLT pair, so it would work that way for any morphism, every morphism, just for this one particular one. So for this one, the discrepancies work out well. And now here's why this is actually good. So I bet this is actually from a minimal point of view, this is not an interesting definition because. Uh, definition because uh, you don't just want this to work for one single morphism, but but we have the following, which is uh kind of the interesting uh um result that I want to share, is that Y is weakly potentially KLT. If and only if it is weakly potentially DLT. So, if you allow the divisor to depend on the morphism, then you can actually erase the difference between KLT and TLT. Basically, the point is that for DLT, so the main difference is that a priori you have a, you allow coefficient one, but depending on the morphism. But depending on the morphism, you can actually replace that divisor with a different one that has a coefficient less than one, and you add a different divisor. But this different divisor will depend on the morphism. So this is definitely not true without this additional weakening of the notion. So KLT is not the same as DLT and potentially KLT is not the same as potentially DLT. As potentially DLT, but with this additional allowance that I allow the correction to depend on the morphism, they actually become the same. And then the corollary is that... Sorry, Shandor, can I interrupt for a second? So I think I'm missing something. So what happens if I have something smooth and simple normal crossing devices? Simple normal crossing divisor with coefficients one. So this is DLT. So, in particular, it is weakly potentially DLT. So, how can I make it KLT by adding something? Right. So, then what you do is you add a very ample divisor to delta so that it becomes, the sum becomes also very ample. And you choose a different representative. And you have to choose this base. Choose this base. So, this is why it depends on the morphism. So, okay, so basically, what happens is that you replace delta with something like one minus epsilon times delta plus epsilon times age. And so you allow taking off a little bit. Okay. Yeah. So you shave off a little bit and then the choice of this. And then the choice of this age, so that the age, the choice depends on the morphism. So I'm not saying you can do this, that you can find an age that will work for every morphism. I'm just saying for every resolution or every modification, there's an age and an epsilon that you can find that will work. This is a good question. I should have given this example. And so that's this is this is essentially the key. That it's just, you know, you have to do a little bit of work on how to choose this age. So it's sort of, it's not entirely straightforward. But something like this was already done in Cora Murray's book. So it's the proof of this is Is kind of repeating their ideas. It just sort of, yeah. Okay. And so if you accept the theorem, that the corollary is that in order to prove that a potentially DLT pair, the ambient thing has rational significant. Ambient thing has rational singularities, or that these vanishings happen, then you just say DLT is potentially or weekly potentially DLT, which is the same as weekly potentially KLT. So I can find a different boundary divisor which makes it KLT. And I already had a proof for that. So that's so the KLT proof works. Works for DLT. Okay, and I think my time is up, so this is probably a good place to stop. Thank you. Thanks so much. Are there any questions? Online? Is there? Online? Is there a question Zoom? So, what would be a good place to start? I mean, if one wants to understand this issue of existence of normal qualifications, I mean, of course, I understand that you have to start in dimension at least five, but are there some natural examples to look at? Um sort of natural examples for well if you are trying for example to try to hunt for counterexamples um well there's you know there's the example that the normalization of a comic holy is not necessarily comic holy is that so and and that's relatively easy so you just take a normal but not comic-holy uh variety so something like a cone over an abelian surface cone over an abelian surface and embedding into some projective space and then start projecting in general directions until it becomes a hypersurface and then that hypersurface is definitely comicoli and and this projection morphism will be the normalization and so so that tells you that uh you know if you normalize something macro comical it doesn't necessarily stay in It doesn't necessarily stain comical. Now, Brodeman actually has a general result which does not have this dimension restriction. And he says that if the ideal that you blow up is a radical ideal and it's normally torsion-free, then on the blow-up, the normal locus is preserved. So if you start with something normal, So, if you start with something normal, then the blow-up will be preserved. So, if you can do a maqualification with such blow-ups, then you're okay. And that's what he does. But unfortunately, the known maqualification proofs, I don't think they, so I actually can't say whether or not those ideals are such. Or not those ideals or such. So I haven't had time to figure that out. So maybe I should have said that this part is kind of a work in progress, but I'm kind of hopeful that this normal Macqualification is not impossibly on. Thank you. If I could also ask, so your varieties were over a field. Is there does it does your result extend to mixed characteristic? Result extends to mixed characteristic? Well, actually, the main result, this CAMP criterion, that doesn't need, that's not, this is in mixed characteristics. Actually, so these are exactly the assumptions here. Yeah, so it's, it's, it's, um, so the field of restriction is only in the broadening result. So in the existence of normal. The existence of normal neck qualification, he only states it over a field. I'm not too sure why, so I haven't actually figured out where exactly he really needs field. So at some point, he says that for simplicity, he's going to work that way. So as long as you're okay with a locally projected biracial morphism, then you don't. Then you don't need anything about the fields. Thank you. Or, I mean, you don't need it to be over a field. So everything I do is for general schemes. I mean, excellent and normal and home-coded. So not totally general, but so it works in mixed characters too. Thanks. Are there more questions? So, are there counter examples of trying to find a so you said that if you have something cohema colli and you take the normalization, it's not cohema college, sorry, it's a um so I guess my question is whether, let me put it simply, so it would make sense maybe to instead of normal consider. Instead of normal, consider G1 plus S2. Would that be something that has is so? Do we know that this could be a problem already? So you're suggesting assuming G1 instead of R1 or? Yes. So okay. So the thing, the only thing I know about the The only thing I know about this is that actually Brodman's resolution, where he achieves, so what he cares about is to keep the normal locus so that whatever you do, the preimage of the normal locus would still be normal. And he actually does it so it act so almost accidentally, it preserves the Gorenstein locus as well. So if it So, if it, well, okay, so that doesn't. So, the main issue is that even if you preserve the regular locus, the preimage of the non-regular locus could become co-dimensional one. So that's sort of the... So here's actually an example that kind of demonstrates how you can screw up something that's already nice. Take a plane, you know, with coding. You know, with coordinates x and y, and blow up the ideal x squared, y squared. And this is a complete intersection ideal. It's really very nice. But if you blow it up, then what you get here is a pinch point. And I won't be able to draw that. And I don't know if I even spelled this right. Is there a T and Pinch probably? Is there a T and Pinch? Probably no. So, you know, if you kind of blow up the wrong ideal, you can create some problems. So this is non-singular, and this one is not even normal, right? So it's hard to defend against this. But in Brodman's condition, he explicitly says that. He explicitly says that he wants his ideal to be a radical ideal. So this fails that. And of course, why would you blow this up if you actually know that you're on a surf on a plane? But the problem is that if you just find elements that have certain properties, and let's say you choose a regular sequence, and you might think, And you might think, okay, let's blow up that regular sequence, but this is a regular sequence, so it's just sort of, there's a better one that almost looks the same, right? But it's not exactly the same. But in terms of your result, the Kempf type result, would that still work if you just assume Coin-Macaulay and G1? No, so actually in the proof, I located the part where, so what I actually need in the proof is that there's no, so there's no codimension one associated point on X that's exceptional. So there's no, so X doesn't have a X doesn't have a codimension one singularity that gets collapsed. That's the point. And since Y is normal, assume normal, this means that X would have to be normal. Because if Y is normal, then it's R1. So the only way X could be not R1 if it has a one coefficient. On if it has one co-dimensional singularity that gets collapsed in Y. But that's exactly the part that I need. I guess one could so I have not thought about that, but maybe one could try to do parts of my proof for not assuming y normal, but maybe lessen that to Lessen that to something, yeah, I don't know what exactly, maybe semi-normal or something like that. In that case, X doesn't have to be normal either. So it's sort of, yeah. And I don't think assuming that that would be Goranstein, that would help. Basically, here's the problem. So this is the source of how I made this error. I made this error that at some point I have to take a Cartier divisor on a Y and pull it back and work with the resulting Cartier divisor. But I fooled myself into thinking that, well, Cartier divisors are like Lyme bundles and you can pull back Lyme bundles. But I actually need the actual Cartier divisor, not just the Lyme bundle. And so the problem is if you have a Problem is, if you have a coordination one singularity that gets collapsed and it's contained in your locus in the support of your Cartier divisor, when you pull it back, then it will contain that cotton one singularity and it will not be a Cartier divisor. So it's just it, you know, if I actually wanted to hide this thing from the referees, I think this was a very clever way to do that. Very clever way to do that. But in case the referee is in the audience, it was not intentional, but it worked. So yeah, so it actually took me a while to actually find the place where the mistake was made. And this is the place. I didn't think it made sense to talk about the error because it's kind of really. Error because it's kind of really deep in the proof, so it's sort of uh um so chonda. Your first example, the one with the three blow-ups, that is yeah, isn't that G1 because you're just doing two gluing two P1s together? Yes, it is G1, yes, but I don't know, okay, you're right. Um oh, I see, so then you're saying that it gives a okay, for a second. It gives a okay. For a second, I wasn't sure why. Yes, so Khan is absolutely right. So, so that example, so that example shows that the G1 would not be enough. Right. This is even Guranstein, right? So it has hypersurface singularity. So G1 is definitely. So, so G1 is definitely not enough. At least if the target is normal. Okay. Are there any more questions? So if not, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you. Thanks so much. Thank you.
