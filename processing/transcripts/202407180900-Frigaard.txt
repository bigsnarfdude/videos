Okay, so to begin with, let me just thank various people over on the left who, even if they haven't realised it, have contributed to my problems. Certainly my understanding of them. Some of them, solving them as well, is important. And although the research is funded by many people, probably ENSO is really the main one, but this research. Okay, so Okay, so these are the problems that I listed in the abstract. I'm really just going to go through them one by one. This is pretty much on the fifth floor of Voyd. Beautiful photo. So we'll start with gas displacement. Okay, so this is a problem very concerning industrial problem. This is this picture has nothing to do with the actual problem. Nothing to do with the actual problem. Okay, it's just a nice picture. Well, it could have something to do with it. It's got some nice bubbles going through an interface, and that does come up with these flows. The problem comes from a Canadian industry, which is the oil sand industry. So if you go to the northeast of Alberta, there are very large tailings ponds that arise from the oil sands industry. Industry scale, I think of 10 kilometers, not square because they're not square. Okay, depth is on the order of, say, 50 meters depth. So what's the problem? Well, there's approximately 2% of our emissions, thousands of emissions come from these. There are, of course, other similar Of course, other similar places you get greenhouse gas emissions, even from natural lakes and rivers. But this is certainly significant and it's one of the main problems. So the ponds are stratified and we have a water layer on top. We have something called FFT fine tailings and mature fine tailings down to coarse sand. So when the tailings are put in, the heavy big parts are the same. Put in the heavy big particles quickly. The fines are defined as being things under 44 microns. You also have significant clay fractions. So depending on the particular mining industry, they have different definitions for what clay means. Clay here, I think, is less than two microns. So depending largely on the clay to water ratio, you generate yield stress in the, in really what we call the liquid. In really what we call the liquid. So the liquid is really the water plus some of the clay. And you get yield stresses here of the order of 1 to 10 pascals up in this layer. And then they could decrease a bit because of increased solids content. But they might not always increase, okay, because in fact the yield stress depends. Because in fact, the yield stress depends really on its plate alteration that may not be the same. Okay, so bubbles arise in these because various things are being consumed, so methane and carbon dioxide are being produced. And there's a very simple balance, okay, but whether a bubble stays in the pond or whether it rises, that's just to say whether yield stress divided by a buoyancy stress should exceed some. Stress should exceed some number. And then the question is: well, what's that number? And does that depend on everything else, the pond, its shape of the bubble, etc. So that's the sort of background to this problem. And when you look at this, there's a clear porous media, which is here, okay, in coarse sand. And so this is certainly one thing we have. So, this is certainly one thing we have been modelling. It's the oldest part of the pond, so you would expect the bubbles per unit volume to be the largest, but they're only being produced in the liquid. And then they have to displace somehow through this network. So, we've done a sort of toy model in the last year, which is a poor throat network model. And what you're seeing is a uniform network, and the blue layers. And the blue layers here are residual fluid left on the wall, and the red is gas coming through the network. So this is what I call a Talon problem. It's pressure here, zero here, driving through the network. And so there's similar types of questions about the critical pressure for on second things like this. Okay, so that's the simplest thing, a nice uniform network. This has some nice problems and questions. Here's a simpler network. So I've got coming in here, wide, narrow, narrow, wide, narrow, wide, wide, narrow. So the critical pressure between here and here is the same if I go this way or that way. So the bubble's going to come in in a minute, and who's Come in in a minute, and who thinks it's going to go on the wide channel? Who thinks it's going to go on the narrow channel? So, hands up for wide. Hands up for narrow. Hey, let's see. What's the price? There are people winning, but there's no prize. So you can ask me the questions about why that happens. About why that happens. In the end, there was a broad chip. Ah, okay. So there's a little bit here. So there's some things like that we had no idea were there when we started. Okay, there's a second network I kind of like here. Here's some bubbles. These are bubbles going through carbohydrate, and you can see that they basically get more. That they basically get more long and pointy. If the yield number is lower, of course, Reynolds number is lower. To get to the inertial regimes, you can get these cap-shaped bubbles. So when you do these experiments, so these are from our work, there's many other nice papers that do bubble experiments. They look all fairly similar. So you do these, you have a bubble column, and you need to prepare the carbon. And you need to prepare the carbon bottle or whatever you're using. And in fact, all of these bubbles are what we call first bubbles. So if the first bubble goes through, you get these nice shapes. When you put a second bubble through, a few interesting things happen. First, you follow the same pathway, okay? Um but the second bubbles are usually both smaller and faster. Expert is from some work. So here's some work. Years ago, bubble one, two, three, one, two, three. This is the volume. This is the speed. So basically, the speed goes up and the volume goes down. And if you want to get repeatable first bubbles, you need to remix the fluid between experiments and then everything's fine. And that's what many people are doing, because you don't want to fix up new carbon core just for another experiment. So clearly, something happens here, and there's this beautiful paper by the group in Rio where they put, okay, these are two photos superimposed. Okay, they put a rod in the bubble column, this grey area, and they pull it out. So they clearly sh somehow shear the fluid there, somehow damage it, that's how we call it. And then they uh release the bubbles. Release the bubble and it follows the path where the rod was. The bubbles come up, following some path. So we don't really understand exactly what is going on when the bubble goes up, but clearly there's some form of damage. The pointy tails that you saw in the previous slide understood that carbopol is all agree now. All agree now. It's not purely physical plastic, but has elasticity. This could be, certainly, this can be elasticity, creating this pathway. Orthixophy is another option. But whatever it is, it's clear that because we are getting faster bubbles, somehow the viscosity is reduced in this channel. Channel. So we've done some experiments and simulations like that. So we've, this is our bubble columns. We've got carbacol, we have a water layer, or we've got carbacol and a weaker carbacol. So the way you do these is you put, you freeze the water, and you put that in, then you wait for everything to melt. And if you don't wait too long, you might get some diffusion, but that's how you get the. But that's how you get the two layers side by side. So you can see the bubble somehow senses this weak layer and is attracted towards it. Same here, senses this layer attracted towards it. It moves up at an angle. We can do the same things computationally here. We just use a venue fluid. This is the bubble. This is now a Newtonian layer I'm putting in there. And these are time shots. You can see the bubble. Shots: You can see that the bubble goes towards this layer, eventually, it's engulfed in the layer and just moves up the channel. Okay, so we go back to the pond. When you put a camera over the side of the boat and you look down, you're looking down at this mudline, you can see. Line, you can see this is some sort of sediment on top, but you can see these things called pop marks. I should want to mention that I don't send my students, I PhD students out on toxic plates, and this was work of a colleague. Anyway, beautiful photos. Okay, so you think, okay, so these pop marks, and so what's happening? Well, we started this project maybe four or five years ago, and our initial hypothesis was. And our initial hypothesis was this: that bubbles were pretty much everywhere, and then they would all just migrate individually. So now our hypothesis is this, okay, that we have a sort of network that is forming and coming up through these pot marks. So we're sort of interested in what's called a self-forming network, and then the bubble flows through the network. And you know, there's ever interesting questions like, well, what if I have a small channel and now I put a big bubble? I have a small channel and now I put a big bubble through there, which would widen a bit. If you went back to the previous slide, you could see that the shapes of the bubbles in the weak layers were not nice pointy bubbles. They sort of formed the stay the bubble shape. Okay, so that was the first problem. Probably we'll work on a bit in the coming years. Second one, squeeze cementing along a microannuli. You're going to see this in multiple. To see this in Mahdi's talk later as a brief primer to get you excited. So, Mahdi. This is sort of what it's about. We drill wells. A lot of wells leak. So this is the structure of a well. We have steel casings and we have cement. And we get leak. These are gas wells in BC. Leakage occurs here and here. This is a layer of cement. This is a layer of cement. The black line is a steel casing. And due to shrinkage, generally there's some detachment from the side, so gas can go up the sides. So how do you fix it? Well, you try to make holes in the side of the casing. So you put in what's called a perforation gun, you blow holes in the side of the casing, and then you want to pump cement. Cement into these holes, and they go, the cement goes and fills up this hole, and then it goes laterally, hopefully, to fill up these layers. So that's sort of what this is about. And Marley will tell you more about that. But I just want to say if you haven't seen a bear so far. Okay, so more on that coming later. Related to that problem, but also other problems, there are problems to do with filling of cavities, basically with slurries. And what I'm interested here in is the transition from suspension flows to filtration. So here are some of the problems, but squeeze cementing is, you know, can be one of these problems. Or construction grouting, illustrated here. Tunnel grouting, very similar. You're trying to fill in gaps to stop. So for tunnel grouting, you want to fill around these large concrete sections because you don't want water from the rock to leak into the tunnel. If you live in the UK, you probably have a cold, wet, miserable house. Sweat, miserable house. But if you did a damp-proof course, many of the UK houses are Victorian era, made of leaky forest bricks, equally bad cement. So it was very common to do a damp-proof course, which basically involves drilling holes and pumping something in to stop that. So that's the type of problem, okay? Basically, you apply pressure, you inject a yield stress fluid, or could be a yield stress suspension, into some cavity. Suspension into some cavity. Questions: How far does it go before it stops? And then, does the injected fluid form a barrier? So if pumping in here doesn't connect with the next hole, well, it's still just as damp and miserable. Okay, so what we're modeling is what is the stopping mechanism when you do this? And I think the answers would depend. You do this, and I think the answers really depend on various things. So, here are some of the scenarios. The thing to remember with these is it's really a filling problem. So, you've got a cavity here, and there's something in there. It might be air, right? Or it could be water. And you inject in some kind of Yoggstrus fluid. So, the first thing, you know, a Yogs plus fluid needs a pressure gradient to force it. So, as you get further and further away from your applied pressure here, the pressure applied. The pressure lights, but it's like a fluid pressure gradient decreases. So eventually it would stop in a long enough cabinet. So that's the real logical answer, and that's one we've used a lot. Then there's the filtration flow. So the suspension would penetrate into the channel, and then the filtrate leaks off through the walls. So what's left is the solid. So what's left is the solids of these. So if you're lucky, solids are small and they get to the end, the liquid leaps off. If you're less lucky, like Duncan was very unlucky, all of your things were clogging. But you know, these are both two and there's maybe also with the clogging, there's a question of whether that is a jamming phenomenon or just a different type of Or just a different type of model. So those are sort of the broad area, and we're interested in various things. So we've developed models that do essentially shear-induced migration, some kind of leak-off and some displacement. But a lot of things are missing. So we haven't really captured this suspension to porous media transition. And we it's only after doing the first work that we understood what we didn't understand. What we didn't understand. The leak off through the walls, the filtration, and the build-up bed is interesting. So, lots of things there that are ongoing. If people here are interested in the same problems, we're happy to talk to you. Okay, and we're doing it ahead of time. Okay, so fourth one was this continuum network modeling. So, this was Modeling. So, this was things Hussain showed on Tuesday. Broadly, the questions are whether this link between the porous media and network models can be made a little bit more transparent at the numerical level. We have questions. I'm not sure if we're happier now or are we less happy now when we came here, but we still. From when we came here. But we still have some questions, I guess, about that connection. And then it's just, you know, people have been doing these convex minimizations for this copostic roots for 70 years, I guess. And also well-established methods for networks. So, you know, I guess in principle, maybe I'm more interested in applying the network methods to more classical classical problems. But I think there's definitely a Benefits to looking both ways. Okay, and now the last one. I guess this is maybe more general. Okay, so when we're doing these simulations with Yoga Spress fluids and we're going into different pores, I really have an underlying doubt that we will ever get. We will ever get, let's say, general closure expressions. Sorry, Eva. And Pedro. But I've got a little bit more optimistic during the meeting, but we'll get some closure expressions. So wh wh wh where does this come from? Uh well there's two things. So the pore geometry always affects the flow, but really you know you would never know that except in some statistical uh way. Some statistical way. And then there are two unusual features that I just want to illustrate, to explain what I see as the problems. So the first is this idea of self-selection. So, you know, at any particular flow rate or pressure column, I think the point is that you don't actually know the region that is flowing. And so that's just a fundamental thing. And then the other question is the sensitivity of the limiting pressure gradient. Sensitivity of the limiting pressure gradient to the porous mediography. So, all of these come from she's work done nine years ago now. It's a Stokes flow, Bingham fluid, single phase, adaptive meshing finite element method that we've been using for since doing this work. So, it's a quite nice method. It solves It solves the physical plastic flow, evaluates the unyoded regions very well, the measure adapts to the unyoded regions. So that's how we're computing these. So let's start with this is work from Ali Rustai's PhD. And in this, we were doing flow along a channel, okay, and it's symmetric, okay, so. That's symmetric, okay, so seeing just half of the channel. And again, this actually came from an oil and gas application where this is what we call a washout in part of the well. And we just wanted to understand the influence of the geometry of this washout on the flow. And so what you're seeing here is contours of speed at a particular Bingham number. Flow rate is imposed, so we have. Flow rate is imposed, so we have a thing of number, and the grey regions are the unyielded regions. Okay, so now let's remove the speed. And yes, I've got three different ways of making a washout. So, this is a sort of a snowflake, square, triangular, or sine wall. Okay, so when we put together When we put together just the yielded and unyielded regions, it looks a bit like this. So here I have increasing depth coming down, and increasing length going across. That's the square, the ox snowflake. That's the triangle. Dying, back. What do you see? You can see that I hope you can see that if you were to look, say, here, this one, these ones a little broader, okay. But I hope you can see that these regions of flow are not really changing, okay? So uh the the flow self selects, okay, and we we've we're used to that, um, but it means that the actual cavity geometry becomes irrelevant. Cavity geometry becomes irrelevant in some sense. So, if you've got some porous channel, in a way, it doesn't matter. If you're going to characterize that with a porosity, well, it's pretty clear you need more than that. So, many geometries will give you the same flowing area. So, of course, it means many of these which would have very different velocities would have basically the same photo. It's not the same photo. And it seems very hard to really generalize and get this without. So that's sort of my concern. So of course we use dimensional analysis, we look at limiting cases, and we've seen many of these, but I still wonder if eventually you need to calculate for any characteristic geometry exactly you have to go through the calculation. Exactly, you have to go through the calculation. That may be true. Okay, limiting pressure gradients. So you get many of these models that are built on channels or tubes. So at least for some work done in Martavali's PhD and also we have a channel here with some roughness or some smoothness and We looked at the critical limit, okay, in these. These are short channels, these are long wavy channels, these are nice uniform channels. With these ones, it probably won't surprise you that the critical limit is the same critical limit as a spray channel. And you can look at the convergence of that. So the critical yield number is one, but you can look at the convergence if you're doing right flow. Applied flow rate. Okay. If it's longer, you can essentially integrate to find the critical limit. That works fine. More complex geometries, you have to compute. And here you can see you're getting these dead zone problems. And the other problem is that these are not really fully yielded or unyielded. Yielded. And so when you do that for those two geometries and these here, these are all similar channels. They're statistically similar. And you can see that you get variations in yield limits. So it seems that you have to somehow accept that these variations are there. Okay, so the outlook, this is the last slide. Yeah, so in flowing regimes, it seems Yeah, so in flowing regimes, it seems that the closure can't only depend on things like pore fraction, but it has to include at least a yield number or a million number, probably more things. Following the talks on the workshop, I'm more optimistic about the critical pressure. I think it's going to be a nice channelization aspect. I have a conjecture on what the critical limit is. It's sort of Limit is. It's a sort of cylinder rolling argument. So if you look at a Stokes flow through some bed of obstacles, for example, the squares and circles, then you oppose the pressure drop, the Talon problem again, and you ask what delta P does it start. Well, I think if you pick a path between any path between the start and the finish, you essentially roll a larger cylinder. You roll the largest cylinder possible along that path. For each path, you can compute essentially a critical pressure. I calculate this integral along the path. And I think then if you take the minimum of those, that would be your critical pressure. That's probably what that argument is. Okay, so with that, I'll stop and thank you. And that was that was from the hype. Oh, nice. We have time for Presidents. Thank you very much again for the nice part. I didn't know that you had so many problems. Oh, since you left, Mahalo. So yeah, the first problem part was interesting different flow and different channel sizes. So have you tested the converging and diverging channels and what Channels and what you showed, like the flow should go through the diameter part, right? This is the bubble going through the network. The first problem where you had the network of channels. So. Oh, you mean, would it be the same if you had a converging via diverging? I think it would go through the diverging folks. I would, I think it would go through the diverging. I mentioned you guys before. Better systems. Really cool problems. A lot of really interesting things to think about. For your first problem, the levels that kind of form this converging network. I guess in the real system, the yield stress is changing vertically as well. So have you thought about that? Can you have a grant to where you're seeing? We do have. We've been trying to model. We've been trying to model that, and you can actually get public data on the distribution of solids through these panels, the annual reports they release on that. So you can at least get some understanding of plate to water ratio and solid content as you go down. And it's not always long-term. So what's the implication of that? Deep other round. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. For one more question, Alex? Yeah, um what about compressibility in in uh gas network? Gas. Yeah, um it depends. I guess, you know, it's there, but it's not in the model. No, no, yeah. Because we did not one-dimensional model last year in computer course we did before we had compressibility. Video for your compressive, very interesting stuff. Fix the prices. Yeah, I'm sure there will be a lot more coming in that. I mean, we haven't really done anything else on that effort. We probably should. Okay, so with that, let's hanker Ian again.
