Could we start? Yes, yes. Okay, it's my pleasure to introduce the next speaker, Stefan from UT Dallas. The title of his talk, Renormalize Volume of Partially Bounded Sub-Regions of a Symptomatic Hyperbolic Einstein space. Partically hyperbolic is nice spaces. Please. Thank you so much to the organizers for this for inviting me to speak at this conference. It's been very nice and it's an honor to speak. This is joint work with Matt Gurski and Aaron Terrell, who's a student of Matt. And I'm happy to say Erin's going to be coming out to be a postdoc at UT Dallas this fall. But it's only a one-year postdoc, and I must say, if anybody's looking. I must say, if anybody's looking next year for a really strong, really strong postdoc who has a very good view of all of this material, very good at computing things and contributing to the theory. Please keep Aaron in mind. He contributed very significantly to this project. Okay, so this, of course, has been covered a number of times now. A number of times now, but an asymptotically hyperbolic space is again a compact manifold X, dimension n plus one, has a boundary m, and it's equipped with a metric we'll call g plus on the interior x, such that two things are true. So for every defining function phi of m in x, the metric phi squared g plus extends to a smooth metric on the entire manifold x. And this And this implies, of course, that the original metric blew up to second order at the boundary. Recall that a defining function is a function that vanishes precisely to first order, precisely on the boundary. And we have the normalization condition that the length of dφ with respect to this so-called compactified metric is exactly equal to one along m. So, given such a manifold, you can define the conformal infinity to be the conformal class of the compactified metric restricted to the boundary. The metric, the compactification restricted to the boundary is not well defined, but the conformal class is, because if you choose different defining functions for the boundary, you still get a member of the same conformal class. Okay, and then we say that. And then we say that g plus is Einstein, of course, if the Ricci tensor is equal to negative n times the metric. And we're going to be focusing on the case where n equals 3, so the Einstein space is four-dimensional. The boundary is three-dimensional. So this picture, of course, as many, if not most people here are familiar with, has been very Has been very important in the, well, in lots of ways, starting perhaps with both Ray Fromatseo's work analyzing these in the 80s and also the Pfefferman and Graham project to analyze conformal invariance by using these metrics. So that leads us into this important tool. So if you have an asymptotically hyperbolic metric, not necessarily Einstein, you have this very useful normal form. So suppose you start. Normal form. So suppose you start with an asymptotically hyperbolic space, and it has this, it has conformal infinity, which we'll call m and h, and you choose a metric in the conformal infinity. Then for epsilon greater than zero, sufficiently small, you get a unique diffeomorphism from this product space onto a color neighborhood of M so that the pullback metric has this particularly nice form. And I should have said before, of course. And I should have said before, of course, as Fang Wong did say earlier, the model of an asymptotically hyperbolic metric is, of course, the hyperbolic metric. And the normal form here sort of gets as close as you're going to be able to get to the upper half space model of hyperbolic space. So G sub R here is a one parameter family of metrics on M, and G zero, when R is equal to zero, is this chosen metric. So G sub R will not be flat. Metric. So G sub R will not be flat in general, but it's still a nice product decomposition. So these nice normal forms are in one-to-one correspondence with the members of the conformal infinity. And that makes this a particularly nice tool to use to study the relationship between the conformal geometry on the boundary and the Riemannian geometry on the inside in general. Okay, now let me. Now, let me just point one more time. We have this form. So, the only undetermined thing in general here is the G sub R once you've put this in normal form. Now, if G plus is Einstein, and again, we're assuming four dimensions on the interior, then we have the asymptotics G sub R equals H, your chosen representative, minus R squared times P plus R cubed. plus r cubed g3 plus order r to the fourth so there's no order r term and p here is the scout intense intensor of the chosen representative which is given by this formula and g3 which is the so-called non-local term is trace free but otherwise is formally undetermined by h so again feng wong covered this in greater detail earlier the idea is you you choose Uh, you choose H, and you already know what the order two part of the expansion of the Einstein metric must be, but you would have to have the global Einstein metric to know what G3 was going to be. And I should say the asymptotics here formally are due to Fefferman-Graham, and the fact that you can actually expand any at least C2 Einstein metric and get such asymptotics is crucial to Leigh Lee and Skinner. Crucial to Leigh Lee and Skinner, the regularity result. Okay, so we're going to be focusing on an important global invariant called the renormalized volume of four-dimensional asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein space. It's actually an invariant of any even-dimensional asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein space. So let R be some geodesic defining function. Geodesic defining function and consider the volume of this with respect to the asymptotically hyperbolic metric of the set where r is greater than epsilon. So because g plus blows up to second order at the boundary, of course, the volume blows up, but you can, if for fixed epsilon, you can expand this as a series in epsilon. And due to the parity properties mentioned in the previous slide, what you get is something of this form where C0 and C0. Something of this form where C0 and C2 are constants determined as integrals over m of local curvature quantities. And then you get this constant term, and then you get higher order stuff in epsilon. So V plus is global. It depends on the interior geometry of G plus. And a priori, it would seem that V plus should depend on the choice of geodesic defining function that you took. Defining function that you took because these are different sets for different such choices. But the big theorem, or the first big theorem, due originally to Henningsen and Skanderis, and proved in this particular form in a little more detail by Robin Graham in 1999, is that in fact the renormalized volume is independent of the choice of R. So that follows from, again, related parity considerations, but it's true. Parity considerations, but it's true again only in even-dimensional asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein spaces. I'm going to slip and say Poincaré Einstein one of these times, so I should just say now that that's a synonym for asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein, as I'm sure most of you know. So this makes it a very nice global invariant, and of course, the question then is what can you do with it? And so one of the You do with it, and so one of the first big theorems about the renormalized volume is this theorem of Michael Anderson from 2003, a so-called Gauss-Bannet formula for the renormalized volume. And so what we have here is that 4 pi squared times the Euler characteristic of the global manifold x is equal to 1 eighth times the integral of the Weill tensor squared. Weil tensor squared plus three times the renormalized volume. So you get a really beautiful Gas Bonnet formula. One thing you might think looking at this formula is that it's not completely clear that the integral term converges since again, x with respect to the g plus metric has infinite volume. But you can see that it does if you recall that the norm squared of the while tensor squared is a pointwise. Is a pointwise conformal invariant of weight negative four. And this is a, of course, the volume form is a pointwise conformal invariant of weight positive four. And so this product is just a pointwise conformal invariant, an absolute pointwise conformal invariant. So if you compactify the metric, this integral doesn't change. And so you can see that this is finite. Okay, so this was proved using a different method by Using a different method by Chang, Ching, and Yang, Yang, rather, in 2008, and also generalized to higher dimensions. And they also proved a number of different identities, which we won't be getting into today. But we want to talk about the method that they used, because it's the method that is relevant to our theorem, which we may or may not have time to discuss in detail proof-wise. So, suppose you just have a couple of the So, suppose you just have a compact manifold with boundary, compact four-manifold with boundary. So, we're going to say you have x g bar. So, g bar is some compact metric, smooth out to the boundary, and h is going to be the induced metric on the boundary, which we'll call m. So, of course, you have a Gauss-Benet formula, Chern-Gauss-Benet formula, and Chang and Qing in 1997 put this. In 1997, they put this in a form that's very nice for conformal geometry. So they say that you can write the Euler, the topological term here, as the sum of this interior integral, where again, you have exactly the same bile term. And then you have half of the so-called Q curvature of G bar. And then you have the boundary term of two terms, which they call L H and T sub H. And these four quantities have the following properties. These four quantities have the following properties. So, if you make a global conformal change on the whole manifold x, getting a new metric we'll call g bar twiddle, these quantities transform as follows. So vile squared, as I said a minute ago, is a pointwise conformal invariant of weight negative four. Q is not a pointwise conformal invariant, but the degree to which it fails to be a conformal invariant. Fails to be a conformal invariant is parametrized by this operator, which I'll go ahead and put the next paragraph there. This operator, I guess I didn't say the name here, it's the Panitz operator. It's essentially the second GJMS operator. It's the second conformally invariant power of the Laplacian. In particular, it's a linear conformally covariant differential operator. So, from a conformal geometry point of view, this is still. From a conformal geometry point of view, this is still pretty nice because you've got this nice conformally invariant operator parameterizing the change. And it's linear. Okay, then L again is a pointwise conformal invariant. I'm not giving you the definition of L, but it's just a combination of extrinsic geometry terms, extrinsic and intrinsic. And then T, again, an extrinsic geometry term is not conformally, pointwise conformally invariant, but again, the change, it's change under conformally. Its change under conformal transformation is parametrized by this nice linear extrinsic conformally covariant differential operator. So this is a differential operator from functions on X to functions on M, and its coefficients also depend on the extrinsic geometry of M in X. So once you have this formula, the The way you can prove the sketch, let's say, of how you can prove the Gauss-Benet formula for renormalized volume is the following. If you have an Einstein metric, well, first of all, say you have an asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein metric and you cut it off at r equals epsilon, or so you look at the manifold where r is greater than or equal to epsilon. Now, even g plus itself on that manifold is a compact Riemannian metric, and since it's Einstein. And since it's Einstein, its Q curvature, one can show, is identically six, which means this integral essentially turns into just the volume, three times the volume. So then the game is to analyze the other terms and control how their asymptotics as epsilon goes to zero. And it tends to be easier to compute those with respect to a compactified metric. Compactified metric, and then use these conformal change formulas where omega is equal to negative log r. So, in other words, you use the compactified metric r squared times g plus. I hope that was at all clear. Okay, so that was the idea of Chang, Ching, and Yang. So, So, the setting that we're going to consider is the following. You have an asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein four-manifold, but you also have a global minimal surface Y, a three-dimensional minimal surface Y in X, that extends smoothly to M, and it divides your manifold in two. And we call those two pieces X plus and X minus, and the naming is completely arbitrary. You can just think of it as choosing a normal, choosing. Is choosing a normal, choosing a side, you know, orienting y, choosing a side of y, if you will. But you choose one of them to be x plus, and that's the one we're going to be interested in. So this is this, sorry, was it says participants can now see your screen. Was there a problem? I can see everything normal. Yeah, no problem. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Sorry. So this setting, the setting in particular. So, this setting, the setting in particular of having minimal surfaces that come into and meet M was studied first, so far as I'm aware, by Graham and Witten, who used this as a method to study the conformal geometry of submanifolds in M. So, where y intersects M is a, in this case, a hypersurface in M. In this case, a hypersurface in M, and you can study the conformal geometry of that by considering this minimal surface. And that's been pursued by a lot of people, including some here. I think Youngbing Zhang, Robin Graham, and Nick Reichert, and of course, Governor Waldron, and many other people have pursued that. It's also been used a lot in physics. So, this is our essential setting. And we want to consider the renormalized volume of x plus. Volume of x plus whatever that should mean. So you fix a geodesic defining function r for m and then you want to consider the volume of this region where both r is greater than epsilon and you're in x plus so this distinguished half of x. And so if you do this for parity reasons, again, you're going to get an expansion like this in terms of epsilon, and there will be a constant term, which we're calling. And there will be a constant term which we're calling v plus plus, you know, because it was already v plus, and now we have x plus, so it's it's v plus plus. If I guess if computer programmers can do it, we can do it. And then plus something that vanishes to higher order. It's not immediately clear that V plus plus is well defined. So in the case with no hypersurface Y, the proof that The proof that this does not depend on the geodesic defining function r for m depends on a product decomposition at the boundary. And you don't quite have a product decomposition of x plus necessarily because y can bend a little bit. And so it seems maybe a priori plausible, but at least to me, it's not completely clear that it's well defined. I should say this renormalized volume has been considered before, in fact, in a much more general setting. Much more general setting by Gover and Waldron in their paper Renormalize Volume with Boundary. And so they defined this not just for Einstein spaces and not even just for asymptotically hyperbolic spaces, but certainly for all asymptotically hyperbolic spaces with a dividing hypersurface. So their paper is, in one sense, is much more general, but it also does not show that this is a well-defined quantity in the Einstein case. For now, we're going to defer that question and so just consider the geodesic defining function r to be fixed. So, now suppose you have a hypersurface z in x. We're just going to define a curvature, an extrinsic curvature quantity on it that's going to be useful here in a minute. So, you can define this asymptotic curvature quantity to be negative the inner product essentially of the trace-free second fundamental form of Z with the Ricci tensor of Z plus one-third times the. Of z plus one-third times the mean curvature times the norm squared of the trace-free second fundamental form minus one-third times the trace of LZ cubed. And for those who are familiar with the Chang-Ching paper, this is the same thing as negative one-half L4 minus one-third L5 in the notation of that paper. So the important thing about CZ is that it is a pointwise conformal invariant of weight negative three. Of weight negative three. So if you take Z and you did a global conformal change on the interior metric on X, CZ would transform as a pointwise conformal invariant. Okay, so our first theorem is the following. So with Y minimal as above and sigma 2 being the intersection of Y with M, and if you let H be the induced metric. And if you let h be the induced metric on the tangent space of y, then we have this Gauss-Bennett formula. So we have the topological term from x, and we also get a topological term from the corner, sigma 2. And we have the usual vial term on the inside. And I'm sorry, this is a mistake. This should be the integral over x plus. And this should also be the Euler characteristic of x plus. I'm sorry, I forgot the pluses in both of those cases. X minus just doesn't matter for this picture. So Euler characteristic. picture. So letter characteristic x plus and the integral over x plus. Then you get the integral over y of c y with respect to the induced metric, and then you get this plus 3 v plus plus. So because again, this looks like it might not converge, but it does because we know that cy is a pointwise conformal invariant. And an immediate corollary of this theorem, of course, is that the quantity v plus plus is in fact independent of the choice of r because this formula doesn't depend on r so. So, nothing else in the formula does, I should say. So, this both gives a proof that V is a well-defined quantity and then gives a Gaspinet formula for it. So, having proved this, we then used this formula and we wanted to consider in the second part of our paper how the renormalized volume of V plus would vary if we move Y through minimal surfaces. So, suppose that we have a variation. So, suppose that we have a variation of minimal surfaces in Y. So, we have some family, smooth family in T of immersions or embeddings, I guess, of Y into X. And it's minimal for each T. So we're making no assertion at all, of course, of the existence of such a thing. We're just assuming you have such a thing. So, suppose you happen to have some nice variation of minimal surfaces like this. You might wonder then. You might wonder then, so for each t, you're going to get a v plus, sorry, an x plus for that t, and it'll have a renormalized volume by the previous theorem. And the Gauss-Benet theorem will apply, so you can use that to compute the derivative. So I need to define some notation. So suppose that mu sub y is going to be the unit normal vector to y with respect to the g plus metric and pointing into x. And pointing in to x plus. And we define this function f on y by simply defining f to essentially be the normal component of the variation vector field of f. And then we have to define a bit more. So there's an induced variation. If you have a variation of these minimal surfaces, there's an induced variation of sigma in M because. Variation of sigma in M because if you're moving the surfaces, then you're presumably moving the corner, or at least you can be. So we define this F twiddle to be the induced variation of sigma in M. So it's really just the restriction of F to negative epsilon epsilon cross sigma, where sigma is the boundary of y. And we let this new bar sub m be the unit normal to sigma in m with respect to h, which is the H, which is the metric corresponding to R on M in the conformal infinity inward with respect to X plus. So the reason we call this new bar sub M, there's also a new bar sub Y. It's not going to come up today, but it comes up a lot in the paper. It's the normal to sigma in Y. So the notation in this setting gets really hairy, really fast. Anyway, we define this to be simply the normal, F twiddle is just the normal component of the variation vector field. The variation vector field of the induced variation. So, with all of this said, the variation formula is that the derivative of v plus plus at t equals zero is given by a sum of two integrals. The first one is an integral over sigma, the corner, of f twiddle integrated against g3 evaluated at both two times on the normal vector to sigma in m. Now, what's g3? Well, remember all the way back, this is the non-local. All the way back, this is the non-local term in the expansion of the Einstein metric. So it shows up here in the derivative of the renormalized volume. And then here, we also get a global term in y, which is, sorry, let me go back. I'll say that in a minute. We get the finite part as epsilon goes to zero of the integral over y intersect the set where epsilon greater than zero of f times the norm squared of the second fundamental form of y. form of y so that's that's what it is that's what comes out of the formula and i do want to point out though that uh f if you if you know that if you knew that you had such a variation so you you started with y and you knew you were going to get such a variation if you knew f twiddle you you would know f because f is determined by an elliptic by the solution of an elliptic boundary value problem that's that's solvable uniquely given f twiddle by Uniquely given F. Twiddle by, for example, work of Matseo and Matseya Melrose or Lee's monograph, Jack Lee's monograph. So in some sense, this derivative is determined just by the normal component of the boundary variation. And that's it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Any questions, comments? So let me ask that: do you have size control of this V plus for some special minimum surface? No, I mean there might be, but I don't have it. I see. I see. Because in the model case, I'm just talking about a model case. Talking about a model case, you do have this size control of the renormalized volume. Well, you can compute it if that's what you mean. I mean, yeah, one could compute it, of course, for if you took the hyperbolic ball and you just take the obvious minimal surfaces. Yeah, one also knows the extreme case happen on the model case. I'm just talking. I see, I see. Yes, no. I see. Yes, no, I don't. We don't have that yet. Yeah. But that would be interesting. Yeah, maybe for special Y, it can be computed. Yeah, yeah. That's right. Hi, Stephen. Hi. So, what happens if the dimension of the CCE is odd? Of the CC is ordered. Say E13. Yeah. Well, then there's no Gauss Bennett formula to use. So I don't know. If there is such a formula, I don't know how to look for it in the odd-dimensional case. I do, of course, I assume, I don't know how nice it would be, but there are. I don't know how nice it would be, but there presumably is something in higher even dimensions that one could write down that would just be messy. But as far as odd dimensions, the Gauss-Bonnet integrand vanishes. So it's not so easy to know what to do. Also, the renormalized volume is not an invariant. I mean, can we expect the log term gives some conformal events? The log term, you say? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a really interesting question. Yeah, I think you probably can, but we haven't looked at it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think it's maybe interesting because it's a conformal geometry for the four domain with boundary on the conformal infinity. Yeah, I agree. It's an interesting question. And I think, you know, we used the Gauss Binet to show that V is well defined. But essentially, we went through, in our proof, we went through steps that are essentially equivalent to showing that. So one could do that for the odd-dimensional case, and you might get an interesting, yeah, you might get some interesting log-term behavior there, which would be very interesting. Yeah, I agree. That's an interesting question. I agree that that's an interesting question. But we were focused on Gias Bonnet, so we didn't do that. Thank you. Thank you. Any other question?
