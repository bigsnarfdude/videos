Association of Women in Mathematical Physics. That it was very like very nice of her that she contacted Anna and me. And so I let her to introduce herself what is going on in their association. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks, Nesla and Anna, for giving this lot to introduce the newly founded Association of Women in Mathematical Physics. And I'm Cristiana Caracci. So, sorry. Um, so sorry, okay. Let me just start with a brief story of this association. Um, around half one year and a half ago, a group of women in the mathematical physics community, more I would say in the quantum many body communities, uh, had the chance to write a special edition of the bulletin for the International Association of Mathematical Physics. Association on Mathematical Physics, which was out in April 2022. And they, in this bulletin, they interviewed some professor in the community about their life and as well they did some statistics about minorities and gender gap in the association, the International Association of Mathematical Physics. Mathematical physics. During these meetings to prepare these articles, they realized that we're basically facing the common problems, common issues among them, and they wanted to extend the opportunity to meet with other women in mathematical physics to share the experience, or just to. The experience, or just to like have some informal chats to support each other. That's how some we call them coffee meetings were born. And at the same time, we wanted to make things a bit more formal. So we wanted to like formalize these meetings. And that's why we decided to found a proper association. Found a proper association. Thanks to CONI, we realized that there were already some initiatives in this direction, like WOMAP, organized by NESLA and Dana. And so we decided to join forces. And this March in 2023, we founded officially the association. This is just a brief story of how we. Of how we born, and to give a face of ourselves, these are some of the women involved in the association. In the board, you can see you can't see my. I can see you closer. Okay, okay, thank you. So, of Connie, Ana, Simone, myself, and Serena Schratiempo are. Are a part of the board, and then there is the committee with Amanda, Esla, Emanuela, Leia, Maria, and I think there is missing Chiara Bocat in the pictures. Yeah, the aim of the, I mean, I want to say that we try to be as much as international possible. As much as international possible, even though we're not aware of all the people, all the older women not based in Europe, let's say. But for instance, Amanda is now back in the US and hopefully Anne Vandenbosch will join the committee. So she's in Chile right now. So we try to expand worldwise. To expand worldwise the association. And the aim of the association is to support women in the field of mathematical physics, establish a network and meeting spaces for them to promote diversity and equal opportunities for all individuals in mathematical physics. This is quoted by the statue of our association. So I was telling you about I was uh telling you about some activities that we have, like uh the coffee meetings. These are informal meetings that take uh place once per month. Uh we try each month to have two slots, one at nine and one at three, so that uh also people know yes exactly. Yes, see European time central European time. Yes, thanks, San. So that also um with different uh time sheets people. Different time shifts people can join. There is a reading group in which we read every month either a paper or chapter of a book about gender gaps in academia or minority gap in general. Then there is, and these two are quite active. Are quite active activities. Then there are events. I mean, Anna itself and herself and Nesla are involved in organizing conferences that are organized through the Association of Women in Mathematics, which is a different association, but they are together with us. And there is a group. Group that tries to promote hybrid conferences, the sense that they try to collect data to support hybrid conferences because we think that during the pandemic, we realized how powerful can be having the possibility of having online conferences, and we think that. And we think that this should be continued and not just stop after the pandemic is over. So they are meeting to summarize this data and to promote this. I'm not exactly sure at which point they are right now. Then you plan to have also a mentoring program. plan to have also a mentoring program. And shaping in the initiatives means to, I mean, the association is just born, so we want also to connect with other similar initiatives and to like enlarge our community. So this means shaping the initiatives. So if you are interested in joining Seed in joining us. There is a website. Now, let me I want to can you see the website? Okay, this is a work in progress in the sense that the web page is ready, but we still have to buy the domain, so for technical issues not yet online. Issue is not yet online. And here you can see the names of people in the board and in the committee. And you will scroll around the different activities that we have. And there will be a direct link to the registration page. But for now, if you're interested in Um I lost it. Sorry. No, sorry, what you're looking for? No, I was looking for sorry. Can you see it? Okay. So now, if you want to join, this QR code links you to the This QR code links you to the registration page, which is already active, so you can actually scan it. And if you have any question, feel free to write me. Here I brought my email and yeah, that's it. Thanks very much. Any questions? I cannot hear you, Suzanne. Any question? Yes? Maybe just to comment, thank you so much for your work. I think, I have a feeling that there's a lot of European members of the association, and I would be very interested in maybe expanding the network to some other mathematicians, at least in North America. At least in North America, maybe Latin America, because the certain I could look into. And I just want to say there are a lot of people in mathematics at least that I know of working to support online options in conferences. So we could kind of join forces in that sense. Because I do think it's been really important for tens of groups in mathematics to have that option, especially now we are seeing laws against. Laws against transfos, laws against freemen, laws against black dollars, wealth against all sorts of like reasonable things in the United States. So it's becoming actually dangerous to go to certain states to certain places to conferences. And there are lots of people working to try to convince at least big associations like the Association of Mathematicians of the United States. Okay, that's famous, yeah. For big events like the National Conference, the Events like the national conference, the joint map meetings is what it's called in the United States to be to also have like that online option. I would be glad to kind of share whatever I know about toilet sources. Thanks very much, Flora. So actually, I can probably can just link here. I mean, to the board members, and that would be fantastic if we have any extra hands on America. Uh, on America, north and south. So, because I mean, as again, we're mainly based in Europe for now, but we want to expand. I definitely need to need to expand and actually learn from, for example, the Association of Women in Mathematics in North America. I mean, that's really huge. And I think we can share quite a bit of the activities with them. So, yeah, cool. Yeah, or someone else's office. I'm having trouble reaching the website. I put an association with mathematical physics. All I get is the OMAT and AWM. Do you mind sharing, Christina? Can you share the Zoom? You mean for the registration page? Because the website isn't online yet. Yeah, I mean, website is not online. No, no, no, no, it's not online. It is a will with. I hope that in less than a month it will be online because we still have to buy the domain. So it's. I mean, this has taken a while. I mean, like, just we're established as an association in Switzerland, based in Switzerland. And for example, things like opening an account where most of us do not live in Switzerland. That has been quite a game. But we do have now. So now. So now that we have an account, we can buy a domain and then we can just get things going. So, but we should be there very soon. Yeah. Okay, since there is not any more questions, yes, please join their coffee meeting and then you can see other people or join their board or committee meetings if you. Meetings, if you like, we'll just see what is going on, and we're very, very happy to get more members and have more activities. Well, thank you so much again, Christina, for the nice talk. Thanks to you. Thanks for coming today. And now probably we can go to Connie's.
