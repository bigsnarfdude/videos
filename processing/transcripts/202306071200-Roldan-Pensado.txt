So, uh I'm the second speaker for this morning this morning's session is going to be um the radar of that. Thank you. So sorry for not giving a title in advance. I never sent it to Levora. But well, I'll be talking about transversals and colorful sets. So just very quickly, well, I should mention this work is with Coltemo Comez Navarro, which is a student of mine. He's right now in the limbo between master and PhD. So hopefully. In PhD. So hopefully he'll start his PhD soon. So I'll just quickly. Yeah, this is not working now. Okay. So I'll just remind everyone quickly, Helly's theorem. You all know it. If I have a family of convex sets in Rd, every D plus one of them intersects, then they all intersect. I drew here a non-example. I drew here a non-example. So if I have a family of sets that don't intersect, it's because d plus one of them didn't intersect. And well, after Helly's theorem came the colorful version of Helley's theorem. And I guess you all know this as well, but I'll quickly remind you. So now we have a family of convex sets, but it's colored. So typically you have D plus one colors. And what you're assuming is that whenever you take Assuming is that whenever you take a colorful subfamily, which means one of every color, then this subfamily intersects. So, here, for example, if you take red, green, and blue, any red, any green, any blue, let's see if this works. No. So, I don't know, here is a point of intersection between this red, this blue, and this green. So, you always have to have these. So, you always have to have these intersections. So, if this is the case, then you can find one color that is intersecting. So, in this case, reds are not intersecting, greens are not intersecting, but blues are. So, this is the colorful version, more or less from 1980, because this wasn't published when it was discovered. And what happened next? Well, this exploded. There's a bunch of colorful theorems now, and I'm going to talk about. And I'm going to talk about two of them. Well, this is the intersection. Oh, and this is a generalization of Helley's theorem. I guess you all know, right? You just take the color classes identical and you get Helley's theorem back. So I'm going to talk about Dolnikov's conjecture. So this time we're not going to be talking about general convex sets. We're going to talk about the translate of a specific convex set. So here we start with a fixed. So, here we start with a fixed, compact, convex set K, and this conjecture is in R2, so it makes things easier. So, now I'm going to take a bunch of copies of translated copies of K around the plane, and I'm going to color them with three colors. And I'm going to assume that whenever I take two different sets of two different colored sets, they intersect. And the conjecture. And the conjecture is that if this is the case, then I can find one color class that can be pierced by three points. So this is an example with triangles. So I have a bunch of triangles. I've colored them. And any two of them of different colors intersect. This is maybe not a very good example because here everything intersects, but I don't know. Maybe the blues didn't have to intersect. And the conjecture is that I can find some color, in this case, any color classworks. So, for example, the reds, and I can find three points such that any one of the red sets contains one of these three points. So, this is the piercing number. And you imagine that if you have the convex sets, you can put what are these called? You can pin them down, right? And you killed every. And you killed every convex set of this color. So, this is his conjecture from 2011. And Karasov proved a non-colored version of this. So, I think that's where this was like the colorful version of Karasov's theorem. And later, Pablo here with Jesus Geronimo Castro and Michael. Jesus, Geronimo Castro, and Margassinov showed that this is true when the convex set is centrally symmetric or when it's a triangle. And you did a bit more. So I think they discovered that apparently having three colors is not really important. So they made a new conjecture. So this time we're still in the plane, but now we have n colors. And I'm going to. And I'm going to assume that whenever I take two sets with different colors, then they intersect. So, here the number of colors could be three, it could be more, or it could be two. And well, what they think is that there will be some color such that everybody except that color can be pierced by three points. So, this is the same example as before, but only with two colors. This is like what was the case in Dolnikov's conjecture. And you could add another color. You can add as many as you want. And they proved this in the case where K is a circle. So, this was 2015, and we're going to go forward a bit and talk about a computer. Forward a bit and talk about a completely unrelated theorem, which my student says is like the very colorful Helly theorem. I argue that it's not more colorful than colorful Helly, but less colorful. So I didn't know what to write up there. So this is a theorem I worked on with Leonardo Martinez, with here, and Nathan Rubin. And what we were actually doing is seeing how strong the hypothesis. Seeing how strong the hypothesis from the colorful theorem, the colorful Helly theorem was. So, as I said before in the colorful Helley theorem, you find one color with a point. So, forget about that color. Well, you have a bunch of other colors and they still have a pretty strong conditions, right? So, can you say anything else? So, in this setting, the number of colors is one less. So, now Is one less. So now I'm left with the D remaining colors, and I'm going to have this colorful assumption, right? That whenever I take one of each color, they intersect. So we found that there were two possibilities. So one was that I could find one color that can be pierced by few points. So in this example here, I'm in the plane, I only have two colors. I'm in the plane. I only have two colors this time. And you see that, well, the red sets are all intersecting. So in this example, I can pierce the red sets with one point, not the blue. And if this is not the case, then I can find a small number of lines. These are one-dimensional lines that intersect everybody. So, in this example, well, I have a bunch. In this example, well, I have a bunch of vertical blue sets, a bunch of horizontal red sets, and I cannot pierce any one of these families with few points, but I can find like a diagonal line that touches all of them. Right? So, in this example, I can find one line, which would be like this, that intersects everybody. So, yeah. We studied how many points. How many points, how many lines we needed. The general bounds we have are ridiculous. But in the two-dimensional case, we proved in this paper that we could either have one point or four lines in the plane. We also noticed that the number of lines should always be at least half of the dimension in general, but we don't think this is. General. But we don't think this is a good lower bound. And another thing, which is maybe a bit funny, is that it seems that, well, not in the plane, but in general, you can play a bit with these numbers. So imagine that for some magic reason, I know the optimal values of f and g. So this optimal value may not be unique in the sense that I may be able to increase f and decrease g. F and decrease G, or vice versa. So there's a bit of wiggle room. I think the interesting case would be to see when they are more or less equal. But I don't know. This is my feeling. In reality, we don't know much about these values. But well, I have these two numbers from this paper. This was a very simple argument, really. And then we started thinking about this again with Qualtemook. This again with Kualtemok during his master's thesis. So this is just there, so you remember it. So this is like this thing I said in the plane, but I'm emphasizing that it's either one point or four lines. So what we did is we changed this four into two, which is not very Which is not very exciting, but this is optimal. And it's too bad that Sheera didn't make it, but we used her idea with McGuinness of using the KKM theorem. So I thought I wasn't going to have to explain this, but maybe it's good to do it. So the KKM theorem says essentially this. If I have a simplex, so here I have a triangle, and I have a cover. And I have a cover of this simplex. So, say you number the vertices, so one, two, three. I want a cover such that the first element of the cover covers the first vertex. So, this would be red, colors the red vertex, green colors the green one, blue colors the blue one. And I want this segment to be covered by well, by the one corresponding to this one and this. Well, by the one corresponding to this one and this one. So, in this case, this face of the triangle is covered by red and green. And I want this for all faces, of all dimensions. Then the conclusion is that I have a point in common to everyone in this cover. So, in this case, like this intersecting point is at the same time red, green, and blue. So, it's very believable, right? So, this is the KKM aether. So, this is the KK A theorem, and we're going to use a slightly higher-dimensional version of this. But it's exactly the same thing that She-Ra and Daniel McGinnis did in, I think they have two or three papers where they explore this idea. The idea is to somehow parametrize all the lines, all the pairs of lines. So, what they do is they take a giant circle. So what they do is they take a giant circle that captures all the convex sets we're working with. They fix one point here, which is like, I don't know, just give it one, zero coordinates. And then you choose another three points ordered around the circle. And then you measure like how much this arc, the length of this arc, this arc, and so on. And then I have four numbers, which Four numbers which add up to a constant and are always non-negative. So, this is a simplex. And once they have these four points, I just choose this line and this line. And these are the candidates to being the two lines which intersect everyone. So, I assume that the theorem is false. And that means that this is not intersecting everybody. So, I missed someone. So, that someone should be in one of these. Someone should be in one of these regions, right? So, for the point in the simplex corresponding to these two lines, these three points, I give it the color corresponding to the region where this set is. And this gives me a coloring of the simplex. And then I use the KK, well, it satisfies all the hypotheses that you have to check that. But then what the KK theorem says. The KK theorem says that I can find a point which is colored with all, which is contained in all the covers, all the sets, all the open sets of my cover. And what that means is that I find sets in each one of these regions. Now, these all have to be in the same color because they don't intersect pairwise. So then I just take someone else that intersects them all. Someone else that intersects them all, and that set has to contain this center point, right? So, if I couldn't find two lines that intersect everybody, then I can find a point that contains all the red ones. And this is the proof. And it's very similar to what they had done before. It's almost identical, which is funny because they were thinking on yeah, related problems, but not the same one. Anyway, this one. Anyway, this was, I think this is a nice proof. This was completely Qualtembox idea. And well, I just want to comment that these numbers are optimal. I cannot do it with only one line. And of course, I cannot do it with zero points. Okay. So then we started thinking about things in between Dolnikov's conjecture and this very or less. Conjecture and this very or less colorful thing. And the idea was like to, well, I'll tell you what we could prove. So again, I'm going to have a family of convex sets. I'm going to color it. Here, I don't really care about the number of colors. I have a bunch of them. I'm going to have this colorful hypothesis that whenever I take two different colors, two compact sets of different colors, they intersect. Then, Then I can find one color such that everybody that is not of that color can be pierced by a few points, or I can find a small number of hyperplanes that intersects everybody. Now, this is different from this colorful, very colorful Helli, because here, sadly, we have hyperplanes. Sadly, we have hyperplanes, not lines. So, lines would be stronger, right? But on the other hand, here I don't really care about the colors. My hypothesis is a lot weaker because I only have pairs intersecting. While in Helly's theorem, you have D plus, well, D tuples in this case. So it seems like. Right now, no. No, this is general. Later, they will be something. So we showed that we can choose these numbers. And you might be thinking, well, why didn't you just write one over here? And the reason is because, again, I feel like you can play with these numbers. So maybe you can write two here and then use something smaller than the here. This is my feeling. I don't know. Is my feeling, I don't know, and and what we well, this what we meant in the proof, we kind of converted this into the uncolored version of this theorem. So yeah, maybe don't read this yet. So while we were proving this, we actually showed that sometimes. Sometimes you can take this number down to one. And in exchange, you don't have points here, but you get that all of the families except one. So where is this? So this thing here, that is something which is pairwise intersecting. So you get a bunch of new intersections. And so the colors don't matter here anymore. And then you can go to uncolored versions. And family. And families of pairwise intersecting convex sets have been studied a lot, not in general, but for specific classes of convex sets. So, for example, if I don't have a general families of convex sets, but I start with families which are homotic copies of some fixed convex set, then there is some theorem saying that this has a bounded piercing number. Number and then I can just plug that one in over here. So sometimes I can get this g down to one. So I only have one hyperplane transversal. And again, if I want to go down to having only one hyperplane, then I can, there's like a whole list of theorems like this. And they just give me stuff here. So in this case, for example, for disks, For disks in the plane, I can take this equal to four. Axis parallel boxes, I can take this one all the way down to one. So this is one of the reasons why I feel in general I should be able to decrease this one and increase this one. Because for a lot of families, I can take the gene all the way down to one. And the F goes up. Well, not here, but in general, it goes up. It goes up. So, after, well, you're going to say this doesn't look so much like Dolnikov's conjecture. I have like either points or a hyperplane. In Dolnikov's conjecture, I only have points. But it turns out I can use this for Dolnikov's conjecture. So, this is what we managed to do. So, again, I'm going to go back to R2. I'm going to go back to R2, which is the easy case. I'm going to take a convex body, I'm going to take translates, so exactly as in Dolnikop's conjecture. I'm going to use two colors only this time. I have the pairwise intersecting hypothesis. And as you know, Dolnikov's conjecture was solved for centrally symmetric and for triangles. So we wanted to push this a little bit, see what we wanted to prove the. See what I wanted to prove the general one, but we didn't manage to do it. But we managed to get the three points in two cases. So, one is when my convex body is very close to a circle, which is really expected, right? If you can do it, no, I think it is. And the other one, which was a bit weirder, is I can get it for constant width. Okay, so what I want to talk about. Okay, so what I want to talk about is how we managed to solve this. Oh, and I should note that with these line transversals, K-flats, points, these are all a fine invariant. So when I say that something has to be close to a circle, well, it could be close to an ellipse, right? So it doesn't have to be a circle. And then you just do a linear transformation. Circle, and then you just do a linear transformation, and you're in the circle case because I am going to use the circle. Okay, so the idea is to use the previous result. So, as I told you, there's a bunch of cases where I can get G all the way down to one, and then I just need a theorem which is uncolored. And as I also told you before, Karasev proved the uncolored version of Dolnikov's conjecture. Of conjecture. So, what this tells me is that if I am dealing with translates of a convex body, I can have either one line or three points. And I'm going to use this to prove this one. So let's assume that three points is impossible. What that means is that I have one line which is transversal to everybody, right? To both colors. And additionally, I know by the one-dimensional Helley theorem that if I have a family which is two colors and every two intersect, every two of different colors intersect, then in any direction, I have a line which is transversal to every one of one of those two colors, right? You just project and you find the Helly point in the projection, and this goes back to a line. So let's assume this is. Assume this is so. Let's assume that this is the direction in which I have a line transversal to both colors. And then I'm going to choose another three directions. And I'm going to choose them so that these angles are 45 degrees. Then, because of Helly, I know that in these directions I have lines transversal to one of the two colors. So let's say. Two colors. So let's say, I don't know, for example, this could be transversal to everyone in F1, this one to everyone in F2, this one to everyone in F1. These are just the directions, right? Not the lines. I don't know where the lines are. Well, by the pigeonhole principle, I have two here, which are the same. Now, I'm not taking directed directions here, right? So this one is the same as minus this one. So, because of this, I always get something like this. So, I can always find three directions, 45 degrees, and they are all transversal. I have transversals in these directions to the same color. Right? So in this one, in this example, I would maybe flip this one, and then I have exactly this. Right? Good. Good. So now let me draw the lines. So let's say that this one was the horizontal line. The other two lines are there somewhere. And now I'm going to look at the convex sets. So I'm going to choose a center for each of the convex sets. This is not necessary. I just, I don't know, it's easier to visualize. So when I have constant width, let's say constant width one. Let's say constant width one. Well, I can put this in a square of site one, right? And then just to make things easier, just take this point at the center of the square, and then just do the two lines which are orthogonal to this direction. So I get this hexagon, which is touching the figure like this. And in the case of the Banach-Masseur distance, so I didn't say what Banach-Massur distance was. I didn't say what Banach Masur distance was, so maybe this is a good time. So, what this means is that I can find a circle, and then I can blow this circle up by a factor of, I don't remember the number, this number, and my convex set can be placed in between. It's sandwiched between these two disks. Right? So, this, what this means is that this convex set is very close to a circle. So, just take the two circles. Just take the two circles, and this is the choose this as a center. So, where are these centers? Well, because this is transversal to everyone of color one, let's say, the centers have to be in this strip, right? Because if it's above this strip, then, well, in this case, Well, in this case, this side of this hexagon would be above the transversal line. And in the case of this circle, no, I'm taking the outer circle this time, would be above this line. So here, let's say that this distance is one half, I guess. Then take this distance as one half and this one as one half. So then all the centers are in this strip, right? The centers are in this strip, right? And the same happens with the other directions. So I get a strip which is vertical and one that's 45 degrees. So that means all my centers are inside this hexagon. And that's good. They're all clumped together, right? Because I want to find three piercing points. So what do I do next? Well, the shape The shape of this figure depends on this line, right? So it's a square, and I'm just removing two corners. So if this line is going through the intersection, I get something which is symmetrical. But as it moves, well, I start getting more and more of this corner and less and less of this. So in any case, I can always fit this shape into something like this. Fit this shape into something like this. Now you can check. Do some easy computations, right? Like the worst, one extreme case is when it's symmetric, and the other extreme is when I get the full corner here. Okay. Now I want to find piercing number three. So all the centers are inside here. All the centers are inside here. And if I want to find three points that intersect everybody, well, this is equivalent to finding three copies of minus k that cover this pentagon. So now my problem is finding three copies of the convex set that covers this. So for the constant width case, Case, what we do is we split it like this. Why, like this? Because it seems to work. And there's a theorem by Kachelsky, I think, that tells you when you can cover a region by a figure of constant width. And it's, well, it says that you can always do this if. This, if any rotation of these figures can be fit into a relaud triangle, and that's convenient because now we don't have to check everything of constant width. I only need to check the relaud triangle and its rotations. And we have very nice pictures, but I didn't include them sadly. So it turns out you can do this. And it's actually. And it's actually, well, it's close to not working. It's not so bad because really this pentagon is a lot bigger than it had to be. But it barely works. So rotating this square is more or less easy. Rotating these things is a bit complicated, but these are symmetric. So I only had to check one. But what will you do it? I mean, we made pictures and we saw, yeah, it just barely works. And I guess you could do it formally. I think. It formally, I think we didn't actually do it. We convinced ourselves because of the picture, but not yet. It's just been sent. So it's in archive. I mean, you can do it, but it's like a bunch of computations and quadratic inequalities which can be solved, but it's really tedious. I mean, you have to be checking these distances, a lot of those distances. A lot of those distances, and they're not so nice, yeah. But I mean, you have, I don't know how to do it without just doing a bunch of computations, and because distance is quadratic, it's ugly. But I mean, I'm convinced by the picture, and you can see that you have a little bit of wiggle room, so yeah, we'll see how the refereeing goes. Yes. Okay. So if you have a set and you want to cover it with something of constant width one, then you can do this whenever you can cover it with every rotation of the Roulette triangle of the same width. If you have a set, then it can be covered by any set of constants, there's one. Yes, if you can any rotation of the roulette triangle can cover it. Exactly. Okay. Yeah, I didn't read the proof of that. I hope it. But it's in a book. So in order to hit yourself, you don't need the picture, but you need the next. Yourself, you don't need the picture, but you need an animation, right? Yeah, so we had an animation. Well, not exactly an animation, like we had a bunch of pictures that looked like an animation. Yeah, yeah, but I mean, we have a very small amount of pictures. It wasn't 60 frames per second. So, this was the hard part. The close to the circle is the easy part because you just do it. Yeah. So, this is the Yeah, uh, so this is the inner circle, right? First, we used the outer circle, then we used the inner circle. That's why you need the one, yeah. So, just yeah, and we can it's easier to write it like this, but we, there is a horrible expression for this number, but yeah, it's exactly the number you need so that this works. So, with this. So, with this, well, this is not exactly phrased as Zolnikov's conjecture, but this implies Zolnikov's conjecture for in these two cases. And of course, we want it to be more general than this. So, this whole idea kind of works in other places. So, you may notice that here we only have two colors, and I talked a lot about n colors in general, right? So, it turns out that we lose something when we have more colors. When we have more colors. So, this is like the general statement. The proof is almost the same, only it's in arbitrary dimension. So, I have a convex body in Rd, and there is some number so that if I color the translates of K with n colors with this colorful intersecting hypothesis, then, well, I can do what you would expect. I can find one. Do what you would expect. I can find one color so that everyone else can be pierced with few points. But I don't know how big this is. So, in the conjecture by Pablo and et al., in the plane, they said this should be three. So, in the planar case, we can show that this number can go down to nine. This is probably not very good. This is using the same idea, but now we don't have a Using the same idea, but now we don't have a nice pentagon, we have the square. We couldn't find this third direction. So we end up doing, and we use like Banach Masur in the easiest way possible. And we end up having to cover a square with very small circles, and we need nine of them. So that's where this nine comes from. And so for constant width, So, for constant width, which was like a nice thing, we can't go down to three if we have n colors. So, it stays at four. And in the case where I only have two colors, and this is important because it implies Dolnikov's conjecture, then we can show that in general we can do it with eight points, so a little bit better than this one. And I think that's it. Yeah. That's it. Yeah, okay. Yes. The partition you may remind it with this one? Yeah, but that one. You have pentagons and partition which looks very much like the golden radio helps to make up. Mean help to make a formal proof of it. I don't know. So, this partition was like, let's try it. I mean, we did it experimentally. And then we saw that this was like a nice number we could put here. Probably not. I mean, first this pentagon is too big. And then we saw that this one worked and we said, okay, let's leave it like this. But yeah, maybe there's some. Even that parameter you could move a little bit. Yeah, this one you can move it a little bit, not much. This was a nice rational number, that's why it's there. But yeah, maybe there's something better. I mean, this was enough to get three points. We know we cannot get less than three, so when you said that one, two was optimal, did you mean that I cannot lower it to one line. One line. So you cannot put it to one line. Regardless of the number of points. Yes. What about like changing the 3-3 into something like QA? And it's the same thing. Which 3-3? Like just for two families. If I have two families, instead of 3-3, you want to say that, right? Yeah, so but there was no three three so I had I mean I mean the conjecture is that you can the conjecture is only with three points and that's it well only one class did I go too far? Yes, I went too far yeah so the no I want I want the I don't remember where it was yeah so I had this 1.2 Yeah, so I had this 1.2 lines. This is optimal in the sense that one line is not enough. And in this one, I could choose one and three. No, no, no. The original conjecture. The Bolnikov conjecture. So there you have three colors and it's just three points. There is no lines. So, what if so? So, you could say that you can either pierce the color one with three or the color two bits or the color three lit three. Yeah. Well, what if you change color one to two and increase the other two? I don't know. Or just be two colors, actually, right? Like, like sorry. I feel that in this case you cannot go below three. You cannot go below three because of a triangle example. I'm not sure right now, but in general, it seems that these numbers, they do have some wiggle room. So, in general, maybe in higher dimensions, you can do something like this. I don't know. When you say triangle example, so what I'm saying is that if there are two families, I either can pierce one family with just 100. Or the other one with 100. Yeah. So I feel like that should be true, right? Because I don't know. I mean, it definitely should be true for some numbers because you take, I mean, especially for translates, right? Like, they can't be arbitrary far. They cannot be arbitrary. Yeah. But I don't know if you can, in general, go below this three. No, okay, I see. You can always get yeah, you can get. Yeah, you should be able to play with this as well then. It's the same thing, right? Maybe you can scroll there. Yes, just any details there. Any other big question? No, so thanks again, guys. No, so thanks again.
