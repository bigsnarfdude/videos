Changed a little bit the title of my talk. So I changed the because the first title was efficiency of data sets and random designs. So I changed the name because I noticed that no one is actually no one likes here random things. So I will not speak about it. I will just mention what was the problem. And I will focus mostly actually on first on some things connected to the universal. Some things connected to the universality of quantum grades, because there are also some people who want to use maybe some methods we developed, and then a little bit about this efficiency. And it will be all somehow connected to this theory of t-designs. So that's why they are in the title. Okay. Okay. So I will start with some basic definitions because I don't want I don't want to rush. So by s, I will always denote some finite sets of quantum gates. These are just unitary matrices. And if we put here some small index l, it means that we are taking words of the length l built from this alphabet, which is available. So on those matrices u1 up to u k. And then we all know what does it mean that a set of gates is universal. Set of gates is universal, so we can build all the possible words of all possible lengths. And then, if the closure of this is actually a unitary group, or actually it's enough that this is unitary group up to the global phase, then the set is called universal. Okay, so you can simply say that, and if we have the universal set, then any unitary matrix can be arbitrarily available up to a arbitrarily well up to a global phase approximated by an element from sl for some l so by the by the by by a word of of some length okay so it's also good to quantify it a little bit uh what does it mean that something is dense and that it approximates and so on so for this first purpose it's it's good to have some measure of distance between elements of the unitary group Uh, elements of the unitary group and actually of the projected unitary group. I'm always like somehow emphasizing that it's not really needed to consider the full unitary group because, anyway, the global phase of a state is not important. If we look at the unitary operations as channels, then this conjugations is canceling the global phase. Okay, so the distance between two elements in the ULD will be the minimum of the norm. Of the norm of the difference between u and z, but I multiply v by an approximate base so that, for example, if I have u and e to i phi u, then they are the same element. The distance between them is zero. Okay, and here you can choose any norm you like, but I will be using always the operator norm, so the biggest singular value of a matrix. Okay. Okay, and then this usual definition can be stated using this, the usual definition of the universality can be stated using the distance d. So s is universal if for every element in the group and for every epsilon there exists a word of the length l such that the distance between u, which we want to approximate, and this w, which is this word, is less than epsilon. Is less than epsilon. Okay, and for some reasons, I also want to introduce some notion of epsilon nets. They will be important later on. So I know that probably everyone knows what is epsilon net, but let's just for the sake of completeness say that if we take some finite subset of matrices in unity, then we will call it epsilon net if for every If for every unitary element, there exists some element in this set which is at most epsilon distance from this from this element. Okay? And then we can also state the definition of the universality using the notion of epsilon nets. Okay, this is a little bit of the madness what I'm doing here now, but let's do it. Yes, S is universal. For every epsilon, there is L epsilon such that S L is epsilon map. That SL is epsilon map. Okay. And the purpose of what the next step, which I want to discuss, is how to actually check that something is universal. We know many examples of useful gates that are known to be universal, but if someone gives you some, I don't know, raising random gates, can you simply verify efficiently without doing too much if they are actually universal or not? Okay, so this is what. Okay, so this is what I want to discuss first. And for this, I will need this notion of t-designs. So, and in order to speak about t-designs, I have to speak a little bit about functions on the unitary group. And those functions, which I will be interested in, are polynomials. And this will be a special type of polynomials, namely, they are not homogeneous. Are called homogeneous and here it will be just an example of one one. So let's maybe do it in order. So let's focus for a moment on the simplest unitary group, which is mu2, simplest non-trivial of my non-abelian. Okay, so then here is an example of a homogeneous polynomial of degree one, one. This degree one means that I take every one one means that I take every time one entry from this matrix and then it has to be accompanied by a conjugation. So the entry conjugation and then entry conjugation. Okay, so the polynomial is of the degree two itself. It is homogeneous in the usual sense of the definition of homogeneity of polynomials. And this one means that one entry is normal, the one is conjugate. One is conjugate. Okay, so then how to generate all possible polynomials of this type: that one is normal entry and the other is a conjugation of an entry. So you can simply take a tensor product of U and U dagger, sorry, and U bar. And then the entries of such a matrix, they are all possible things which you can put in this homogeneous one-one polynomial. Okay? Polynomial. Okay. So, how to write nicely any possible one-one polynomial? So, it should be some linear combination of those elements. Yes. So, some alpha, ij, and then entry of this matrix. But this, if you define a matrix A to be like this, then you can compactly write this thing as a trace of U, U blah, and this matrix A. This is. This is so this is an arbitrary matrix, okay, which is in this case matrix which is four by four, and this is mu times mu by four. Okay, and this way we generate any polynomial of degree one. Okay, of course, you can generalize this to homogeneous polynomials of degree tt, and you don't need to. And you don't need to focus on the group U2, you can take UD. Everything is exactly the same. So any polynomial of degree TT will be of this form. You have to take T times tensor product of U. So this will give you those U elements, entries without conjugation, and then tensor product T times of U bar, and then some big matrix which is of the size which Size which of the same size as u tensor t tensor u bar tensor t. Okay, so this is how you can create a homogeneous tt polynomial. And now I want to finally define what is this t design. So another ingredient which we need is some natural measure on a group, on the unitary group. So we have a natural measure which is a hard measure. You can think about You can think about it as a measure which actually does not somehow distinguish any element in the group. It's a natural uniform measure of the group. And then having a finite set of elements from a unitary group, I can also define a discrete measure, which is just for every element in my set, I associate a weight which is. Associate a weight which is one over the number of elements in the set. Okay, so this is like the very natural choice of a measure for a discrete set. So then a set of gates with this natural measure, one over s for every element, this will be called the T design if we have the following identity. So calculating the average of any Tt homogeneous polynomial with respect to the Haar measure. Polynomial with respect to the Harr measure, we get the same result as calculating this average of the same polynomial with respect to this. Okay, and it has to be the same for all homogeneous TT polynomials. So then we will call a set a T design. So basically, averages with respect to the hard measure and with respect to my chosen set are the same. Chosen set are the same up to polynomials of degree tt. Okay, can I ask a question? Yes, please. So, I learned from my colleague that if you do two designs, you're looking at the first moment and second moment, which is an average and invariant. How does that statistical intuition correspond to the definition of the T design theory? These are higher moments, simply. So, can I understand that F1U corresponds to the average and F2U corresponds to the variant? you corresponds to the variant f to f one to be like when t is one then at one design time that's the average or that's the average of a polynomial which is of the degree one one okay it's so okay it depends how you what do you think how you define the those okay Okay, can we discuss it a little bit later? Because I don't want to go into these details of how to define those variances for polynomials and so on, and it will not be needed. Okay. Good. So, of course, you can imagine that it's actually kind of difficult to find a set which satisfies such a weird condition, yes? Condition, yes. So the idea is to find sets which are first approximately satisfying this condition, and we have to quantify somehow what does it mean that they satisfy it approximately. So we already know that this space of those ET polynomials, yes, it's spanned by the entries of this matrix. So we can construct some operators, okay? Operators. One operator will be with respect to the hard measure. So we are integrating this UTT. And the other one will be with respect to the R measure. And then we can calculate the difference between those two operators and take the operator norm of it. This operator norm, you can show that it's always between zero and one. And of course, if something is an exact t-design, then every Then every this thing and this thing is exactly the same because those averages are the same for any TT polynomial, yes. And the entries which are here are just the averages of those TT polynomials. So then something is exactly designed if this delta is zero. And if this delta is bigger than zero, but of course it cannot be bigger than one, we say that something is approximately designed. So the closer to zero we are, the better is our approximation of prediction. Approximation of criteria of an exact theta. Okay, do you have any questions to this? Because this was actually quite important point. Yes. If something is a t-design, does that invite us t minus one design? Yes, I didn't mention that stronger and stronger. Yes, exactly. If something is t-designed, it's t minus one, t minus two, blah, blah, blah. Yes. So there seems to be two notions of distance here between like the unitary just done in you have like the conventional notion, you know, you have your unitary another one that's approximating it and you're doing all that difference. And then by this method that you've now constructed, you have this delta, which you're now using as like a measure of like separation. I'm just curious, one are they different and if so, how are they? Are they different? And if so, how are they relations? This will be actually, this is one of the points of this talk, to relate. They will be very soon related. But the point is that this is a distance between the sensor unitaries, not between three unitaries. Okay, so yes, so what I will show you is that if something is epsilon net, it has to be some kind of an approximate TD. Some kind of an approximate tree design, and if something is approximate t-designed, it's a psilonet, and then you can like use this thing to somehow say something about the lengths of the circuits, and so on. Okay. So, here is like one slide where I'm like listing some applications of those approximate T designs. So, they are actually T designs. They are very important for randomized benchmarking. Randomized benchmarking, good of state discrimination, complexity growth. This is actually some subject which was very recently quite popular. And also, what I will show you, they are kind of useful for the criteria for universality of quantum gates. And this is all because, so all those applications here come from the fact that in many tasks in quantum information, what we want to do is. In quantum information, what we want to do is we want to calculate an average of some physically important function over the set of gaps, over all possible unitaries. And the natural way, of course, is to do it with respect to the hard measure. But doing this integration with respect to the hard measure, and in particular, like applying it in the lab, is very difficult. So that's why it's better to find some finite set on which you can do the same thing. On which you can do the same thing, you can calculate an average with respect to this discrete set, discrete finite set, and get the same result. Okay, and here is some inequality which is telling you how this delta somehow relates to the difference between those two things. So if delta is zero, you will get exactly the same results. And if the delta is non-zero, you can somehow estimate it by the first norm of this matrix A, which encodes this polynomial which is. Encodes this polynomial which you want to average. Okay, so that's good further. So now I will speak about this about those applications for the universality of gates. So once again, a reminder that this UTT is exactly this tensor product. And then I will define those two things: STT and UDTT. So this will. U D T T, so this will be. I'm taking matrices from S and I'm constructing this UTT, and also from all the matrices from U, U D, and I'm doing this UTT for that. Okay? And also a notion of a centralizer. So if I have a set of matrices, let's say this B is a set of matrices. So everything which commutes with them is a centralizer of B. Okay? So first thing we So, first thing which we proved, kind of maybe a long time ago, actually, is that if we have some set of unidary matrices, and if this set satisfies this condition, namely that this centralizer of it, of its S11, is the same as for the unitary group. And this is actually very easy to verify this condition because. To verify this condition because basically it means that the dimension of this space and this space, these are the vector spaces, should be two. So you can just write some equations and mathematically I will check it for you. So then, if this condition is satisfied, there are only two options. Either this set S is universal or it is a finite subgroup of a unitary group. There are no intermediate possibilities here. For example, it cannot be infinite. Cannot be an infinite subgroup which is not the whole unitary group itself. Okay, so this condition already rules out a logic. Okay, so since I wrote here TT, you may probably already see what I'm going to do because since one, one is the necessary condition somehow for the universality, then perhaps taking higher T's will give you the Will give you the also sufficient condition. And it is like this, but there are like two theorems which we proved. One is some kind of a connection to those delta approximate T designs, and then the other one is of this form. But we need this one to prove this one. So that's why I'm like showing both of them. And of course, I'm not going to prove anything. So if we assume that we have a set which satisfies this. A set which satisfies this necessary condition for the universality. Okay, so then this set is universal if and only if it is delta approximate six design for qubit and delta approximate four design with delta strictly less than one. It's very important when the dimension is anything which is bigger than two. Okay, so then you can translate. Okay, so then you can translate this results, this result, to something like this. Okay, so if you have a set, then it is universal if this condition is satisfied or if this condition is satisfied for the qubit and for all other dimensions. And checking if those things here are satisfied is basically comparing dimensions. Okay, and I can count. Dimensions okay, and I can calculate the dimensions in those cases using some representation theory of the Itary group and so on. I can do it, and we calculated them. So basically, the conditions are like this: take the centralizer of S33 for keep it, and if this dimension is 132, then it is universal. And for this three and four, you have those two formulas, and actually, starting. And actually, starting from D was for this dimension stabilizers. This is somehow connected to this representation theory of the unitary group, but I don't want to spend too much time discussing it. Okay, how much time do I have? Three or four more minutes. Good. So maybe I actually want to say a little bit about this because now we are done with this universality quite. Universality criteria, and no one can ask the following question. Okay, so what is the relationship between action nets and T designs? So look, if I have some set on a unitary group, some set of elements, which gives me quite well averages of polynomials up to order t, it cannot be like it's not nicely distributed over the unitary group. There should be some connection between. There should be some connection between those two notions, okay? So, basically, what we showed here is that if we assume that we have a set which is delta approximately t design, okay? And this delta is of the order, the dimension blah blah blah divided by epsilon, and the sort of t is of the order like this, and delta is of the order like this, then this set must form an epsilon net. And epsilon net. Okay, so it's up to some, I would say, constants, but those constants are calculated. I didn't want to write down some ugly numbers here, so I'm not giving those constants explicitly. So there is this connection between t-designs and epsilon nets, and then you can use this connection to formulate somehow. Some analog of, let's say, Solovai-Kitayev theorem, but it will be a theorem which concerns let's which have which have the following setting. Let's say that I'm fixing precision, which I want to use. So epsilon is some fixed precision. And now I'm asking what is the length of a circuit which is needed to epsilon approximate any unit R. Okay? Okay, so this length can be given by this formula here. So basically, this delta nu st is kind of an important thing. Yes, if this is, if this thing is close to zero, then the formula is nice. So this constant is not like blowing up. And if this delta USD is very close to one, then this. One, then this constant is actually very big. Okay, so one can also do the following because this T can be arbitrary, okay? Okay, so I can take the supremum over all the T's. Okay, and it's not immediately obvious that this supremum will be smaller than one. Be smaller than one, okay, strictly smaller than one. You see, I cannot have here something which is equal to one because the formula will explode. But let's say that I have a gate set for which this is smaller than one, okay? So then I can formulate a sort of IQ type theorem with log. This is a linear thing here, yes, without any power three and so on, for those gates for which this. Gates for which this thing holds. Okay, and now one can think a little bit about what are actually possible values of this. Let's say that this is not equal to one, okay, strictly smaller than one. So how close to zero it can be? Okay, and this is once again some questions mathematicians were asking a long time ago, actually. And the answer comes from something which is called custom mathematics. Something which is called custom maquette distribution, and there is some optimal value of this. So, this optimal value is given by this number. So, you can see that when you have a set of generators which is large, this thing becomes small. When s goes to infinity, this is going to zero. So, basically, we will say that a set of gates is efficient if it has. is efficient if it has this optimal spectral if it has this optimal delta okay so good and so do we have any examples of such gates so for example the gates for qubit are such that they have this optimal value of of delta but if you look at this set of the if you look at the If you look at the Clifford loop and T-gate, and you organize this thing such that the elements of your universal set are some elements from the Cleford times T, yes? Then they will also have this optimal spectral level. So this is this choice of a T gate is not only optimal from the point of view of some stabilizer calls and so on. Some stabilizer calls and so on, but it's also optimal from the point of view of this approach, that it will give the shortest sequences. Okay. Okay, good. So I think I used all my time. So I just wanted to, at the very end, what I wanted to say is that you actually cannot do better than the linear in the logarithm. And this is just some volume arguments that if you want to cover. But if you want to cover your unitary group with some axial balls, it will be always sales. Probably everyone knows this. Okay. Good. I think I will finish. I will not. Okay, maybe one more sentence. So this random thing, which I deleted from the title of my talk, corresponded to some other question which we asked, namely, okay, so we know that. Okay, so we know that having this delta nu st small is good because then the set is very good for creating short sequences. But if I choose my gates randomly, okay, what is the distribution, probability distribution of this delta? Okay, so and so we actually found some bounds on the on the expression like this, okay, and it turns out that actually And it turns out that actually gates really like to be kind of close to this optimal value. It's not that they are like really spread evenly in this interval 0, 1. They concentrate around this optimal value. Okay, so here are some references where you can see the results which I presented. The results which I presented. And thank you very much. All right, one question. Yeah, I guess I was wondering how your results are related to the Saranak for Manchester work and super golden gates. They are somehow related because so basically what I am showing here is Here is so what Serb did is he actually constructed some examples, yes, like examples of gates which satisfy this condition. We have never constructed any example like this, okay? We just somehow show that there is this connection between because he's always starting with this formula, okay? What we are. What we advocate a little bit for is that, to some extent, from the physical point of view, this formula is more important because, anyway, you will never, maybe I should not say never, but we typically are not able to create perfect gates, yes? So they are always somehow epsilon approximate. So asking the question how to do something perfectly is perhaps not very, I don't know, important from the physical. I know it's important from the physical point of view. So, if I want to do something with the precise precision at epsilon, I should only care about this thing, but on the scale with t, which is somehow like, I don't know, the dimension divided by epsilon. So I don't need to consider all possibilities. I can stop at some point. Okay? And stopping at some point also means that to some extent, this thing is calculable. This thing is calculable, okay? Because this object here, this sorry, this object here, I haven't seen any example where someone calculated this, because you have to do it over all possible irreducible representations of the unitary group. There are infinitely many of them, and doing such a calculation with a computer is impossible. Keep us down time and suggest further questions at coffee break or during the aftermath discussion sessions. So, thanks, Adam.
