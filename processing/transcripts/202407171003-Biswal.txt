Possibly a next experimental talk. No, thank you, and thank you to the organizers. It's been a wonderful workshop. And so I'm happy to share some of our work, which is actually shifting a little bit away from polymers and going to bubbles and bones on here. So just briefly, we've seen a lot of the motivation for polymers in Forest Media. A lot of those same applications apply for homes in forest media. For foams in forest media, from things like oil recovery, environmental remediation, but more recently, there's been an aspect of being able to think about using foams to be able to store CO2 in the subsurface, and even hydrogen. As we try to think about finding places where we can store gas and large scale, subsurface happens to be one of those ways, and if we can foam it, we can then be able to trap it in the subsurface on there. One of the areas of foam. One of the areas of foam that I appreciate a lot being in Houston is being able to actually inject foam in concrete and roads to be able to take care of potholes and things like that on there. So when we think about foams, we really think about this as a collection of bubbles. And really, you can see that we find foams in a lot of our natural everyday life. You probably may have had a cappuccino or a beer lug. Have had a cappuccino or a beer last night, which has a foam head. Of course, natural foams that you see on beaches associated with the ocean, as well as personal care products on here. What's really interesting about foam is its rheology. So the second aspect that you can be able to actually take something like air, 100%, very low viscosity fluid, something like water that has again a little bit higher viscosity fluid than air. Than air, but as soon as you start to be able to mix them, you have a lot of interesting geological behavior. So I'm going to start actually over here in the bubbly liquid phase. So this is going to be mostly water, a little bit of air, and you start to have these nice spherical bubbles that we'd be able to see. And then as soon as we start increasing that ratio of air, you're going to hit a jamming transition where those spheres start to overlap and start to then deform those bubbles. To then deform those bubbles. And then you start to be able to get into what we call the dry foam regime, where now these bubbles start to take on these polygon shapes on here. And you're really going to be driven then by capillary pressures that are going to move the fluids through these very thin liquid lamellas on here. So there happens to be a lot of really interesting length scales associated with foam. So if you think about that bulk foam that you're used to seeing on, again, That you're used to seeing on again on Capuchinoer, and thinking about that in terms of what type of the bubble length scales. Those happen to be on the order of tens of microns to centimeters. But if we zoom in and again think about those thin liquid lamellas, they can get down to somewhere around 100 nanometers. And really, being a photo scientist, really what we're interested oftentimes in is actually the interface. And so, how do we design surfactants? And so, how do we design surfactants, particularly in the presence of salts and brines, that will then stabilize these interfaces? And that then will control the liquid lamella, the dispersion, and ultimately the foam properties on here. And other aspects of these interfaces really is their stability. And we think about the stability of these liquid lamellas, we think about them in terms of a disjointing pressure on here. And this disjointing pressure really is going to be that balance between the Balance between the liquid pressure here, the film pressure, as well as the external gas pressure that's exerted on here. And so you could be able to see in kind of a model disjointing pressure curve for one of these foam films on here. As these films get thinner and thinner, you can be able to see that disjointing pressure increases quite a bit on there. Again, you have really, when you get through these dry foam systems on here, you have these really these thin films. Really, these thin films on here, which you have capillary suction that will actually lead to these plateau borders that will then drive fluid to collect in the nodes of the foam on there. So, if we're talking about foam and porous media, we really need to think about what happens really at the single pore throat level. And so, there's been some really nice work really from the 70s and 80s that really tried to understand what happens when you. Try to understand what happens when you have a gas thread entered between a pore throat on here. So, here's three identified mechanisms. One is that gas thread will come through a pore throat, and now you're going to have a pressure differential in here that's going to then lead to a snap-off of these gas bubbles on here. You can have the gas thread enter into this poor throat and be able to go through what we call lamella division, where it's going to actually have liquid bridges that bridge between these poor. That bridge between these pools. Or you can be able to have the gas invade on here, and you can be able to then have this leave-behind mechanism on here. And then we have seen this interesting phenomenon where you can be able to actually have bubbles pinch each other off. So you can see as these bubbles are entering through this narrow constriction, you can be able to see that they're actually all biting to enter in. And then you can actually see some of these bubbles then are. See, some of these bubbles then are elongating, and as they elongate, they're actually getting pinched by neighboring bubbles on here. So, I wanted to actually show some of the work where, again, we're going to focus still on looking at more homogeneous bubbles and what happens to them as they go through elongation and then expansion on here. So, we're going to design a microfluidic system. We're going to have a flow focusing. We're going to generate bubbles of very Generate bubbles of very uniform sizes. And then, what we're going to do is actually focus out here in the expansion region on here. We modify, again, their surfactants stabilize, we modify viscosity, we're going to use just air as our gas phase on here. So I'm going to show you some videos. And right now, what you're seeing is, again, very high fast capturing. So you would not be able to see this with your eyes. So we're capturing at 5,000 frames per second. And so you saw on the Per second. And so you saw on this one, bubbles get deformed, but overall, not a lot of changes that are happening. So the bubbles are very uniform in their size distribution on here. As we go ahead, we're going to increase, in this case, just the flow rate of the gas and the liquid. And you start to see a little bit more deformation that happens in there. Occasionally, you'll see again one of those lamella divide, and you'll get then some. Get then some distribution of bubbles on air. Going to again higher flow rates of both our gas and our liquid phase on here, you're going to see a long, quite a bit of extension of these bubbles as it goes through that expansion. And so you'll see then a little bit more of those snap-off events happening. And eventually, you go to a high enough flow rate, and you start to see this very metronomic. This very metronomic division that starts to happen. Every other bubble starts to then go through this expansion and division. And so here you then get now from a monodispersed bubble system now to actually a bidispersed system. And so just to take a look at, this expands on that pinch-off phenomena where we're actually going to look at this in color coding. So as these bubbles have come in, they create almost a barrier, what we call a wall bubble. We call a wall bubble. So the next bubble that comes through, which is shown here in orange, it has no option besides going through the strong extension. And so you have this elongation. The following bubble is going to come through, and that's going to actually cause this then to be able to then have no choice but to divide. And then this process happens over again. So you have this metronomic pinch-off type of phenomena that starts to happen. So we can be able to look at this in terms of being able to think about what's the extension associated with. About what's the extension associated with these bubbles and that length associated with where you can be able to see that pinch-off. So, you can analyze that through a capillary number. And so, for each of these regimes, where we're going to actually see those first pinch-off events, it's going to be sporadic or irregular, a transition regime, polydispersed. And when we're going to actually see that perfect monodisperse metronomic pinch-off, that's where we're going to actually define this in terms of a critical. Find this in terms of a critical capillary number that's associated with the extension on there. And this alpha then actually allows us to be able to divide and see those phases that you're able to actually see. And you can again do some fun things where you can be able to actually change the ratio of that extension. And so now you can create a tri-disperse dispersion of these bubbles on here. So now let's shift over to home and chorus media. So we do a lot of work in actually. So we do a lot of work in actually conventional SENPAC and we're being able to visualize that. So first let's take a look at what we'd actually see. So many of you have actually already presented this. I won't have to do this. So we'll actually go ahead and measure the pressure drop across the forest media as a function of time on here. And so here's actually a water alternating gas, a lag process on here. And here's a foam process. So you can see that as you inject foam, the pressure will increase. Pressure will increase, and using Darcy's law, as many of you have noted, we can be able to turn that pressure drop into apparent viscosity when we know things like the permeability of our porous media and the superficial velocity of our fluid on here. So this is something that is a little bit different than what we've seen with polymer systems on here. So if we look at the apparent viscosity, and then what I'm going to plot on the x-axis is the foam quality. So this is the ratio of the gas to the total situation. The ratio of the gas to the total superficial velocity of both fluids in here. And so you can see this characteristic where you'll see apparent viscosity rise. And so this is going to be a steady state and apparent viscosity. So where do we get our clauses steady state on here? So you'll start to see for wet foams on here that the apparent viscosity is quite low. Think about it almost like this water alternating gas. And as you go to drier and drier foams on here, you're going to get stronger and stronger. On here, you're going to get stronger and stronger apparent viscosities, higher apparent viscosity, stronger foams. Hunger, eventually, you hit a point where it's so dry, those liquid lamella collapse, and so then you'll see that apparent viscosity drop. So all this depends very much on things like the surfactant you're using, gas liquid, temperature, all these things affect this process on here, but overall the shape takes place for almost all foam systems on here. Almost all foam systems on here. And so, when you think about this increase in apparent viscosity, it's really related to this idea that you can be able to trap gas bubbles on your porous media. That's going to reduce the flowing fraction of the gas phase and provides that capillary resistance to flow on here. So now we're going to take a look at a glass feed packet and be able to visualize what the foam is happening flowing in here. So this is going to be a wet foam on here. Be a wet foam on here. So you can be able to see that there's lots of flowing paths, but a few stagnation types of regimes on here. So we get what we call discontinuous gas flows on here, where you get finely textured small bubbles that are moving through our porous media on here. They're fast moving on here. As we turn and make that foam drier, increase that gas ratio on here, what you're starting to see is that you definitely reduce the flowing fraction on there. Fraction on there. You get much more now discontinuous gas flows that are finely textured on there, but you get also these coarser, large-scale bubbles that start to get trapped within the coarse media. And then if we go to the very, very dry regime, what you'll start to actually see is some movement that you can maybe spot out, but overall, you really aren't able to track these flowing phones on here. These flowing phones on here. In fact, most of them are actually trapped, and what we have are a few continuous gas channels on here. So, what we have done is really try to answer this question of how did these bubbles get there in the first place, and how does this connect to apparent viscosity that we see on there. So, we're going to look at foam in a model, microfluidic porous media. This is going to be a 2D system. We're going to control gas-oil ratio. This is one on my Ratio. This is one of my favorite videos to show for why foam is so effective. So here is a dual perm chorus media. I have a high permeable region and a low permeable region. Blue happens to be just a dyed water phase, and you're injecting here just air through that. So you can see that as soon as the gas moves through that porous media, the video is still playing, but you see nothing happening. So you have breakthrough, and so you're not able to then move. And so you're not able to then move through that low permeable region on here. Versus, if you foam that gas, what you're going to see is now movement through both the high and the low permeable region. And that's because you now have trapped bubbles, you have that extra lamellar resistance. So definitely thinking about this in terms of a mobility ratio, you're able to actually decrease that mobility ratio with bone quite a bit. With bone by the cat. So, going back to our microfluidic porous fedia, what we've been able to do, many people ask how representative this is to an actual sandpack system. So, here again is our pressure drop. We do apparent viscosity with Darcy's law, function of phone quality. And you're seeing here, this is two different gases on here. Here's CO2, here's nitrogen on here, and you can see that. On here, and you could see that in general the trends are the same as what we'd expect. And we saw this actually with a sandstone-based system. Here's actually CO2, here's nitrogen. The absolute values actually are different, but the trends of where we see that increase and where we see the collapse happens to match very nicely between our course media and our sandstone experiments from here. Here. So, going into this idea of trying to understand now how to connect what we're seeing in the microfluidics with measurements of the pressure drop of air viscosity on here. So, we did this really just trying to look at two different surfactant concentrations. So, we're going to use nitrogen as the gas, and that's because CO2 has some interesting solubility effects. So, we're just going to focus on nitrogen, and we're going to change the concentration of the The concentration of the surfactant on here. So you're starting to see in this case the higher concentration surfactant is going to give you higher apparent viscosity on here. We do a lot of work with our microfluidics and be able to identify each of those bubbles and be able to actually track which ones are stationary, which ones are moving on here. I'm not going to focus on telling you about this, but if you're interested, I can share some of the codes that we do. So we can be able to monitor what's the flowing fraction and what's the trap. What's the flowing fraction and what's the trap fraction? And here, as you're seeing kind of a screen through these different qualities, so again, very wet foams to very dry foams, you are seeing qualitatively at least the difference in what the foam texture looks like. So you can see in here, a lot of those flowing fractions happen to have larger bubbles. As we're going through and being able to increase that quality, you're getting much smaller trap bubbles that start to appear. And this is where it's interesting. Here. And this is where it's interesting. This is where the peripiscosity falls off. So this is very dry problems. And so you start to see actually large continuous gas channeling that starts to appear in these types of systems. So we did some statistics. So again, here's our apparent viscosity measured through the pressure drop on here. And what we're going to do is be able to actually track what's the fraction of the trapped bubbles on here. And we're going to do this with two concentrations on here. So I know it's So I know it's a little bit data heavy on here, but I'm going to show you the area in red happens to be the flowing fraction. So here what you're seeing is basically a histogram, a probability histogram. Here is bubble size. And here is different foam qualities on here. And so a couple trends to be able to see. You can see as we increase that foam quality, make it go from wet to dry, the flowing fraction happens to decrease. Fraction happens to decrease, and also, as we make it increase that quality in the foam, the bubble distribution sizes happen to be increasing also. So, this is associated with more coalescence events that are happening within the porous media. Highlighting some of these events, you can be able to actually see things like Oswald ripening and things like that start to appear in these. And the color coding in here in these images are, again, red is going to be trapped. Are again red is going to be trap bubbles, and blue happens to be the flow interaction on here. So, here happens to be a little bit of that lower surfactant concentration on here. And here you can be able to see again apparent viscosity is lower. The trap fractions follow the same trends. So, you can see that the highest apparent viscosity happens to be where we have the most trap bubbles associated with our forest media on here. So, we've been able to actually use some simple population balance models to be able to actually quantify a little bit of what the foam texture happens to look like. So, here's a bubble density model where essentially what we're going to do is look at the trapped fraction as a function of that foam texture on here. So, what you're seeing is for the lower surfactant concentration, that's the weaker foam. So, you get a higher. So, you get a higher trap fraction for a given size ratio on here. For that stronger chrome, you'll see that it follows the same trend, but just happens to be at a lower trap fraction on here. If we look at a population balance model here, which you can be able to think about this in terms of what's the ratio of, we're going to assume that we're going to be at a quasi-steady state, so we're going to ignore that. We're not going to consider a source or sink term on here, so really we're going to look at. Term on here. So, really, we're going to look at what's that flowing fraction via convection on here, and then what's the generation coalescence associated on here. And so, you could be able to actually see a couple of different things where here blue happens to be here the generation coalescence for that 1% and that 0.5%. So, you can see that at lower surfactant concentrations, you're not able to generate and coalesce as much. And coalesce as much. And so, therefore, what you're dominated by is that infection. Higher surfactant concentrations, you are able to go through more generation coalescence terms, and so that's where you can be able to get more of that trapping that consumer. All right, so I'm going to switch gears and show you what happens now with foam in the presence of oil. So, we're going to start off now with the forest media that's completely filled with, in this case, crude oil, as an API of about 30. API of about 35, so that translates to a viscosity of about 40%. I'm going to actually see if I can stop the video real quick. So, first thing you start to see, we have dual perm and a larger fracture in the center. Bubbles coalesce in that fracture. So, you see that coalescence effects. Second thing to watch is that we start off with a very oil-wet system. So, notice these oil ganglia that's hugging the posts on here. That's hugging the post on here. And as we continue on on this video, what you'll see is actually imbibing of the gas bubbles in the high permeable region, right? And you're starting to, again, see the sweep of that oil gangla. But notice then, the bubbles are able to enter in here once we've actually gone through wettability alteration. Alright, so because we have a surfactant system, We have a surfactant system, it's able to actually alter from oil wet to water wet, and that then allows the gas to be able to enter into the porous metal. So we can be able to track this. So we look at comparisons with just entering gas. So if you try to just flow gas through an oil-filled system, you can be able to see that it's mainly going to flow through the fracture. Some will be able to move through into the high permeable region. If we're able to use Region. If we're able to use that surfactant solution by itself, you're able to see again most of it's going to flow through the fracture, some is able to move in that high perm, a little bit in the low perm. But when you do the foam, you can see how effective the foam is at being able to mobilize that oil from both the high and the low perm region on here. And so we track the oil saturation in the different regions and be able to see that here again, the foam will actually drop that oil saturation. Foam will actually drop that oil saturation like we've got here. And so we can test this as a function of foam quality and looking at this as a function of time. And again, being able to see how much trapped oil you have in the porous media really is going to depend on that weak foams you can see are not able to mobilize the oil as effectively versus when you get to that strong, high apparent viscosity, then you're able to mobilize that quite a bit. And again, thinking about this in And again, thinking about this in terms of why the gas is able to imbibe into the forest media, we think about that as a capillary entry pressure where we could be able to actually measure what is it for the gas phase to be able to displace the oil versus the surfactant solution to displace the oil. You could be able to see an order of magnitude difference in that capillary pressure. And so that's why you need to alter the wettability on here, and that then will allow the gas to be able to imbibe into the. The gas to be able to imbibe into the forest and that one again. Okay, so I'm going to kind of skip through some of the phenomena a little bit on here. So you can be able to see that we have some interesting zones on here. Initially, you have foam that creates a displacement zone where you're able to then push and be able to mobilize. This is where foam starts to coalesce. You have a transition zone where you have wettability alteration. Have wetability alteration, and then you can have a foam bank that you can be able to then have public generation that starts to import. In terms of foam being what we call a smart rheological fluid on here, it's able to exist in the dry phase in the high permeable region. This creates to higher flow resistance, and that then allows you to divert fluids into the low permeable regions. And so then the foam is able to exist as a wet bason here. All right, and now I'm going. Alright, I know I'm running out of time, so I wanted to actually probably skip the last one, but I might the last section I had. I wanted to just show it because it's kind of a fun video to watch. So the other aspect I wanted to tell you a little bit about is asphaltine. So this is actually components that fall out of crude oil. It's based off of solubility. Based off of solubility on there. And so you can see these asphaltines can actually deposit within these porous media and cause plugging and clogging of our porous media on here. And what's interesting is that you can actually see that they will grow upstream to the flow. So you can have, and you can see that this is a dynamic interface, so it's being sheared, and as that shear, they're That shear, they're growing and eventually plugging on there. And so there's some interesting transitions where you can actually see again, this is kind of growth, and you can see color changes. So there's interesting packing parameters associated with these asphaltines, and they then are able to then create these very unique shapes. And so we've kind of looked at this as a function of their solubility on there, and then how they are able to. How they are able to cross and bridge forest media. And then connecting that a little bit to understanding why we get the different shapes, you can be able to think about this in terms of a peculiar associated with when you get these broad shapes versus kind of these finger-like patterns on there. I'm going to skip this and maybe leave you with this video before ending. What's nice about these systems, again, they're all What's nice about these systems, again, they're all multi-phase, and so if we add a little bit of water to the system, you can see that these water droplets are actually going to get glued together with these asphaltine deposits, and they're going to take on the same shape, that comb-like shape at the stagnation point of these pores. And so then you'll get kind of interesting clogging and bridging of the pores with these water droplets on there. So, with that, I'm going to take us to. I was going to wait till you can see a little bit of those cone-like shapes on here, but yes. So with that, let me go ahead and let me thank my students. Kuhn really set up this idea of this course, Media to Study Films. Dan did a lot of the bubble pitch-off systems. Jock did the work with the crude oil. Mavis is doing this bubble trapping on there. Bubble trapping on there. Longtime colleagues Vora Porto and George Hirosaki, who we really rely on for a lot of help with the understanding. Our sponsors, and thank you all, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.
