Be presenting this paper, myself and my wooden leg. So, this paper, I was really interested in understanding psychological reactance, and I'll talk a little bit more about it, but really, like, why were people so reactive during COVID towards the measures that were implemented? This is work that I've done along with Matthew, a great student, and Mathieu Evidk. And Mathieu, Eric, and Vaxan. So, yeah, feel free to talk to us about it if you have any questions after. So, as we all know, following the implementation of the public health measures during COVID-19, there was, you know, a lot of people, these measures faced a lot of backlash. So, there was vaccine hesitancy, there was non-compliance to the health measures, and even To the health measures, and even protest against the restrictive natures of these measures. So, for those who live in Canada, we can all remember the Freedom Convoy that was set up in front of Parliament for a 23-day period, and it really forced the Prime Minister to declare a state of emergency. There were also demonstrations in France. There were about 300 demonstrations throughout France. I guess the past has been. France, I guess the Place Batson. And those are just two examples, but we know that there were manifestations of protests throughout the world. So, New Zealand, US, Germany, Switzerland, I think you name it, the word manifestations. So the big research question that I was wondering about was what explains the sense of lost freedom and why are individuals so motivated to regain this lost sense of their freedom. Lost sense of their freedom, this lost sense of freedom. So I turn to psychological reactance. Psychological reactance is a motivation triggered when a person perceives that his or her lost freedom is threatened. And since it's a motivation, it has energizing properties that's going to drive individuals to engage in behaviors that can restore the lost freedom. So what does that mean? That means that individuals can develop counter-arguments. Can develop counter-arguments, they can suppress their thoughts in support of the measures that have been put in place, and they can discredit the source of the message. And there's a lot of research out there on psychological reactants and just looking at what are some of the factors that may be associated with individuals that have higher levels of psychological reactants. So we know that there's age and So we know that there's age and gender that are two demographic factors. There's personal factors, so political identity. Right-winged individuals are more likely to be reactive, quality of life. Those that feel that they have less quality of life are more reactive, less self-esteem, those that have strong emotions, those that have a higher level of self-control, those that have more depressive tendencies. Those that have more depressive tendencies, less just in governments, and certain elements of the big five: agreeability and conscientiousness. There's also contextual factors, so social norms, how the individuals around us perceive things, and the clarity of the message. So, how clear are the policies that are implemented? Can play a role? Implemented, can play a role. So, one of the biggest limits about this long list of factors is that most studies have looked at one or two, maybe three or four Max at the same time. And so they really looked to focus on these factors individually. So, what does that mean? Was that there's no exploratory studies that have kind of taken all these factors together and even maybe added some more that might. Maybe added some more that might be pertinent in understanding why individuals are so reactive in certain contexts. So this means that we don't know if there are factors that have not been considered before that might be important in the study of psychological reactions and the relative importance of each factor. So we don't have a comprehensive picture of what is the what are the Of what are the characteristics an individual that is reacting to? So, our study had three main objectives: to study the importance of demographic, personal, and social factors, identify previously unidentified factors that might be important to understand psychological reactants, and finally, have a comprehensive picture of psychologically reactant individuals. Reacting to individuals. So, to do that, to do this, answer these objectives, we turned to machine learning because it's able to capable of considering several factors at the same time. And it's also recognized for their robustness and replicability. And this is so because it divides data sets in two. So, you have a training set just used to build the model, then you can test the model blindly. Model blindly by using the test set. So I'm not going to go over once again this famous, now famous data set that you've all heard from, but basically I used the COVID-19, the end of the world as we know it data set. And there were 12 time measures. And so And so we used all of the variables that were available at time one. And when there were known predictors that weren't measured at time one but were measured at subsequent times, we took those. And in total, we had 162 variables in our model. And we used psychological reactance measured at 2012, which was measured between March 2nd and April 19th, 2022. Our measure of psychological reactance we built as a SEM model because we know that psychological reactance is kind of built by through two important aspects. So there's this emotional response. So there's anger, frustration, and annoyance, which are the three main emotions that have been associated with psychological reactants. And then there's also this freedom threat that. Threats that are part of reactives as well. So, freedom threats. So, one of the questions was: the measures implemented to fight against COVID-19 restrict my freedom. And then the same applied to the vaccine pass. So, with this measure, we really had that emotional component and that threat component to freedom. And so, to test our model, we used to be able to. Uh and so to test our model we used uh lasso regression. Uh so lasso regression is a uh basically a regular regular uh linear regression, but you use a penalty term. When this term is set to zero, you get the same thing as the linear regression, but the bigger the penalty term is, it shrinks the number of variables and removes the ones or sets the ones that are less important to zero. Less important to zero. So in that way, you can select the most important variables. So to train our model, what we did is we divided our data set into two subsets, a training set and a test set. We imputed the data, and then we selected that penalty term for the lasso regression. We ran the lasso regression, and then we tested the accuracy of the model with the test set at the grind. With the test set at the point. So, what we find is that the LASL regression was able to explain 21% of the variance of the test set. And out of the 162 factors included, the lasso regression kept 34. So, there were a few confirmed factors. So, there was age, control over one's life. So, the more people felt control over their life. People felt control over their lives, the more to the right they are, the less trust they have in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and the less trust they have in scientists, the more reactive individuals are. And we also identified a bunch of new factors. So people that were married, that had minors in their home, that were lonely, worried, and bored, that perceived COVID-19 as negative but slow change. But slow change, and that had less contact with immunocompromised individuals, these factors all played into feeling more psychological reactants. And we also found that where people obtained their news from was also an important factor. So individuals that got their news from local, national, or international news were more reactive. But those who consulted the World Health Organization or their provincial health authority. Or their provincial health authorities or family and friends, or less recaptants. So, to conclude, well, we found that some predictors remained. So, age, self-control, political orientation, and trust. I think these are all factors that we've discussed today. So, their usual culprits did keep, were retained by the regression. But we also identified new predictors. So, the presence of minors in the household, the Of minors in the household, the sources of information, and contact with immunocompromised individuals. And we also lost some predictions, so the big five didn't play a role anymore, and social norms neither. So this suggests the fact that we added some more, that some were removed from previous studies, that perhaps the context where we measured psychological reactives might be really important. Be really important, and that there might be some variability between contexts. And our results also suggest that there's not one big defining category of variables that are important in predicting reactants. So democratic, social, and contextual factors all seem to play a role in predicting reactants. Some limits and future directions. So, I think the biggest limit is that when you have so many predictors in your model, it's really difficult. It's really difficult to interpret what it means because, you know, I guess one of the strengths of having just a couple of factors to understanding is that you have a really deeper understanding of each relationship with reactants. Well, in this way, yes, you have this big block, which is fantastic, but then you kind of lose perhaps the meaning of each individual relationship. And so, since we kind of find that the context seems to be playing a big role in A big role in psychological reactance would be really fascinating to study it in different contexts. Perhaps climate change, since we know that there's a lot of coming policies and policies are changing quite a bit around climate change, perhaps a deeper understanding of how psychological reactance plays in adherence and how that compares to COVID would be a great advantage. Thanks.
