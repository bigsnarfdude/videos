This has been a wonderful conference for me and I'm very happy to be here. So I just want to start very elementary by talking about spheres in any graph. So if I have any graph, I pick a center vertex that I'll call C and a radius R, and the sphere of radius R about C is just all of the vertices of distance exactly R away from C. So that's a set of vertices. For convenience, I'm just going to say vertices. For convenience, I'm just going to say a set of vertices is connected if the induced subcraft is connected. And so I just want to do a few examples. So first of all, take a tree. So there's, I pick a center point, doesn't matter which one. And I look at, here's the sphere of radius 2 about C, and you can see that it's disconnected. And furthermore, it's hopelessly disconnected, and this is just the nature of a tree. And next, look at Z2. So I've taken that center point, and in red, I've drawn the sphere of radius to about Z, and that also is as disconnected as possible. There are no edges joining any two red vertices. And in fact, every sphere is disconnected. But here, this is sort of totally different. This is somehow some. Some mild combinatorial problem. And it's solved by taking the union of two spheres. So, for example, if I take S2 union S3 and look at the induced subgraph, I get this thing. And so the union of two consecutive spheres is connected. So each one was disconnected, but it somehow wasn't a big deal at all. Whereas here, that wouldn't have helped. Whereas here that wouldn't have helped at all. That would still be disconnected. So, today I'm going to tell you that spheres in the Kerr graph are connected, almost always, and relate that to the Gromov boundary. And for a big chunk of the talk, I want to take a really, really, really far away perspective and sort of describe some analogies to other things in geometric groups. Things in geometric group theory, where at the very least there's a bit of a, one can make a bit of an analogy in terms of how the story is progressing. Okay, so first I want to start with some of the motivation, the most direct motivation. So really my motivation, and I'll tell you why this was my motivation, was to understand how to like is the crit class. The surface. Okay, so here sigma is a surface, and C sigma is its curve graph. And let's just start with some things that you probably know. So there are only two curve graphs that we actually understand. There's a curve graph of the zero of the genus zero surface with four punctures, and that turns And that turns out to be the same as the curve graph of the G is one surface with one function. And this is the fairy graph. So this is the unique curve graph that I would say we actually have a satisfactory understanding of. And it's a fuzzy. So it's super treating. Oh, I should say, like, point zero is sorry, I should Is sorry, but more important is C Sing much, is hyperbolic. And that's, of course, baseline. So that's a result saying it's tree-like. But I want to talk about even beyond its hyperbolicity, how tree-like this is. So there's a result of Dowell Fuchen Maser that I That says the generic pair of points, and I'm not going to define generic, the pair of points x, y in the sphere of radius r about some center have the distance between x and y is 2r. Okay, and moreover, the geodesic between them, every geodesic between them has to go through. Geodesic between them has to go through the second number. So the only graph I can easily think of with this property is the infinite valence tree. So for a finite valence tree, it wouldn't quite be generic. It would be high probability. The probability would get higher and higher as the valence increase. So in this way, it's sort of as tree-like as an infinite valence tree. And maybe even a little bit more hyperbolic or tree-like than a phyto. Like or tree, like then a finite balance. So to sort of look from far away, many top-level spaces of HSs are quasi-trans. And somehow, this was a very important point for me when I got interested in this. Important point for me. When I got interested in this, I think it was basically all the known examples of HHSs, other than the mapping class group, had a top-level space that was a quasi-tree. And this was a point of very deep significance to me because I wanted to use the HHS machinery to prove things that couldn't possibly be true if the top-level space of the mapping class group was a quasi-tree. And so I wanted to better understand it. So I should take. Understand it. So I should say, with these exceptions, they're not quasi-trees, and that dedates me quite a lot. But still, I think the point is that the curve graph does actually have some behavior that sort of goes beyond being hyperbolic in the tree-like behavior, and many other analogous pieces do too. So, as I said, it was already known that it's not a quasi-tree in general, but I want to give my answer to why it's not a quasi-tree. So, I'll say, but. So I'll say but and later I'll tell you the other proofs that it's not a quasi-tree. There are very few. And I'll say all the other proofs that it's not a quasi-tree have very little to do with the curve graph. The proof either largely takes place in a space of eliminations or largely takes place in type of space. So somehow the situation when I started this is working in the curve graph itself. It was actually very hard to know that the curve graph was not a quad graph. Very hard to note that the Kerb graph is not a quadration. So if 3G minus 3 plus N, so this is genus GN punctures, is greater than we could for, all spheres are connected. And that in particular is a proof. And that in particular is a proof you're not a quasi-tree. If you're a quasi-tree, the scripts would be very, very disconnected. So a slightly weaker result holds for the remaining cases cases other. Other than 1,1. So, again, in the only two cases where we understand the curved graph, it is a quasi-tree. And in every other case, you can show that squares are connected. So this is finally many cases. And what happens is something like this. It's not a big deal. You need two consecutive spheres or three consecutive spheres. And I actually grant an RA last summer and they sharpened those results. So, in particular, I think you can put a 3 here now, thanks to my REU students. This is true for all R, not about R of R. For all R and all C. So, every sphere of every radius, about every center. The spheres are counted. And then what I think even more interesting results is. Sorry, is definitely not true for two? Or let me just say. For complexity two? Yeah. Yeah, it's not true. For complexity two, you need two sources. And other than that, you need one source. And so that was my argument students that sharpened that. So 3g minus 3 plus n is bigger than or equal to 2. So this again is only excluded in the fairy graph case. Paragraph case. The Gromov boundary boundary of the Kerb graph is linearly connected. And I'll tell you later what linearly connected means. But I'll say I think this is the more important result. And what you should take away from this is I'm actually working in a Take away from this is: I'm actually working in a Kirchgraph. I'm not working in height-lone space, I'm not working in some space elaborations. I'm proving some strong results on the connectivity of the Groma boundary actually working. Questions so far other than what linear connectedness is? If not, I'm going to take a maybe excessively circuitous route to telling you what linear. Circuitous route to telling me what linear connectedness is so that I can introduce it in the context that I'm interested in it and sort of draw some big picture analogies. So this was the sort of introduction. Now I'm going to do some very, very broad context. Really so broad as to have very little to do with my work, but I like the analogy in terms of the story that's going on. And then I'll get back to the specific context. And then I'll get back to the specific context of what was actually known before for the curved graph. And then I'll align it for you. So that's the plan for the talk. Okay. So broad context. And I mean really, really broad context. So one of the most famous open problems in geometric group theory is the Canning conjecture. And the Canning conjecture says, And the Canyon conjecture says that if gamma is a hyperbolic group, if the Gromov boundary homeomorphic to S2, then gamma is virtually a finite, very famous problem. Many people have worked on it. Very famous problem. Many people have worked on it. I'm not going to talk much about the Canon conjecture. I'm only going to mention one of the many results that have been proven related to the Canning conjecture. And that's Result of Markovic. And he showed this is true if only if gamma Uh gamma has enough by embedded surface suckers. So actually, technically, it's not just Markovitch. The direction that if gamma is a hyperbolic group with sphere boundary. Group with sphere boundary and it has enough QI embedded subgroups, then it comes from hyperbolic 3 manifold. That's Mark Rich. And the converse is Khan Marklich. Okay, so a QI embedded surface subgroup. So what is that? So I have some surface subgroup is pi 1 of some closed surface. And I want to emphasize that it doesn't have any functions. We don't want to talk about frequencies. When I say surface group, I don't mean a frequency. So it has to map into gamma, and it's a quasi-isometric embedding. And so in particular, these give quasi-planes. And so a quasi-plane. And so a quasi-plane is just a QI embedding of a hyperbolic plane into a space. A bit of my narrative and what comes next is a bit out of order historically. out of order historically, but if it happened in a different historical order, it would make a better story. So I'm just going to pretend it did. So I'm going to use Markovic's result to motivate a result that preceded Markovic's result. So given Markovic's result, you need to find these QI embedded circuit servers. And since Canada's conjecture is famously difficult and important, maybe you're looking for some sort of warm-up. Sort of warm-up. And maybe as a warm-up, you maybe want to separate the algebra from the geometry. So the algebra here would be something like Gromov's question, just is there a surface over Bill? And never mind that it's QI made. And then on the other hand, if you strip away the algebra and just leave the geometry, you get the question, are there quasi-planes? If there weren't quasi-planes, Cannon's conjecture would be false. If there are quasi-planes, it certainly doesn't. If there are quasi-planes, it certainly doesn't prove Canon's conjecture, but it's maybe circumstantial evidence that Canon's conjecture isn't true. So you might try to then show that all of these groups have lots of plus points. And that's what Bonk and Kleiner did actually before this result. So Bonk and Kleiner proved a result, suppose gamma is hyperbolic. Hyperbolic and not virtually free, then gamma has many so that that maybe corroborates Cannon's conjecture. And I want, so I'm certainly not. And I want to, so I'm certainly not going to explain the proof to you, but I want to tell you one ingredient in proof. What is many here? I don't know of many. Is it that synthetic space or something, or is it like? Yeah, I think you can approximate arcs in the boundary with arcs that come from half planes. So some dance that you can find. But honey is not half plane. But many is not enough. Do you have enough? No, no, this is many, but these don't come from surface circuits. So the issue isn't that this isn't not enough. It's that it doesn't come from surface circuits. And just to double check enough means any mirror points are said breakthrough. I think something like that. I don't I've actually never read, but it's paper. Do we know now sort of what are most podcast planes do have to open source hubber? Quasi-Planes do not account for subverts? No, I don't think most quasi-planes have other subgroups. I don't know if there's any result in that direction, but my intuition is that not at all. Yeah, no, no, I think that's about having both service updates. Okay. So I just want to tell you one ingredient in the proof. So the proof uses a very beautiful theorem. A very beautiful theorem. So, due to Tukia, or maybe I'll say approximately Tukia, the non-standard part of it is Tukia, but this isn't the way Tukia originally stated it. So gamma is a delta hyperbolic space, and the Gromov boundary. And the Gromov boundary is linearly connected and doubling. Then γ has any quasi-points. I encourage you not to pay attention to this. It's actually quasi-half planes. You cut the hyperbolic plane in half, and then you QI embed down in. Really, it shouldn't be in parentheses. I just don't want you to pay any attention to the word half. Okay, so time to tell you what linearly connected is. I'm not, so this is not a talk about doubling. To talk about doubling. Doubling means every ball can be bounded, covered by boundedly many balls that have the radius, and the bound doesn't depend on the radius. But doubling has nothing to do with my talk. So let me just define... The boundary is doubling our DMS to the boundary. The boundary is linearly connected. Okay. So definition, a metric space is linearly connected if there exists L greater than zero. Really, it's greater than one. Is it greater than one? Oh, red is not good. I'll just do it in white pants. A metric space is linearly active if there exists L such that for all X Y, there exists an arc from X to Y. So an arc A A with the diameter of the arc is less than equal to L times the distance from x to y. An arc is an embedded path. So for every two points, I can find a path between them. And I'm not saying anything about the length of the path. The path maybe isn't even rectifiable. This is about diameter, not length. But the diameter path of the path isn't excessively larger than it has to be. For the minimum, it has to be the distance between x and y, which is why l is at least one. And so it's sort of saying you don't really go further from x and y than you have to by some sort of reasonable standard. So a few comments. One, it turns out to give you the same definition if you don't require A to be an arc, but rather. Be an arc, but rather a connected compact set. It's not obviously the same, but it's not too hard. And two is that this is just, you should think of this as a metric space strengthening of path-connected and locally path-connected. So it certainly implies path-connected and locally path-connected. But whereas path-connected, you just sort of stay in some neighborhood. Now you have some metro. Stay in some neighborhood, now you have some metric control on the neighborhood that the path has to stay. So you should think of it as a metric space version of path connectivity, hopefully path connection. As far as I know, people don't study that. So I just want to advertise. I've never read Tuki's. I've never read Tukey's original paper. There's a very, very beautiful proof of this due to John McKay, which is where I learned it. It's very short, and it's quite nice to read. And this was applied in a paper of Cisco and McKay, which is where I learned some things related to this. Okay, so I've gone really far afield now, but I've been I've gone really far afield now, but I've at least introduced the definition of linear connectivity. In context, it's related to finding quasi-quadines and primable x-faces. I need to get back towards the mapping class group. So I think this definition has already appeared, but I'm just going to write it again: convex compactness. So originally uniform, and then elaborated on by Kendall-Meininger. I can't do mining there and so a subgroup of the mapping pass group of a surface is convex co-compact if the orbit maps maps from the group. That's from the group to the curve graph are QI index. Okay, and then a question which we've already heard about for example in Chris's talk. Usually I've always attributed this solely to far I've always attributed this solely to Farben-Moscher. I learned from Chris's talk that in various forms, this goes back far before them, but in this form, it's doing Farben-Moscher. So, do there exist convex, co-compact surface sectors and mapping passwords? I have a question? Yeah. What kind of space would it be linearly connected? Do you have any examples? Something like really bad fractal. Okay. Assuming that that's not each distance space, right? Oh yeah. Geodesic spaces are linearly connected with L E or so it has to be very far from it's sort of pathological behavior in my town. So anyways, this is an important So anyways, this is an important question and I won't, well, and Chris already said a lot. But again, we don't separate that classroom. Like something that looks like a cluster. Like this. To get from there to there takes more than a constant times the distance. Thank you. Much better than some more complicated examples. Okay, so this is a very important problem. And I just want to point out that it would immediately give quasi-planes in the Kirk graph. So I think of it as, at least in terms of like a big picture narrative, as somewhat analogous to Cannon's conjecture. Because it's about surface subgroups giving quasi-planes also, like QI embedded in the natural hyperbolic space. And for Cannon's conjecture, the natural hyperbolic space is the hyperbolic group. And here, the natural hyperbolic And here, the natural hyperbolic space is the curve graph. That was the sort of very, very broad context. Any questions about that? But now, some more specific context. So I said it was already known that the curved graph is not a quasi-tree, so I now want to tell you exactly two ways in which we knew this. There were only two moves. I'm only going to give about two results in specific context. So, one is that the Gromov boundary is path-connected and locally path-connected when the curve graph isn't the fair graph. So, in complete generality, this was due to Gabby. This was due to Gabai. In a very large number of cases, there were results by various subsets of Leininger, Rahan, and Solschweiler. What I want to say about this is these proofs work in spaces of laminations. They don't work directly in the graph. Turns out that the Gromma boundary is homeomorphic to the space of any lamina. Morphic to the space of any dimensions. Okay. And one other result that I really love is dudo mining or slimer. And it says many per graphs have puzzling lengths. Okay. So this is, in my mind, a particularly beautiful paper. It's a very nice idea. It involves looking at Teichmüller geodesics and quadratic differentials, sort of sliding along the stable foliation hard point. So most of the proof takes place in Teichmuller space. And to my mind, this is sort of finding quasi-planes in picture via Technoid space. Via type markspace. And it doesn't quite work for all the curve graphs because it's at its core involved moving a mark along the stable foliation of a pseudo-NOSR. Chris is here, so if you don't already know about this result and you've already exhausted yourself asking Chris questions about his new work, you should also ask him questions about this because it's very, very nice. Because it's very, very nice. But as much as I like all of these results, I really wanted to work hands-on in the curve graph. And I just want to emphasize these results sort of really have shockingly little to do with the curve graph. So I want to get to the idea of the proof. And I want to do the proof that the spheres are connected. Spheres are connected. So, again, really, what I care about is the Gromov boundary. But the proof is the same. Somehow, what happened is I proved something for the Gromov boundary, and it worked out so nicely that it applied to spheres. So you think of the Gromov boundary as the spheres infinity, which are sort of coarsely natural, as a coarsely natural object. And these are finite spheres that are not so coarsely natural. But the proof in the vein of sort of But the proof in the vein of sort of what we now know as CHHS point of view works sort of in a very nice combinatorial way that gave something more and then a course result. So So, what I start with is two points in the sphere of radius r. So, I don't know how to draw the sphere of radius r. So let me just draw it like this. I mean, in the end, it's connected. It's some huge, huge space. Spheres of radius one are curved complexes of smaller subsurfaces. This is some huge infinite diameter thing. But let me just draw it as that. So, I had two points on. So, I have two points on the sphere. The proof is going to be as naive as you could possibly imagine. So, I'm just going to sort of, first, I'm not really going to explain the proof, I'm just going to explain the sort of most naive way you could approach proving something like this, and then give you some hints about how to make the most naive way work. So given two points, I want a path between that stays in the sphere. I don't know there's a path that starts between, that stays in the sphere. What do I know? Sphere. What do I know? Well, I know that there's a distance r path from X to C and a distance R path from C to Y. This is sort of extreme, this is as bad as you can get in terms of staying in the sphere. But this is what you know exists, so you'll start with this. So start your path through the center, and this is sort of very The center, and this is sort of very, very bad, and sort of iteratively push away from center. So after sort of row of steps Disjoint, you want to get a path of disjoint from the ball radius of rho minus one about the same time. So I think it's a lot easier if I just draw this. So my first thing, so I go, so I just sort of approach it in stages. The most offensive thing about this path is it goes into the sphere of radius of it. Okay? So I'll keep everything there, but I want to replace, so this is the sphere. But I want to replace, so this is the sphere previous one, and I want to replace that with something. So that's my sort of first push. And, you know, you could replace with something like this, and that would be okay for proving results on the Gromhaw boundary. It turns out usually you don't need to do that. And it really stays, you're just sort of moving into the next sphere. Maybe, I don't know, I think we close the piece. And I believe that you can do that, or you're going to tell us why this piece. Well, this piece you know, at least in high complexity, because the sphere of radius one is a curved graph, and curved graphs are connected. So that's like that first hint that this might work. So then in the next stage, you're going to sort of stick with your path and say, oh, but now I don't want to go into the sphere of radius one. So I'm going to somehow remove my excursions into the sphere of radius one. And then I'm going to somehow remove my incursions into the sphere of radius too and just sort of iterately push it over. And eventually I'll get something which at least, I mean, maybe if it didn't work out so well, it would only show that the complement of the ball was connected. And I would have been happy with that. But it actually works out especially well perfectly. Okay, so again, this isn't really a proof. This is more just the most naive way you could start thinking about it. Other. And now let me talk a little bit about what's involved in getting this most naive idea to work. So I see it's just pushing out one level at a time is what allows you to say the spherical spherical. Yeah, if every time you push, you only go to the next level, then you actually get the spherical circle. If you went far out and back, then you would get columnized falsified. Which again would have been fine. Okay. Is it actually something that you can view by induction? Like you know it for the sphero rate is one, so inductively you can... You can view it as near induction, right? Actually, I don't even write it this way in the paper, but this is the way I think of it as you sort of iteratively push push off of bigger and bigger balls until eventually you're just in the sphere you want to be. Until eventually, you're just in the sphere you want to be in. But what's the sort of zero-est thing that's involved in this? So for, so say I have some vertex in the sphere of radius row. So maybe I pushed up so that the closest I get to see is on the sphere of radius row. And now I want to push away. And I'd sort of, in practice, you only want to push away a little bit. You know, in theory, you could push away a lot, but again, In theory, you could push away a lot, but again, as we are learning more and more from the CHHS point of view, it's actually very hard to separate local geometry from coarse geometry. So it actually is very useful to think just in terms of small moves in local geometry. So for V in this sphere, I'll need or want to produce many V prime in the next sphere that are adjacent. That are adjacent. So it may be in the middle. And that maybe gives me some ways of sort of pushing up by one. Okay, so now a problem, it's actually a very small problem. And because it's a small problem, I often brush it under the rug when I speak about this, but it's actually a nice problem to talk about. A nice problem to talk about. And if you haven't seen it already, it's very beautiful. So, I'm actually going to talk about the small problem, even though it is, in fact, a very small problem. So, sometimes no such D prime exists. So, in other words, the curve graph. As dead heads. And this is due to Berman and Masco. So they would have phrased it as sometimes there are geodesics you can't continue, but that's exactly equivalent to what I wrote there. But, so, okay. So it's easy to remember the curve graph has dead ends. Somehow, a more subtle but more important fact is the curve graph barely has dead ends. Somehow it doesn't have the dead ends in a very bad way. This is why this is a very small problem. But let me explain to you why not so many things are dead ends. So there's a lemma. I don't exactly know how who to attribute the idea to. Certainly some version of this appears in Berlin. There's certainly some version of this appears in Bermuda Manasco, and I also saw the trick in the paper of Saul. It's a very fundamental trick to this point of view, to this crowd. So if V in the curve graph is either non-separating or those Around a pair of punctures, then he is not a dead end. That's a good question. Not separating means on the surface, right? Yeah, on the surface. I can just draw a picture. Fine. Let me comment on that more in a sec, but let me just draw the pictures. So I type there. One picture is this one. So that's a non-separating curve. I cut it and it doesn't separate the surface. And it doesn't separate the surface. And the other picture is maybe it goes around in pair pictures. That's pretty easy. So the proof is really very easy. So let U be the non-pants component. Of sigma minus B. So that's U here, and sorry, is the blue hard to see? Yeah, it is hard to see. Over here, this is the If you have a non-separated perf, it's the complement. And otherwise, it's the part of the complement that doesn't have the changes. So the key observation is that the only curve that does not cut. Not cut, u is equal. So you say a curve cuts u if it has a, if its subsurface projection to u is defined. So the only curve that I can't take the subsurface projection of is E itself. And it's not really essential, it's just one reason things work out extra nicely in this situation. Only this one curve. So if I take E prime, If I take V prime and Cu, so in otherwise, so Cu is the length of V with the distance in U between E prime and C large, then the bounded geodesic image theorem implies that the geodesic geodesic from V prime to C goes through. So in general, the bounded geodesic image theorem says it has, the geodesic has something not cutting. There's only one curve not cutting, which means this especially beautiful. So it goes through V. And V and V prime are adjacent, so that implies the distance between C and V prime is the distance. Prime is the distance between B and C plus one. Okay, so this was known long long before my work. Uh but here so I I call these curves essentially non-separating. I call these curves essentially non-separating. So that means it's either non-separating or goes around in pair functions. And they, from the HHS point of view, they're the same as non-separating curves. You know, the problem about separating curves is you have the curve graph of one side and the curve graph of the other side. But there is no curve graph. But there is no curve graph on this side. And so you just have one. So, really, sort of functionally, these are not separated curves. Okay. So now let me get to sort of the main idea. So say we're at sort of the stage of the argument where maybe our path goes like this. So this is s rho. S rho and this is BP. And I want to sort of push it a little bit further away. Say we want, say we want to push out a path. And it looks like this. So v prime, v prime, and the distance. And the distance in u. So, say this is essentially non-separating, and u is as before. Both large. So this isn't the whole proof. I don't have time to give you the whole proof. But one specific thing that you might encounter is: I have this sort of only very brief incursion into the sphere of radius rho, and I want to get rid of the rhythm. Sphere of radius rho, and I want to get rid of it. And both the point where I came from and the point I go to next were sort of very obviously in the next sphere for the reason of that trick. So now how do I, I want to sort of explain how you solve this problem. So can do this if speakers Or really, all complements in the curve graph of U are really this sort of essentially non-separating version. Let me just press right under the box. So both of these points are far from C in the curved graph of E. And so now I just join them by a path, if I know that sort of spheres or common lens balls are connected, then I can join them by a path that stays far from C in U, and that's always in the next. So that's somehow the main idea that I'd like to convey: some sort of inductive argument where you know you're in. It where you know you're in the next sphere if you're far away in the smaller curve graph, and you join up those pairs with some sort of inductive hypothesis. So, this leads to induction on complexity. Any question about that part? Check, so u is the surface minus v? Yeah, so u is sigma minus v. Or if v goes around a pair of punctures, you throw that over. Yeah, right. So that's the inductive. Sorry, what do you do if like the points on the path are not at large distance from C? You just like move them away. I can show you. I can show you later if you want. There's a similar trick to get them into this configuration. So you sort of start with an arbitrary pair, and then you move them via something only slightly more complicated to get a pair with this property. Sort of, there's a multi-step procedure. But this is sort of the main observation. And there are some technical details because you want various things to be essentially non-separating. And you actually have to worry about pairs of curves. And you actually have to worry about pairs of curves and not just curves being essentially non-separated. So, but what about the base case? So it would be great if you could use, so we understand C sigma 1, 1, and again that's isomorphic to C sigma 04. So it'd be great if that's the base case, because that's the only curved graph we have to take. That's the only curve graph we ever picked. But that's a quasi-trick. No, because it's false in the most huge way. So in a sense, you might think this isn't really progress. Really, it shows you that the complexity case one up from this is the hard case. So I want to tell you how to do a little bit about what's involved in the case one complexity up from the Ferrycraft case, where you meet different. Graph case where you need different arguments because you can't induct very well. Base case, so use the five times function sphere. Again, this isn't important, but that turns out to be isomorphic to the curve graph of the twice function choice. And these are the only two surfaces that have complexity one more than second. This suffices. So So, I don't know if you've ever, I don't know how many of you have really thought about this curve graph before. I've thought about a lot about it. So, for those of you who haven't, I want to tell you some of the interesting features. So, I'm going to draw the five times punctured sphere like this. So, the sphere is the blackboard union infinity. And infinity is not a puncture in any of the five punctures. And do I have enough colors? I have to use white as one of my colors. So the first thing you notice is there are no triangles in this curve graph. So let me try to draw a triangle. So like there's a curve and then I pick a disjoint curve. Oh no, I can't have three disjoint curves. So lots of the times you think about triangles, but there are actually no triangles, and you could show there are no quadrilators in the curved graph. And so what I want to look at is. And so, what I want to look at is this configuration of curves here. So now let me draw this in the curve graph. So I have blue, and blue is disjoint from orange, so I'll draw that. And then orange is disjoint from white, so I'll draw that. So I'll draw that. White is destroyed from red. So I'll draw that. Red is destroyed from purple. Purple is destroyed from blue. So you don't have triangles or squares in the curve graph. You do have pending months. You need some cycle. If there were no cycles in the graph, it would be a tree. And that would be bad news if you were trying to show the spheres at the end. So it's sort of forced upon you. So, it's sort of forced upon you, you must use the cycles. These are the smallest cycles. And it turns out every five cycles in this. Okay. And I want to point out that if I look at two adjacent things, or sorry, two non-adjacent things on the Pentagon, they have intersection of two. And you just see that here. If I look at white and purple, they have two intersections. So now I can give you at least a little bit of a flavor. So the sphere of great. So I'm going to work in the five type functions. So the sphere of greatest one, about some point, is the fairy. Is the fairy graph. So in otherwise, it's the curved graph of the four times function sphere. And with usual definition, this has no edges. So it's sort of sort of the fairy graph, in that you think of it as the fairy graph. You think of it as the fairy graph, but actually, you use a different definition of when to connect two edges. So actually connect, so you put x is adjacent to y in the fairy graph. So maybe I'll use like a dotted line for the fairy graph. Means the intersection number of x and y just changed. So that's the definition of edge you use when you talk about the curve graph of the four times functions. Of the four times functions. So you think that's a third graph that's connected, but if you're looking at this as the induced subgraph, there are actually none of the edges. So this is not connected. S1C has no edges as a subgraph of the Kirk graph. So what am I going to do about this? So let me draw a picture of the fair graph. So maybe I'll take one vertex X here and one vertex Y here. Actually, I want to call them V1 and V2. V1, V2. So given V1, V2 find Find path in, so these are both in the sphere of radius one of C. Find path, so b1 equals w0, w1, up to wk is v2, with the intersection number between wi and wi plus 1. So, in other words, you're just finding a path in the fairy graph, because that's what encourages. So, maybe I, you know, it doesn't even matter which path. There's a path. This would be W1, W2, W3, W4. And I sort of think of this like this. So I have C and I have. Um one equals w not and then I have w one w two dot dot dot w b and if you want even sort of put dotted edges between these to remind you that these are adjacent and varied so they have intersection and then what you do is so it's very easy to show that you could put you could build a pentagon for That you could build a pentagon for each of them. And that has to do with the fact that these have intersection number two. So it's just sort of we start by drawing one curve and then two disjoint curves that have intersection number two, and you can fill it into a pentagon. It's only one configuration of the mapping last proof. So the picture is a proof. So I fill in with these pentagons, and then I can. And then I can sort of take the path across the top. So fill in with pentagons. And I want to point out, so I'm not going to, these are going to be non-degenerate pentagons. So this is not C. And the sphere of radius 1 has no edges. So all of these actually are in the sphere of radius 2. In the sphere of radius 2, because they're not C and they're not in the sphere of radius 12. So, just for free in this instance, all these new vertices I've drawn in the sphere of radius 2. So, sort of going across the top of all these pentagons shows S1 union, S2 connected. So, you just get it from the fact that Fairy Graph is connected. Get it from the fact that Fairy Graph is connected in pentacles. So, a higher screen is actually a slightly involved argument. You need to use the bounded geodesic image theorem to get pentagons that stay further. I look it's not for free anymore. And you need the one nice thing about the fairy graph. It may be very tree-like, but it's not actually a tree. If you remove a point, it stays connected. And so, if you like, that's sort of the inductive hypothesis in the case of the fair graph. That's what's left of the fear. And that is actually important. And that is actually important post. Any questions about that? If not, I want to mention some open questions. I think there's lots related to this to think about. So, okay. So for the first question, let me say context. Say context. So if I look at the curve graph minus a ball of radius r about c, this is or should be an HHS. Is encodes in that I sketched a proof and maybe Sol Schleimer sketched a proof too. And it seems to work. But the constants get spawned. So it obeys the default conjecture, which is you keep the subsurface. Which is you keep the subsurfaces so that every curve in the set of vertices you're looking at cuts it. And so these sort of eventually better approximate, so r to infinity, sort of approximate the Gromov F of the curve in some way. But it's a little challenging to think about. The reason I never wrote it up is because the The reason I never wrote it up is because the constants get worse and worse as the R increases. And when I tried to do it, they got worse so fast I couldn't get any of the colours I wanted. But it would be useful to prove this and see sort of what the best concepts would go. So anyways, the first question I want to ask is if there's a, so all of these have hierarchy paths. And then so what do hierarchy paths become in the Gromoff boundary? So the Gromov boundary is sort of approximated by all these HHSs. These HHSs. So, did you say that's known or open? That it is an HHS, it's more or less known. It's not obvious. It's actually a little tricky, but it's not written up. Call it a conjecture if you want, but I think it's true. So it is there D sites. But you're not planning on writing the though, because you couldn't get uniform constants. I couldn't. I mean, uniform constants shouldn't be true, but the constants were so bad. Shouldn't be true, but the constant was so bad I couldn't get any of the crawleries that I wanted to get from it. So, if someone can do it with good constants, they should be able to do it. I think it might. So, I don't know what's true. If it were true with sufficiently good constants, I could do perfect. This is sort of part of a big story for understanding subgraphs of the curve graph and showing their easy justice that many people have worked on. So, is it true that for every pair of points in the Roman boundary, there exists a path? There exists a path to the Gromov boundary that goes between them boundary such that for all u that's non-sigma, rho root gamma is a unparametrized quasi-jance hence. So the subsurface projections are defined on the Gromov boundary, with the sole exception that you can't project to sigma itself. And maybe for this crowd, the explanation is VGI. So somehow the Gromov boundary is actually like an HHS, just missing its top-level hyperbolic space. And so showing linear connectivity of the Gromov boundary. Linear connectivity of the Gromov boundary is one way of showing our reasonable paths. But it would also be upsetting if you found a path which maybe satisfied the definition of linear connectivity and unnecessarily would not see some subsurface. That shouldn't have to happen. So the conjecture is yes, there is such a path. So I'm running low on time, so I'll just say the remaining questions. It would also be nice to find lots more questions. Find lots more quasi-tones in the graph. And there, what I would conjecture is if you take any pair of what's called co-bounded points, then they're contained in the boundary of a quasi-plane. And you could show that would be sharp. Not every pair of points are in the boundary of a quasi-plane at all. You could try to do some version of this for the free factor complex or the free splitting complex. Actually, maybe the easiest thing in that. Actually, maybe the easiest thing in that direction is to do a linear graph. So, as far as I know, linear conductivity of the boundary of the R graph does not follow from this. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong. I only thought about it for 20 minutes. So, you could try to do it for that. And then you have the two analogs and out at then, or three analogs, the various paperboard complexes. And I think another, maybe, just, I don't know if this is true, but given the people here, I want to say it. Here, I want to say it. So, Bonking-Pleiner showed that part of the proof was to show that if you had, say, a one-ended hyperbolic group, then its Bromov boundary is the other that went into this proof of 2B. You could ask for a similar thing for HHGs. You could say if you have an HHG and the top-level curve graph is one I think, then is the boundary linearly connected? Or there are various variants. You could go easy on yourself and say, suppose you know the Gromov boundary. And say, suppose you know the Gromov boundary of the top-level hyperbolic space is path-connected and local path-connected. Is it automatic that it's linearly path-connected? And I think it's pretty natural to guess that the answer is yes, in that similar things are true for hyperbolic groups. And although the proof here uses a lot of very fine and specific things, it also sort of does a lot more than what you need just to get the groma method. And finally, the last question I want to mention is: you can look for higher labor. Last question: I want to mention is you can look for higher linear conity. So, if you look at the six-times punctured sphere, it's known that if you have a loop in the Gromov boundary, you can fill it with a disk. So now you can ask, can I make the diameter of the disk be bounded entered into the diameter of the Gromo? And this actually shows up in work on Canon's conjecture, sort of higher linear connotation. And so you could try to prove that. Okay, thank you. I'm going to ask a question first. So I guess one question I think just because I think it's worth asking. So from the Meiging Group paper, they know that they build these quality planes, and so they know there's lots of swimming boundaries. So they know there's lots of circles in the boundary. Can your argument be used directly to proves there's lots of circles in the boundary? Like, kind of, it holds it. So you can get lots of circles in the boundary. And actually, that's what I was sort of playing around with when I came up with this. So you can even build sort of negatively curved planes, like the QI embedded into the curved graph. And it's not so hard using this sort of line of ideas. The hard part is actually keeping the curvature bounded from minus instead of mi. And that is again some question of uniformity. And these uniformity questions seem to be, to me, are quite challenging. But yeah, you could build lots of sort of quasi-negatively curved plates. So you can prove, like, given any two co-bounded points, you can find them. For this, you don't need co-bounded, I think. Although I haven't done it. The way I initially thought of this project is the goal was to crochet hyperbolic plates in the curve graph, where you just sort of build concentrically outwards and get your hyperbolic plate. And it failed in that sort of crocheting, you're supposed to insert like one stitch every so many. And I couldn't keep a uniform bound on that. But the ideas did sort of turn into this, where you don't need the uniform. There's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be able to. It was very aggravated. You can find a reason something should be hard, and you can give up honestly. But I found no reason it should be hard, and I could not actually keep the uniformly. So maybe one of you can find some easy way to do that. Do I have to stop this now?
