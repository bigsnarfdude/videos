And the City University of New York, and the title is Integral Current Spaces and Their Properties. Thank you very much for this opportunity to speak. I don't know if the recording has started yet. Is it already? It seems so. Yes, I think so. Yes. Okay, sorry. All right, so thank you for this opportunity to speak. This opportunity to speak, and I'm sorry we aren't able to be in Oaxaca in person. So, I took a photo of the institute here, the Casamatamatica. That's where we should be. And here is some pictures of Oaxaca. So that should get us all in the mood for how we should be enjoying ourselves this week. So, anyway, I'm going to give a very introductory kind of talk and bring up some questions. Bring up some questions. So, the topic is integral current spaces and their properties. And I'm going to explain what is an integral current space and why are they interesting. And what properties do they have? And what do we hope to show in the future? So, we need more experts to be studying them that are in metric geometry. Right now, most people working with them are effectively Romanian geometers, and they are metrics. They are metric spaces, so it's important to get more people to look into them. So, let me just start with what an integral current space is in a very light way. I'll get into a deeper level of definition in the future. So, an integral current space is a metric space, X D, and it has what's called a current structure, T, and it was defined by me jointly with Stefan Begger this year using Ambrosio Kirheim's notion of an integral current in a metric space. Current in a metric space. So we're starting with a metric space and we're just adding one additional structure. So this structure, this additional structure, the current structure, is going to be recording basically a collection of bilops charts, orientation, and integer-valued weights at points. So it's very much like an integral current, but it's attached to the metric space in an intrinsic way. So in So, integral currents that we've already had mentioned in this previous talk, they're generalized like sub-manifolds. So, if you have a sub-manifold in Euclidean space, you can call, review it as an integral current. An integral current space is generalizing the notion of a Riemannian manifold, and it's adding a little more structure to a metric space. So, it's an intrinsic notion. So, integral currents are viewed in terms of an extrinsic space, just like sub-manifolds have an extrinsic space involved. An extrinsic space involved, and integral current spaces are intrinsic, and so we're just going to be trying to capture properties of a space intrinsically without referring to an exterior space that it might sit in. So, let me just review what integral currents are in Euclidean space in case some of the people here are not familiar with Federal and Fleming's work. They introduced integral currents in Euclidean space. So, this is my notation for Euclidean space. I love some arbitrary. Euclidean space of some arbitrary dimension n to study the convergence of sub-manifolds in Euclidean space. So they had the plateau problem, and it said if you have the infimum over all areas of a sub-manifold, and the boundary of the submanifold is taken to be S1, a particular S1 that's fixed inside Euclidean 3-space. So perhaps the S1 sitting in the XY coordinate plane. You fix that boundary, and then you say, what the inf of the area of all these sub-manifolds. The area of all these sub-manifolds is this achieved? So, the natural question would be to take a sequence of surfaces, MJ, two-dimensional surfaces in E3, such that the boundaries are fixed to be S1, and take the area approaching this infimum of the areas, this infimum here. So here's an example of a sequence of such sub-manifolds. Each one of them, the boundary, is this fixed blue circle. And they're for. The goal, they're progressing, the area is decreasing, but as you can see, they're becoming more and more complicated because there's no reason why decreasing area should in any way correspond to any control on curvature or on whether it is even becoming space filling inside Euclidean space. So we can develop all these extra tubes. And in what sense might it actually converge to the flat disk, which is actually achieving this area? And obviously, the same question can be asked with other. Obviously, the same question can be asked with other shapes, but I wanted to emphasize even if the circle has these problems: that even if it's a really nice set, like a circle, where we know that the flat disk achieves the infremum of the area, the sequence of sub-manifolds approaching that is going to have possibly more and more complexity. So because of this increasing complexity, Federer and Fleming introduced this notion of integral cards in Euclidean space to study these convergence and define a notion of convergence for these sequence, where this sequence would. Where this sequence, with this increasing complexity, still nevertheless converges to a flat disk. So, the way they note it is that these mj's converge weakly as integral currents to m infinity, which is the flat disk, if the integration over these sub-manifolds by any differential form converges to the integral of the limit of the differential form. So, where you test it with all possible differential forms. So, you can see that if you So you can see that if you test this, no matter what differential form you use, it has this form: a dx budget dy plus b dy wedge dz plus c d z by h dx. Take any differential form where a, b, and c are functions, and you test it against this by integration. You will see that this integration over the differential form will in fact converge to the integration of that same differential form over the flat disk. So that thus achieves a notion of convergence for some manifolds. Convergence for some manifolds, which can handle this problematic issue of all these extra space-filling behavior possibly occurring. All right, so this is a metric geometry conference. So let's move on to, okay, let me talk a little more about federal film first. One thing that we want, okay, I'm going to keep this here so we can see. Note that the boundaries of the MJs in this particular picture, the boundaries of the MJs. In this particular picture, the boundaries of the MJs were all S1, but you could just talk about MJs that are converging weekly as integral currents. So let's just consider that and not this particular sequence. And notice that if we say that MJ converge weekly as integral currents with this notion of convergence, then if you want to study the boundaries, you'll notice the boundaries also will weakly converge as integral currents to the boundary of the limit because the boundary of the mj's testing on any one form now. So we take the anyway. One form now, so we take any one form is equal to the integral over mj of d of that form. So you see, we switch from boundary to manifold by taking the differential of the form. Then we take the limit and we have the differential of the limit. This is the convergence of the mj and m infinity we're using right here. But then we can switch back to boundary m infinity. So we have boundary convergence if we use this notion. Furthermore, they prove that the limit They prove that the lim inf as j goes to infinity of the area of mj's is greater than the area of m infinity. To handle non-smooth limits, Federer and Fleming define what's called an integral current. So let me just to handle non-smooth limits, Federer and Fleming define what's called integral currents. They act on differential forms with boundary defined by the boundary of the current acting on a form. Both satisfy the same rule here that we have, the Stokes theorem. Boundary T. The Stokes theorem. Boundary T acting on any differential form is T acting on D of the differential form. So this is a way of defining boundary. An integral current, which is acting on a form, can then have a boundary defined by how it acts on a form of lower dimension. And it has a notion of mass such that Tj will converge to T infinity implies that the limit for the mass of the TJs is bigger than the mass of T infinity. Now, I'm not going to get into the precise definition of what they Precise definition of what they call an integral current and what they call mass because we're not actually going to use their version of things. We're on everything they did was on Euclidean space, and we need to work on metric spaces. So now let's talk about defining this more rigorously in the setting where our space is a metric space. And this is the work of Ambrosio Kirheim. And I just misspelled Kirheim, so let me fix that. So, Ambrosio Kierheim defined integral currents for metric spaces, and that's what I want to define vigorously for everyone because that's what we're actually going to be using. So, an integral, consider a complete metric space Z, D, Z. We have no differential forms, so we can't talk about testing a sub-manifold or notion of sub-manifold or current on differential forms. Current on differential forms. So instead, we're going to use DeGeorges' notion of a tuple. So, this is what used to be a differential form in the previous theory will instead be a tuple of functions, f pi 1 up to pi m, where f is a function from z, that's our metric space, to the reals, bounded n Lipschitz. Okay, so he's a bounded and Lipschitz function, and the pi i's are all Lipschitz. Okay, so these are what we're going to define our car. Are what we're going to define our currents acting on these kinds of spaces. Notice that ellipsoid submanifold Ï† that maps a Riemannian manifold that's oriented into Z can be viewed as acting on these tuples in the following way. So we use this notation bracket phi star M. This is pushing forward, viewing, I should probably put the phi star in front of the bracket, but anyway, this is the push forward of M and we're going to see how it acts on this tuple. It acts on this tuple. And the way it acts is as if the tuple was like a differential form, we're integrating over m the function, the first term, the f following phi. So this is just the function in front of a differential form. And the pi 1 to pi m become d pi 1 following phi, wedged up to d pi m following phi. So this is just like the differential forms you had before, but we're not actually viewing them as differential forms on the metric space because we don't have differential forms in the metric space. Because we don't have differential forms in the metric space, but we've pulled them back to a manifold, pulled them back using phi, and then we view it. You can do the D to them because as long as phi is a Lipschitz map, pi one following phi will also be Lipschitz. So this differential is defined almost everywhere, and so are the others. And so we can do this integration over m. So this is a well-defined notion of how we could take a Lipschitz sub-manifold and view it as acting on a tuple. They further define what they want the d of the omega to be, and they say we'll set d omega to equal 1 f pi 1 to pi m. And this is designed exactly so that this works, interacts with this correctly. The one in front is, think about it, if you took d of this differential form here, you would get d of f volume phi, and you'd have a one as the function in front. So that's where this one comes from. Front. So that's where this one comes from, and f becomes one of the terms that's wedged. So it's all set up such that phi star m of d omega would equal phi star boundary m of omega. Right, so this is a way of now defining integral parts for metric spaces. This is a beautifully written paper. I highly recommend it from 2000, published in ACTA. And it's been cited hundreds of times already. It's a beautiful paper to work with. Now, I haven't given all the details. Work with. Now, I haven't given all the details yet because so far I just described a particular current, which is a Lipschitz submet. So they define a rectifiable current in a complicated way, and then they prove a theorem. And so I'm going to use the theorem as how we're going to sort of define the rectifiable current because it's a simpler way to look at things. So they define a rectifiable current is a current acting on tuples such that there exists a bunch of Borel sets and a Lipschitz function phi i's from Ai's to Z. function phi i's from a i's to z and weights a i in the reals such that t is equal to a sum from equal one to infinity of a i and the push forward of the borel sets and they require that this um that they have finite mass which is equivalent to requiring this this is not the formula for mass but this is equivalent to finite mass so it's saying that we want the the weighted sum of the housing measures of the images of these charts to be less than infinity um and we Than infinity. And we can have these guys to be destroyed. Let me add disjoint, destroyed images, just so that we don't have to get confused too much. So what you want to do is to picture that what you've done is you've taken a collection of rel sets and now you've put them over. Into your larger space, and you've put them in like that. So, there's each one of those pieces, those charts, is a little rectifiable. It's a little bit of a Lipschitz image of a Borel set in RM. So, T is called integer rectifiable if the weights themselves, these weights AI are in Z. So, the weights are giving a weight, a certain amount of multiplicity now to. Multiplicity now to the um to each chart. And we say that t of f pi one to m is then equal to the sum to infinity of the weight and the integral over the Borel set of the f following phi i, d pi one following phi i, and so on. Now they don't need to be disjoint. That is true. If we make them disjoint, though, it's a little easier to picture the weights. Thank you. And this, by the way, is not their definition. This is a theorem they prove about them. So I just want to be sure everyone understands that. Is everyone able to see the whole thing at once? Maybe I should make it a little smaller. Seems to want to bounce up. Note that the collection of charts is not unique. Okay, so you can switch the collection of charts around, but what's important is that you consider two of these integral cards to be equal to each other. If whenever you test them on any tuple, they have the same answer. them on any tuple, they have the same answer. So they define it in a more theoretical way as having certain properties and then prove it has these charts. But you could say an erectifiable current is one that has these charts, but just remember that the current itself is not the collection of charts, but the action on the form on the tuple. Yes? Yes, let me see the new question. Excuse me, um Excuse me. So here you differentiate once you take the differential of Lib should function on a Borel subset of Rm. Yes. So is it something well defined or anything? Yeah, it's everywhere, almost everywhere. And so we actually are, it's only well defined after integrating. Okay, so it is some refinement of Radiomacher's theorem? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so this taking a differential is not really defined, but this is almost everywhere. And so we can do the integral. All right. So picture a bunch of possibly horribly boundaries for each AI. Okay. So the AIs, there's no assumption on them having nice boundaries or anything like that. But we do want the notion of. But we do want the notion of something that has a boundary. So, what we're going to do is we're going to define integral currents so that their boundaries turn out to be nice and integer rectifiable as well. But we're not going to insist that the charts themselves, AI, will not necessarily have nice boundaries. So picture that the AIs could have horrible boundaries, and that's why I made them very squiggly in this picture. So an integral current is an integer rectifiable current whose boundary, boundary T, is also integer rectifiable. Remember, Integer rectifiable. Remember, boundary T is defined as something that acts on a tuple as T acting on the D of the tuple. So that's a defined notion, and it would be called an integer rectifiable current as if that defined notion has a set of charts. But keep in mind that the charts that are defined for the boundary may be distinct from the charts. They're not the boundaries of the charts defining the original T, unless the original T happens to have really nice boundaries. Original T happens to have really nice boundary for its charts, but we don't know that it even does. It just exists that there's a bunch of charts for T, and that exists there are a bunch of charts for the boundary of T, and that's all we know. And by bunch, I mean countably many. Okay. So then if with this definition, weak convergence as parts can be defined, TJ weakly converges to T infinity, if and only if TJ tested on a tuple, converges to T infinity, tested on a tuple for all tuples. Infinity tested on a tuple for all tuples omega. And then, as before, TJ weakly converts to T infinity implies boundary TJ converges to boundary T infinity. And remember, boundary TJ is just defined using the Stokes theorem approach. Boundary T acting on a tuple is equal to T acting on one, the rest of the functions in the tuple. Then AK defined mass. They have a rather difficult definition for mass. A rather difficult definition for mass that's defined exactly in a way so that the limit as j goes to infinity of the mass of tj is greater than equal to the mass of t infinity. This is a really beautiful and fundamental property of their notion of mass, and it is not as easy to define this mass as in Ambrosio Kirheim. I'm sorry, as in Federal Fleming. So, their notion of mass is not just a weighted Hausdorff measure, it has extra complexity. It has extra complexity to it. The Ambrosio-Kirheim compactness theorem is the same as Federer and Fleming's compactness theorem, but using their mass. And it says that if Z is a compact metric space and the TJs are integral currents, such that the mass of the TJ is less than or equal to some constant, and the mass of the boundary TJ's is less than or equal to another constant, then a sub-sequence of the TJs converge weakly as Karns to T infinity, which is an integral card. Which is an integral card. Possibly it's the zero card. The zero current is the current that, when you act it on any tuple, just gives you zero. So you could say it has n equals zero charts and it has zero mass. So there is the zero currents, and that is part of this compactness theorem, the possibility that a sequence of subsequences could collapse to the zero space. Now, this collapsing can happen. This collapsing can happen in two different ways. One way would be that the mass of the TJs is just getting smaller and smaller and they sort of disappear from existence. You could picture this. Yes, two questions. I'm so sorry. Yes, so Simeon Aleska was first and then I think Jofu. Okay, thanks. Okay, so this compactness theorem, if you specialize it to smooth manifolds, is it exactly equivalent to Federal Flaming? To further. So there, Von Ha Lin has a book and he imitates the proof of the Ambrosi-Kirhan factus theorem to give a new proof of the fetter of Lemming. And so you could say that the same proof works in the Euclidean setting. But I don't want to thought the mass, the masses are a little different. The masses are a little different, and the definition of an current is a little different. Okay, okay, thank you. Yeah, so there is some distinctions. Just to so you know, Ambrosa Kirheim do mention that this is in their in their article, they talk about the distinctions. And I believe Stefan Wegg is here, so he's also very much an expert. Vegas here, so he's also very much an expert on ambrosio-kirheim and very good with these kinds of questions. And the second question: Yeah, so the definition of integral current that you give assumes that the boundary is rectifiable. I guess in the classical situation, right, you can also replace that boundary condition by the condition that the boundary have finite mass, and then it has a theorem. Mass and then it is. They have a theorem. Yeah. And that is true also here. That is true also here. It's a different definition of mass, though. Okay. Thank you. Stefan, auto-free question? Yeah, just one comment. I think the two theories in the case of Riemanni manifolds, they coincide, except that sometimes Federal-Fleming currents, integral currents, they're assumed to have compact support. And in the Ambrosio case, The in the uh ambrosio-K-Hank theory, they don't assume compact support, so but otherwise, the two notions are actually exactly the same. Thank you, and there's also work of Lang and Wenger, local integral currents on metric spaces. So that will allow the removal of the compact support and finance mass conditions. And Stefan Benga's here, so any other um Any other comments, questions? All right. So, the main point I want to, so I haven't put the exact definition of mass. The mass is a weighted Hausdorff measure in federal Fleming theory. The mass in the metric space setting is not just a weighted Hausdorff measure. There is an extra term called an area factor. But the weighted Hausdorff measure. Hausriff measure times a constant will be an upper bound for it, or the constant depends on n. So we can have an upper bound on the mass, but in order to have this lim inf of mass behavior, you need this exact definition of mass that has also this area factor, which measures in some sense how tangent spaces are Euclidean or not quite Euclidean. All right, so now Federal Fleming had the same compactness theorem for Z compact inside Euclidean space, and they also And they also define the flat distance between integral currents. And that is a flat symbol from music, like flat and sharp. This is based on the Whitney flat distance. Whitney also had a sharp distance. So this is the flat distance. T1 minus T2 flat. It's actually a norm when you're sitting in Euclidean space. So T1 minus T2 flat distance is the infimum of the mass of A plus the mass of B, such that A plus boundary B is equal to T1 minus T2. B is equal to T1 minus T2. So you have T1, say, this one-dimensional integral current I've drawn here, and I've drawn it with an orientation because we're talking about subtracting. And it acts on forms, remember? So we can say T1 minus T2 just means T1 acting on a tuple minus T2 acting on a tuple or acting on a form. So we have this T1 and we have T2 here. And then we want to close it up to make a cycle. So I have two parts of A in this picture and that makes a closed cycle here. makes a closed cycle here. And then boundary B would end up being that closed cycle and B itself is something one dimension higher whose boundary is equal to this cycle. And so we say that the flat distance between two currents is the infemum of the mass of A, which you can think of as a length in this picture, plus the mass of B, which you can think of as the area of B here. So they proved that under this hypothesis of their compactness theorem, Tj weakly converging as currents to T infinity. weekly converging as currents to T infinity, where you're testing it on forms if and only if Tj minus T infinity flat goes to zero. And then Benguer studied the flat distance between integral currents inside a complete metric space C and proved the same results for Ambrose Girheim's notion of integral currents. So this is a paper from, I don't remember, maybe I'm not going to try to remember the year, but anyway, Wenger has this paper here where he kind of extends these results to the Ambrosia-Kerrheim setting. The Ambrosia-Kerrheim setting. So now we want to move to the next stage. We want to deal with extrinsic versus intrinsic. All the notions we just talked about were extrinsic. They depended on exterior space Z and submanifolds MJ converging to limits M infinity based on how the MJ's are sitting inside Z. So for example, if the MJ is folding in some way, like this wave here, this MJ would be kind of close to M infinity because of the way it is sitting inside. Because of the way it is sitting inside this box Z. So if you have an increasingly narrow wave or fold happening, this MJs would actually converge to this M infinity. But viewed intrinsically, the MJ's are twice as long in this direction. And they're just flat, Z2 cross 0, 1s, while M infinity is 0, 1 cross 0, 1. So these are not really close in an intrinsic way. And by intrinsic, I mean where distances between points are measured by lengths sitting. Distances between points are measured by lanes sitting inside the submanifold. Then, this submanifold is twice as big in some sense than M infinity, and they shouldn't converge to each other in any, this is a repeating sequence, so its limit should, of course, be itself. So the only reason that this sequence MJ would be converging to infinity is because of the way it is sitting in an extrinsic space C, the way it's viewed inside Z. So that's extrinsic kind of convergence, and that's what we've studied so far. That's what we've studied so far with the Ambrosio-Kirheim and Federal Fleming situation. What we want is an intrinsic notion of when a sequence of Riemannian manifolds or a sequence of metric spaces actually converges with its intrinsic distance structure, not viewing it in terms of any external space. So, Stefan Wenger and I define the intrinsic flat distance and a convergence for a sequence of oriented Riemannian manifolds. For a sequence of oriented Riemannian manifolds, and we imitate Gromov's definition of what he called intrinsic Hausdorff distance, which is the Gromoff-Hausdorff distance. So the way we define it is we say that MJ is converged in this intrinsic flat sense, if and only if the intrinsic flat distance between the two manifolds is going to zero. And the intrinsic flat distance between two manifolds is the infimum of the flat distance of the two maps of the images of the two manifolds. Two maps of the images of the two manifolds sitting in an ambient space Z. So Gromoff-Hausdorff distance was the infimum of the Hausdorff distance between the images. So we instead are saying we want to take the flat distance. The flat distance, remember, is what Stefan Wenger studied here. It's the extension of the idea of the federal flowing flat distance. The same idea here, but done in the ambient space is just a complete metric space using Ambrosi Q. Is just a complete metric space using Ambrose-Kierheim theory. So we have this, it's the same definition though. It's in them over the mass A plus mass B of the A plus boundary B is T1 minus T2. So we're just studying this sort of area kind of distance or filling distance in between the two currents. But now to make this intrinsic and not depend on any extrinsic space, we're going to take an infimum over all complete spaces Z. So now it doesn't depend on a particular It doesn't depend on a particular space Z. We've taken the infimum over all possible complete spaces and over all possible distance-preserving maps phij from MJ to Z. So a distance-preserving map would be one such that the distance between the points in the original MJ is exactly the same as the distance between the points in the embedding into Z. So, this idea of taking an infimum over all metric spaces and over all distance-preserving maps, this is the same idea that. Preserving maps, this is the same idea that Gromoff had when he defined the Gromoff-Hausdorff distance, which he called intrinsic Hausdorff distance. And except in his case, he takes the Hausdorff distance between the two images, and we're taking the flat distance between the two images. Now, you might say, wait, that doesn't really make sense. What do we mean by images? So we would really need to change this into the notation where we add the star and we put in the notation. The notation from J-Man measure theory. So we have to view them as acting as carts, right? So you push them forward and they're acting as currents. And now we can talk about the flat distance. So we just change the notation a little bit so that this is rigorously defined. Any questions at this point? All right, I don't see questions. So I don't see the hands raised. So of course, if you put it in the chat, I will see a question. The chat, I will see a question. The one thing I do want to point out about this is that in Gromov's definition of intrinsic house ref distance, he takes overall compact Z and we take overall complete Z because complete is more natural and allows certain things, sequences to converge that we would like to see converge. And I will show you some of the sequences later that where it really has to be complete Zs that we consider. So then we define the integral current spaces. So finally, we're back to what I mentioned at the beginning, which is this notion of integral current space. So the integral current space is an X and ind, that's a metric space, X D, with an integral current T that's defined on the metric completion of X, because I didn't require that X is complete, okay? So we take the metric completion of X so that we can define integral currents on it. And then X is equal to the set of T, which is the collection of points in the metric completion. points in the metric completion such that the limit as r goes to zero of the mass of bpr over r to the m is greater than zero so m will be the dimension of our integral current space and it's the same m we're going to use at every point in the space and this is this is basically saying we don't want to include any points that don't have positive density so this is sort of saying we can include if it's a smooth manifold with boundary we include every point in the smooth manifold with boundary if it has some singular points and they're constant It has some singular points and they're conical, we are including them. But if they're cusp-like singular points, singular points like this, we don't include them. And if they're conical, we do include them. Okay, so we're including conical points. We're not including cuss points. And the reason for doing this is various theorems about rectifiability and the fact that we're then able to show that these spaces are rectifiable with oriented weighted Lipschitz. With oriented weighted Lipschitz charts via A from AA to Z, such that T is actually equal to, we already knew that T has some sort of structure like this. But now we're saying, oh, because of this property, the Hausdorff measure of X take away these unions actually turns out to be zero. So we actually are covering most of it. Okay, full Hausdorff measure, we're covering of the set X with these charts and we. Charts and we can define boundary of x dt to be the set of the boundary d boundary t. So we just take the d from the original x d so this space is not necessarily a length space. It does need a metric from the original x. And we can define the zero space as empty set zero, zero in each dimension. So we have now this notion of integral current space. Now we've actually defined Space now we've actually defined it. Notice how this property here that x is set of t is really tying the x back to the t. We're really forcing x to really be close to the image of these, this Hauser measure property here. And this is proven using Ambroser Kirheim's work. The thing to keep in mind is that your metric space doesn't have to be a lane space, this is just a metric space. This is just a metric space, and that it, if you were to imagine a countable collection of spheres sitting in Euclidean space that become increasingly dense, but they're still countable, that with the restricted distance from Euclidean three space, that would still be such an integral current space. And notice if you didn't take the positive density in that situation, you would take a You would take a, if you took the metric completion of it, you'd get the whole of Euclidean space. And that would look one dimension higher, and that's not correct. So the countable collection of two-dimensional spheres is still a two-dimensional integral current space, in part because of this set and positive density requirement. So this is really keeping us in the setting of keeping track of the dimension of our space and keeping this Hausdorff measure property here, where the M is the correct dimension. So if it's a collection of two-dimensional spheres, this. So, if it's a collection of two-dimensional spheres, this is M is 2. And it doesn't matter if it's a space-filling collection and that their closure would be all of Euclidean space. All right, so that's the integral current spaces. And they have a nice constant of boundary, which is convenient and will now work well with the intrinsic flat distance. So, we can define the intrinsic flat distance between two intercocurrent spaces. And the way we do this is again, an And the way we do this is again an infimo, and it's over all distance preserving maps into any complete metric space. So it's all these things the same as before. The distance preserving is where we're using the distances, and the push forward is not of X, it's the push forward of that integral current structure. So, this integral current structure has weight, it gives a notion of orientation on charts, it gives an integer-valued weights, and this push forward also will. And this push forward also will capture the boundary. Push forward of a boundary is the boundary of the push forward. So we're just push forwarding the weighted structure into the common space Z, and then we take the flat distance between them. So again, the infimum is over all complete metric spaces Z, so it does not depend on a specific extrinsic Z, and all distance preserving maps from XJ to Z, so the spaces are not folded. So this is the thing that's preventing. So, this is the thing that's preventing a folding effect where it can fold like that, but that would give a shortcut that's much shorter than the actual distance inside Z. The flat distance DFZ is defined using currents in Z, N is this infimum of mass of A plus mass of B, and it's taken between the push forwards. So I just recalled that the push forward of a T is just saying T of F following the phi one of the tuple, phi one following phi one. It's just like a push forward of a differential form. A push forward of a differential form. This is like the push forward of the push forward of a tuple acts just like the push forward of a differential form. So if you had, say, an xj that looks like this and an x infinity that looks like this, you could put them into z as long as z doesn't have the metric on z is one that doesn't make these are shortcuts. Okay, so your z can have interesting metrics. It's not Euclidean metric. And yes, question? Question? Nope. Notice that we can define the intrinsic flock distance from the zero space to M easily because we can just make this zero. And then we're just talking about how we fill in the images to themselves. So the A plus bound GB is just equal to the first minus zero. So that's just fine. It's sort of like a filling volume of sorts, but we have the A part. So that's interesting. So that's intrinsic class distance. And we proved that the intrinsic class distance is zero if and only if there's an isometry from the one metric space to the other, which push forward the T1 to equal T2. And we proved that if MJ intrinsic flak converges to M infinity, we can construct a complete metric space Z and that there are distance preserving maps into the Z such that the images, the flak distances inside Z converge to zero. Distances inside z converge to zero. So, this allows us now to use all sorts of theory, all sorts of um um this theorem allows us to then use everything from Ambrosio-Kirheim that's known about these guys converging. In particular, we can show the intrinsic clock distance from the boundaries, go to the boundaries, where the boundaries are defined this way again. And we are able to show the limit of the masses of the MJs is bigger than the mass of the limit, where we just define the mass of an integral current space to be the mass of a Of an integral current space to be the mass of its structure. Then Venger has this beautiful compactness theorem. It says that if the MJMs are all integral current spaces and their mass is uniformly bounded above and the mass of the boundary is uniformly bound above and the diameters are uniformly bounded above, then you actually have intrinsic flat convergence and the limit is an integral current space, possibly the zero space again. So this is Benger's compactness theorem. I will refer to this again. Compactness theorem, I will refer to this again, but you'll notice it's almost the same as the Federal Fleming one. But instead of saying that they all embed into a common compact metric space, there's this diameter assumption, and they do not all embed into a common compact metric space. Okay, so it's very important that they don't actually do that, but you're still able to get an intrinsic flat limit. And their examples do not embed into a common compact metric space, they do all embed into a complete. Do all embed into a complete metric space. All right, so this is what I'm going to refer to as Wenger's compactness theorem in the subsequent parts when I say we'll apply his theorem. So this is very handy theorem combined with this mass limit of masses, which comes from Ambrose. Basically, this comes from Ambrosio Kirheim as soon as we've proven this theorem. All right. So let's just look at an application to Ramanian M3 with scalar greater than equal to zero. Suppose you have scalar curvature is defined by this lim inf of how volumes in Euclidean space minus volume of the balls divided by r to the fifth greater than equal to zero would be the scalar curvature greater than equal to zero in three-dimensional m's. Gromoff has a scalar compactness conjecture. His compactness conjecture says that if mj3 are Just says that if MJ3 are Riemannian manifolds with volume bounded above, diameter bounded above, and no boundary, and if scale is greater than zero in this sense, or in any way you can define it, and the minimum area of the MJ is the greater angle to some A naught uniform greater than zero, where the minimum area is the infimum of the areas of surfaces that are minimal surfaces that are closed inside M3. So this is a minimal surface. So, this is a minimal surface condition that's sort of preventing collapse. Then, the conjecture, this conjecture says that you'll get an intrinsic flat limit. Well, we already know that by Wenger's compactness theorem. We have an intrinsic flat limit because there's this volume bound and there's this diameter bound and this boundary volume, boundary area bound is already bounded because it's zero. But what is part of the conjecture is that. Is part of the conjecture that the volumes will actually converge to the mass, not just limit that it won't be zero, it won't be the zero space. That's a big part of the conjecture. And the limit space should be connected and geodesic, and the scalar should be greater to zero in some sense. All right, any questions? All right, so this is a compactness congestion. A compactness conjecture for Riemannian manifolds with non-negative scale curvature. And the main points to keep in mind is that this trio of conditions already allows us to use Wenger's compactness. So we already have intrinsic flat limits, which is, I would say, a big piece of the reason why the conjecture involves intrinsic flat. It is definitely false for Gromo-Fausdorf. So this is known to be false for Gromo-Fausdorf, but the hope is that it works for intrinsic. But the hope is that it works for intrinsic flat. And one of the key examples that made him conjecture this is an example that Stefan Binger and I had in mind when we first defined the notion. And that's the Ilmanin example. So let me just sort of keep this and the Ilmanin. So Elmanin's example is a sequence of manifolds that are diffeomorphic to S3. They have non-negative scale and they have wells. So they have these wells. So this, yeah. There seems to be a question by Alexander if I'm seem to be a question by alexander if i'm yes please go ahead um yes thanks so uh the following so is it something really three-dimensional is that something specific in dimension three or is it a special case of something yeah the reason the reason the conjecture is three-dimensional is it's known that this this condition on area will not suffice um in higher dimension to prevent the going to zero and there are examples And there are examples of neighbor, Neumeier, and Lee, where in four dimensions this is failing. Okay, thanks. Thank you. So a different condition needs, a stronger thing needs to replace this one in higher dimensions, and it has not been, nobody has something yet. So the element and example. So, the element in the example: you have a sphere with one well. This is actually like a gravity well from general relativity. That's the inspiration. And then you have two of them, and then you have three of them. And these all have non-negative scalar. So every one of them has scalar greater than or equal to zero. And they converge in the intrinsic flat sense to the round sphere. So that's an example. So that's an example which has no GH limit. So there was not a hope to have a groma-powiter convergence in this setting. So this limiting example was known quite a bit before since the 90s. So this was known fairly early that they would not hope for a Gromov-Hausdorff limit in the setting of scalar curvature. Now this new Now, this next example is in my paper with Stefan. So we looked at the Illman example in our original paper. We also noticed this barbell example, S3s with tunnels. So just take the S3, like a warped S3, and make a narrow part narrower, narrower, narrower. So we end up squeezing, this is an S2 here, right? So we're making it narrower and narrower. And the intrinsic flat limit is a disjoint pair of spheres here. Of spheres here, and the metric on this intrinsic flat limit is the metric of a length metric, not on the spheres because they're not connected, but on the spheres with a line segment. So the distance between this point would be distance to that point, distance here, and then distance to this point. But we don't actually have the points lying in between. These points, you might say, do not have positive density, if you think of it. Okay, so these that sort of. Okay, so these that's sort of the density is disappearing. So this region disappeared under intrinsic flat convergence the same way the thin wells disappeared. You picture that you can put this space and this space together into some Z, and you can do it in a way where the Z hat, the large metric space Z, this filling between these two spaces has very small volume or mass. And this also has the same issue. The mass inside here is very small. So this is close to this and the intrinsic So, this is close to this, and the intrinsic flat sense, this part just disappeared. These also have scalar gradients of zero, but notice that they're min A. The minimum area of a closed minimal surface is being achieved by these necks, and that's getting smaller and smaller. So, this is failing this mine condition. So, this is not a counterexample to the conjecture. This is a nice illness example, is an example of what you want the conjecture to include, and this one. Conjecture to include. And this one is a counterexample for not having the min A condition. So if you want to replace the Min A condition with something else, it has to be something that gets rid of tubes that open up on either side. You want wells to be allowed, but you don't want something that has a neck and opens on either side. That causes disconnectedness. And we would like a connected geodesic limit space. And this guy is not connected, not certainly not geodesic. Not and certainly not geodesic. So then Park, Tian, and Wang prove the conjecture in the warp product setting. So they have just one warping function. And it's possible a welcome to form in that setting, but they are able to prove that there is an M infinity. And the limit warping function is H1 loc. And then they are able to prove the intrinsic flat convergence to this guy. So that's just the only setting that's been done. I've been working with Tiana. Been done. I've been working with Tian and Wang further on another case that we're developing, and it's very intriguing because these limit functions, when you do the warping, they don't even end up H1 loc in our case, but we seem to still be able to get the intrinsic flat limit. So that's good news. Let's talk about some more examples. There's examples I did with Dodgic and Basilio, where you take a sphere and you make a lot of tunnels. So a tunnel, a picture of So, a tunnel, picture a tunnel is like this. Okay, so a tunnel is a parabola rotated around a sphere, is the best way to say it. This thing has non-negative scalar curvature. It's an S2 cross 0L. You can actually make it long by putting a cylinder in the middle of it. So, this is a tunnel. And what you do is you take these tunnels and you connect points. So, I'm going to just zoom in. You put a curve here and you make these tunnels between. Curve here, and you make these tunnels between points. But these two balls are not necessarily close before you put the tunnel. But now you've just made a shortcut from here to here. So you have this curve, and to travel from here, you go through the first tunnel, walk outside, second tunnel, walk outside, and you've made a shortcut. Think of these tunnels as like taking a subway, and you've just taken a subway trip super fast between these two stations, and then a subway trip super fast between these two stations, because this tunnel is going to be a shortcut. It's not as long as Shortcut. It's not as long as going inside the sphere. Then we do it again, the second one, but we do more of them and more stops. And each one of them is giving a shortcut. We call this sewing. We have to space these holes in a way where these two are close and then these two are far with a shortcut now through the tunnel. And so along this curve, we've made a bunch of shortcut tunnels. So if you live over here and you want to travel to here, you're going to take the subway, these stops, and get out and get over here. And get out and get out here. In the limit, there is actually a Gromoff-Hausdorff and an intrinsic flatliner limit of the sequence. The limit is, in fact, a sphere with what's called a pulled thread. So this is actually a notion that is, I believe, in Borago Brago Ivanov's textbook, the pulled thread space, which is a sphere where an entire curve has been identified to a single point. And by making these tunnels And by making these tunnels, making like a subway trip along the thread or sewing along the thread, then you pull it tight and you've got this entire thread identified to a single point. This space fails to have non-negative scalar in the sense of the volume limit of balls because the volume of a ball around this point, which is a pulled thread, is so large that that volume limit ends up being at a negative infinity, and that's Negative infinity, and that's not non-negative scalar. But again, this fails the min A condition because there's these smaller and smaller minimal surfaces in the middle of each of these tunnels, and these tunnels are getting smaller and smaller. So we don't have a uniform lower bounded area. So it's another example showing why you need that min A kind of condition or something similar. So these are three-dimensional to create the non-negative scalar curvature. The non-negative scale of curvature on this sequence. They all have non-negative scalar. It's made out of spheres, and these kinds of shapes also have non-negative scalar. And you can glue them smoothly. Then, in joint work with Kazaras and Basilio again, we made a sequence where now we put tunnels between every sort of, just more and more points. So direct routes without taking a subway train with many stops, but direct shuttle distances from any point to any. Distances from any point to any other point on the manifold as you get increasingly many points involved. So nobody has to take a local train. They all get express shuttles to any other place and you make increasingly dense collection of points that are all directly connected. The lengths of these tunnels will be the length from Euclidean space. So they are straight in Euclidean space and this is sphere. So now in the limit, we end up, and by the way, these are virtually attached, so they're not. By the way, these are virtually attached, so they're not actually sitting in Euclidean space. The length is from Euclidean space, so they don't actually crisscross, they don't hit each other, they're virtually created. The intrinsic flat limit is the sphere with the Euclidean four distance on it. This space has no geodesics between any points. It's not sitting in Euclidean four-space. It is S3 itself with the distance from Euclidean four-space. It has no geodesics. Euclidean four-space, it has no geodesics at all. So, that first example that was constructed, the Barbell example that Stefan Beger and I constructed showed that you could have a disconnected manifold, and that's why it didn't have geodesics. And this example shows, well, it's even connected, but it has no geodesics. So, that's an interesting ingendric flat limit that just got created. We can start with metric spaces that have length metrics on them, and the limit will not necessarily have a length metric. The limit will not necessarily have a length metric anymore. Yes, Stefan. I don't hear you. Maybe you're muted. I think it was up all the time. Okay, maybe. Sorry, I forgot to put it down. Sorry. Oh, okay. Sorry. I'm sorry if I didn't notice it before. I'm not seeing these hands. I don't usually teach with Zoom. All right. So, anyway, this is an example. So, I just want these examples to keep in mind. They're kind of interesting even without the non-negative scalar. So, then there's an Azella Scoli paper I wrote where I proved various theorems, but one of the theorems that I'm just going to mention here is that if you have MJs that are intrinsic flat converting to M infinity, who isn't zero, and if you have a sequence. And if you have a sequence of Fj's that go from Mj to a compact space, a compact metric space, and the Lipschitz constants of the Fj's is less than or equal to a uniform constant, then a subsequence of these guys converge. I won't exactly explain what this means, but the important part is that there is a Lipschitz, an F infinity that goes from M infinity to K with the same Lipschitz constant. So it's a way to create a map from the limit space now to the same space. Limit space now to the same space as the sequence. And Raquel Prows asked me the following question, or pointed out that this was a serious issue, I should say. Suppose the MJMs satisfy this above Arzella-Scoli theorem, where we assume that the Lipschitz constants are all one and the compact set is sitting in Euclidean space. So, one picture of such an example would be: suppose the MJs are Riemannian manifolds. Riemannian manifolds that are defined with pullbacks from submanifolds in Euclidean space. So here it would be a sub-manifold sitting in Euclidean space, and I view it as a Riemannian manifold using the pullback metric tensor on it. So the lengths of curves are long and winding around, you know, between lying inside the space. So that's the metric on the space. So suppose that the boundaries are all the sphere, or let's just do the two-dimensional case. Or let's just do the two-dimensional case. All the boundaries are all a circle. So that's like the question we had at the beginning with the plateau problem. Suppose the volumes converge to the volume of the flat disk. Does the MJs itself intrinsic flat converge to the disk? So do these guys? So think of this as this is sitting inside Euclidean space. These guys here are all inside Euclidean space. Let me put that. These guys are NE3. These guys are NE3, inside E3, inside E3. And these guys at the bottom row are just the Riemannian manifolds themselves. They are intrinsic manifolds. They exist in their own self. And they have Lipschitz-1 maps going into Euclidean space. This guy is a Riemannian manifold who has a Lipschitz-1 map going to Euclidean space. And then you say, if the volumes of these guys goes to D2, well, if These guys go to d2. Well, if his volume is converging to the flat disk, then this guy's volumes are actually less than or equal to these guys. So they are converging to flat disk. So we know that the Federer-Fleming flat distance is this guy. The question is, does this converge? Well, we know this has a limit by Wenger if we assume there's a diameter bound. But, and we know that the limit that Wenger found has this guy here. We know that this guy is not zero because he has boundaries are all nine. Because he has boundaries are all nine. Well, we can probably show this guy's not zero with a little effort. But now, is he the flat disk? Any questions? Let me look at the chat. Oh, thank you. So that's the end. So this is false if you don't assume the volumes converge to the disk because you could possibly have false. And so I just wanted to leave it with this question. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much, Christina. I'll secure questions. Aside questions. Just unmute yourself and ask them. Or raise your hand as you do, Alexander. But maybe it's easier just to ask questions. So I think Alexander was first and then Vitaly second. No, sorry, I just clapped my hands. So it was another reaction. So the yellow hand means clapping hand, and since I don't know what's the difference. I don't know what's the difference between raising hand and clapping hands in Zoom, but maybe I will learn this week. Holy shit. Okay, so can I ask? Yes. It's kind of vague, but are there conditions which are like weaker than things which imply gramo-hospital compactness, but still guarantee that the limits of The limits of spaces with intrinsic metrics have intrinsic metrics. Thank you. You asked the next slide. So one way to keep things from disappearing or to control them and prevent this kind of collapse without bringing up minimal surfaces would be to use filling volumes. So you can talk about filling volumes of balls sitting inside the space. This is something that came up. I have this definition of filling. I have this definition of filling volume here. It's almost the same as Gromo's filling volume, but we just take the infium of the mass of any filling. And you can use this on balls in the space. And if you keep control on the filling volumes of balls, you can prevent those balls from disappearing. If the filling volume of the boundary is prevent that from disappearing. So that's one way to prevent things from disappearing. That doesn't require something Riemannian like minimal surfaces. Surfaces. And this is studied in my work with Portuguese. But this doesn't necessarily imply that the limit will have intrinsic metric, does it? No, you'd have to keep working on it. So what you would want to do is show that midpoints have filling volume controls. But that has not been, there is no existing theorem yet. Existing theorem yet that says that the limit is connected. The closest thing is theorems where they show the limit space is Euclidean or like flat. There's work of Pirales and Allen and there's various other things. There's something called capacity by Jurgu and Lee. These things can be used to try to prevent disappearing, but they the focus so far is what makes something actually flat Euclidean, and then you can maybe go one step. Maybe go one step, you know, let's step back and say, okay, now we just want midpoints. Is this condition satisfied in your example with tunnels where the limit is connected but just has a chord metric? This one, S3. Yeah, this one with the no geodesics, that fails the min A condition and it doesn't have filling volumes around every point. Have filling volumes around every point. So the midpoint of, if I were to take these two points on M3, the midpoint between these two points is inside a tunnel. And if you're inside a long tunnel, then your filling volume will be very small. Thank you. Thanks. Okay, other questions? If not, then thank you very much. Thank you very much. And the next talk will be at 11, which means
