So our next talk, next speaker is Professor Paul Yang. So the title of his talk is Quasi-Conformal Map on a Fourth Sphere. Start now? Yes. Okay. I'd like to thank the organizing. I'd like to thank the organizing committee to give me this chance to speak here. It's wonderful to see so many old friends. So I want to talk about the construction of quasi-conformal maps and the differentiable four-sphere, not necessarily the standard four-sphere. So I try to recall. So, I try to recall something, namely, if you have a metric on a four-manifold, then there's the Weyl tensor. And the Weyal tensor vanishing means that the metric is locally conformally equivalent to the standard four-sphere. So, if you assume the manifold topology is the four-sphere, then it is in fact globally conformally equivalent to the. Globally conformally equivalent to the standard force here. So if the vial square integral, which is conformally invariant quality, so if the L2 of Vial is small, then generally we expect that the metric G should be quasi-conformal to the standard sphere. So I want to talk about a result that makes this a little bit more explicit. That makes this a little bit more explicit. So, this is joint work with Alice Chang and Eden Privis, who's a postdoc at Princeton. So, I want to recall a little bit about the fourth-order Q-curvature. We're going to use it to formulate the result. So, remember now the Q. So remember now the Q curvature on the four manifold is given by this quantity 1 over 12. So 1 over 12 times minus Laplace of R plus R squared minus 3 V C square. And it's basically the Q curvature can be computed. Be computed under a conformal change in metric by the fourth-order Pennits operator p of u. So here is the formula for p of u. It's basically the biharmonic operator, and then you add a second-order perturbation term. So the equation that controls the change of Q curvature is given by this one. So, the first result makes use of this Q curvature in its formulation. So let's recall what is a K quasi-conformal map. So, if I have a map F going from the first manifold M1 to the second manifold M2, and M1 has the metric G1, M2 has G metric. M2 has G metric G2. We say it's a K quasi-conformal if it is a homeomorphism, and F is locally in W14 from M1 into N2. And then the most important condition is that the determinant, sorry, the differential of this map F, the norm to the power n is bounded by K times Jacobian determinant. Jacobian determinant. Okay, so k is the cost, the quasi-conformal constant. So that's the formulation of k quasi-conformal maps. So the first theorem is the following. So I start out with a metric G1 on the differentiable four sphere, which has positive Yamati class. And then the assumption is that the integration of Is that the integration of Q for this metric G1 is now negative? So I call this condition star. And then I look at a conformal metric. I write G1 as exponential 2w times G0. Then the statement is that there is a epsilon, say epsilon 1 positive, so that if the following quantity, I call it alpha. Quality. I call it alpha. Alpha is the difference of the Q curvature of these two conformal metrics. So I write it in this way: Q1 times exponential 4W minus Q0 in L1 is less than epsilon 1. Then there exists a quasi-conformal and bidips map F going from the first metric G1 to G0. To g naught, okay, with a biliptious constant L, which is controlled by one plus constant times alpha, and the assertion is that this alpha depends only on the metric G naught. Okay, one remark: this Q curvature integral condition star, if you recall the Gauss Monnet formula, so on the fourth sphere, the Gauss Monnet is. Here, the Gauss Bonnet is 16 pi square. This quantity is equal to the integral of vial square, and then plus the integral of two times Q curvature. So this condition, integration of Q, is greater than or equal to zero, is the same as saying the vial L2 is smaller than 16 pi squared. That's a reasonably large range. Okay, so this. Okay, so this is the first result. And then to formulate the second result, I want to recall the Bach tensor. So Bach tensor is the following quantity, Bij in local coordinates. So it's the double divergence of the vial. Namely, you take vial Kijl and contract it with upper K and then upper L. Upper K and then upper L. And then you add to it one half of the contraction of Ricci. So Ricci upper KL against WKIJL. So in dimension four, block tensor is the gradient of the vial functional. And it is well known that this is the transmission rule for conformal change of the Bach tensor, namely Bach of the conformal change. Bach of the conformal change exponential 2w times g is exponential minus 2w times the original buck. Okay. So that if you do this carefully, then bug in L1 is conformally invariant. However, we make a non-conformally invariant assumption here for the second theorem. So now we So now we take G0 to be a Yamabi metric on a differentiable force sphere. Say Yamabi constant is positive. So remember, Yamabi means that it's the minimizer of the Yamabi quotient. And then we look at the following two quantities. So beta is the L2 of IO, and then gamma is And then gamma is Bach L2 instead of Bach L1. And the assertion is that there exists an epsilon law so that if beta is smaller than epsilon law, sorry, epsilon two, then this metric on S4 is bilipious to the canonical metric on S4 with a bilipious constant L2. Okay, so the biliptipus. Okay, so the bi-dimensional constant means that under this map, distance between x and y in the metric g ni zero is bounded above and below by this quantity involving L2. And then the assertion is that this number L2 is bounded by one plus the constant C prime times the product of gamma and beta. Okay, so here's So here's a remark. So, unfortunately, because Bach L2 is not conformally invariant, there's something unsatisfactory about this result. Currently, we don't know how to do it, so we leave it as an open problem, how you can possibly replace this by ba in L1. But anyway, the corollary. Uh, the corollary is the following. If you compose these two uh bilips map, then you get a you get a bilipich map from G1 metric. Remember that was the one conformal to the original G0, which was a Yamavi metric on a S4. And then from that Yamavi metric, using the second construction, you get a value. Using the second construction, you get a Bilipschius map. So the composition is a Bileupschus math from G1 to G canonical. And the Bilips constant can be controlled by 1 plus C1 alpha plus C2 beta. And the assertion here, of course, is that C1 depends on the conformal class of G, and C2, unfortunately, depends on the L2 norm of P of G0. Okay, so the Okay, so that's the result. So let me give you a little bit of background and information here. So this is actually the first result. Well, there are results earlier to this, but I don't have so much time, so I'll just mention the main one. So this is quite an interesting result by Bonk and Lange. And lang, and they say the following: suppose you have a metric on R2, and then the metric, well, it's a complete metric on R2, and if the positive part of the Gauss curvature integrate to strictly less than 2Ï€, then this metric is bilipsch to the standard metric on R2 with the bilips. With the bilips constant given by this expression. So we're assuming k minus is also integrable. So 2 pi plus integration of k minus over 2 pi minus integration of k plus. And this bound is actually sharp. And then the basic remark is that this 2 pi here is also sharp, namely, if you take the inf. Also sharp, namely, if you take the infinite cylinder, if you take the infinite cylinder here and cap it off by basically convex hemisphere, then obviously you don't have a biliptious constant because the circle here, as you push it out, has a uniformly bounded length. But on the other hand, the area here is increasing. So, this result was generalized by Bonk, Heinorman, and Soxman in 208. And their statement is the following. So they look at the Q curvature in R4. Actually, their result is general for all even dimensions, but only formulated for R4. So you have a conformal metric on R4 written as an exponential. Written as exponential 2w times the Euclidean metric. Then you can assert a Bigership equivalence if the total absolute value of Q curvature is smaller than some constant epsilon naught. This epsilon naught is not that small, but it's written down explicitly in their paper. And then this result. And then this result got an improvement by Yi Wang in 2005 that more or less going in the direction of the Balkan Lang result, namely, if the total curvature of Q plus is again strictly smaller than one half of the total Q curvature on the standard S4. And then the total, I mean, the Q minus part is also L1. Also, L1, that is finite. Then, there now, the result here is the following: then there is an isoparameter constant depending only on these two quantities. And the isoparam constant is reasonably sharp. However, she did not get a bilips constant that depends on only these two numbers, but she gets a bilips constant that depends on this particular metric G. This particular metric G. So that's the unsatisfactory part of this result. But let me make another comment. This Bonken Land result is really interesting. It's quite sharp. However, the proof is a bit unusual. The proof, their original proof, uses polyhedral approximation. But unfortunately, But unfortunately, in the middle of the proof, they reverted back to smooth approximation. So, somehow, there should be a reasonably nice elementary PDE proof of this result. I just point out this fact. It's such a nice result, so we should be able to find a more elementary proof. Okay, now the background. Now, the background of quasi-conformal maps. So, this is a basic work of Ryman following Alfors. So, Ryman's result is 1976. He studied quasi-conformal maps on Rn. And basically, what he did is to look at this, what we call the conformal strain tensor of our force. So, you have a vector field. So, you have a vector field on Rn V, define S of V by this formula. You basically take the derivative of V and then add to its adjoint, divide by two and subtract off the trace of D V times identity over N. So, the assertion is the following. Now, if V is a time-varying vector field on our Varying vector field on our n. And if this strain tensor S of V in sup norm for all points at all time is bounded by a constant, then the flow along V is quasi-conformal with quasi-conformal constant K, and K is bounded by exponential two times Ct. So this is the basic existing result that everyone uses in constructing. In constructing these classical maps. And this result has an analog for Riemannian manifold by Piers Showski. And he basically gave a definition for the conformal string tensor by doing the following. So S of V is the lead derivative of G in the direction V, and subtract off 1 over N divergence of V times G. Of V times G. And his basic assertion is that the Lyman theorem continues to hold in the setting. So technically, Piachowski's result assumes the vector field is smooth, but the observations that the same conclusion holds if V is in W11 of Sn for time-varying vector field defined on Sn cross. define an Sn cross the path line, then the flow F sub t if you solve for the sort of O D of this flow that is the root of F T in T is V of T applied F T with F of zero to be the identity. Then this is still okay. Okay, so let's see how much time I have. Okay, so Okay, so the big we need a couple of basic facts on quasi-conformal maps, and that is the following. The first map, the first fact is compactness. So W, if W is a sequence of K quasi-conform maps on Sn then there exists a point P on Sn so that either the sequence converged locally uniformly to a constant map. Only to a constant map on Sn minus P or to a K quasi-conformal map. There's a basic compactness result. I think due to Georgia lots of other people. And the second part is the following. Suppose F is a mapping between Riemannian manifold onto itself. If it's k quasi-conformal, If it's k quasi-conformal, and now suppose its Jacobian determinant is about the same order as exponential nw for some function w, then with respect to this conformal metric, this map is by Lipschitz with a constant depending only on k. So these are the key facts we use in doing these constructions. Okay, now for the input. Now for the input to that really make this construction work is that we need to understand the green function of the penis operator. So in earlier work of Gersky, Gersky, Marchiotti, and Fungboheim and myself, we know the following. Suppose that a four-manifold has positive Yamadi constant and the total Q curvature. And the total Q curvature and the Q curvature integral is now negative, then we know that the kernel of P consists of constants, and then the Green's function exists. His leading order term is a dimensional constant C times log of one over the distance in this metric between X and Y. And this is in terms of a good coordinate system, like the conformal normal coordinate system. And the error term. system and the error term h is smooth function and it's bound independent of x y okay so that's the key fact we use and so let me explain a little bit the idea of proof zero one so we follow a the basic argument of bunk heyuman and socksman we use this green function and we cook up an initial vector field v of x y just to just Just basically about the same as the Green's function of the Pennys operator times the vector x minus y. So, roughly what I'm saying here is that you take a coordinate system, you know, when x is close to y, and then we construct the spectral field as long as x is close to y, and you smooth it out by some other suitable choice. But the main point here is that we use something which nears. We use something which near the diagonal is controlled by the Green's function times the difference. Okay, and then for this vector field, you check the divergence of d is about n times the Green's function. And then the Alforce conformal strain tensor is bounded by some constant. So that's the initial step. And then the Wong Heinon Sachsman has an iteration. Taxman has an iteration procedure to successively change the vector field as you move in time, and then also construct each iteration of the classic conformal map. So it's a complicated construction, but let me just say so much. Okay, so now let me talk a little bit about the second theorem. About the second theorem almost out of time. So, second theorem is the following: the two important inequalities when you have the Yamadi constant is the following. First, this constant that determines the Yamadi constant. This is an inequality. And the second one, if you have a positive Yamavi metric on S4 with positive Yamavi constant, then we have these two inequalities. Namely, the one half of the tracer. Namely, the one-half the traces VCL2 is founded by ViL L2. And then 16 pi square minus integration of y L L2 times 24 is bounded by the Yamabi constant. So earlier work of Gursky that says if you have a positive Yamabi constant and vial L2 is small, then the Ricci flow converges to either the canonic. The canonical metric on S4 or the canonical metric on RT4. And then Eric Chen had the following result. He says, if you look at the asymptotically flat metric on R4 with positive, non-negative scalar curvature and y are small, then the Ricci flow converges to the Euclidean metric. So, Alice. So, Alice and Eric suitably modify this result and then put it on S4 to say that again, if Vial L2 is bounded by epsilon squared, and you look at the initial metric G of time, look at G of T, which is absolute vial plus absolute value of traces, and then plus scalar minus average of scalar. minus average of scalar, then this quantity in L infinity is bounded by this quantity here. Now the observation here is that for small t, g0 in L4 is needed. Actually what's really needed is G0 plus epsilon is needed. So to prove theorem two, it suffices to show that we can It suffices to show that we can control these L4 quantities of traceless Ricci and Vial. So we go back to the earlier equation that we studied when we prove our sphere theorem. We wrote the Bach tensor in this complicated form, and we use the Sobolev inequality to control the traceless VC in L4. Traceless VG in L4. So that's how you gain control on the traceless VG. And then you use another inequality that is, you look at the, I guess it's called the Yankee consequence of the Yankee. Then you get this identity for gradient of vile L2. And you can write that as this integral of divergence of Vile squared, 72 times determinant. 72 times determined by and then minus one half. So you use this one together with the Yankee, then you can control the violin F4. So you get this controlling violin F4, and then you use this earlier result of Chan and Eric Chan to get our conclusion. Okay, so. Okay, so the basic question here is: I say, can one replace Bob Tensor in L2 by BOP tensor in L1? And this will make the condition conformally varied. Okay, I think my time's up. So thank you for listening. Any question, remarks? I think the obvious question is why is only on four dimensions even Bonk's results is in n dimension at least for uneven well I think there's a analog of this result in S3 This result in S3. We haven't got it completely either the conformal S3 or the CRS3. CRS3 is like the conformal S4. But higher dimensions, even dimensions, probably doable as well. But you have to put in a lot of assumptions. So, you have to put in a lot of assumptions. So, any other question?
