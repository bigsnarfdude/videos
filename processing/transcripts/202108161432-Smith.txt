Okay, it's time for the second talk in this afternoon's session. The talk is by Simon Smith. Simon is known for his work on, in particular on the words of my mind. Anyway, but also for his But also for his construction of uncountably many non-isomorphic compactly generated simple groups. But he's not going to talk to us about that today. He's going to talk to us about groups acting on trees and the TITS independence property. Thank you, Simon. Thanks, George. Let me just check. Can people see my screen? Young Seth. Yeah, okay, cool. Um, yeah, well, thank you very much. Um, and uh, you know, thank you for attending and listening, and thank you for inviting me and all that. I'm going to talk about a kind of work with Colin Reed on a, it's like a local to global complement to Basseur theory. So it's not the same as Basé theory, but it, but it mirrors Basé theory in some really kind of In some really kind of interesting and I think quite beautiful ways. So, yeah, absolutely everything I say is joint work with Colin and all the best ideas of Colin's as well. So yeah, now it's probably a bit difficult to, yeah, there's a lot of things that I need to introduce because I want you to understand why we did it, why we needed to do it. Do it. And so, I'm going to give a kind of a little brief overarching overview. And then, if you get lost partway through the talk, then you can kind of hopefully keep track via that overview. So, first of all, the talk is about local actions of groups acting on two very different groups. Now, What about still thinking about action S3? What about the local action at some other vertex? So, w not equal to v, so let's let's take that to be our w. And so, there, the local action at w for this group, remember it's fixing v. So, what does it look like? Does it look like locally at W? Well, if we fix W, because that's what we're interested in, a stabilizer, what can we do to the neighbors of W? Well, they're all going to be fixed, aren't they? So the local action at W is just trivial. So there we've got a few different local actions. Now then. Well, then, what about looking for a different local action that's not that dissimilar to S3? So, let's think about local action C3. And here we're going to see some of the subtleties of what can happen with local actions. So, let's imagine a group G, that's a subgroup of the automophyson group of T3 that has all localized. That has all local actions C3. So, meaning that its local action at any given vertex is C3. Well, let's think about what happens. So, here's our tree again. How big can we make G? How close to ought T3 can G be? It turns out it can't be very close at all, and that's because our specified local actions kind of collide with each other in such a way as they restrict the structure of G. So, let's see why that is. So let's see why that is. Whoops. Sorry, that's okay. Let's see how that is. So it looks like there's quite a lag on my internet here. Let's see. Okay, hopefully that's going to be a bit faster. So let's. So let's see what happens. We want that the stabilizer of V in G induces C3 on its neighbors. But we also want the stabilizer of W to induce C3 on its neighbors. And let's think about what happens when we stabilize V and W. So here, So here, the stabilizer V induces C3 on its immediate neighbors. But if we're also fixing W, that means because it's regular, that means that we have to fix all of the neighbors. So all of the neighbors of V are restricted, are fixed by the stabilizer of V and W. But that same argument applies to the neighbors of W. Of W. So they're all fixed as well. But then, if all the neighbors of W are fixed, then we can, you know, look at the neighbors of the next vertex out and see that all of its neighbors are fixed and so on and so forth. And we end up seeing that all vertices in the tree are fixed. So the stabilizer of V and W, in fact, fixes every vertex in the tree. And so it's trivial, which means that the group is discrete. So G is very, very much smaller than ought T3, right? If you don't like thinking of discrete things, then yeah, like our G has finite vertex stabilizers, and of course, T3 has vertex stabilizers of cardinality 2 to the RF0. So yeah, so this local action that we chose was very, very restrictive. And so the moral Very, very restrictive, and so the moral here is that the choice of your local action can severely restrict your global behavior. Um, yeah, so this idea of kind of what getting the local action that you want and maintaining certain global properties is going to be a kind of theme throughout the talk and is one of the motivations for doing what we did. Let me turn my attention now. Let me turn my attention now. Just I'll go into more detail in a bit. This is still the overview, but let's look briefly at Basser theory. So the main tool for groups acting on trees is Basser theory. And it turns out that Basser theory is of limited use. And I'll explain why in a little bit, but it's of limited use when we're trying to construct the kinds of non-discrete groups that Of non-discrete groups that we want to when we're looking at the theory of locally compact groups. So this emergent idea of what might be called local to global universal groups, there's a sort of body of work that takes its inspiration from a 2000 paper of Mark Berger and Shah Moses. So, yeah, you might call it local to global universal groups. It's local to global universal groups. I'll talk some more about it in a bit. But it turns out this emergent idea is much more useful in these situations. And so what Colin and I have done is kind of try to do something that is akin to Baset theory, but for these kind of local to global constructions. And when I say akin to Basé theory, I mean it's very much the same. Theory, I mean, it's very much the same. Like Basseur theory, you code the group in a graph of groups, and then you've got this beautiful kind of circular property to it, which I'll talk about in a bit. And we do a similar thing. We create a combinatorial object called a local action diagram. And it also has this lovely kind of circular symmetry to it. And yeah. There's also the kind of foundational constructions in. Constructions in Baset theory are the HN extension and the amalgamated free product. And the foundational constructions in ours are the Berger-Moses universal group and the box product. And yeah, you will see when we talk about the local action diagrams of those structures that they look very similar to the graph of groups of the HNN extension and the amalgamated free product. Amalgamated free product. So that's where we're going, and that's what my talk will be about. Let me just briefly mention some conventions. So all my graphs are going to be in the sense of SER, meaning that there's loops and multiple edges. They're permitted. Every edge is going to be thought of as a pair of arcs, one in each direction. So an arc and its reverse will be denoted by. Will be denoted by a letter and a letter with a hat on. The only difference is that our loops may or may not equal their own reverse. There's a reason why we need this, and it's because the local action diagram is going to be built on top of a graph, and we need that graph to really contain a huge amount of information. And so we need all of these kind of multiple edges to encode that. Multiple edges to encode that. If you're thinking, hold on a minute, I thought this was going to be a talk about trees, and I like my graphs to be simple. Don't worry, trees, in the sense of SAR, have no loops or multiple edges, and they don't for us either. So we're talking about groups acting on trees where the trees are simple graphs. I'm going to be making various topological statements throughout the talk. I'm always going to be Throughout the talk, I'm always going to be saying things with respect to the permutation topology. If you don't know what that means, then it's just a natural topology on permutation groups that plays nicely with the permutational action. If you want a little more detail, it's a basis of open neighborhoods of the identity are point-wise stabilizers of finite subsets of the set being acted on. Um, and often, when you're looking and thinking of permutation groups as topological groups, we're interested mainly in closed subgroups. So, if you want an intuitive way of thinking of that, of thinking of that, okay, this is when the set being acted on is countable, this works perfectly. What you do is if you have a subgroup and you want to form its closure, you look at all convergent subgroups. Convergent subsequences of permutations, and you throw the limits in the subgroup as well, and then you end up with a closed subgroup. So you can't distinguish a subgroup and its closure from actions on finite subsets. So yeah, so hopefully that's enough of an intuitive picture. I'm going to do the subgroup symbol with a little C to mean closed subgroup or a little O to mean open subgroup. mean open subgroup so that that's kind of housekeeping let's look at uh groups acting on infinite trees then the main tool here is is basé theory so let me go into just a little more detail it's going to be a fast uh tour so basé theory uh essentially uh is built around this notion of a graph of groups which is a graph gamma that is coloured but instead of colors you you you're using you're using groups. You're using groups. So we decorate the vertices with groups called vertex groups. We decorate the arcs with groups. And the decoration of an arc is always equal to the decoration of its reverse. So it makes sense to call them edge groups rather than arc groups. And there's also a monomorphism that allows us to kind of see arc groups inside their own respective. Arc groups inside the respective vertex groups. But don't worry about that. So, the fundamental theorem of Passere theory is that if you've got a group acting on a tree without inversion, this can be modified so that it works with inversion, but yeah, it's neater this way. And inversion is just where the edge is reversed by the group. So, if we've got this group acting on a tree without inversion, there's two parts to There's two parts to the main theorem. One is a deconstruction and a decomposition. So, what that says is that you've got your group acting on your tree. You can form this kind of combinatorial object called a graph of groups that's associated to that action. And your group can be identified with the fundamental group of that graph of groups. So, how is this a decomposition? Well, you essentially, you know, you Well, you essentially, you know, you have your action by looking at the graph of groups. You end up with these vertex and edge groups, and the fundamental group construction tells you how to plug those all in together to get your original group back. So you kind of see how your original action is constituted from these vertex groups and edge groups. And then we have the constructive side of it, which is that if Which is that if instead of being handed a group, maybe you want to build a group. So you draw a graph of groups, its fundamental group acts on a tree. And this tree is obtained from the graph of groups in a natural way. And the action of that fundamental group on the tree is such that if you plug it through this first part, then the associated graph of groups is precisely the graph of groups you started with. So that's what I mean about this nice kind of With. So that's what I mean about this nice kind of circular logic to the theory. Now, just some quick remarks. So the decomposition largely works well when we use it for locally compact groups, but the construction is problematic. And the reason is that it's fair to say that when most non-linear constructions of compactly generated, simple, locally compact. Generated simple locally compact groups, use to some extent groups acting on trees. And when you're doing that, you're using the permutational action to keep track of the topology because you want to recover that topology. And so you care very much about the permutational behavior of what you're constructing. And this constructive mesh. Constructive method in Basse, you kind of lose track of it. It's because you sort of, in a kind of hand-wavy way, you need to know that a vertex, you need to know that the stabilizer you want is realized as a stabilizer in a group with the global behavior you want. You need to know that before you put it into Basseur theory in order to build a group. In order to build a group. But if you know that you've got a stabilizer that does what you want in a global group that does what you want, then you don't need Bastaire theory because you already know it. So that's a sort of hand-wavy explanation of what goes wrong. Let me try and give you a sort of a small example to a little bit more concrete. So let's imagine that you want to build a group acting on T3. Group acting on T3, and it's got two vertex orbits and some specific permutational representation for the vertex stabilizers. So let's, for example, take this, we want the stabilizer to be C2 with C3 at each vertex. And the action that I want for that is this one. So at any vertex V, I want it to act like C3 on the immediate neighbor. To act like C3 on the immediate neighbors, and then modulo that action, I want it to act like C2. Right, so this is this looks like a nice thing that might be a stabilizer in some group that I've just described. So how do we go about building it? Well, Basé theory tells us that we should take as our global group the amalgamated free product of a stabilizer of two adjacent vertices amalgamated over their intersection. Over there intersection. So that seems nice. But we've already seen earlier in the talk that this action is impossible. If we really did have this vertex stabilizer, it would be locally C3 at every vertex. And we know that we can't do that. So something's going wrong. And it's simply that we're just not getting, you know, usually goes wrong because you're either not getting an action on the tree that you originally wanted or you're. Tree that you originally wanted, or you're not getting the permutational representation that you thought you were going to get. So, yeah, the moral here is: like I said, if you want to use Basari to construct what you want, you kind of already need to know that it's going to work before you do it. Well, that's not very useful for building examples. But local to global instructions avoid this. And so, what Colin and I have What Colin and I have done is a kind of local to global complement to Baser theory. So, let me talk now about locally compact groups, because that's where this sort of comes up. So, Colin mentioned this class, this class S, of non-discrete, locally compact, compactly generated topologically simple groups. Some people also put totally disconnected in there, but some people put don't. Anyway, let's. Don't anyway, let's. We don't need totally disconnected here at the moment. So, yeah, so if you're not overly familiar with this, just think it's the kind of compactly generated is the sort of topological version of finitely generated. So you can, you know, we're interested in locally compact groups. Non-discrete just means not trivial from a topological point of view. And topologically simple means no closed, non-trivial proper normal subject. Closed non-trivial proper normal subgroups. So, this class kind of is a fundamental class in TDLC theory. And there's lots and lots of papers and work done in trying to understand this class. And groups acting on trees are the main source of examples of non-linear groups in S, right? Maybe with modifications here and there, but still in spirit, most of them are sort of in that vein. In that vein. So, let me give you a little bit of history about the discovery of non-linear groups. It looks like I'm going on an aside, but it'll loop back sharply to the main theme. So, I want to talk about something called the independence property P. So, Schachtitz in 1970 gave the first examples of non-linear, abstractly simple groups in S. And he did that via groups acting on trees to answer a question of SER. To answer a question of SER. So here's our friend T3. I'll kind of draw things on that. So T's result relies on this independence property. So for a group acting on T, what is the independence property? Well, you look at all finite and infinite paths in T. So there's one, which I've called Q. And you ask, does the pointwise stabilizer of that path act independently on all of the subtrees kind of down? On all of the subtrees kind of dangling off Q. Meaning, if the pointwise stabilizer of Q admits some kind of automorphism of this yellow subtree, can we pointwise stabilize the rest of the tree and still do that same permutation of the yellow subtree? If we can, then we say that there's independence for the path Q. That there's independence for the path q, and if we can say that for all possible choices for q, then we say g has the independence property p so tits theorem concerns this group G plus, which is the group generated by edge stabilizers in G. And the theorem says that if we've got an infinite tree and a group of automorphisms with property p, then as long as Then, as long as our group doesn't preserve any non-empty proper subtree or fix the end, then G plus is abstractly simple. It might be trivial, but it's abstractly simple. So that gives you an immediate corollary. So if Tn denotes the n regular or the n valent tree, then as long as n is at least three, then if you look at the automorphism group of the n regular tree, Automorphism group of the n-regular tree, you look at the subgroup generated by all the edge stabilizers, then that is a non-linear group in S. So yeah, I mean, Sarah already knew that it was topologically simple, but T's proof that it was abstractly simple. So that then, if you're interested in kind of generating lots of groups in S or maybe new examples in S, here's a kind of idea that might occur to you. Idea that might occur to you, but um, I say it's a flawed plan. I mean, conceivably, it might still work, but no one's managed to get it to work. Um, so what you could do is you could use Basé theory to find large, like as in non-dis subgroups of Tn with property P, and then apply the theorem. Um, but you know, as we've seen, in order to kind of get this non-discreetness and but Non-discreetness and but still making sure that you're a proper subgroup and keeping control of the group so that you're definitely getting interesting behavior. You then fall foul of this problem that we saw before where you kind of need control of the stabilizer, but then if you put that stabilizer through Bassettia, you lose control of the stabilizer and so on and so forth. So, yeah, the breakthrough came from. Came from this kind of local to global universal groups. So let me talk a little about that. So the first construction of this was due to Mark Bosher and Shaha Moses in 2000. What I'm going to do is give you two constructions kind of at the same time, and I'll build them at the same time because then you can see the symmetries between them. And they're the two foundational examples. Examples that play the same role as the H and N extension and the amalgamated free product in Bassett theory. So we start with two permutation groups. They actually don't need to be transitive, but the statements are cleaner with transitivity. So I'm going to put that in. M has degree little m and n has degree little n, but m and n can be infinite cardinals. Things are much more interesting when these are infinite groups. These are infinite groups. Right, so a group acting on the M regular tree, so the tree where every vertex has valency m, we say it's locally m if the local action of g at every vertex is permutationally isomorphic to m. So, I don't know, here's an example. If we pick any vertex we pick, if we always We pick if we always induce C3, then it's called locally C3. We've already seen that being locally C3 is very restrictive. Okay, the next piece of terminology I mean, and this I need, and this is the only other bit I need, is locally MN. So here, T Mn is the biregulatory. So every vertex has valency either M or N, depending on which part of the natural bipartition. Of the natural bipartition of the tree it's in. And we say that a group acting on that tree is locally Mn if it is locally M whenever, sorry, it's locally M at V whenever V is in the part of the bipartition that has freency, sorry, yeah, frequency M and is. And is locally n at w whenever w is in the part of the bipartition that has valency n. Right, so that sounds like a mouthful, but actually, if you think about it, it's quite natural. Here's a bi-regular tree, valency 4, 3. So if every time, and there's the bipartition drawn. So every time we look at G as local action at a blue vertex, if we get C3. If we get C3, and every time we look at its local action at a red vertex, we get D4, then that is a locally C3D4 group. Okay, so that's just two pieces of terminology. Now, two theorems. So the first is the sort of construction of the Berger-Moses universal group, and the second is the box product, which is some. The box product, which is sometimes written m box n, if you're interested in the permutational group, but it doesn't really matter here because we're thinking about topological groups and they're the same topologically. So, right, the first the Berger-Moses' theorem is that there's a universal locally M subgroup of O T M. They denote U of M. So, what does that mean? It means I'm saying universal in that it has the universal. Saying universal in that it has the universal property. Any locally M subgroup of OT M can be found up to permutational isomorphism can be found inside U of M. So it is the universal locally M group. And this box product U M N, which is a generalization of this, there's a similar statement. There's a universal low There's a universal locally Mn subgroup of OR T MN that's universal in the same way. It contains a permutationally isomorphic copy of every locally MN group. And what else do these groups have? They both have property P, independence property P, and they have this universal property that I just mentioned. The Berserker Moses universal group has a simple subgroup of index two. A simple subgroup of index two generated by vertex stabilizers, so you can use it to easily generate lots of simple groups in S. U of Mn, the box product, is simple whenever M and N are generated by point stabilizers. So, for example, if they're both primitive but not regular. So, again, you get lots of simple groups out of it. So, I think it's fair to say that the majority of new constructions of non-linear groups Constructions of non-linear groups in S have used the ideas of Tietzenberger and Moses. And so, yeah, that's it's very important construction. The box product construction was used to prove the size of S up to isomorphism as being two to the LF null. Right, let me talk now then about the theory of local action diagrams. Uh, the theory of local action diagrams. So, I'm not going to write local action diagram every time, I'm going to just write LADS in that sort of funny font. Um, it's analogous to Basé theory, but for local actions, it gives us a way of completely describing and classifying closed subgroups of all T with property P. So, this is why I said it would come back to include property P. So, we get a complete classification of groups with property P, and if they're closed, then we also get a complete description. Then we also get a complete description. It turns out that they're precisely universal groups of our local action diagrams. So, whenever we have a group that's closed with property P, I'm going to call it P closed. So let me describe what it is. So a local action diagram is like a graph of groups. It's a graph, some colors, and some groups. And they obey certain properties, right? obey certain properties right so uh they consist of a connected graph gamma so here's a an example um remember our edges are decomposed into arcs in each direction for every arc we have a non-empty set called the the colour set of a um so here i've drawn in the the colours so here are the colours of a um colours of b now here i've kind of put something strange i've I've kind of put something strange. I've got the colors of the reverse of A are precisely the vertices of the trivalent tree. That's important because by putting color classes that have structure in there, you get to embed complicated groups as vertex groups, as we'll see in a second. Sorry, I'm not sure quite why my app keeps crashing. So, yeah, for every vertex in the local action diagram. In the local action diagram, we have a vertex group that we call the local action of V. It's not, it doesn't do the same thing as a vertex group in Basé theory, but you can think of it that way. And it's got the following properties. So yeah, here are kind of two examples that fit with this construction. So you can kind of follow along there. The properties are that you derive You derive the color set of V from the arc colours of arcs leaving V. And then this, well, let me draw on the diagram what those are just to make it clear. So there we've got the colours of the arcs leaving V. So the colour set of V is there, the colour set of W is there. Is there. So you can kind of see what's happening. Let's go back to the local action diagram now. The local action at V is a subgroup of permutations of the colors of V, and it has to be closed. And the decomposition of the local action at V on the colors of V. Colors of V are precise into orbits are precisely the arc colors. So you can kind of think of these arc colors as being a decomposition of the vertex colors into orbits, if you like. And that's it. So it's just a little kind of combinatorial widget that encodes these kind of local actions. There's a concept of amorphisms of local action diagrams. Imorphisms of local action diagrams, and it's precisely what you would probably write down if you had 10 minutes and tried to think about it. So it's an isomorphism of graphs that plays nicely with the local actions. So here's our theorem. There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of local action diagrams and isomorphism classes of pairs, a tree. Of pairs, a tree and a group, where the group is a closed group of automorphisms of the tree with property P, i.e., it's a P-closed group. So this is what the classification theorem is, right? They're completely classified by these local action diagrams. These local action diagrams. Right, so let's then look at an outline of the argument. The local action diagram delta gives rise to an arc-coloured tree, which we call a delta tree. So I'll just kind of flick through this so that you can don't worry about following too closely, but just to get a sense of how it's done. To get a sense of how it's done. This is particularly for those people that have read the Berjer Moses paper and the box product construction, because you'll kind of see what we're doing with this. So we've got our delta and we've got some arc colors. And so there's our local action diagram. Let me just draw in the arc colours so we can see them because it makes it easy to see how we draw the delta tree. The delta tree is just a colouring map taking the arcs of the tree. Taking the arcs of the tree to the arc colours and a projection map from the tree onto the local action diagram. And so here, down here, I'll start drawing the tree. This V1 projects onto V. So at every vertex, you look at all the arcs coming out of it, and which I haven't drawn in yet, but I will do in a second, and they have to be. And they have to be colored in such a way that they're in bijective correspondence with the arc colors of the arc leaving V in the local action diagram, where the arc is the one that corresponds to the arc leaving V1 in the tree. So, I don't know, it's going to be easy if I just show you with this example. So, here we've only got two classes of arcs, so all the arcs leaving. Of arcs. So all the arcs leaving V1 are going to project onto A, and there's three colors for A. So we just draw those three colors coming out. We've got a bijective correspondence. Now we don't care about the reverse colours. So they can be chosen arbitrarily as long as they correspond to the colour classes of arcs coming in. So it could be green or purple there. So let's choose one and do it for the others. One and do it for the others, and now we kind of carry on. Now we draw arcs out of our WIs, and they need to be in bijective correspondence with green and purple. But at each of those WIs, we've already chosen one of the colors, so the other is forced on us. And then again, we don't care about the reverse colors, we can pick arbitrarily, and we keep going, and then eventually we've got a tree, right? Eventually, we've got a tree, right? And it's an arc-colored tree. And all of those kinds of arbitrary decisions we made don't matter, it turns out, because we just get isomorphic delta trees. So that's the first ingredient. The second ingredient is we define a universal group. And again, those of you that are familiar with the Birge-Moses universal group or the box product construction will kind of see what we're doing. Hopefully. From this very quick tour, so we look at those automorphisms of the tree that play nicely with the projection map. So we've got our local action diagram, we've got our tree, we're defining a universal group, we're considering automorphisms that lie in this kind of this subgroup of OT. So here's the local action diagram. So here's the local action diagram again. Here's a bit of the tree. What we do is we look at automorphisms in that subgroup. We see what they do to this little subtree here. And so here V1 is being mapped to G of V1. And then we simply go through the arcs. And then we simply go through the arcs and we say, well, here, this arc is mapped to here. What color was it? Okay, what colour is its image? So it was yellow. Now it's red. So the local action of G at V is sending yellow to red. And similarly, it's sending red to blue and it's sending blue to yellow. Blue to yellow, right? And that gives you a permutation of the color class of the colours of V. And so then you simply say that this permutation we're thinking of lies in the universal group if and only if locally at every V it lies in by this kind of construction, it lies in the appropriate vertex local action of the local action diagram. Local action diagram. So that's it. So you simply check, it turns out that the choice of t doesn't matter. And so we can talk about the universal group. And the third ingredient, I won't really go into any details with, but it turns out that if you've got a tree and a group acting on that tree, then there's a local action diagram associated to it. And you can then kind of color T so that it becomes a delta tree T. And how do we do that? Well, you just pick represent. How do we do that? Well, you just pick representative vertices in the tree and use their arcs to color as colors in the local action diagram. So here's the theorem again. Now, how are we going to use these kind of these three ingredients? So these are the three ingredients. Every local action diagram gives us an art color tree. Once we've got the local action diagram and the art color tree, we can define a universal group. Reversal group. And if we've got a group acting on a tree, we've got an associated local action diagram whose associated tree is the tree that was originally stated in the action. So then you can kind of start investigating the local action diagram associated to the universal group is the local action diagram you started with up to isomorphism. The universal group of local action diagram is a closed subgroup. Diagram is a closed subgroup of the automorphism group of the underlying tree and it has T independence property P. And if you've got any group acting a group of automorphisms of T with associated local action diagram delta, then up to permutational isomorphism, you can find G inside the universal group of delta. Another way of saying that is that if you've got a group that is locally like delta, then G. Then G sits in up to isomorphism sits inside the universal group of delta. So it's precisely this universal property we were talking about before. And you have equality if and only if G is closed with property P, meaning that G is a P closed group. So this is how we get this correspondence. These groups here are precisely the Here are precisely the universal groups of local action diagrams. The universal group of the local action diagram is like the fundamental group of the graph of groups in Bassett theory. So just a couple of final remarks. All possible local action diagrams of RISE. So you can just draw whatever you like. As long as it fits those simple rules, then you end up with a universal group. The two most important The two most important, the two foundational examples are the Berger-Moses framework. It's the local action diagram, it's just a single vertex with a set of loops, each of which is its own reverse. Well, think of the graph of groups of an H and N extension. It's just a single vertex. The local action diagram of the box product framework is two vertices with no loops, but with an edge between them. Well, the Them well, the graph of groups of an amalgamated free product is two vertices with an edge between them. So, this is what I mean about them being the kind of foundational constructions. And then finally, there's lots of properties of the group. If you've got a group with property P and it's closed subgroup of the automorphism group of T, then many of its properties can be read directly from delta, from the local action diagram. And this is really a lot of This is really a lot of um this really is uh Colin's uh very good ideas. Uh, this one is my favorite. You can see proper non-empty invariant subtrees and fixed ends of G as combinatorial structures inside the local action diagram. And remember that that's what you need in Tietz's theorem in order to deduce the simplicity of G plus. And you can easily also see. And you can easily also see whether G plus is trivial or not in the local action diagram. So, what that means is you can look at a local action diagram and deduce simplicity from it simply by looking at its combinatorial properties. So, thank you very much. If you're interested in reading more, this is Bojer Moses' initial paper. This is mine and Collins' preprint that is a little out of date now, but you'll get the gist of it from there. Gist of it from there. There'll be an updated one soon that's very much revised. This is the box product construction. And this is a preprint, recent preprint by Stefan, where he kind of takes this idea of local to global universal group, but instead of looking at the one ball, he's looking at the k ball as k gets bigger. So this is a lovely paper I just kind of wanted to mention there. So yeah, that's it. Thank you very much. So, yeah, that's it. Thank you very much.
