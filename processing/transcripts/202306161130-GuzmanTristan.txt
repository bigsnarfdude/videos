Thanks to the organizer for this opportunity. So I'm going to talk about work in progress. We joined with Mario Udabe, Fabiola Manjaris, and Enrique Ramirez. And it is about genus 1 non-normal spiber nuts. So let's So let me start with some definitions about non-almost fibered knot. So it has to be with knocked exterior decomposition. So if you start with a knock in S3 and take a regular neighborhood of it and a cipher surface in the exterior, you You can consider a tree manifold as follows defined as the exterior of K minus the interior of a regular neighborhood of the cipher surface. So this tree manifold has three boundary components. Two of them are copies of the Of them are copies of the cipher surface and an annulus between them joining them. And this tree manifold with boundary has a Hagar splitting, a generalized Hagar splitting, where you start with the side first surface, then you attach some one handles and you get a compression body. Get a compression body whose boundary is another surface, and then you attach some two handles to obtain again the copy of the cipher surface you start with. If the Higher splitting is weakly reducible, which which means that you have a compression disc, disjoint compression disc on both sides of the Hagar surface. Then you can change the position of one handles and two handles, similarly to the work of Charlemann and Thompson to obtain a head. To obtain a Hagar decomposition as follows. Here you start with the cipher surface. You attach some one handles to get a compression body whose boundary is a cipher surface. After that, you attach some two handles to Handles to get a thinner surface, a cipher surface, and then you attach again one handles and so on. And the peculiarity of this decomposition is that the thick surfaces are weakly incompressible, which means that. That compression disks on both sides intersect. Now, by identifying the copies of the cipher surface we start with, we get a circular decomposition of the exterior of the note. This is a picture of Um where here we I put the cipher surface cross the interval then you attach some one handles to get a boundary who is a cipher surface of genus bigger than we call the thick surfaces. Thick surfaces, and then we attach some two handles to get as boundary another surface of lower genus and so on. So now we are going to define some complexity in this kind of decompositions. We use the definition of complexity of a surface. So if you have a sphere, if you have a surface different from a sphere, you define the complexity as two times the genus minus one. If it has If it has a boundary, we first cap its boundary with disks and define its complexity as the sum of each component of the surface if it is not connected. Now you order the you take a circular You take a circular decomposition of the node and you order the complexity of all the thick surfaces and in non-increasing order and compare two of these multi-sets with the order lexicographically and the circular width of the The circular width of the noted serior is defined as the minimal circular width of all possible circular decomposition for the note exterior. So we say that the exterior of K is in circular imposition if it realizes the circular width of the composition. When we don't have six surfaces in the circular thin position, we can conclude that our knot is fiber. So the exterior look like a product of the cipher surface with S1. And in this case, the circular width is zero. The circular width is zero. If you get a cipher surface thick in this circular imposition of the knot, we will say that our knot is almost fiber. So this is an schematic picture. You have one cipher surface, attach some one handles to. Attach some one handle to get a thick surface and then two handles to get again the cipher surface we start with. And when the circular width has two or more numbers, we say that the not is not almost Is not almost non-onmost fibered, not so Fabiola Manjaris proved in 2009 the following theorem. If the exterior of the knot is in circular thin position, then the thin surfaces are incompressible in the exterior of K. In the exterior of K and the thick surfaces are weakly incompressible, which means that the surfaces are compressible to both sides and the compression digs always intersects. As a corollary, we have that if we have a not We have a knot which is not almost fibered. Then this knot has to have at least two disjoint non-isotopic incompressible cipher surface. Because if we look at this decomposition, if we have a non-ulmus fiber node, Non-olmos fiber node, that means that we have at least two thick surfaces which correspond also to at least two thin surfaces. By the theorem of Fabiola, these surfaces are incompressible, but also non-parallel. Infinitely many examples of almost fiber nodes are known. And our goal is to construct a family of hyperbolic genus 1 and non-almost fiber nodes. So, a central idea is this remark. So, suppose So suppose you have a genus one surface with one boundary component and consider the product of this surface with the interval and take an annulus on the surface whose current is an essential curve in the torus. Then take a Take this annulus cross I, which is a solisturus, solistorus, and remove it from this product. So we are going to replace this solistorus with another solistorus in such a way that the annulus here Annulus here glues to an annulus here, which goes around twice or more times this solid torus. So it can be shown that we get a genus II handle body under this construction. Now, I will describe the construction of the family of knots. Suppose you have a knot with these properties. There are cipher surfaces in the exterior of the node, all of them of genus one that are. One that are not non-isotopic. In this picture, we are thinking in these T ice surfaces and the region between two of them are genus two-handed bodies as constructed as in the remark and the previous remark. And under this construction, we have that the core of the annuli in one of these pieces intersect in one point the annuli of the next piece. Well, the theory. The theorem is that there exists an infinite family of hyperbolic nodes, which depends on these three parameters and satisfies all of these properties. So, here I show you three diagrams. Each one represents one family. One family parametrized with M, L, and N. Each box means that you consider horizontal crossings according to the number we have in each box. If you as you can note, As you can note, the node L and the node K prime are trivial. So if we consider the double branches covered along the not L, we will get S tree and the family of our The family of our interest is the per-image of this K prime under this double cover, double branched cover. I put these families on this order because we started with constructing this family in a previous paper and In a previous paper, and currently we are working with these two families of nodes. So, note that if we consider this red disk, they live to a cipher surface for the note we for the family of notes we are considering. Of notes we are considering, and these cipher surfaces are of genus one and they are non-isotopic because we have here in this region these crossings that doesn't permit that the product decomposition. Composition. We note that in the first family, we have four known isotopic genus I cipher surfaces, and the second family has three of these cipher surfaces, and the last one has five. five cipher surface of minimal genus genus that are non-isotopic and in fact there is a result of luis valdez who says that on a genus one hyperbolic note on the exterior of a genus one hyperbolic not you has at most Has at most five ciphered surfaces of this type. I mean which are genus one and no parallel to each other. If we sort of these diagrams, we get another We get another decomposition of the exterior where we can find these surfaces, the pretimes of this disc are cipher surfaces, but the difference is that this green disc leaves to a genus to cipher surfaces. So we can see that the exterior of the node The exterior of the node decomposed first by passing through a genus one cipher surface and then we arrive to a genus two and then come back to a genus one cipher surface and then to a cipher surface of genus two. That means that in the intermedial steps Intermedial steps. We have to put here one handle and then a two handle and then one handle to get the composition of the exterior of this family. And similar for this family, in this case, we find two siphons. We find two ciphered genus II surfaces. And in the last case, we find three different genus II cipher surfaces. So we arrive that this family of notes has with has a decomposition with width tree tree and in this case And in this case, also. And the last case, we have the composition of width 3, 3, 3, given by these thick surfaces, green thick surfaces. So in order to construct to arrive to almost fiber nodes, we are going to We are going to prove that, in fact, this is the width of these families of knots. This is the main theorem that there exists an infinite family of genus 1 hyperbolic nodes, which are not non-almost fibered. And this is the sketch of the proof. Of the proof, we just constructed this family of nodes, which depends on three parameters. And we have seen that they have genus one cipher surfaces in their exteriors, which admits a circular decomposition of with tree tree or in the line. Or in the last case, 3-3-3. So suppose that they are almost fiber, then their exterior admits a circular decomposition of lower width. The only case to decrease the width in this case is to have the composition of width tree. And the way we can get a lower width of this in this case is, for example, a width of 33. In the first case, when we have a width 3, we can get a picture like this, where we start with a genus. Start with a genus one cipher surface. We attach one handle and get a cipher surface of genus two and then attach just one two handle to obtain the cipher surface we start with again. And for this width tree tree, we can similar Similar picture, but here we have two thick surfaces. In order to get a contradiction, we consider these thick surfaces, thick surface, and intersect with the union of tori. Of tori in the exterior of the nut. And by a work of Schultens, this intersection consists of simple closed curves that are essential on both sigma and in the tori. We want to see how We want to see how this tori divides the surface sigma, what kind of pieces we get. So we need some lemmas to discard some cases. And these lemmas are that we get the node constructed like this is hyperbolic. Like this is hyperbolic. And between two tori, we have just five kind of annuli properly embedded in this genus two-handle body. We also have that there are no incompressible There are no incompressible annulu whose boundary lies in two adjacent regions because we can isotop to lie just in one piece of these handled bodies. And the last lemma is that the exterior cannot contain another Contain another cipher surface of genus 1, non-isotopic to the considered. And the idea of the proof, for example, here I have the composition of the serial of the node, which has four non-parallel. Four non-parallel cipher surfaces of genus one, and we are supposing that it has the composition like this of with tree. And we said that the thick surface is divided into pieces by this thorai. By this story, so the kind of pieces are thanks to the lemma are like this. We have just six cases and to arrive to a contradiction, we analyze each of these cases. In the case of with 33, where we have this decomposition and five non-parallel incompressible cipher surface, genus one, we can assume that the thick surfaces lies on just one of the region. One of the regions like this, because this thin surface divides the exterior into regions and the thick surfaces like each one on these pieces. So, to arrive to a contradiction in this case, we just look at this This uh this piece which is this case where we have uh just three non-parallel cipher surface of minimal genus and we get in the in a similar way uh this uh division of the Division of the pixel phases. Now we are in the process of discarding all these cases. And I think that's all I can say. So thank you so much. Are there any questions? Are there any questions? Thank you. That was very interesting. Is it possible to have a situation where it's not almost fibered, is genus one, but the other thin surface. Other thin surfaces aren't genus one. So you have like the genus one surface, and then the other thin surfaces aren't genus one. Or, because like in all of your examples, all the thin surfaces are these disjoint genus one surfaces. Could it be the case that you have only one genus one surfaces? One genus, one surface, and then the others are higher genus? Oh, I'm not really sure. So, you mean just one thin surface of genus one and Maybe I don't know, right? Yeah, that could maybe happen. Can you have right, yeah, the ones you've created, right? Yeah, no, which is great. I like that. No, which is great. I like that. Can you could it also be the case that you have other, like you have multiple genus one cipher surfaces, but they're not disjoint from each other? Or is there some or does it like follow from Jennifer's work that maybe if you have multiple genus one ciphered surfaces, you have multiple ones that are disjoint? Well, I think if you are considered a thin position, the thin surfaces have to be disjoint, but not in general. But could you have could you have like five? Please, I don't know if I first saw it, but um because my memory of my cache groups complex is connected is like. Is by like a minimal surface for phase. So maybe like you have Venus one surfaces, you can create a Venus one surface. I don't know if you can hear them. Thank you, listening. Thank you. Hi, is there any other question? Sorry, um, hi Rosalie. Um, hi, Roseline. Hi, I have a question. So, I understand that there is another version of team position, circular team position by a couple of students from Davis. Is that right? I was wondering, like recent ones, I was wondering, like, does any change, yeah, is that notion like, I don't understand this a little bit different, but like, are all your computations like, can you say anything about this other one? I don't know that the composition you see another kind of team position. Please, please, Jennifer, I don't know if you can correct me. This is student of Abby recent ones. They introduced another one. So I was wondering if, you know, the numbers might change slightly, but if you can still compute anything in that one. In that one. Well, maybe we can talk later, but I was just wondering. Okay. Okay, then no more question. Okay, then let's thank the speaker again. Thank you. So this was the final talk of the Gorcho.
