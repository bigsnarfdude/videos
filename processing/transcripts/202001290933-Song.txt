Give me this opportunity to speak here. Today I will talk about twisted effect models. And this work is collaborated with Agnov Prime, Chen Jie Huang, and Professor Martin Delgado. Okay. So uh th uh th th there are two main motivations for the study of fractal phases. One is from the condensed matter field, that is to look for interesting gap to quantum phases beyond the conventional topological quantum field theory. And now we have many interesting models. Many interesting models, and now the problem is we don't know how to classify and how to organize them. And the other main motivation for fracton models is from the quantum information community. This community is trying to look for self-error correcting quantum memories. Right now, Quantum memories. Right now, all these models cannot fully realize the self-error correct memories. The fracon models roughly can be divided into two groups, type 1 and type 2. In type 1, the fractons are created by membrane operators, and in type 2, they are created by Type 2, they are created by operator with fractal geometry. So the defining characteristic of fractal order is there are excitations with restricted mobility. So in all these models, there exist some there exist some intrinsically immobile excitations called fractons. They cannot move as a whole without creating additional excitations. In this talk, I will focus only on type 1. In type 1, there are also excitations called, now people like to call them lion-ons and plan-ons, and there are excitations. Excitations mobile in one or two directions. And another feature of fractal orders that is quite different from standard topological order is their ground state degeneracy grows self-extensively with the system size. To see how these properties may happen, Properties may happen. Let me briefly review one of the simplest examples. And because later I will use this example as a start point for generalizations. So this model is called the checkbox model. It is proposed in 2016 and it is a stabilizer Hamiltonian. The stabilizer Hamilton means it can be written as commuting polygroup operators. Each operator is a product of poly operators and they commute with each other. So the model is exactly solvable and the ground state is specified by the common eigenvalue. And the ground state of this model, three torus is growth like two to the power of six minus six. It's sub-extensive. That means the system is a gap to fix. Okay, and yeah, we have claimed this is a fractal model, so let's see. This is a fractal model, so let's see how the excitation of this model. So suppose this is the ground state of the model, and we apply a sigma x operator here. It will create four excitations, and I apply more poly operators. Polyoperators, we can change the position of the excitations. Apply more, we'll get some configuration like this. The excitations will be separate from each other. And the interesting thing is we can never create a single excitation each time. And the excitations are not created as the end of a string operator or created locally. It is created as a corner of a membrane operator. So that's already strange, and that implies the excitation cannot move by itself. And this is a type 1 fractal model. So it also has lion-on and plan-on excitations. So for example, we can pair the two excitations together and they will be It will be possible to travel along one direction. So it is a line. And it's and if we pair these two excitations together and then they can move Yeah, they can move in two directions, so it's a line. So it's a plan. So we also noticed this excitation. Also, notice this excitation is kind of abelian in some sense. So, suppose we consider the system with an open boundary, and then the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian can be labeled by just a common eigenvalue of the A and B operators. And because it's an open boundary, because we put the model in an open boundary, Put the model in an open boundary, so this common eigenvalues specify a unique state. And even we make some excitations like this, so some excitation configurations like this, the ground state is the state is still unique. So when we try to break them in some way, there's always a phase factor. So there's no way to. So there's no way to get non-cummulative gradients. So our pro so as condensed matter theorists, after play with models like this, a natural question is to ask what are the possibilities of fractal orders and how to describe and classify them. And classify them. But so the examples we know are still limited. There are many possibilities and not explored. So the first step towards this goal maybe is just to construct more exactly software models. And another way to think about this problem is because there are many Because there are many similarities between fraction order and topological order. So, like their ground states are locally indistinguishable. For type 1, there are even more similarities because the plans are just like anions. So, because the similarities, naturally, we want to know whether the notions in topological order whether the notions in topological orders has counterparts in the fract uh in the fractal orders. So another main focus of my talk another main focus is to understand the notion of non-believers, whether it's Billion is whether it's there's a reasonable to talk about it in fraction in fractional order and to clarify what's the meaning and to characterize if such order exists to characterize how to characterize them. So basically I finished the motivation and this is the man outline. Is the outline. So, first, I will sketch the two basic steps to construct the twist-different flex model in general. Then, I will work out an example to write down the Hamiltonian in polyoperators and to give a complete list of the quasi-particles and study its breeding properties. And I also calculate And I also calculate the ground state degeneracy of this phase. Through these solutions, I could show that there exists a non-believable phase and try to introduce some basic notions to classify and clarify this the notion of non-believing fractal phase. Okay. So uh the generalization uh I will mm uh do the generalization based on the checkbox checkboard model because I have just introduced but the construction is uh is uh i uh uh the the the construction can be applied to uh j generic type one fracture uh models. On models. Okay. So the first step is straightforward. It's just going to generalize the group from Z2 to any finite abelian group. So to do this step, we just need to be careful about the sign. So here I assign alternate alternate uh uh vertices pattern for the uh checkbox uh checkbox lattice and the A operator can be understand as a generalized gate transformation it just translates the uh translates the each vertex by a group element and there's also a generalized flux operator it's uh it's an alternate It's an alternate summation of the group elements because it's an alternate summation and this is a uniform transformation. So these two operators commute. And the Hamptonian just require the system is charged and flux-free. But right now, it's very hard to generalize the group to a non-believing case because A non-believing case because the generalized gate transformations that I done at the corners of the system. So it's not a string. It does not act on ends of strings. So it cannot be commuted if the group is non-viding. So that's why we developed this trick to make the theory non-blooded. To make the theory non-villian. So we add to the generalized gate transformation an additional phase factor. Then the phase factor is determined by a mathematical object called three cocycles and general and the gate field configuration near near the where the Where the gauge transformation X. Okay, so this construction is motivated by the digravatant topological gauge field. So let's make a little review of this theory. So first the three cosycles is just a function from From some number of group elements to the U1 phase factor. And the function will call our cosycle if we satisfy cosycle condition. So for now, we just remember it is just a function and takes a value in u1. So and this is a so But different co-cycles are not necessarily equivalent to each other. There's some equivalence here, but it does not matter much in the construction step. So for 2D lattice gauge theory, square lattice, we want to add a phase factor to the factor to the gate transformation. We need to triangulate the lattice. We need to first triangulate the lattice. And because we will focus only on the flat gate field configuration, so doing this triangulation doesn't add more degree of freedoms. Of freedoms. And the phase vector can be presented geometrically like this, and it can be defined as a product of tetrahedrons. And each tetrahedron is just a phase factor assigned by the cocycle. And the cocycle condition geometrically means the phase factor assigned to 3D body. 3D body is independent of its triangulations. So that cosycle condition ensures that these two operators will commute with each other. But this is only valid on the flat configuration, gauge configurations. When there will be some non-trivial flux, the gate transformation will become The gate transformation will become projective. That's why the anions are labeled by the representation of twisted quantum double. And we will use this group and this record cycle for 2D gauge field, and this theory will be non-believer. Non-believing, the flux will naturally carry charges. Okay, so now we go back to our go back to our construction. So now we look at a single layer of the checkup model. So like the The layer of cubes cut it by the orient plan. And if we from a flat gauge field configuration of this system, we can get a flat configuration for a 2D system by doing this difference, the difference between the top and the bottom of this layer of cubes. And the generalized gate transformation is The gate transformation the effect it flips the spins is just like gate transformation for the has the same effects for as gate transformation for the 2D system. So it's natural to add a phase factor associated with a light in the 2D lattice gauge theory. Gauge theory. And in general, by adding such a phase factor, we say that we twist this layer of the system. And in general, we can twist each layer. So for the generalized gate transformation, we can twist the layer below it, above it, on its left, on its right, in the front and on the back. On the back. So in general, there will be six phase factors here. Okay, now maybe this is still too big or too abstract. Now we may work out some example. So as we said, we will work on this group. This is straight copy of D2. And the straight code cycle has this form. And G1, G2, G3 has. G1, G2, G3 are the three coordinates of the group elements. And we also mentioned that the gate transformation will behave not so nicely when the flux is not trivial. So we just put a projector required that the field configuration is flat near the That near some cube for the gate transformation. And we just replace the general gate transformation by someone, only acts on the flat, locally flat configuration to make everything well-behaved. And the Hamiltonian just requires that the ground state is invariant on all gate transformations. And And there will be some fixed factors associated with the gate transformation. So the field configuration will be flipped by the poly operator. This is its first component because we only this operator flipped the first component. And uh there are some phase factors kind of kind of like uh control the operator. So control the operator. So it depends on the for this gate transformation associated with this cube, it will have some fixed factor depends on the field configuration on this cube. So yeah, it's not so bad yeah there that's a There's some details about try to now we try to classify all the topological charges of our quasi-particle. So the idea is we remove all the Hamiltonian terms inside a cube and we want to ask what are all the possible excitations inside this cube. Excitations inside this cube. And it can be by analogy to the twisted gate theory, it's naturally to expect this result. And it is derived in our paper. So it is listed by for each layer, we need a group flux and some representation for the labeling how it transforms under the gate. How it transforms under the gate transformation. So yeah, basically for each layer we have a topological charge. And the representation is maybe projective of it may be a projective representation of the gauge group because the twisted factor. And when And when the layer is twisted and the flux is non-zero, the representation has dimension two. Yeah, I will explain the physical meaning of this representation later. Okay, from this, after labeling the generic excitation by charts, we can see many things. First, we can relate the top-lower chart with mobilities. Mobilities. So the topological charts associated with the K layer of the K layer can be detected by bringing some excitation around it along the XY planes. That implies if the quoted particle is movable in the Z direction, Direction. This topologic chart has to be trivial because you can move it from the third direction, then the breeding process is just like breeding nothing here. Yeah. So in this terminology, so we relate to topological tasks with We relate the topological charts with excitations. And so, and in mobile excitation, we can have a picture like this. We have some non-trivial topological arch in each direction and fuse them together. We will get the excitation that has non-trivial topological arch in each direction. It's mobile, but this is just a But this is just a trivial immobile excitation. So, a fractal, precisely, a fracture should be defined as intrinsically immobile. That means it cannot be a fusion result of any mobile excitations. That implies it cannot be created at the end of several string operators. That means it has to that that means it has to be created by an operator has dimension greater than one and in in this language so a single flux excitation in a checkable model is it's easy to see is a flux home because any mobile excitation has to validate even number of flux Even number of flux. It should have an even number of flux violations. I will try to so right just now we have some representations and they have some dimensions. Actually, this dimension can be interpreted as a quantum dimension and it can be mirrored physically. So suppose we start with a So suppose we start with a state like this, we create from ground state by some membrane operator or some operator supporting the gray region and it may create some factors at the corners. Then we make it possible because the topological chart along the Z direction can be mirrored by breaking process along the Z plane. The Z plan. So we can have a trajectory that requires the Z topological chart is zero. And then the dimension is just the average of this project operator. Okay. Every excitation with quantum dimension greater one has to be. Dimension greater one has to be associated with some non-violent gradients. This is something standard, I think, in 2D as well. How much time do you have? Eight minutes. Eight minutes, okay. Uh yeah, e May maybe maybe uh I don't ex explain this in detail. Explain this in detail. But another simple way to see that we have non-abelian excitations is like this. We just create some non-trivial flux in this system and we breed it like in this way. After breeding, we find we cannot fuse back to vacuum anymore if we will leave a curve charge in the end. If the system is twisted along this Twisted along this layer. Yeah, but right now we have fractals and we have a non-believer. But is that enough to say that we have some new non-believing fractal phase? Probably not, because there's a very trivial case to get non-believed fractions just adding some non-believer anion system onto the abelian fractions. To the Belian fraction system. So, to get rid of the trivial case, we propose that we should characterize this new phase by something called inextricably non-believing phase. So, a fractal is called, a lion is called inextricably non-believing if its quantum dimension cannot be. Its quantum dimension cannot get reduced to one by fuse with particles with high mobility. So that means an inextricably non-abelian frectron cannot be a fusion result of abelian anion with some non-abelian mobile quasi-particles. And for lions, it means it cannot be an abelian lion fused with some non-abelian. With some non-believion anions of third-dimensional topologic charge. Okay, but inextricably non-abelian fracton can fuse with some anion lion and we will get inextricably non-abelian lion. So in general, we can imagine two kind of non-abelian fraction phase. One is with One is with both fractal and the lions inextricably non-believing. And another type of non-believer basis, it only contains inextricably non-believed ions. Now it's very easy to see that our system is Is a new kind of phase. Suppose our system, our checkbox model is twisted in each layer, maybe each X layer. Every violation of flux will carry some high-dimensional representation, and it has quantum dimension greater than one, and it's non-believing. billion and and we will have if we consider the single violation of flux we will notice it can never be made a billion reduced the point dimension to one because every mobile mobile excitation must have even number of flux violations and the single flux violation cannot be removed. Okay. Then uh but if we don't uh twist the system in each layer, we just twist half of the layers. So we twist the system alternatively. So suppose we only twist the gold plants, then this violation of flux will carry some high dimension. Of flux will carry some high-dimensional representation, it's a non-elium, but it can be reduced to a billion flux by a fuse with 1D particle. That means in such a system, we don't have any strip with non-villian fraction here, but But we can prove that such a 1D particle, the lion is actually inextricably non-belian. So the face is still non-belian. But if we twist even less layers, then uh there's no There's no intracible non-believing particles, so the system is not non-believing generically. And I conjecture that it is equivalent to billion fractional phase plus some 2D non-believing layers. And this also has hints in the ground state degeneracy. So for a billion cases, it's just like this. It's just like this. And for non-believing case, if we twist only a few layers, the ground state generality is like this. And it's just like some type of some 2D non-believer layers and some 2D abelian layers. But if we twist it half of the system, we get a very good ground state. Very real ground state degeneracy, it does not still have the layer structure anymore. If we twist all layers, all three layers, we get even complicated ground state genes. Actually, it doesn't look like it can factorize into different systems. So, this is the summary. So, this is the outlook. So, we have a very a lot of models in the twisted way. In the twisted way. So next we may want to classify them. And first we need to develop a sense. And also its ground speed young is so weird. So if we want to do entanglement renormalization, I don't know how to get a scalable factorization for such phases. And right now we only focus on type 1 fractal model. So another natural question. Another natural question is to ask: what about the type 2 fractal models? Yeah, that's what. Thank you. So for the, let's just say for the twisted XQ models, is there any relation to, are these equivalent to or related to the models you would get if you took an X uh if you took a okay, sorry, so the XQ model is a gauged uh plaqueizing model. Gauged placidizing model. And so if you took a non-trivial SSPT of that form and then gauged it, is that what these models are? I didn't try, but I expect there are some relations, but because the gate process because this is the most efficient way to guess the model. Efficient way to guess the models, but the gauging process, there's extra steps. I didn't do that. I mean, instead of just taking models because they have a BLM gauge structure and ungauging them, that will give you some model of symmetry type of. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That will be an interesting question. Because in in in in the sym uh subsystem symmetry system there's also also weak and strong uh SPTs. W what happens when you gauge it? What happens when you gauge it? Is there a relation between the non-abelianness of the fusion rules and the non-abelianness of appropriately defined breaking? Yeah, yeah, there's a page I skipped. There's a slide. This slide just proves that quantum dimension greater than one implies it must be involved in some non-commutative readings. So we consider a state like this. So you create excitations from ground state with the actual charged excitation like this. And we consider two gradients. A is exchange of the middle two excitations. Of the middle two excitations. And B is some radiant process that can detect different charges of particles, the fusion result of particle 3 and 4. So if it's non-bladion, so if we do B first, because 3 and 4 must have a trivial chart, so B breath trivially. So AB equals AB. AB equals A. But if we do the breeding in the other order, we do A first and then do B. Then after the exchange of 2 and 3, then the total charge of 3 and 4 is indefinite. So then breed B cannot be equal to A anymore. So A just shows you have a non-commutative breed. Understate. So before you twist, say in the Z2Q model, know how to do a local unitary time twist to some XQR beats, right? Because it's just checkable. It's like copies of checkabot model. Before twisting. Before twisting. Before twisting. Yeah, but in an untwisted Z2 cube, checkabot model, you can have just like six copies of X cube, right? XQR. Oh, yeah, yeah. So then get twisted kind of couples this. But on the execute side, is it just coupling the different XQ files together? Yeah. Yeah, maybe. Alright, let's take cow again.
