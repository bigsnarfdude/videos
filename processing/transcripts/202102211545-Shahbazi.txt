And also he is editor-in-chief of the AMS Inclusion Exclusion Blog. Orion supports two of the best cats in the world and loves to sing. Maybe at some point we can ask him to sing for us. And we have Susan Rofsky. We have Susan Drufsky that brings experience in a number of fields to bear in an innovative and interdisciplinary approach to mathematics education and environmental education and curriculum theory. She holds degrees in languages and linguistics as well as mathematics education and worked for 12 years in film production, eight years in adult education, including workplace and labor education, and nine years in high school. Education and nine years high school teacher at Vancouver School. Suzanne has been involved in interdisciplinary research and teaching involving embodied arts-based mathematics education, garden-based environmental education, applied linguistics and film. And also, she speaks several languages and is an active musician with Tidelik of Morris. I hope I pronounced that correctly. Correctly. So, for the panel, I'm going to type questions that I have, and I share those questions with the panel members ahead. And you can see those questions. But please feel free to type your own questions or raise your questions. These are my kind of maybe narrow questions that we talk, and they might not be that Be that relevant to some of the panel members, and it might be relevant to others. So, these are the questions that I'm going to read and then ask our panel members to provide us comments or their thoughts about that. So, and they are also typed in the chat for you. Which approaches do you implement in your courses to bring research and teaching together through using educational and art tools or models? And art tools or models? What differences do you recognize in your students' learning and attitude when concepts are explained in an illustrative way by employing physical or arts tools? What action could we as educators take to elevate public understanding and interest in mathematical developments? What actions may hinder this? And my final question is: access Is accessible pedagogy of mathematics. I call that APM, this is the word that I invented, hopefully it makes sense, can refer to the practice of communicating research, recent research developments in mathematics with public through us. What benefits do you think APM could have not only for us, but also for our students and for the academia and the society? So, these are questions. So, these are questions that I thought, and I can ask our panel members to start each one of them with 10 minutes and just share us their perspective about these questions. And maybe we can start with Henry. Sure, yeah. So, let's start with the first question. You know, how do you bring arts into teaching education? Teaching education. So I've taken a very sort of specific route in that. And there are other people who have done different things, and I can't say so much to how they do things. But maybe I'll just briefly share screen and show you some slides from a different talk, which I give. And this is a small section where I talk about the course that I run. So I run a course that's sort of, it's something like geometry and algorithms. It's something like geometry and algorithms in 3D modeling here at Oklahoma State. And it's run in the math department. And we have a 3D printing lab, which is currently full of extra desks and chairs, which can't be used for social distancing reasons. So I'm running the course right now, but we're doing it in a sort of online version. But the idea is that students learn how to use the 3D software. To use the 3D software that I and many other people use to make our 3D designs. And they learn how to use 3D prints. This is the lab. And these are some of the things from the, I think it's the fourth week homework. So they've learned how to write little pieces of code to generate parametric curves in space, and then they 3D print these out. And then it's a project-based course where they end up producing mathematical art, essentially. Art essentially, fractals and all kinds of cool stuff. Like, you know, they learn about one group learned about L systems. This is about Kepler's equal area in equal time of orbits and illustrating this with a sort of a bathtub with different sections of the same volume and something like this. And this one is sort of a Fourier series. Sort of Fourier series. Maybe I can play this just real quick. So it's a 3D model that illustrates adding more and more terms to your Fourier series. So the way that I run this, it's a separate course. It's not attaching something to an existing course. I do try and do a little bit of that in my, like in teaching calculus three or something like that. But it's essentially, it's a separate course. Separate course, um, let me stop sharing maybe, um, which is uh, you know, giving students the, you know, in a project-based course, they've got the freedom to go out and explore something and take ownership of it and create something. And my experience is that, you know, they get a lot out of that kind of, you know, they have the freedom to explore things and get into real trouble, you know, the real life problems that come from doing. Real life problems that come from doing projects are often much more interesting and much more real and much more difficult than the cookie cutter things that solve with whatever you did in the class a week ago. So that's the sort of strategy I've taken. I mean, it's, you know, I should mention the prerequisites are pretty high. It's like, you know, you need to have done multivariable calculus, so you know about vectors and curves, and you need to have done linear algebra so you can. Linear algebra, so you can program transformations. Other people, people like Laura Talman, has done a lot of work, David Bachmann also, with people with less background. So that's what I've done, and I could talk more later about what I think the pluses and minuses are. Let me try and touch on a couple of these other questions. Okay, what differences do I recognize in my students' learning and attitude? So, this is a little different. So, this is a little different again because I'm not necessarily trying to teach them a standard piece of a curriculum and then say, look at this artistic application. I'm saying, you're going to do the artistic application. And there's a big motivation there. So, I don't know how effective it is to do it within a standard course. I haven't done that myself, so I can't speak to that. Myself, so I can't speak to that. Elevating public understanding and interest in mathematical developments. I mean, yeah, like you know, one of the descriptions of what people in pure math do is you're writing a kind of very rigorous poetry for an audience of 50 other people worldwide. And somehow we've managed to get paid to do this. I don't know how this happened, but it's obviously a good idea to. idea to make other, you know, the public aware of what it is that we do. I think mathematics has a better go of things than many of the humanities. Like in today's era of austerity, people will come around and look for, well, can we cut that department? Can we cut that department? And mathematics has a shield of impenetrable, well, it's really complicated and I don't understand it, so it must be. Really complicated, and I don't understand it, so it must be good. But we shouldn't rely on that. We should, you know, try and get people to see that mathematics is useful, but also, you know, valuable in its own right. And just as we should value the humanities, the beauty in mathematics is much easier to get across to people if you can do it in a way which doesn't require that they take a graduate course in the subject first. So, I mean, I think it's obviously very important. I guess I've answered the fourth question is there. I've answered the fourth question, is there as well? And maybe I've gone on for about 10 minutes. So maybe I should let somebody else say something. I think you're muted. Susan, do you want to share because you have technique? Sure, and thanks. It's really great to hear what you're doing. Of course, it looks really helpful. Because I'm mostly teaching either pre-service teachers, sort of, you know, they're getting ready to become secondary math teachers, and they've just finished a degree in mathematics and or computer science and or physics. And then I also teach graduate courses to people who mostly are already teaching mathematics somewhere, whether from anywhere from preschool through K to 12 through secondary and post-secondary. I'm post-secondary. So, one of the things that I've done, I know Mara Alargic talked about a similar project that she does in classes, but in my first math methods course, as they call it, that I teach to the new secondary teachers, I give them their very first project when they first arrive in the program is to do a math art project related to bridges, math and art. Math and art. So I'll just, oh dear, where did it go? Sorry, I've just got to just find the right screen to share again. But I can just sort of show you how I frame it for them. There we go. So, and I used to do it sort of about two-thirds of the way through the course, and I found it was too late because many came in kind of thinking that what they have to do when they're teaching is exactly what was done with them when they were math. Done with them when they were math learners, which is have you know very teacher-centered lectures that are very technical and it doesn't necessarily reach their students. So I make this the first major assignment for the course. I've got some images here from the most recent galleries from Bridges Math and Art. So they form groups of three. They go to the Bridges Math and Art Art Gallery online for the summer just preceding. The summer just preceding, so you can take a look at that yourself. And each group chooses one of the works of mathematical art that appeals to them and that has a mathematical topic that they think they can understand. And then they're asked to, for one thing, get in touch with the artist, because the artist is a living person who just made this piece of artwork. And they can get in touch with the person or people by email, and they'll often get an answer and have a conversation. And they'll often get an answer and have a conversation with the artist to talk about the work. Their first job is to reverse engineer it so they can reproduce their own version of the work just to understand how it works mathematically and artistically. And then as teachers to extend the mathematical and artistic ideas to some new levels in some new way. And then to design a way they could take the ideas to teach in their own classroom. And then they have to do a brief interactive activity with their classmates that With your classmates, that lets them try out this idea. And so then they get 15 to 20 minutes to present and all that kind of stuff. So you can see the ones that were done this year. There were quite a few of really interesting artworks from Bridges that they chose. And what I found, and then at the end of the course, I have the students write a reflection about the whole course. And inevitably, I mean, like 80-90% of the students Of the students say this really changed my ideas of what teaching mathematics would be. And it really made me opened up all kinds of possibilities. Like I never thought that math could be connected with dance. I never thought that math could be connected with needlework. I never thought that math could be connected with sculpture. And by doing it right at the very start, they're kind of shocked and they're also, but because they've got to do the assignment. But because they've got to do the assignment to become a teacher, well, then they do it. And it really sets the tone for everything else. So I'm just going to put a link here to, this is a little film that I made that was also in Bridges. This is just a direct YouTube link to it. It's called New Math Teachers Riff on Kandinsky and Binary, which was a piece of artwork from something like 2016 Bridges. And we actually made a film because this group of students did such an amazing job of Students did such an amazing job of turning this into an educational activity, extending it into something about binary numbers, but they extended into other bases and so on. It was very interesting. I want to look at the fourth of the questions on the list and the idea about reaching out to the general public. We have a cabin on a little island near here called Hornby Island, quite a beautiful place. Island, quite a beautiful place. It has about a thousand people who live there year-round. And something I've noticed is there are quite a few mathematical artists on this island, including a modern dancer named Sarah Chase that I've made a film with about her number theory dances and so on. They're sculptors, they're poets, and so on. But there's also a huge number of, you know, a great percentage of that thousand people are very math averse. And as soon as they hear the word math, And as soon as they hear the word math, they start backing away and you know being really upset. So I'm planning a project, I'm trying to get some funding for it, called Hornby Island of Math and Art. It's a very artistic island. Almost everybody does the arts, and yet so many people are quite averse to mathematics. And so I've already started, even before the funding has come through, I've started to do work with colleagues and grad students on the island. And grad students on the island around well, the idea is that each we do say a five-year project on the island, and each year we'll take on a different kind of mathematical art connection and explore it, extend it, and get people from all, not just the kids in the school, but people of all generations. So, like the idea of like the preschoolers up to the 90-year-olds for sure, and get everybody involved. And it'll be something that the idea. And it'll be something that the islanders identify as an interest. So the very first thing people were, I mean, a number of people came to me and said, this is really what we want to do, was exploring the idea of labyrinths. And so I started to learn about mathematical labyrinths. And it's already starting to take off as an idea. And there are three different sites that people want to build, different kinds of mathematical labyrinths. There are sand beaches where we can track them out in the sand and so on and experiment. Sand and so on, and experiment. There's a maker lab where we can do CNC routed versions of finger labyrinths. There's actually a museum of finger labyrinths just on Vancouver Island, which is not too far away. So we could actually visit this incredible museum of finger labyrinths. So as you start to learn about these things, they open up and you find out there are many, many people involved in this. And by exploring it with the whole community, Exploring it with the whole community, there's a way of, I think, getting community members. Not if they say, well, this is mathematics, and we start to explore mathematical patterning and generalizations through it, some will get more into the mathematical side, some will be more into the sort of meditative side of labyrinths and so on. But I think all aspects of it are potentially interesting. And then there are a lot of, there's a whole poets guild on the island, and so the idea of doing The island, and so the idea of doing mathematical poetry. There's a theater group, and there are many potters, and painters, and jewelry makers, and every kind of art that you could imagine happening on the island. So, and there's a recycling depot that has lots of materials that we could reuse. So, there, there's, so I'm really excited, like, even just beginning, like, just kind of putting my toe in the water here and kind of getting people started with doing this kind of thing. Started with doing this kind of work has already hyped up the idea of mathematics and the arts being connected. Oh, yes, at the Bethlehem Center. Thank you, Parker. That's exactly the place. So it's near Nanaimo, which is not very far away from Hornby Island. So, and one of my biggest hopes is that when you take the ferry to this little island, there's a kind of a hippie-looking sign from the 1970s that says Hornby Island, kind of handwritten. 70s that says Hornby Island, kind of handwritten. And I wanted, for at least a year or so, have underneath it say, Island of Math and Art. And to give the island a reputation for being a place of math and art, too. So I'll stop there and let other people have time to talk. Very interesting. Brian, yes. Excellent. Hello, everyone. I'm Brian RBK. Like the other two panelists, I am interested. I am interested in changing beliefs about mathematics, and I think geometry is a and visual elements of math are particularly fruitful domain in which to do that. I'm going to get kind of philosophical for a couple of minutes, but I think it's sort of interesting to think about what is math and what is art. For me, art happens in the conscious interpretation. The conscious interpretation, or maybe the conscious intention of creation of a thing, but it doesn't exist in the objects. So it exists in the act of maybe seeing an object and making meaning out of it. And similarly, I sort of, this is sort of a pithy thing I say to my students, sometimes I believe in stuff, but not things. And what I mean by that is I sort of like accept that like matter exists on sort of Like matter exists on sort of you know faith. I like I accept that that's there, but I don't think there are things. The things, like, they aren't objects until they're made sense of from the perspective of a conscious observer. And what I think mathematics is, is the ability, well, I think one big element of mathematics is the sort of ability to move between a particular object and the sort of a category in which it lives, right? That sort of Lives, right, that sort of move between the concrete and the sort of structural relationships. And lots of other disciplines use this. But as a result of both of these, I think of both math and art as sort of like consequences of consciousness and that everyone should have access to them as humans. That doesn't mean everyone should do them all the time or love them. And there definitely is, you know, history of which, you know, how we do particular things. I'm not saying there's nothing there but being. There's nothing there but being human. And certainly, there are systems of oppression that use mathematics or that exclude people from mathematics. But I do think that sort of that intellectual move is sort of fundamental to our humanity. And I think one of the ways that math and art are different, this is probably painting with way too broad a brush, is in math, we pretend our objects are their definitions. And in art, in many ways, we pretend that the objects are. Pretend that the objects are ins, what's the word from good omens? Not inscrutable. I forgot, I lost the word. Basically, ineffable. Yes. That we, and so in many ways, that's kind of like the digital and analog divide, where the sort of like it, it's been totally discretized into exactly this, or it has so much richness in it, and that any attempt. In it, and that any attempt to discretize it loses a little something. And so, I think that's actually, and that comes up a lot in geometry. And so, I think that distinction is at play in both disciplines and is really useful in terms of this work of changing people's beliefs. So, what kinds of things do I work on with students? I work with future teachers like Susan, and I'm particularly interested in changing the ways they believe, what they believe about the nature of mathematical truth. So, since we're sharing something. Since we're sharing some things, I'll share. Sorry, my cats are fighting with each other, sadly. Kittens, stop it. Can you see the screen? Great. So these are two concept maps. Sorry, hold on one second. Kittens, stop it. Stop it. These are two concept maps. These are two concept maps from my modern geometry class, and they are taken from the first and last day from the same student. I gave them a bunch of terms and asked them to organize them into a concept map and connect them. If we look at this first one, she says, mathematical truth introduces undefined terms, definitions, and examples, which provide intuition, decidability, logic needed for, there's a lot here, and time is tight. So showing consistency, which produces theorems, correlates. Consistency, which produces theorems, corollaries, lemmas, and axioms. So, when I've asked mathematicians to look at these, overwhelmingly they say, I have no idea what those arrows mean. And there's some things here that concern me. For example, that axioms and lemmas and theorems and corollaries are sisters, right? Those should be different in terms of mathematical truth. And so, this is the pre-course map, and this is the same student from the end. It's three separate pages, but I glued them together. Glued them together. So, mathematical truth: first, we have ideas. From these, we assume definitions, intuitions, and axioms, yay. And through logic, rigor, and persistence, we can use constructions and examples to make conjectures. Then we can apply a type of evaluation where we use decidability, contradiction, and deduction, only to find out that we still have undefined terms. So, this was several years ago. She felt that undefined terms was a negative rather than sort of the way that Hilbert used it as a positive. Like, you didn't have to use your intuition. A positive, like you didn't have to use your intuition about the term. So, I have subsequently modified the course to make sure that idea gets delved into more deeply. So, we test it again and look for consistency in our results. And if that is true, we have formed theorems, corollaries, and lemmas, the ones that should be sisters from my perspective. And then we have proof that there's such a thing as mathematical truth. Yay! And when I've asked mathematicians about the post-course maps, they're like, yes, these make sense. I understand these. There's a couple of terms, like undefined terms that I disagree with, but I can see how a student is thinking. Disagree with, but I can see how a student is thinking about those in very particular ways. The students, when they looked at these, noted things that they were often much more cyclic or iterative, like the process of mathematics came out for them. And a few other interesting things came out from the results. So what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to really make them think about how mathematics works and what mathematical truth is. Most of them end up with something like Kant's synthetic a priori truths. Synthetic a priori truths. They want axioms to be true, and therefore, geometry is true. The result of it is true. And some of them are more like me relativists, where for me, mathematical truth is closer to like dream truth, where there can be like things that are true in a dream and there can be consequences from that, but that doesn't mean that the truth in the dream generalizes beyond the dream. It requires a dream to even talk about that kind of thing. That kind of thing. And there's, I do lots of things in the course. We, I mean, we read about Girdle and a few other things, but I think there's some particularly geometric and artsy type things that really help. One is Geogebra. We do a lot of constructions in Geogebra, and the problem with drawing a triangle is it's a particular triangle. And my definition of math was that you sort of move between the particular object and the category it's in. And GeoGebra is really powerful. And GeoGebra is really powerful because you can make your constructions dynamic. And it builds in the ways that the constructions are dependent on the previous steps of the construction. And it also allows you to check that your work still, that your claim still sort of makes sense for a wide family of them, even if you can't check from that, that's all of them. And another really big one for me is we use a very unusual. For me, is we use a very unusual axiom system in my modern geometry course. My sort of assertion there is that for my teachers, what they're going to have to do is they're going to have to listen to a child's thinking, take some of their ideas as axioms, reorganize the whole system of geometry and build from that, you know, every three minutes in class. So we better practice reorganizing our geometry, our axiomatic system in that way. And so And so we don't measure angles for a really long time. And as a result, they're desperate to prove that all right angles are congruent. And there's this brilliant picture that we finally get to where they're trying to prove that if an angle, that is it, an angle that is congruent to a right angle is a right angle. Which sounds ridiculous, but because we don't know right angles in there. But because we don't know right angles and their supplements are that we don't know all right angles are congruent, what we have to use is sort of like using supplements and all kinds of other things. So the one they know is a right angle, they draw as a right angle, and the one they don't, they draw like this, but they know a congruence. And for me, that picture shows that they know how to think about the epistemology really carefully, right? They believe it's a right angle. They're trying to prove that it's a right angle, but they've drawn it in a way where it doesn't look like it. It in a way where it doesn't look like it, and so they're being very careful about what they know and what they don't know. And then we go on, and like the most impactful day of the whole term is they try to construct a square and they can't do it. They just like they, and despite the fact that the materials we use, it says right next to this task, you're not going to be able to do this. You're going to need another axiom. They never notice that sentence. It's like right there. And as a result, oh, and then we use something like non-Euclid, that just. Something like non-Euclid that jar, the whole JavaScript thing, that where we can show that all of the axioms we have assumed so far are true, that their constructions produce generally rhombi or something that doesn't close up, depending on which of the constructions of the square. And then as a result, they have to accept that they need another axiom to specify away from this system. And as a result, axioms become artifacts of human choice rather than. Choice rather than sort of like truths. And so that's a really powerful day in my class. And just to sort of like to tie it back to the last question, I don't know if you've been on Twitter over the last year and a half, but there's a lot of white supremacists who scream at people of color to say two plus two equals four. And what the heck is going on here? What's going on is that there's What's going on is that there's this idea in our society that mathematics is the measuring stick of objectivity against which all other knowledge should be compared, and that any attempt to view mathematics differently than that is, you know, ridiculous nonsense and corrupting it in some way. And as a result, they're trying to use that idea to sort of silence other conversations about the way that math and art are. Math and art are done by human groups, and then to use that to sort of silence other parts of the conversation. Sarah Hottinger in her book, Inventing the Mathematician, has even argued that this vision of mathematics is central to the Western construction of the rational objective individual, which is sort of like one of the core prerequisites for some of the white supremacist ideologies. And so, just to sort of tie it back at the very end to Sort of tie it back at the very end to Susan's points: like, I'm trying to convince teachers to help offer a different vision for math to children so that they don't have these same sort of traumatic experiences. And I think the interaction between geometry and the visual arts is really key for how I help support those teachers. So, sorry if that was more than 10 minutes. No, wonderful. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Do we have other questions that you can ask from Henry, Susan, and Roya? Comments, questions? I have a few questions myself. So for you, Henry, so you were talking about this three-dimensional lab that you have, Henry? So is this So, is this related to a specific course? And then, which is this, and which program? How many students are you working with? Could you just say more details about the lab is there for a particular course? I mean, it's also available if students have projects outside of a course, but it's for a particular course, which is a sort of upper-level undergraduate course. And I mean, the But I mean, the and I sort of capitaled maybe 15 students. And part of the reason for that is that part of a project-based course is they're going to be doing presentations to the rest of the class. And with 15 students, it's going to take two class periods to get through. So it's just like, it just takes a long time to do. And I need to go around and talk to everybody. So, I mean, it is pretty sort of faculty intentional. Faculty intensive in some sense. But I mean, yeah, like I said, I mean, other people have done things involving 3D printing, which at other levels, and it does, you know, it gets people thinking about geometry in a way where they have to get it right in order to make their thing. And therefore, they have to actually get it right rather than who cares, it's on an exam. It's gone. How do you guide the students to create or print something in your assignment? Do you have some guidelines? I mean, I demonstrate things in class, but there's also, you know, the assignments are sort of carefully chosen. The first assignment is just get used to the software, make a cool castle, right? Like, not 3-printed or anything like that, just make a castle. And people know what a castle looks like, and they've got building blocks, and they're moving them around and whatever. And then the second one is, you know. Whatever. And then the second one is, you know, here's a pretty simple, like a like, draw your initial, extrude it, make a keyring. And so it's sort of, you know, I know it'll print easily and they're very, very step-by-step instructions. And then you just, you keep going. Now you add in the next thing. Well, now with this piece of code, you can make an interesting curve given a mathematical expression. And you build up their skulls over time through the homeworks and then the projects. Time through the homeworks and then the projects, you say, Okay, well, you know how to do this and you know how to do this, so now you can do some project with this. And of course, they have to learn more in order to do that. Primarily, yes. So, what I do is I, this was an important later addition that I added was that I want to have an official graded part of it to be like a, what do I call it? It's sort of like a project proposal. Sort of like a project proposal. So the you know, maybe the whole thing is two weeks long, and you know, the last day will be presentations. The first day is, you know, come to me with some sort of idea based on what the in the briefs, the brief of the project, the first one is very, is pretty specific. It says, you know, make me a, make me a goblet that contains 100 milliliters of liquid, and the shape should have some interesting mathematics, and you should be doing some calculation to figure out the volume. Be doing some calculation to figure out the volume. So, lots of volumes of revolutions, but also other things. And then it gets more generic later on, and I want to give them more freedom to find things. So, they're coming to me with their proposal on the first day, and they need to have thought about something. And then we've already got the conversation. Oh, that's interesting. Have you thought about this? How can we make this a bit more mathematical? Oh, that's really interesting. Oh, that sounds really hard. And then we're off. So, yeah. Have you noticed that there are no Having noticed that there are, you know, out of this project and this assignment, there are questions that the students come up with those questions which are interesting and kind of new for you and for them to do it. It happens, yeah. I mean, right, I showed the Fourier series thing and I never thought of that. And somebody just, they're just doing their goblets like the past week. And nobody had before this just. Try doing well. If you've got some simple shape, but then you shear it, it doesn't change the volume. Nobody had ever done that. I hadn't thought of that. And it's like, oh, you could, so you can make a goblet that's just like a cone, but then you make it wavy or something, and the volume is still going to be the same. So I haven't seen the presentation yet, so I don't know how well they did. But I mean, you know, that's a surprise. They're like, oh, you can do that as well. Yeah, it's great. Yes, interesting. Henry, you had a question. Yes, I did. So, my question is: unfortunately, I haven't really taught classes in the way that the three of you have: say, Susan really engaging and involving with artists and Henry with manufacturing and Brian with the philosophy component. And I'm curious, has the pandemic given you new ways that you think you might improve your class even after the pandemic if things return closer to usual? So for me, Return closer to usual. So, for me, one way I would think my teaching will adjust afterwards is really trying to subdivide a class into shorter segments that are a little bit more digestible for students, as you might try to do in a video class. So, I'm curious your thoughts, teaching very different types of classes than I've been able to experiment with yet. Shall I s I I guess I can say something um I guess I can say something. I mean, well, so this, there's since we're not actually 3D printing things, it's made me think about other things you can do. Sort of like, you know, there's this sort of visual programming language that's built into Rhino, and you can move sliders and stuff happens, right? The shape changes, you're changing the parameters of something. And so maybe the product is not just a 3D print, but maybe it's, you know, like imagine a museum exhibit. A museum exhibit where you get to pull this knob and something happens, and it's illustrating something about the math. So, I'm hoping that some students will take that direction. And that's something that I will want to continue after the pandemic as well. Just getting some props here. One thing that I do in my classes when we're face-to-face is we talk about embodied learning. We talk about embodied learning and we actually do making while we're doing it. So, here's, for example, some kinds of rope you can make out of different kinds of leaves or out of rags and things like that. And here's a net bag that you can, it's really interesting. It's something called Turkish lace. I don't know, you can't really see the pattern of it very clearly here, but it's kind of concentric pattern, rosette kind of pattern. And these are all things you can just make with very, very few materials. So I'd done it in my classes. So, I'd done it in my classes for the last few years, this kind of hand-making, and also seven-strand braiding, and gotten into teaching people how to do multi-strand braiding. And I thought, well, how am I going to manage this with everything being online? But one thing, I'm also involved with a teaching and learning garden on campus called the Orchard Garden. And we were only allowed to have four people in the garden at a time by the university's COVID protocols, but we managed to have four shifts of But we managed to have four shifts of four of my students plant a food forest. We're starting to plant a food forest in the garden. So we got some money and we were planting these fruit and nut trees and berry bushes. And so on the day where I had like 16 students come through out of my 20-something students, I had these day lily leaves that I had been saving up in the garage and I could hand, well just like put past on a bench to each of them a bundle for them and other people went and you know collected And other people went and collected their own leaves and stuff. And then we had a class, like a three-hour class, where we were all doing rope making while we had the class, or we were making Turkish lace or we were doing seven-strand braiding. And the really interesting thing, too, is that one of my students had grown up in a farming community in northern India. And as she was doing this, memories came flooding back to her about how people would make rope there in the fields from straw. There in the fields from straw. So it'd be one person twisting and one person sort of feeding me bundles of straw fibrin. And so she found us a little YouTube video right away and we all watched it. And then it came back to me. She said, oh, I learned how to make a bed out of rope. There's a traditional craft in the Punjab where people would do this kind of really interesting geometrical stringing of this handmade rope to support a mattress. And so she found us information about that so we could share it right on the spot. Share it right on the spot while we were using our hands and we were discussing an article, and we were, you know, we were doing other activities. So, there were, and sometimes like being in the online class where we could do breakout rooms and stuff was in some ways more in person than in person in a certain way. Like, we could work in small groups, we could have discussions, and we could, I don't know, somehow there was something really positive. There's something really positive about it all. So, anyway, so I'll try to keep those elements happening when we're in actual class. And yeah, they were really good. I think a lot about authority in my classroom and making sure that sort of students are constructing knowledge together. So, for many years, I've really emphasized synthesis and co-construction kinds of things for the big assessment. Instruction kinds of things for the big assessments. Like, in a lot of my courses, the students write a small textbook together over the course of the term, and that transitioned quite well to remote teaching because they were sort of, especially in the middle of the term, they were already used to after class contributing something to a sort of a shared digital repository. I'm struggling with, so I've built partially because I've changed institutional context and partially because of the pandemic. Context and partially because of the pandemic, I've been trying to make sure that there's lots of flexibility. So, people who have a crisis for a week or two, the course is flexible for them. And my students are so overwhelmed with life in general that me giving them some flexibility has led some of them to saying, like, well, I have to take it to do other things and that that has consequences. And that has consequences. And so I'm still struggling with that. So I want to keep that flexibility moving forward, but I haven't figured out how to do it really well. But in terms of something kind of like Susan's examples, I got an idea from Federico Ardila where my students DJ the awkward time before class. And so each student picks a day of the term, they send me a YouTube link, they play a song before class, and then Play a song before class, and then that we start class with 30 seconds of them explaining why they picked that song. And some of them are like say things like, you know, this is just a pump-up song for me. But others have said things like, they told me my nephew would be dead at birth and wasn't. And this helps me with my faith in God. And this is a thing. Or others have said, like, this out song helped me through when I felt like I'd never belonged. When I felt like I'd never belong. And they're just extremely vulnerable in ways that have been very helpful for building community. And the sort of related, like the private chat, the like multiple venues for communication that aren't really easy to do in a live in-person room where, like, yeah, you could talk out loud or you could try to whisper, but only to one person and it's obvious it's happening. I want to try to. happening. I want to try to bring in that kind of like safer interpersonal communication into my teaching moving forward. Great, thanks. Are there other questions, comments? Henry, in your room? Can I make a comment? I think there's something that's sort of interesting that I've heard from each of the panelists, but kind of in their own way about. About sort of the idea of math, especially when you learn it as sort of a thing that always has to be right and wrong. Like, that's the experience that, you know, I guess most of us probably had growing up through math is that like, there's a yes or a no, there's a right or a wrong. And like having art or any type of creativity blurs that line. So it becomes something that is, it's not like a robotic pursuit. Is it's not like a robotic pursuit, it's like a human pursuit. Um, and I feel like, I don't know, I just wanted to say that I think it was sort of really interesting how each of the panelists kind of addressed that in their own way. Like, yes, Henry was discussing about, you know, how his students kind of fall into traps of their own problems. I mean, I loved Brian's. Brian's sort of way of like deconstructing belief and axioms as like holy grail. Like, I don't know, I just thought that there's everyone sort of brought that in in a really interesting way. And I think that's maybe something for all of us to think about as teachers going forward. How do we break the mold of math being an objective truth? That's an excellent point, and actually, I have one thing. Actually, I have been teaching a geometry course for undergraduate students fourth year. And I felt that moment that, you know, after introduction about Euclidean geometry and then hyperbolic geometry comes and then spherical geometry comes and then the other geometries that they discover on their projects, the moment that they come to this fact that, okay, there are other worlds, this is kind of unbelievable. This is kind of unbelievable, and it's hard to get to that point. So, there should be, I guess, enough support to help the students to get to that point and kind of believe it and find it that actually there are various ways that we can see relationships and they are in their own world, they are true. So, for me, that's a really amazing point in my teaching. Okay, is there any other comments or suggestions? I just wanted to partly to address Parker's question in the chat about why is art or geometry particularly suitable to opening up the mathematical experience. And I just want to kind of, I was kind of tangential comment, but it relates to this, is that art is not easy for everybody. Just as there's math anxiety or math, you know, people who are aversed to math, there are people who have art anxiety. Anxiety, and I've seen it so many times where they're, you know, say, Well, you know, you're gonna make an artistic piece, and people say, Oh my god, I can't draw, I can't sing, I can't play an instrument, I can't write poetry, I haven't done it since I was 14. And so you'll find, I mean, there are other, so there are other kinds of areas where people have anxieties. And some of my students who are very precision-oriented, they really like things that are precise. Decision-oriented. They really like things that are precise and things that are right and wrong. Don't want to delve into the murky areas of things that could be interpretable or that they might not know how to do it right. And so sometimes what helps with that is to say, well, for one thing, that they're not being judged on, like, it's not about connoisseurship and, you know, we call it. Let me call it, can't think of the right word by that, but you know, where you don't have to be like a hugely accomplished musician that would play on the concert stages of wherever to be able to write a song that's interesting here or whatever. And also that we're interpreting the arts in the broadest way possible. So, for some students doing some kind of process video or something else, that might be their artistic practice. So, that, yeah, so some people are like, But yeah, so some people are like, as soon as they hear art, they kind of breathe a sigh of relief and this is wonderful and this is human. And for others, their anxiety is ramped up and they just don't know where to start. I was going to make a comment on Parker's question in a different direction. So why is art geometry particularly suitable to opening up the mathematical experience? I mean, one thing is just sort of the information content. Of the information content of images is very high in comparison to other sorts of media. And I mean, there's sort of an example. So often at a math conference, you'll have like, you know, a five-minute talk lightning session from the graduate students or something. And it's hard to get across what you're doing in five minutes if it's a technical math thing. You know, technical math thing. But when we've done this at the illustrating mathematics sort of ISEM things, I think it's been quite a bit more successful because there's an image there. There's something you can see. If you're interested, you can go at it further. And you sort of, yeah, you get it across much more quickly because it's designed to go in through a different Not really a different sense, but something like that. I think there's another sort of answer I'd give to that: why is art geometry particularly suitable? I don't know that it is. For some students, it doesn't connect. But I think what we as educators as a whole want to do is to make mathematics and everything else as accessible as possible. Everything else as accessible as possible. And that means different students will approach, will have different aptitudes and want to see things in different ways. And if you can show the same thing, same mathematical idea in, you know, through axioms or through a short story or through an art piece or whatever, then the more the merrier, right? Find a way which will connect to that particular student. Yeah, rather than duplicating Susan's point about different anxieties and different comforts about Anxieties and different comforts about messiness, or Henry's point about, you know, pictures having lots of information. One other thought I just recently had was that, I mean, thoughts happen in a brain, right? And by the time in its brain, all of the thoughts are just, you know, collections of electrical activity in this squishy organ. And our brains appear to, I mean, whatever, we appear to have evolved to make meaning out of a physical world. Meaning out of a physical world. And there is, I don't know how solid this is, but there's some evidence that basically that mathematical objects get stored in the brain kind of like objects, right? That the sort of similar kinds of ways of thinking of them as like, you know, physical objects you might be able to rotate. And this is on the struggles. Like those of us who do a lot of mathematics definitely think of functions, we can think of them as processes, but we can also think of them as static objects. And that is a big transition. And that is a big transition. I think one of the reasons that maybe geometry is a little more open for some people than, say, I mean, I'm an algebraic geometer by training. I love abstract algebra. This is not a negative on abstract algebra. But in abstract algebra, the objects of interest are binary operations or structures or things like associativity, where it's very hard to get my students to start thinking about those as objects. Where in geometry, Where in geometry, it's easy to help them move into that object world and start thinking about it in that other way. So I think that might be one particular reason geometry is so facile. I just wanted just to comment on, because Brian's used the word objects a lot, but I'm thinking about the performing arts as well as the visual and plastic arts, and also thinking about what I'm learning about Indigenous ways of being in the world and of knowing things. And one of the things that Of knowing things. And one of the things that's come out in certainly in Canadian math education research around Indigenous languages and Indigenous ways of picturing things is that most Indigenous languages in North America at least are very verby as versus nouny. So where English we tend to nominalize things, we turn things into nouns. And I mean this is true in Maori language too, according to the math education researchers working there. Math education researchers working there. So instead of talking about a circle, you might talk about circling. And that's a very different thing. So just as, say, a conic section, locus of points, kind of definition of a parabola is all the points that are equidistant from a focus and a directrix. It's very different from y equals x squared, right? It gives you a different way in. And if you think about circling and you actually try circling, Circling, and you actually try circling, what does that give you? I mean, if you're walking and you're circling with your two feet, there's a sort of a lean to one side, and there's a whole different kind of motion-oriented way of being and thinking. And so just to get away from the idea of just static objects that are, not that those are bad, but that that's only one approach. And we might think about being more verby in our ways of thinking, motion-oriented. Right now, I'm trying to. Right now, I'm trying to get my calculus three students to get that link between the implicit equation of a circle and the parametric equation of a circle. That's precisely that: is it a function that moves around or is it a static thing that you check? That's exactly the distinction. Thank you for these wonderful thoughts and elaborations. This is like such rich food for thought. I had another image to share from this that linked on to, I think, what Brian was saying about what is mathematics and the freedom that the students don't know they have yet. So this is a slide that I have in my public talks sometimes, which is the, you know, The, you know, what is it that math and art both can do? Is they can both say, I'm just going to make up some rules and see what happens. And in a way that scientists and engineers usually are not allowed to because they have to have something to do with the real world. And I think this is, I don't know, I should actually find out what the general public thinks when they see this and if they believe me, because I think as all of us, as All of us have, as many of us have brought up, is that there's this like, you know, math is this thing which is always black and white and true or false. And it's not like that, the way that mathematicians actually work. If people are not familiar with the meme, this is the shot from, is it from Predator? I think it's from Predator. Anyway, this is the meme where you have two things, which are like they agree on this thing. Two things which are like they agree on this thing. So math and art both agree on what if, what are the consequences if this are the rules. Okay, more comments, questions? Any comments? So I just typed this in the chat pretty much. So, I just typed this in the chat pretty much, but just to kind of piggyback on what a lot of you guys have been saying. So, I teach this class called visual mathematics for 10th, 11th, and 12th graders in Alabama, where math education sucks. And students come to my school with varying degrees of mathematical ability, right? Some of them, you know, maybe made straight A's at their home school. Straight A's at their home school, but that doesn't mean that they learned a single thing. And then others, you know, are ready for calculus or whatever. And in the selective class that I teach, like I don't, I call pre-calculus a prereq just because there are some like sequence series things that I sometimes do. But for the most part, there's like, there's no prerequisites for this class. And I guess, I get kids. And I get kids that have both this like art and math anxiety, but also kids that have not just anxiety, but like they've already decided whether they're interested in math or whether they're interested in art. And one of the things that sort of frustrates me teaching at the secondary level is that I see students that could be like amazing mathematicians. Like amazing mathematicians very quickly lose interest because the only math they're dealing with is algebra and calculus, and they just don't make a connection to it. But then if I can bring them in through geometry and these visual mathematics problems, you know, they're getting exposure to like topology and dynamical systems and these things that you wouldn't even see unless you already like math and already decide you're going to major in math in college. You're going to major in math in college. And so, you know, I mean, it's great that you all are doing these things at the university level, right? But there's not really the like, like I teach at a really special school where I'm able to offer this elective. But I mean, at least in America, right, like our math system doesn't allow for this sort of interdisciplinary study. And so kids just don't get exposed. And so kids just don't get exposed. And so I'm just wondering, like, you know, what are your thoughts? Like, I can't expose all the kids to these things. So what's the answer? I figured by teaching teachers, each of those teachers is going to teach 200 students a year in secondary school. So after 10 years, each one of them has taught 2,000 students. And if I can kind of win them over to doing projects where bringing history. Doing projects where bringing history, bringing geometry, bringing arts into math, they will start teaching that way, and a lot of kids will be influenced. So that's my hope. I was going to say, I mean, things are better than they were in terms of access to interesting math outside of the classroom and the exam system and the standardized whatever. It used to be that your only shop was to. Your only shop was to get to happen across a Martin Gardner book. And now there's enormous amounts of really good content out on YouTube, for example, of engaging stuff and getting millions of views. I think, yeah, I mean, it's getting harder, I think, to just miss all of this stuff. Although, I mean, you've got a lot more ability to sit somebody down in front of this really cool thing and make. Somebody down in front of this really cool thing and make them look at it when they're in your classroom than when it's like, Am I going to bother watching that YouTube video? But still, I think there's a lot more access, which is fantastic. I could teach a whole undergraduate curriculum and maybe a whole high school curriculum using by hearts videos. And I get not kind of close to that in many ways. Just to keep this from being all, yay. Being all yay geometry. I find proofs without words infuriating. So, and I find them infuriating. I mean, I'm happy they exist. I'm happy to make other people happy. It's lovely. I don't have a problem with them. But like they, for me, are so not careful about the epistemological things that are important. It's so hard to tell if you know which results you know are true in advance and which ones are sort of the consequences. Are sort of the consequences. And so, like, it's a nice diagram and it says some interesting things, but it does the opposite for me for what I want. And so, anyways, just to throw something controversial in there at the end. I want to make a little comment about that math anxiety. Why is there this math anxiety among the students? Students. I could not see similar, similar math anxiety, even among researchers or in general community of mathematics, even if they are top researchers, still there is that mathematics ancillary. I can just kind of see that they are similar. In my calculus courses, I see a group, most of my students are side. Most of my students are silent. They don't ask questions. They have that deep escalating situation from the learning. And I see it also in seminars or conferences in mathematics. Why should we have this mad anxiety? And what is the reason? And what is the thing that we do wrong to create this bad anxiety? I agree with Amy saying that this is a very big question. It could be a whole other conference around this. But I've certainly seen that in some societies or some nations and so on, there's more math anxiety than others. And one of the things I've noticed in living in Vancouver, where there's a lot of contact with East Asia, there are a lot of East Asian. East Asia, there are a lot of East Asian immigrants, people moving back and forth. In some families, anyway, people do math in the same way that the general society reads bedtime stories. So there was a big movement in literacy movement to get parents to read books and read stories to kids from the earliest age. And it's been quite successful. But there's not a similar movement to do mathematics in that way. But I do see some. But I do see some families, and certainly are families like that, and people coming from China, but also from Singapore, also from Eastern Europe, and also from Iran, and also from India, where there's, you might actually sit on your mom's knee and do a math puzzle when you're like five. So there's a kind of association with warmth and love and the family and all those good things that, like, like with a bedtime story that's associated. Like, like with a bedtime story that's associated with mathematics. And then I see other families, like, for example, my husband's from a British family, and it's not like that in his family, whereas math is kind of like, oh, tough, hard, scary, better not, that kind of thing. So I think there are some kinds of, I mean, I don't want to stereotype countries and cultures because, you know, there's a lot of variety, but there are certain places, like certain ways that within a culture, things are considered. Within a culture, things are considered normal or desirable, and they can that can change too with public policy and I don't know, grassroots movements, maybe. Yeah, I agree that sort of rituals at home. So, my bubble during this pandemic is two friends from grad school. So, the three adults, all of us have PhDs in mathematics, and their six-year-old child. And so we. And so there's a lot of talking about math with the six-year-old. And even though he'll say sometimes he doesn't like math, he wants to think about how exponential growth happens in Magic the Gathering, like all the time. But in terms of the question, yeah, so Sabeta's point that the right-wrong thing is, I think, drives a lot. I think we praise little boys for being fast and little girls. Fast and little girls for being careful. And then that sets up the boys the first time in the US. And then the first time that something can't be done fast, that's proof they don't belong. And that it sort of makes it really stressful for the little girls. And so there's some gendered kinds of things there. I think we also implicitly assume, like, I think Devil's Advocate is another way of saying it is a particular pretty white. Particular, pretty white male version of how you're supposed to engage in discourse. And we sort of like say that's the one you're supposed to be using in mathematics. And that, so if you don't fit into that or you're not comfortable with that, it makes it a kind of toxic place. I'm queer, and so, which is not something that's overt all the time, although you might have assumed, which is fine. And it, so there are times when I feel like the universe. When I feel like the universality, the sort of like utopian vision of mathematics, everyone's like, yeah, but it doesn't matter. You're welcome here. And I'm like, but I'm also asked to suppress that part of who I am in order to be in this space. And so that sort of carrying burden of whether or not I have to suppress part of my identity and for students, especially students of color, I think really contributes to that. And then, of course, whether or not we have to be sort of the model and stand for everyone with our identities. And stand for everyone with our identities. So, if we are not the best person ever, does that mean that people who are like us didn't actually belong in mathematics? So, there's a bunch of societal cultural things that play on that right-wrong. Comments, questions? Well, I just want to say that I'm loving this discussion. I'm just feeding off all you guys because I'm not, you know, structurally a math teacher. I'm not part of any institution. I'm just kind of like this rogue origami artist teacher that kind of goes around teaching people how to fold the snipe patterns, whatnot. But, you know, back in the day when I did get some gigs in schools and stuff and engaging with people generally, I would get a lot of comments regarding, oh, I wish they would have taught this to me in my school. Like, I would have. me in my school like i would have learned to love i would have loved to learn geometry this way and a lot of the times it was just me like riding the public transport and just folding and somebody would catch my eye or like they would be looking at what i was folding i would just say hey you like this and i would just like strike up a conversation with them and try to talk about angles and whatnot and i don't know why but sometimes a passionate teacher will ignite that curiosity more in the students so there is that um sort of That sort of broad mind that's sometimes quite the how you say, well, yeah, it just gives you an edge, I guess. But my guess, my point is that I deal with both the art society and the math anxiety. I'm not trained to deal with any of them, but I just try to tell them, like, hey, man, you know, you got to do what you got to do. And if you don't get it, you don't get it. And if you do, great. But if you don't, I mean, you know, you can always try again. I always try to like try and tell. I always try to like try and tell them that it's not about perfection but about intention, I guess. So, yeah, anyway, thank you all for all these beautiful comments and all. And yeah, right on. And also I see in comments, some comments, interesting comments from Amy. Experienced in and out of the school that learned themselves through profiles of math that were To profiles of math that are really unmathematical, also contribute to anxieties, extending what Brian is saying about identity as someone who can not do math, but also about what is conveyed about the identity of math. Great, interesting. What I was sort of getting at there is, well, a few things, but one is: if you're familiar with John Mason's work, he talks about mathematical thinking as an About mathematical thinking as an extension of our natural human powers. And then through school, we sort of lose that connection with our natural abilities to do these things. Part of how the structure of our school systems are set up for young kids, but also part of the routines that end up really resilient in the classroom. Those worksheets, those everything is in 2D and static. And by the way, you should be sitting down when you're thinking. The way you should be sitting down when you're thinking about this and probably quietly by yourself and surely not near a window. But all of these sorts of routines get internalized and become really, really hard to disrupt. And then the adult that we see carry these conflicted expectations of what they think math was supposed to be versus what they'd really like it to be or what they might have liked it to be for them. And then they're torn. And then they're torn in teacher education between pedagogues who are pushing new methods and associate teachers that are mentoring them in sort of the ways, the pragmatic trenches of our school systems. So there's a lot of conflicts. And I mean, passion goes a long way and listening and understanding. And a lot of the things that people have talked about, I think, sound exactly like what the literature is suggesting are good practices. Is suggesting are good practices, but it is certainly a big, a big issue. Maybe when we meet up in Banff one day, yes. So also I see something from Sarah. So she says that maybe this is because of the idea that math is either right or wrong and students are afraid of being wrong. Sarah, do you want to say more about? Oh, well, I mean, I think BK already brought this up. I think Vike already brought this up, right? Just related to what Sabetta had said earlier about there being this idea that oftentimes, like, we think of mathematics, or a lot of times people think about mathematics as being right or wrong. But I think Ricardo said it pretty well, like when he encourages people to think about the intention behind it. I really liked that sort of phrase there, because, you know, what makes a good match. You know, what makes a good mathematician? Well, it's curiosity and dedication more than any sort of mystical natural ability. And I think students oftentimes think that you have to just naturally be good at math or something. There's like this idea that either you're good at math or you're not. But that's all. Are there any final comments, suggestions before we have? Suggestions before we have some sort of interesting surprise from Susan. So, the final thing I wanted to say is the theme of our event was just geometry, research, art education. And, you know, and I was thinking about this afternoon, I was thinking that why should we really dissect these things that they are really connected already? And I think a successful teacher is the one that has. The one that has the knowledge and just has the art to be able to teach in a way that inspires students. And to be a teacher that inspires students, you have to actually use or combine these elements and don't separate them in any ways. So that was just the thought that I had. But then if there is no final comments or suggestions or questions, maybe we can ask Suzanne to just surprise us. Okay, here's a little bit of O'Carol and music for you to sing us out here.   Thanks. Any opportunity, I'll play the accordion, really. Brian, don't you want to sing? I was singing along. I zoomed in a lot more than one audio through at a time.
