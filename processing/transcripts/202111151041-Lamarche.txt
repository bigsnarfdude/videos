Our pleasure to have Alicia who's going to talk about draft categories and rational points for a class of Tori converts. Well, thanks for letting me speak. And I want to, I need a disclaimer first. I haven't written on a chalkboard in like two years. So I apologize ahead of time for anything weird that happens. Or your bicycle. I haven't. Yeah, exactly. You're going to watch me fall off of the chalkboard. Of the chocolate. Okay, so this talk will contain joint work with Matt Ballard. And at the end, I'll mention joint work with Matt Ballard, Alex Duncan. And Patrick. Okay. So first, I think maybe some notation. Also, do I do you want me to look at you? Is this I prefer to study. I didn't? If I didn't? Okay, well, I'm going to read eye contact with you. So, some notation. X is going to be a smooth projective variety over field K. Just assume that everything is smooth in this talk. And K is some field. When I write K bar or K sup or K S, I mean a KS. I mean a choice of separable closure of K. Sometimes I get excited and I alternate between these things. Let's see, what else? When I write, is this too low? Okay, great. When I write dv of x, what I really mean is the bounded direct category of coherent sheaves on x. Of coherent she's on X. Yeah, and I'll say that X has a rational point if I have a map from spec of K to X. And also, some abbreviations. Some abbreviations that I'm going to use. When I write SOD, I mean a semi-orthogonal decomposition of the derived category. What else here? When I write FEC, I mean a full exceptional collection. And since I'm going to And since I'm going to talk a lot about torrid varieties, I'll let TV denote torrid variety. Okay, so I've divvied this talk up into three sections. First, I'm going to try to motivate you. Although you're watching this or you're in the audience, so I suppose you're sufficiently motivated. But I'm going to do it anyway. Going to do it anyway. Then I'm going to tell you about some of the tools we need to use to prove the main result. And then we'll talk about the results. And then we'll be done here. So I'm going to remind you of some things that you already know. And if you don't know, then this is a great time to learn them. So section one. I'll start off with a definition. We say a variety X is rational if it's birational to projected n space over K for some N, N. So, that is to say that outside of some lower dimensional stuff, x looks like it's isomorphic to projective n-space. So, I have a question. It is the following. If you give me two varieties, how do I know that they're birationally equivalent? Maybe you have an answer to this. But I'm gonna, I'm just gonna. I didn't have an answer to this, so I'm gonna tell you what my answer was. Tell you what my answer was? Okay. So I guess our goal is to have some tool to figure out when two varieties are birationally equivalent. Besides like actually constructing a birational map from one to the other. In general, that's difficult. Okay, so one of the few things I know about rationality is weak factorization, which says that if I have a birational map from From X to Y. And here, I guess X and Y are smooth, complete, and over a field of characteristic zero. So if I have this birational map, F can be factored. As a series of blow-ups and blowdowns So each one of these F sub I's Is a blow-up or a blowdown with a smooth center. Okay, so with this in mind, I'll make the following claim, which isn't always true, and we'll see why if you didn't already know. But maybe the bounded-derived category Derived category gives us some way to detect by rationality. Okay, so my evidence for this claim being not a complete lie is the following. So, well, first of all, I know what. Well, first of all, I know what the direct category of coherent sheaves looks like on projective n-space. It has a really nice semi-orthogonal decomposition. So there's just the structure sheet and twists. Also, I know. Also, I know that decompositions of the direct category behave nicely with respect to blow-ups and blowdowns. That is to say that there's a formula. So if I know a semi-orthogonal decomposition. A semi-orthogonal decomposition for the direct category of X, and I blow up long as move subvariety, I can tell you what happens to the semi-orthogonal decomposition under that blow-up. Okay. So a vague idea. Maybe if x is rational If x is rational, then it's direct categories nice. And when I say sufficiently nice, I guess I mean in my particular situation, if he composes in a nice way. Just like PM. So, what about the other question? question, like if its direct category is sufficiently nice, does that rational? Does that imply that x is rational? And this is what I want to focus on, this backwards direction. Okay, so yeah, in general, can the direct category be used to answer rationality questions about x? That's what this talk is about. Okay. So, some examples or history of this question. It's not an exhaustive list. A lot of people have done a lot of things. So I'm sorry if I... I'm trying to keep it short, top length, right? Okay, so yeah, let's just go by dimension. Like, let's look at dimension one first. So for the case of curves, does the derived category tell me? Does the derived category tell me anything about the rationality of a curve x? So we'll go by genus, I guess. So for genus 0, so these are the several twisted forms of P1. And these will have Exceptional collections, if and only if they're trivial, that is, if they're actually P1 itself. For genus bigger than or equal to one, a paper by Akala says As we have no non-trivial semi-orthogonal decompositions. Okay, so in dimension two. So the case of surfaces. There's two results that I want to mention, but surely there's more out there. There's more out there in the ether. So, we all in 2016 showed the following. So if we have a full K exceptional collection, which I'll explain what that is in a minute, and my variety is geometrically rational. This implies rationality. And then in 2015, Brown and Chipman showed Over C that if we have a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles plus some stability conditions on these side bundles and this implies Then this implies rationality. For dimensions bigger than 2, I don't know. But we're going to talk about some examples of it today. So, yeah, okay. Some related conjectures. So this one's usually attributed to Orla. So this one's usually attributed to Orlov. If I have a smooth projective variety with a full exceptional collection, does this imply rationality? And another conjecture due to the fact that we're going to be able Another conjecture due to once asks, if I have a full K exceptional collection, does this tell me that X has a stratification? Into rational subfranes. I guess k-rational. And I think. I think, this is just from my perspective. Maybe you have a different opinion. I think asking for rationality is a bit much. That's a difficult question that I am not well equipped to answer right now. So I'm going to make it a little bit weaker. So the weakest thing that we can hope for towards rationality is the existence of a rational point. Right? So if I don't have a rational point, then I can't be rational. So I'm changing. I'm changing my question. So, can the derived category detect rational points? The answer is no. In general, the derived category is not, I mean, there's no reason to expect it to be, first of all. Be first of all, but in 2019 Nick Addington, Ben Antio, Sarah Fry, and Katrina Hoenigs gave an example of two derived equivalent varieties. Varieties. So where one has a rational point, the other one doesn't. So, even though in general the direct category is not great. Direct category is not great for detecting the existence of rational points. You can ask, like, to what extent can it be used to detect rational points? And yeah, on that note, I'll tell you the May theorem of this talk, which is joint work with Matt Ballard. Okay, so if X is a generalized El Petzo variety, which I'll talk about momentarily. Talk about momentarily. Then X is going to have a K-point if and only if its derived category admits a full Atoll exceptional. Admits a full Atall exceptional collection, which is cool. Let's talk about that. Again, momentary. Okay. So, is anyone angry yet? Are there any questions? Are there any questions? So, with the 2019 theorem, do you remember how many points did it have? Oh, I have no idea. Is there any hope like maybe something modular P can be extracted out of directly? Good question. I've never thought about that, so I don't know. But thank you. I think now we should move on to the next. Now we should move on to the next section. Okay, so yeah, now I want to mention some of the tools that we need to talk about this stuff. So I think the first thing that I want to mention is what's going on with the derived category of x because it needs some explaining. It needs some explaining. So, I guess what I want to say is that whatever you know about exceptional collections over C is too restrictive for like an arbitrary field. So, for example, an exceptional collection, well, an exceptional object over C is going to have C as its endomorphism algebra, right? That is. Algebra, right? That is very difficult in the general case where k is just a field. So I'm going to redefine exceptional objects and stuff. So I'm going to say that A is a finite dimensional K algebra of finite homological dimension. And we'll say that an object E in the derived category X is a exceptional if the endomorphism algebra of B is isomorphic to A. And there are no maps between E and any higher shifts of E. And I'm just going to say that E is exceptional. If it's A exceptional for a division algebra. And I will say it's at all exceptional if A is an atol K algebra. So remember Remember, this just means it's a product of finite separable k extensions. Okay, and given an ordered collection of objects in my derived category, I'm going to call this a full exceptional collection. If Each object is an exceptional object. So I'll say A sub i exceptional or A sub i just being an amorphism algebra of E sub i and we have no maps going Maps going, let's see, I always get this backwards, going to the left and between any shifts to the left. So maps from EI to EJ, any shift of EJ. And this collection generates the drive category. Okay. So, some related results to derive categories over an arbitrary field that I'll need later in the talk. The first one is due to Matt Ballard, Alex Duncan, and Patrick McFadden says that. says that a variety x over k admits a full exceptional collection. If and only if when I move X to the separable closure this guy admits a full exceptional collection that is stable under the action of the absolute guywall group. Of the absolute Galois group. So, this will be important in some of, well, I only have like one example to show, but it'll be important in that example because we need to start. We need to start over the separable closure to get a semi-orthodical decomposition and then somehow descend that. So another theorem, due to Kalamata, says that smooth protective torque varieties over, I guess, a field of characteristic zero and also algebraically close. Zero and also algebraically closed, admit full exceptional collections. So it's just a fine option. In practice, In practice, coming up with these full exceptional collections isn't necessarily easy, but it's doable. So, yeah. Okay, so we've talked about the second part of this theorem. Now I should probably tell you what a generalized petsover idea is. So, section 2, part 2. I can ask how doable it is. Like, how do I, if I do an advert variety, how do you actually find an exceptional collection of it? You cannot ask me. No, so like there's like a minimal model program for torque varieties. But I think like even if you start with a smooth one, you might have to do torque stacks. And I got scared. That's my story. I have tried, but um I'm not there yet. But um, I'm not there yet. Okay, so part two of section two. I want to tell you about arithmetic torque varieties. So, just a reminder: an algebraic torus, oh, a torus. Is an algebraic group T so that when I base change to the separable closure, I get something isomorphic to GMN for some n. And if T is actually isomorphic to GMN, we'll say that T is split. And hopefully we're happy with torrent varieties, but if you're unhappy with torrent varieties, just think of a torrent variety as something containing an alternate torus as a dense open subset so that the action of the torus on itself extends to the whole variety. Extends to the whole variety. Also, I just need to complain. Chalkboards are hard because I keep inhaling the dust. So, okay. So, an arithmetic for a variety. Over field of k is just some k variety so that when I base change up this closure, I get an honest torque variety. And over the separable closure is where we'll have like fans and stuff if you like turd varieties. So you don't have anything like a combinatorial description of arithmetic turd varieties? I don't. Well, group. So, for example, you might know that the projective line over C is toward Raid and its fan is just this guy. Okay, so I want to, for example, take a look at For example, take a look at P1R. So, if P1C was a chord variety, I hope P1R will be an arithmetic chord variety. And it is. But some kind of weird things happen. So, first of all, if I'm looking at At P1R as a torrid variety, what is the torus? And in this case, I have two choices. I could either choose R star or I could choose S1. And S1 acts on P1R by rotation matrices. And R star is going to act on P1R via, I guess, scalar multiplication in the first coordinate. So already something strange is happening. With arithmetic torque varieties, I could have more than one possible Taurus. Very exciting. Very exciting. Who says that there should be any doors? Who's who? Not me. I don't. I mean, I get. No, I sorry, I didn't mean it that way. I mean, is there in general, do we know that... I mean, a toric variety is defined by saying you have a torus action, it's part of the definition. The definition of an arithmetic toric variety does not seem to include any torus It does not seem to include any torus as part of the definition. Is there any reason to expect there to be a torus acting of any sort? I mean, you should be able to use Gawa descent on this, right? No? I guess. So there is always a Taurus. And that one is not God-given? I mean, which one of those two is that the one? Oh, okay. So, I mean, you have to provide some Gala data, right? Sorry? You provide some data for Galois action. But would it have a lot of points, the torus over over Q? Would it have a lot of points? The d or would it I mean if it has a point. Yeah, well. But in general, can we But th in general it can be can be non-rational. So it could be it could collapse. It's unirational torso. So it's unirational. Yes, it has some good amount of points. But it doesn't have any code of union. But like it's a twisted form of P1, is that a correct way of P1? Yes. Yeah, so speaking of twisted forms of P1, thank you. I don't think that was intentional, but thank you. So another example I want to look at is the conic given by the zero set of x squared plus y squared plus z squared sitting inside of P2R. Okay, so if I base change this to C, I get something that's isomorphic to the projective one, right? Right? But clearly, we should not have that C is the same thing as P1R, right? Because C doesn't have any non-trivial points. And P1R does. And actually, in this case, the only torus that we have acting on C is S1. You can check that the R-star action doesn't work appropriately. Okay, so in general, the general idea of what I'm doing here with arithmetic torque varieties is I take a torrent variety over the separable closure. Then I use Gal Adesin. Nowadays to get some arithmetic for our variety over k. And this guy has a point. And then I can, I guess I should specify, this has a point and I'm going to call it's torus T. And I'm going to call its torus T. And from here, what I can do is I can twist by a T torsor, get another arithmetic torque variety, which I'm going to call X. Okay, and at this point, I will now tell you what a generalized dog petso variety is. Don't yell at me for the name. I am sorry. Sorry, I'm just trying to get the camera to work better. Okay, so generally a stop has a variety. is at least open with separable closure, a torrent varieties with the following rates. And I'm going to call this generalized Del Patso variety B sub 2N. So this guy will have raised Raise. Let's do. Once I write down the raise, I think it'll be clear what this thing should look like. Okay, so the rays are really symmetric. That's the point. And the smallest example of this, so I guess for n equals 1. For n equals one. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, so the smallest example of this is the Depot surface of degree six. I'm inhaling junk again. Sorry about that. So the fan for this guy is going to look something like this. And you can see it's very symmetric. And I'm going to leave this here alone. And of course, I guess I should mention that this fan is. I should mention that this fan, this drawing, is only like good intuition for what's happening over the separable closure. Okay, so now we have all of the words in our theorem. Sorry, I'm a bit confused. So you're saying that a delta is delta, so it's something that I. That's something that off your base change becomes this time. Yeah. Or I guess I don't really, I didn't name them. So when someone says generally is the pets over I, do they mean over like seed or just any twisted form of it? Over C. Okay. So yeah, or the twisted form of these of these tips. Of these debt. Does that answer your question? And I should mention that although it's not stated like this in his paper for the Del Penzo surface of degree 6, Blanc did a similar thing as our theorem here in 2006. And before I give you any more details, I want to give an example of how this ought to work. It's sort of, it's maybe a misleading example because I'm going to look at our conic C over there again, which is not a generalized El Petzo variety. But if I were to write down the example with DP6, then it would take me a long time, and I don't want to do that. So Okay, so I'm going to let C be the conic that I talked about over there. So I'm going to compare the direct categories of these two things, P1C and C. P1C and C. So I know what the derived category of the projected line looks like. It decomposes as O and O of 1. And the endomorphism algebras of each of these objects is just C. Okay, so how do I figure out what the derived category of C should look like? Well, O descends without any issue, right? Without any issue, right? O of 1 does not descend. So what do I want to say? I guess I can't, C can't have any degree one line bundles on it, right? Because then, like, any section should give you a point. So O of one does not descend, but I do get that's supposed. I do get, that's supposed to be an F, but a little bit of a J to go off. I do get this object, F. So that when I base change this back up to C, this base changes to two copies of O of 1. And if I look at the endomorphism algebra, And if I look at the endomorphism algebras of these objects, for O I just get R, but for F I get the Hamiltonian quaternions. Um yeah, so this is this is not a separable extension of the real numbers. Of the real numbers. And from just looking at this endomorphism algebra and seeing that it's not a separable extension of the field that my curve is defined over, I want to be able to say that C doesn't have any points. Obviously, we already knew that C didn't have any points, but it's just an example. So, but in your theorem, I always say that there is some nice collection of objects, it's just that endomorphism algebras are good only when there is a point. So do you always still get some objects in dvx, but maybe with wrong endomorphisms? Um maybe with wrong endomorphisms. Like like here. So you you do still have some f or jet endomorphism. They just attended more physical working up. Yeah, so for this particular class of torque varieties, this is very specific. Like, very specific. But in general, I mean, you could get all kinds of weird stuff as the endomorphism algebra. Which is kind of fun. But basically, getting some object F is not a problem. You just getting an object with a glue in the morph is an algebraic. Yes. To have a point. To have a point. In other words, do you need an assumption of having a point to produce objects? Oh. No. No. I'm kind of like going in the opposite direction, if that makes sense. Okay. Um you can always generate it by points or something, right? Like I mean you can always take the drive category. You're asking if you can find a bunch of generators for the direct category? Uh well so yeah, something that ends up being uh an exceptional collection In an exceptional collection, if there is a point, but maybe in full generality, there's just a collection of objects, but the endomorphism algebras maybe don't have to work out. Okay, so some more details about this theorem. So there's two other theorems that this one relies on pretty heavily. Relies on pretty heavily. So, first of all, there's a theorem that isn't worded this way, but so by Castro Vett and Tevlov. And I guess that's from 2017. That says that this exceptional collection here, so Okay, so the derived category of these generalized El Petzo varieties admits a whole exceptional collection that is stable under the action of the absolute Gao group. Okay, and also another theorem not worded like this originally, but in, let's see, 1989, Kwiachko and Vosrusensky. 1984, 84, okay. Showed that smooth arithmetic torque varieties have a K-point when it's T-torcher does. And our T torso is going to have a K point if and only if it's trivial. So it wasn't actually a torso at all. It was just an honest torus. So our game with proving this theorem becomes figuring out if, like, if you hand me some twisted form of a generalized Del Petzo variety, finding out if it's been twisted by a t-torce or not. So, yeah, I'm gonna edit this a little bit. So Okay. Maybe I don't need I don't need to need edit. Yeah, I'm gonna keep that as it is. In general, though, you might ask if having a fully taught sexual collection is enough to guarantee the existence of a rational point. The answer is no. Um the answer is no. So oh okay so this was joint work with Matt Ballard, Alex Duncan, and Patrick Fadden that's not in alphabetical order, but sorry. Let me make sure, let me write this down correctly. So, we showed the existence of a smooth geometrically irreducible threefold. Over Q with no Q. With no cue points, but its derived category does admit a full ATOP exceptional collection. So In general, adding the H call adjective is not enough guarantee rational points. Maybe that's what I have to say. I have a question about this example. What does F look like? Presumably it's coherent, right? Yeah, so it's like, what does F look like on C? Yeah, I mean, if it's coherent, it comes from a modules opposed to modules. Oh, I don't know. Oh, I don't know. You know, I don't know what the module looks like. Oh, okay. Unfortunately. But it's just, okay, a get degree and rank mixed up. An indecomposable rank two vector bundle. Some people write it as O of 1 half, because it pulls back to two copies of O of 1. The restriction of the topological level. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, I mean, like the middle term in the other seat, but it's not a problem. Great. Thank you for listening. Okay, if there are no more questions, let's thank Alicia again. Can I move this?
