For this presentation of your talk from Peter Clamon from Nice, who will talk about the recovery of surface waves from bot infection. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the organizers for inviting me to this nice workshop. So I'm going to make a survey of what I've been working for some in the recent years, that is how to find the wave field at the surface of the sea from pressure field measurement under the sea, the free surface. So let me. Okay, no? Yeah, first let me acknowledge my collaborators: Adrienne Constantin, David Henry, Joris Labart. Labart who was a postdoc with me, and Alexander Pierre, who was also a postdoc, but not with me. So what was the motivation? So we want to monitor the sea states and to, for example, for forecast warning for whatever application. Whatever application we need. And one way is to put some floating buoys at the surface of the sea. But this is problematic because it can be disturbing human activities and also it can be stolen. And actually, that what happened in the past. So a simple way to prevent this problem is to put the pressure gauge under the surface at the seabed, for example, or somewhere above the seabed. But let's consider the seabed situation. The seabed situation. So, from this pressure field bottom, we want to know what is the wave on the free surface and perhaps if there is something else on the free surface. Some wind effect, some floating bodies, what's the color of the bear, whatever. Can we determine like that just from the pressure field at the bottom? So, that's a typical and impressive problem. Okay, so let's consider first the pure gravity wave. So let's consider first the pure gravity weight. So at the free surface, the atmospheric pressure that is constant that we consider equal to zero without generality. And the typical problem here, in a simple situation, we consider a two-dimensional problem. Steady means that we are traveling, we consider a traveling wave and we are in the frame of reference moving with the wave. So there is no time dependence here. And a flat bottom. And we work in the physical space because when we make Physical space because when you make experiments, measurements, your measures are made in the real world, not in some weird mathematical space. You get your data as physical coordinates. So we have the, say, the bottom pressure that we know. We know that at the free surface the pressure is zero and we don't know the rest, but we know some laws of physics, equation of the physics. So Physics equation of the physics. So we know that the pressure from the area equation, the pressure field, satisfies a Poisson equation. So Laplacian of the pressure equals some nonlinear function of the velocity. But we don't know this velocity because we don't measure the velocity. The seabed, we assume it's flat, but we don't know at what position is the what's the depth. The free surface shape, we that's what we want to determine, so we don't know it a priori. Determined, so we don't know it a priori. So, mathematically, we have to solve an unknown equation inside an unknown domain. So, that's typically a non-linear inverse problem. So, this surface recovery problem is not new, and it has been known for a century at least. And the first idea is to consider a simplification of the problem, is to assume that the pressure field is hydrostatic. So, it means at one point. Hydrostatic. So it means at one point in the water, the pressure is just the weight of the water above the point we consider. And so with this assumption, you can revert to the relation, which is trivial, and you get an expression for the free surface as a function of the bottom pressure. But when you do that, you make some big errors. So some estimate, even for a moderate wave, you can make a 15% error. You have 15% error. So if you talk to an engineer and you see 20% error, they are very happy for that. 15% makes sound huge for a mathematician, but for an engineer in the real life, it's all fantastic. But we are mathematicians. And so this hydrostatic approximation is not that accurate. But if you consider, for example, an overturning wave, like this. Wave like this depicted here, you can see that the pressure at the seabed, if it were hydrostatic, you will have a maximum pressure under the crest, where actually you have a minimum. Okay, so this is clearly not hydrostatic. Okay, then the next step is to assume that your traveling wave can be linearized and you use a airy linear wave theory, and you can as well obtain and obtain an explicit formula for your free surface. Formula for your free surface. But this is also limited in accuracy. More recently, Oliveras and Hectal derived an exact equation, a single equation, so they reduced the system to a single differential equation for the free surface and related to the bottom pressure. So here it's this equation. You see that it's quite non-linear because eta here is the derivative of eta. Because eta here is the derivative of eta. And the four m odd here, the coefficients are given by the bottom pressure, but you also have eta here. So it's quite an involved non-linear ordinary differential equation. And numerically, it's difficult to solve. They manage to solve it, but it's amazing. So when numerics are too difficult, what we have to do is analytic work. The point of analytic work is to bring the problem into another form, equivalent form that is more tractable. And this is what I want to talk about. And this is what I want to talk about. And in this particular case, we can solve this equation analytically. Okay. So, with Constantine, we have reformulated the problem. We obtain a differential equation that is exact, but different than the previous one. And the key idea is: instead of making some Fourier expansion or whatever, we consider that the bottom pressure, okay. It's a real analytic function, and we make an analytic continuation of this bottom pressure. So we define what is called the complex pressure. The physical pressure is not an harmonic function, it's not the report of a complex function. So when you make an analytical continuation of your bottom pressure, the physical pressure and the complex pressure match only at the bottom, but nowhere else. So when you continue this, you extract. So when you continue this, you extrapolate to the free surface this bottom pressure, you have to link it to the quantities at the free surface. And you can do that to reduce the sex pressure. So it's about one page of calculus. I'm not going to explain to you because since then I have a much more simple way of deriving the equation. Okay, but this is a differential equation we have to solve. But then I realized that it would be better to solve it analytically and to solve analytically, I mean Solve analytically, I mean, solving the differential equation means integration. So instead of dealing with the complex pressure, I introduce an antiderivative of the complex pressure, okay, which is also holomorphic. And you can see at once that this equation integrates into this one. And this is a purely algebraic equation. I mean, there is no derivative, no integral in this equation. So it's an exact analytic solution in an implicit form. An implicit form. And so you can, from this equation, you can solve it locally just by simple fixed-point iteration. Don't have to have smart numerics, just basic fixed point iteration. And we managed to prove that it's convergent even up to the wave of maximum height with the Stokes wave with a corner at the crest. And then in that case, we show that the iterations are semi-convergent from below, which is a Convergent from below, which is good for the pressure recovery. So that shows that this formulation in the physical plane is quite interesting formulation for practical point of view. Okay, all the results until now were proven rigorously. But then we wanted to generalize the problem when we have a constant vorticity. When you have a constant vorticity, the velocity The velocity, complex velocity, is not a non-morphic function, but it's a non-morphic function plus a linear term. So, actually, constant verticity or irrotationality is pretty much the same thing. So, we apply the same trick for this formulation, and we also could solve exactly the equation in the implicit form, but we could obtain an exact solution. And what is interesting is that with this procedure, not only we recover. With this procedure, not only we recover the free surface, but we can also measure the vorticity. So, the vorticity is unknown in the process. So, that may be surprising because at one point, if you know the pressure, you don't know the very vorticity. They are two different quantities. But here we solve a global problem. So, when you have the information of the pressure on the bottom, the pressure field has been affected by the shape of the morticity. So, from the Vorticity. So from the bottom pressure, you can find what is the vorticity. So here we don't have proof, but we have numerical evidence that it's working. Okay. And the problem is that you know that when you have vorticity, you can have overhanging solution. And when you do the analytical conti uh continuation, you have a problem at the free surface because the free surface is no longer graph. Free surface is no longer graph. So the question was: can we recover overhanging weight? So the answer is yes, but instead of the simple NLT continuation, we just use boundary integral formulation. And the boundary integral formulation, we have an integral over the bottom, an integral over the surface. The one over the bottom, we keep it in Lavarian coordinate, and the one on the surface, we transform it in Lagrangian coordinate, the parametric coordinate. Coordinate, the parametric coordinate. And of course, you implement in numerically, you have a procedure, you solve it. And we were able to. So, here it's an example of the pressure at the bottom. Here, the red line is the exact solution, and the blue circles are the recovered free surface. And you can see that we managed to recover the free surface. Now, if you look at the module of velocity inside the free domain, you see that here you have two stagnation points. That here you have two stagnation points on the button, and we have also other solutions where there are three stagnation points, one even inside the button. And this is an advantage of working in the physical plane because if you make some change variable, the stagnation point may become singularity. In the physical plane, the stagnation point, you have a zero velocity, and zero is just a value at another, so we don't care. Okay. So what about non-gravity only waves now? So suppose that at the free surface you don't have only constant atmospheric pressure, but you may have wind, you can blow on the free surface, so you can have a given pressure at the free surface. Or your free surface can be subject to surface tension, so you may have a pressure, a surface pressure that is proportional to the curvature of the free surface. That is proportional to the curvature of the surface, or you can have an elastic plate, a flexural elastic plate, or you can have a combination of that, or you can have anything else. Or you may not even know what is the surface pressure. The question is: Can we recover from the bottom pressure, the free surface, and the pressure of the free surface? And the answer is yes. And the answer is yes. So, to answer this question, I had to rethink a little bit about how to formulate the problem. And I realized that everything I did before could be simplified. So, the key idea was to work with the square of the complex velocity. That was done before. And when you work with the square of the velocity, a lot of things get simple. For example, if you work with W squared, If you work with W squared with conformal mapping, you get the Bavenko equation at once. So, working with W squared is much more interesting than working with W. So, since W, I have to say, there is no vorticity here, but we could do the same trick as before. I don't want to put everything in the same framework. So, if W is holomorphic, W square is holomorphic. So, the real and imaginary part of W square fulfills the Cauchy imaginary. Square fulfill the Cauchy-Riemann equation. So you have these two Cauchy-Riemann equations, and then you integrate them from the bottom to do a free surface. So you integrate that, and you just have to invert derivative and integration, one line of calculus. And each time you see u squared plus v square appearing, you use the Bernoulli relation to replace by the pressure. And then you get that in two lines of calculus. Two lines of calculus. You get these two equations. Game over. Because here, if the surface pressure is zero, okay, you have that. You can integrate directly and you obtain the equation I've been showing at first the exact implicit solution. But when Ps is unknown, you can, it's just a linear in Ps. So you can eliminate Ps between these two equations. So you can have a formulation independent of K. Formulation independent of Ps. But now, here you have the velocity on the right-hand side. But as before, the square velocity is at the bottom. Since the vertical velocity is necessary zero for the impervability, you have to make an analytical continuation of the square of the horizontal velocity at the bottom. And with Bernoulli, you have an analytical continuation of the bottom pressure. So we introduce the gotic pressure, we subtract. Pressure, we subtract here the hydrostatic component to have a little bit shorter expression. So when you do that and you eliminate PS, you get a single first order non-linear differential equation. And eta, these are functional, everything is a function of eta, and here you have the first derivative. So it's a first order differential equation. Differential equation, whatever PSE has. So, if you remember, when you have capillarity, you have higher derivative or flexural wave, you have even fuse, whatever, doesn't matter. You only have to solve the first-order differential equation. When you have solved this equation, then you know your eta. And then you use the other equations, and you have an explicit expression for your surface pressure. Okay? But when you do this analysis, you because when you solve. Because when you solve the equation, you have some integration constant, and you have to constrain your problem by definition of the mean water level, and you have to define what is the boundary constant. And you have one scalar equation that is missing in this problem. So you need to close the problem. So there are two ways. We found two ways. One, imagine you have one extra measurement. Pressure somewhere else at the bottom. The wave velocity, the whatever, you know something. So if you use this expression, you can close completely the problem and you determine everything. But if you don't have this extra measurement, then you have to use another type of knowledge, and that can be the nature of the pressure at the free surface. So if you know, for instance, that you have capillarity, you can say, okay, I know my pressure at the surface is related to the free surface with an equation. And then you can solve it by. And then you solve it, you can solve it by just v-square minimization, and you close your core. So here is an example. So we have the bottom pressure. We reconstructed the free surface from the bottom pressure. And we did the two approaches. We got the same results here. Up to the six or seven digits. Okay. Perhaps I didn't mention, but this is an imposed problem. So numerically, you have to be a bit careful. To be a bit careful. So we recover the free surface, but we also recover the pressure of the free surface. So that can be used to determine the nature of the free surface if you don't know what's the physics. Okay. And now, what about real life? What do you do when you have noise? If you have noise in your data, which in real life you do have noise in your data, you are not going to make an analytical continuation of a noisy function. Continuation of noisy functions. Certainly, just some traveling waves. Yeah, people think it's permanent. Yeah, yeah. One step after the other. More than traveling reality, right? It's not already. No, it can be solitary wave. No, the habitat of periodic you have for it, but you can we show in the paper we reconstructed the solitary wave or convivial wave or whatever. How is the pressure in the pressure? In what case at the bottom, right? The pressure is just the folks convex, right? Yes. Translator coming along. But you travel with the solitary over, so the solitary is not moving. Factory is there, right? No, but it's in the real life, you have the the x and t. Here it's a function of x, but uh in the real life it would be uh you have two you should have two variables, time and space. Have two variables, time and space. But here you should think XST if you want. The pressure sensor is moving with the weight. Yeah, the pressure sensor is moving with the weight. That's not feasible, right? You can do that. Yeah, we are mathematicians. We can do things. You need the continuous diversion. Yeah, actually, this is the spatial. Because normally you have a temporal evolution at one point. Here, I assume you know the spatial distribution, so it's not exactly the same. So it's not exactly the same. So that's why moving to the unsteady case, if you assume that you know p as a function of x and t, you can do it. But if you know only part of it, this is a tricky part. So the other part is not to obtain the equation with reverse, it's just how to fit your bottom pressure. Okay, so when you have noisy data, the idea was: okay, we cannot do analytical continuation, but instead we went back to the boundary. Instead, we went back to the boundary integral formulation. And it's my colleague that he is from optimization working on the reconstruction of a surface from numerical data, normally resulting from finite element method when you're faceted stuff and you want to plot a smooth surface. So the idea is to consider the boundary integral formulation and apply at the bottom and at the free surface. So you have two dual. Your equation. So, from the bottom pressure you observe, you obtain a surface pressure, surface elevation, and your parameter, your Georgian constant. From that, you assume that now you want to do the opposite problem. From the surface pressure and eta, you want to reconstruct the bottom pressure. And you obtain a recover bottom pressure. Of course, if it's exact, it should be the same. But in practice, it's not. So, what we do, you just make a least square. Do you just make a least square minimization of the original data and the force and back constriction? And that should be as minimum as possible. So you use a 11-gamma-car method, Manti-Lagrangian, and you can do that with the matarse function, fin con. So it's a bit technical. You can read the paper we have published next month, actually, which is already available. Explain the procedure. And it works. The advantage of this boundary. It works. The advantage of this boundary integral formulation can be adapted in 3D. Analytic continuation in 3D. Or 3D. Okay. So you get stability estimates of some sort here? You have parameters that actually when the algorithm, I'm not an real expert on that, but the algorithm are some numerical parameters that are automatically adjusted to get the convergence. I shouldn't say too much. So here's the Shouldn't say too much. So here is the same solution as before, where we added some Gaussian noise, random noise of about 5% of the amplitude of the wave. And we did the recovery first by assuming that we know a scalar condition, the phase speed, for example, the extra measurement, and we get the red curve here. But if we do it, assuming that we know that it's a capillary weight, we know the equation, actually, it's much more constrained because Constrained because the definition of the surface pressure applies everywhere. Okay, so it's like having a redundant information. It's redundant when it's perfect, but it's not redundant when you have noises. And in that case, you could recover the free surface. And for the surface pressure, it's even worse with only the minimum and theoretical information, but with the exploiting the the equation of the free surface, we could recover the noisy data. Of course, this is a preliminary work, and it's more to do, but this is a proof of concept to show that with this kind of approach, we may deal with this someday with the real field data somehow. Okay, so as a conclusion, one more time, yeah, as a conclusion, we have shown that surface profile and surface pressure can be recovered from bottom pressure. You can extend that with constant holding. Extend that with constant vorticity. So it's straightforward in the sense that there is no conceptual difficulty, but still we have to work a bit. And it's possible to handle noise somehow. However, we are never enough satisfied by the efficiency. Clearly, when you do a banner integral formulation, it's more demanding and simply analytic expressions. Can we do something in between to improve some work in? So the perspective that we can extend. So the perspective that we can extend, we hope we could extend that with a level button, extension to 3D flows, as I already mentioned a little bit, to unsteady flow. And what may help is to have a rigorous mathematical investigation, because except for the simplest case where we have proofs, for the rest is just numerical evidence that it seems to work. But gaining some insight from mathematics could help to devise, to improve the algorithm. to devise uh to improve the algorithm or to see what kind of problem we be we may be uh running on. So, to you Yes, thank you very much.
