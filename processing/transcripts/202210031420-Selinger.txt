Theory and about how you need different types of formalism depending on what your goals are. And so I have three parts for this talk. First, a kind of historical anecdote about Dejen, and then speaking about my work with Pevny and Slukin on smectic layer geometries from 2014, and now my current work about elasticity and Elasticity and shapes of smectic layers. Okay, so to begin with the historical part, right? So, okay, I guess as an old-timer, I can tell you that in the 70s and 80s, the field of statistical physics, a very large percentage of it was devoted to understanding critical phenomena at secondary. Phenomena at second-order phase transitions and predicting and measuring critical exponents. The field is really much more diverse now in terms of its scientific content as well as other stuff. So back then, thinking about critical phenomena, one of the important issues within liquid crystal physics was Within liquid crystal physics, was studying the phase transition from pneumatic to smectic A. So the pneumatic phase having just orientational order, the smectic A phase having orientational order and also a density wave. Okay, so to model this transition, the thing that we would want to study was the onset of a density wave. And that would be characterized both. And that would be characterized both by the amplitude up here, right? That is the difference between high and low density as you move along the wave, which is very slight in this picture, and then it gets bigger and then it gets bigger. And also the phase of the modulation. That is where are the layers located, right? Are they here or shifted upwards or shifted upwards? Some more. More. So, how to represent that mathematically? Well, as Randy mentioned earlier today, I heard part of his talk, you can think about a density wave, where there's the constant background density plus some amplitude times a cosine wave, right? And the cosine wave depends on position, and then it has this. Position and then it has this phase offset. And you could think about this as the real part of a complex exponential. And then you could put together the delta rho here and the phase up there to make a complex order parameter, this sine, right? So the combination of delta rho times e to the i phi makes a coarse grain. Makes a coarse-grained complex order parameter with an amplitude and a phase, which is multiplying this rapidly varying complex exponential. What I would point out in this construction is that it does have some implicit assumption that the director is a well-defined vector everywhere, so that when phi increases, we know. Increases, we know which way the layers are getting shifted. That is surely okay for bulk pneumatic and smictic phases without defects, could create more problems for phases with defects, as I'll talk about in a little while. Okay, so if you go with this idea of the complex order parameter that Dejenne introduced. Parameter that DeJenne introduced that makes a free energy, right? You can express the free energy in terms of the complex order parameter with quadratic and quartic pieces that depend on the magnitude of the smecticorder, that is, on the amplitude of the density wave. And then this gradient term, which includes a Which includes a coupling with fluctuations in the pneumatic order. And so, and this combined with the usual Frank free energy for variations in the director itself. So, Degen constructed this free energy function, and based on that, he pointed out an interesting analogy with superconductivity. That is Conductivity. That is that psi can be viewed as analogous to a superconducting order parameter and the fluctuations delta n as analogous to the magnetic vector potential. And then this becomes the Hamiltonian for a superconductor, which has that kind of coupling between magnetism and superconducting order. So in So, in that case, the point that you can see from this is that fluctuations of the director, the delta n's, modify the transition from pneumatic dysmectic A. It's not the same as if you would just have the pneumatic dysmectic A with perfect pneumatic order everywhere. So, this led to a big research. This led to a big research program of people trying to analyze what are the effects of fluctuations in these delta N's on the transition from pneumatic to smictic A. It led to many years of theoretical research, which could then be compared with many years of high-precision experiments studying that transition. So, you know. So, you know, respect to the people who've come before us for that. So, that's a theoretical success of DeGen's early work on spectrics. And it also had an interesting extra fringe benefit, right? That based on this analogy with superconductivity, Dejen pointed out: look, we know that if you Know that if you have a type 2 superconductor and you put it in a magnetic field, it can develop a lattice of vortices that penetrate through the superconductor so that the superconducting order is disrupted right along these defect lines and then it remains almost perfect in between the defect lines. And so does Dejen suggested Smecta could. Deshen suggested, smectic liquid crystals might develop some analogous lattice of defect lines. And this was developed into a full theory of the twist-grain boundary phase by Renin Lubenski, and then it was observed experimentally. So another great success of this formalism in the early history of liquid crystal research. So that's a great story, right? A great story, right? And so you might say, well, what's not to like? Right. Well, that leads into the second point that I wanted to talk about, which is research that came many years later with a somewhat different goal. And so at that point, in the early 2000s, people were starting to do experiments to characterize smectic. Characterize smectic layers in nanoscale confined geometries. And so at that point, I was influenced by this work of the group of the Naval Research Laboratory, my former laboratory. So experiments like that led to a challenge for theoretical research, that is to predict the arrangement of smectic layers, which are subject to the layers of the layer. Layers which are subject to complex anchoring conditions. And so around that time, there was quite a lot of computational work along those lines by Nasser Bukhtier and Alejandro Ray. And that's what I got involved with in collaboration with Tim Slukin in Southampton. In Southampton, and my student Misha Pevny. So, when we got started with that work, we were inspired by the complex order parameter of Dejen. And so our notion, our first notion was that we could say, you know, let's do some kind of finite element simulation. Finite element simulation, where at every position inside the geometry of a cell, there would be a complex simulation variable. I won't use the word order parameter because Randy's taught me not to, but let's say a simulation variable everywhere inside the material. So if there's a density everywhere, let's take the Let's take the cosine as the real part of some complex number. And so, this complex number, which includes the rapid variation, this will be a not so coarse-grained definition of the psi variable. Okay. And we need to include the rapid variation because The rapid variation because that's what we're trying to model. If we want to say what's the arrangement of the smectic layers inside some nanoscale geometry. Okay. So the free energy then is this form similar to what Dejen wrote. Now it's the full n instead of delta n if we include the rapid variation as part of sine. So that lets So that led to numerical calculations to minimize the free energy over functions psi of r and n of r that satisfy the boundary conditions. So does it work? Well, no, there's a problem with that. The problem is that if you have a smictic that is confined in some restricted geometry, it could well have Well, have disclocations and even disclinations in the pneumatic order. And if there are disclinations in the pneumatic order, then the sign of the director is ambiguous. We don't know whether it's pointing up or down. If the sign of the director is ambiguous, then we don't know whether the phase of psi is increasing or decreasing. That is, if we look at a picture like this one, we could say, We could say, look, here, the phase is going up this way. So it must be increasing this way, this way, this way, this way, this way. And eventually we get around and contradict ourselves, right? So that is to say that the complex number psi is not a single valued function of position. It's a double valued function of position. Or to put it another way, that the real Another way that the real part of this complex variable is the physical density variation. The imaginary part does not correspond to anything physical. It does not correspond to anything in the experiment. It's just built in to make the calculus look nicer. The theory is treating the real part and the imaginary part equivalently as two parts of a complex. As two parts of a complex number, but it shouldn't. The real part is special, the imaginary part isn't. So, does this issue actually lead to problems? Yes, it does. So, to illustrate the problems, here are a couple of examples. In the left example, there's a fixed director field with two disclinations, right? One Right, one disclination over here, another one over there. And so, in this simulation, we solve for the lowest energy complex variable and then plot the real part. And we get a structure like this, right? Which looks like it has these kinks in the layers all along the line connecting the disclinations. That is unphysical. That is unphysical, right? That is just occurring because there needs to be a line defect. There needs to be a branch cut in the complex number psi. Really, we could put the whole branch cut into the imaginary part, and the real part could be untouched by the branch cut. But the theory doesn't know about that. The theory is treating them equivalently. theory is treating them equivalently and so it gives the real part some share of the branch cut like this leading to a prediction of a line defect which is an unphysical prediction the same occurs in this simulation where there is a disclination there's only one disclination and so the branch cut has to go all the way to the boundary okay this this is a problem and it's a problem Is a problem, and it's a problem which is really out there in the published literature. It's not just a situation that we made up. Okay, so how to solve it, right? The solution that we suggested at the time was to just work with the physical density delta rho, not with the unphysical variable. That's the imaginary part of sine. Whoops, excuse me. Excuse me, here it is. Not with the imaginary part that is here. Okay, and so to set up a theory in terms of just the real density variation, we can do it, but it's kind of a pain, right? We can make some expansion in powers of delta rho, and then there's a derivative term, but it has to be a second derivative. But it has to be a second derivative squared, not a first derivative squared. And so that includes this implicit coupling between derivatives and fluctuations in the pneumatic order, and then adding on the Frank-Free energy. So we could do numerical calculations to minimize f over the functions delta rho and the director that satisfy the boundary conditions, and it worked. Conditions, and it works. So, here are examples that correspond to the two things that I showed you earlier. And here, there are no more unphysical line effects, right? In this example, we can see the disclination over there, a disclination over there, and everywhere between the disclinations, the layer structure is just fine. There are no line defects in it. Likewise, Likewise, in this example, there are point defects in the layers right about there, but there's no line defect extending out to the boundary. So that does take care of the problem that I was pointing out. And then, you know, we used this approach to simulate a range of systems back then. Back then. So, a disk with radial or tangential anchoring, so tangential here, radial in these examples, or a system with boundary conditions that require a total disclination charge of plus or minus two in these two examples. So, okay, this it is. Okay, this is an approach to get out predictions for semicolon structure. Now, it's not the most mathematically elegant approach. It does have these higher derivatives that are such a pain to work with, but it's something. It can work. More recently, I should say, I have not been working on this type of a problem in the last year. This type of a problem in the last several years. There are two other groups that I know of that have done similar things. And so I'll point you to articles by these authors there and there. Both groups are represented at this workshop. And so, great, these people have my blessing, of course. My blessing, of course, just as long as they can make sure to avoid the unphysical issues leading to line defects that I was concerned about previously. And I would just say that as long as people are working with just the physical density variation, that's safe. But as soon as you start simulating But as soon as you start simulating some variable that is not the physical variable, that's just sort of related to the physical variable, then you're kind of treading on gin ice and you really have to watch out for the risk of introducing these unphysical artifacts. Okay, so that was my second story here. And let's see, if I have time, let me just mention. Let me just mention one other story about smectic theory, which is something that I'm working on right now related to elasticity and shapes of smectic layers. So this is a story which is based on what I've been doing recently about the elasticity of the pneumatic phase. Some of you Some of you may have heard me giving talks about elasticity of the pneumatic phase. I've got a whole ideology, and I've been trying to present my propaganda wherever I go. But it's an ideology which is based on having four bulk director modes in the pneumatic phase. The familiar ones, bend, where is it? Bend. Bend, splay, and twist. And then this other thing, another mode called Delta, which is sort of related to saddle splay in a complicated way that I don't have time really to present. But in terms of these four modes, the free energy becomes, the Frank free energy for a pneumatic becomes a nice sum of squares, right? Of splay, something times splay squared. Something times splay squared, something times twist squared, something times bend squared, and something times delta squared, which is, of course, what an elastic free energy should look like. It is mathematically equivalent to the conventional form with this saddle spray divergence term, but it provides some new perspectives, which I love to talk about, but not today. What I want to talk about. What I want to talk about today is what the implications are for smectics. So, the point here is that the smectic A phase is more severely constrained than the pneumatic. The constraint that the layers are continuous implies that there can't be any twist. The constraint that the layers are equally spaced implies that the director cannot have. The director cannot have any band. That rules out two of the four modes. The other two are still okay: display and delta modes. These two modes in a smitty A phase can be expressed in terms of the principal curvatures, right? So kappa one and kappa two, these are one over the two. Two radii of curvature, right, for any curved surface. And so the split then becomes twice the mean curvature. And delta is a tensor which has eigenvalues of plus or minus half. Yikes, typographical error here. That's supposed to be the difference of curvatures, not the sum of curvatures. Sorry about that, you guys. Sorry about that, you guys. Plus or minus half the difference of curvatures, and the third eigenvalue of zero. So, in terms of those curvatures, the free energy that I showed you on the last, a couple slides ago, takes this form, right? It involves something with the sum of curvature squared and something times the difference of curvatures. Times the difference of curvatures squared. Now, if you like, you can rewrite this in the standard form of the Helfrich free energy from biophysics, right? With something times the mean curvature squared and something times the Gaussian curvature. Okay, yes, that is absolutely true. But I want to suggest doing something different as a different way of looking at this. I want to suggest. I want to suggest thinking of the sum of curvatures and the difference of curvatures as our two fundamental modes in analyzing smectic elasticity. If you do that, then you get a new way to think about what drives favored curvature, right? What can make spectaculars want to curve? Okay, for one example, let's think about molecules shaped like cones. Okay, so if you have cone-shaped molecules and half are pointing up and half are pointing down, then there doesn't tend to be any splay, right? But if more are pointing up and fewer are pointing down, then the natural arrangement has a built-in splay. If you have a smectic phase, then that splay Phase, then that splay would lead to curvature of the layers. And analyzing it mathematically, we would tend to have a sum of these principal curvatures, which is something proportional to the polar order parameter, that is the up versus down population order parameter. And the difference of the curvatures tends to be zero. Tends to be zero. Okay, so this cone shape would induce a favored curvature. This is what biophysicists would call a spontaneous curvature, what I would call a sum of curvatures. What about for the difference? Well, suppose you have molecules that are shaped like these distorted tetrahedra, right? If you have a random distribution of their orientation, Distribution of their orientations, then you just get a perfect uniaxial pneumatic phase. But if you have some orientational order, as in this picture, then you get a spontaneous delta mode. You get a spontaneous tendency of some of these molecules to stick out this way and transversely for the other ones to stick in that way. Okay. What does that imply? What does that imply, right? Well, in that case, if you make a smectic phase, you would get the favored value for the sum of the curvatures to be zero and a favored value of the difference of curvatures to be something proportional to the eigenvalues of this octopolar order tensor. So, something proportional to the strength of the orientational order. The orientational order in a picture like that. Okay. And so then, what sort of structure would have sum of the eigenvalues equal to zero and difference equal to something not zero? Well, it could come out to be a twisted ribbon sort of geometry, like this one. These geometric constraints are perfectly satisfied right down the central axis. Right down the central axis, they're approximately satisfied close to the central axis. When you get too far out, you'll just give up and make a new central axis. This is significant because there are actually a lot of experiments that observe structures that have twisted layers and look kind of like the geometry that I showed you. One example is the helical nanofilaments in bed. Nanofilaments in bent core liquid crystals, which were discovered by the Boulder group, discovered experimentally. They have structures that look sort of like this in the cartoon. They look like this in the experiment. There's a whole range of chemical materials that produce structures that look like twisted layers like this. There has been quite a lot. There has been quite a lot of previous theoretical work, which has modeled these structures based on a favored twist due to molecular chirality. I've been involved with that sort of thing. Randy Kamien has been involved with that sort of thing. Here we see an alternative theory which is not based on tyrality, right? We see an alternative theory which is Which is driven, where the bending of the layers, the curvature of the layers, is driven by a favored difference of curvatures due to this octopolar order of the tetrahedral-shaped molecules. This is actually kind of related to the explanation from the Boulder group, which also talked about a phase. Also, talked about a favored difference of principal curvatures. So, in this way of thinking, there is chirality in the twisted layer structure, but the chirality is sort of an accident, that it can go either way. There is Gaussian curvature, but the Gaussian curvature is also sort of an accident, and that the real driving force is the difference of curvatures rather than either of those things. Of those things. And so then I would suggest: you know, a good mission for future research is to try to distinguish between those theories and see which is more applicable in any particular experimental system. Okay, so I'm running out of time here. I'll give a quick summary. In my historical anecdote about Dejen, the complex order parameter was essential to model. Essential to model the critical phenomena and predict the TGB phase. By contrast, though, with different goals for predicting smectic layers in nanoscale geometries, I find the complex simulation variable to be actually kind of misleading. And I would rather work with just the real density function. Maybe someone else will come up. Maybe someone else will come up with a different simulation variable, but just watch out for that. Watch out for these unphysical artifacts. And for the last section about elasticity and shapes of smectic layers, here I've suggested an alternative approach for elasticity theory based on this delta mode, leading to perhaps an alternative explanation for spontaneously curved structures. For spontaneously curved structures. With that, I'll close, and I thank you very much. Other questions? Thanks, Jonathan. I liked your talk. For the experiments with the fan core molecules that form these twisted ribbons, if it's based on the molecular chiral. It's based on the molecular chirality. Is one-handedness preferred over the other? Because it sounds like maybe from your arguments, if it's these achiral tetrahedra, that you would get these racemic twisted ribbons where you get both hands. Yes, if it's based on chirality, on molecular chirality, then one-handedness would be preferred over the other. If it's not based on molecular chirality, Not based on molecular chirality, then either handedness could be possible. Okay, for the specific case of the helical nanoribbons, I believe this is the PhD work of Sabeta Matsumoto, and so you may know it better than I do. My understanding in that work is that there's a concept of spontaneous chirality, right? That the first step in the argument is In the argument is supposing that the molecules, which are not intrinsically chiral, spontaneously break reflection symmetry, leading to layers that are chiral. And then Sabetto would say that that chirality, which can go either way, drives the curved structures. Might be right. Might be right. I've argued related things for lipid tubules in my work at the Naval Research Lab many years ago. This is, I think, providing an alternative story that is worth looking into. Both mechanisms could come into play, or there might be different combinations of them in different systems. Hi, Diana. Thanks again for a lovely talk. I was hoping that you might be able to say a little bit more about the numerics of how you solve your model in Section 2. Can you describe maybe how you discretize the density variation, the director, and how you actually affect the minimization of the second project, right? For the smectic layers inside a restricted geometry. Inside a restricted geometry. You know, I'm embarrassed to say I don't remember that much about the simulation details from eight years ago. I'm embarrassed about that. It's a challenging thing to do the numerics for the higher derivative. Numerics for the higher derivative problem. And I understand that to be avoided when possible. And I couldn't find a way around it, but maybe someone else will find a way around it that doesn't involve the higher derivatives. I know that this other group here on the left. Has used a very similar kind of model with more up-to-date numerics. And so I guess they would be the experts on that issue. Yeah, I'm the last author on that paper. Excellent. I can't see who's speaking now. Okay. Oh, excellent. Well, then you're far ahead of me in setting up the new barracks. In setting up the new barracks on that. Do you remember was it the final element discretization of the free energy process? I believe it was, yes. Okay, great. Was Pevney the numerics expert on the project? Pevny is the one who did the numerics for that project. I don't know if I would use words as strong as expert, but he was the one who did the numerics. But he was the one who did the numerics. And so he was a PhD student at that time and has moved on to a career outside of physics. Great, okay, thanks. Are there any other questions? Well then, let's thank Jonathan again. Thank you. Let's see. So we have a break now in the room, and then we are back in just over 30 minutes with a couple of talks on the outside and we will leave the Zoom up for now and see everybody in a web fairy net. All right, thanks. Enjoy your days and bath. Right. Oh, they're better than better.
