Closure always end. Okay, so that's the definition. I am using the dual convention that Ardila and Booker use. So where they talk about M dual, I'm talking about M, and vice versa. Okay. And the remark is that these are called metroid-Schubert varieties because there's this cosmolistic theory for metroids that we've heard a little bit about. And these play the role that classical, well, that Schubert varieties play in that theory. In that theory. And if you haven't worked with these before, I want to give a caution, which is that it's called a Matriard-Schubert variety, but it really does depend on the realization. So I will call it a Matriard-Schubert variety, but I will write it as YA to emphasize this fact. Okay, very good. So let's check I've got this as dual correct. Your YA is That's right. Cool. So, if you haven't worked with these before, there's a description of the boundary that I think is quite clarifying. It'll also make the action make more sense. I'm going to talk about a group action later. So, here it is. So, P1, of course, is the complex plane in the infinity point. Just recall from the last slide, we have a subspace. And my notation for coordinate projection is going to be. My notation for coordinate projection is going to be PR subf. So f is a subset of coordinates, and I can project onto it. And so here is exactly what the closure is. So I take my linear space and I project it onto a flat's worth of coordinates. And then in every other coordinate that I haven't projected onto, I just put infinity. I do this for each flat, and I take the infinity. These are vectors. These are vectors with a complex number or infinity entries, so this is a subset of E1 to the n. And here's an example to clear up that description. So suppose V is of dimension 2. My linear forms are these ones. This embeds V into C to the 3. Here is the hyperclane arrangement given by the kernels. Here is the lattice of flats. And here is the Matroid 2 river May. And here is the Maitroid Tuber variety. So for the whole ground set, 1, 2, 3, I project onto everything. I just see the vector space v. For singleton flats, I see a coordinate axis. And for the empty flat, I see infinities everywhere. And all of these projections are affine spaces. And so when people talk about this variety, they mention an affine cell decomposition. And this is what it is. One cell for each flat. And a little later, I'm going to talk about. And a little later, I'm going to talk about the fact that v has an action on this variety given by translation. And how does the action work? Well, in the dense cell, a vector just acts as itself. And in any other cell, it acts as its projection. So this is the variety, and this is the group action. And if you'd like an example to consider for the rest of the talk, I think this is a pretty good one. Good. All right, so. Alright, so let me just mention a few of the things that have been said so far in terms of connections to the work of the people in this room. So, first of all, there's Ardila and Boeker in 2016. They gave a very nice dictionary between the commutative algebra of the defining equations of A and many properties of the matrix. And it's sort of from their defining equations that the previous formula I mentioned. That the previous formula I mentioned follows. And another thing I want to say is that a related idea is a reciprocal plane. So this right here, C star union infinity to the n, this is an open set in the product of p1s. If I restrict to that open set, then what I see is the affine reciprocal plane. This was the Orlean-Terrell algebra that was mentioned in the last talk, or its coordinating way. Or it's coordinating anyway. Right, and so there's been other work on reciprocal planes that sort of touches many other things. So I want to mention that in terms of connecting it to various works. And in particular, there's this costumistic theory for matroids that we heard a little bit about, in which theory this plays the role of a shift. There's also this proof of the top. There's also this proof of the top-heavy conjecture in the realizable case. And this, the YA is very crucial. The proof considers different topological invariants of YA. And in particular, the topological Betty numbers count, the ith topological Betty number is the number of flats of rank I. Okay. And then I also wanted to mention this five-authored paper, many of whom are here. So there's this note. Here. So there's this notion of the intersection cohomology module of a matrix, and in the realizable case, what this is is the intersection cohomology of YA. So this is just to give a sense of what this YA is connected to. I just want to convince you that it's interesting if you're not already convinced. But you should all be convinced. Okay. And then here is this observation. And then here is this observation that I think was mentioned in the problem session yesterday, which is that this C to the D is a group under addition, and this compactification is in fact equivariant. And just, you know, here's what an equivariant compactification is. I have a linear algebraic group, a little more generally, and I choose a completion as a variety. So I put it as a dense open set in a variety x. Dense over the set in a variety x. And I have an action of the group on x that extends the action of g on itself. There's no reason it needs to be complete. You can also think about partial completions. And a very nice example of such thing are toric varieties. Okay, so one way to define toric varieties is you can just say what is the toric variety of a fan and take that as a definition of toric variety. But there's this other perspective. But there's this other perspective where you give an abstract definition as equivariant partial completions of a torus. I have to start assuming varieties are normal, by the way. But you give this abstract definition as equivariant completions. And then there's an accompanying classification theorem, which says that every variety fitting this abstract definition is classified by some polyhedral fan. Normal mean? Say again? What does normal mean? Yeah, so it means every local ring is integrally. So it means every local ring is integrally closed. Okay, so this is multiplication, the torus, the Maitroid-Schubert variety's addition. And people have considered equivariant completions of the additive group. So this was started by Brandon Hassett and Yuri Chinkle in 1999. And the theory, there are many wild examples of such impactifications. Wild examples of such compactifications, owing to the fact that the additive group is not reductive. So, many, many examples, there's nothing like a systematic classification of them, like there is rhetoric varieties. Okay. So, before I say the main result, let me just sort of review where we are and what the goals are. So, Matri-Schubert varieties are examples of normal equipment. Are examples of normal equivariant compactifications of this group, but not all of them, far from it. They're a very small subclass. And so the goal was to see if you can add some conditions in order to get down exactly to what these matrix hubert varieties are. So we want an abstract definition and accompanying classification theorem similar to what there is for tuberculosis. Okay, and here's the statement. Okay. So I put the definition and the theorem together into one. So I'll say any completion satisfying the following properties is a matrix you were variating. And what are the properties? So one thing that's not automatic in this setting is that there's finitely many orbits. So normal toric variety has finitely many orbits always. The same is not true here. And if you want an example, Here. And if you want an example, you can just think of the usual affine space inside projective space. The dimensions higher than one. Every orbit, every point at the boundary is fixed. And so there's infinitely many orbits. So in very simple examples, finitely many orbits will fail. And the original guess was that this would be enough. That if you just require finitely many orbits, you would get Matroid-Subert varieties exactly. But by poking around at this literature of additive compassion, Around at this literature of additive compactifications, I found that there were some counterexamples, certain classes of counterexamples to this. I can tell you about them later if you like. They're kind of interesting. But another condition is necessary, is the point of the story. And, you know, looking at these counterexamples and trying to find a condition that will rule them out, this is one. So I require that every orbit. I require that every orbit in my variety should intersect the closure of a one-dimensional subspace of the vector space. So, given any line in the vector space that has some boundary point at infinity, which lies in some orbit, I ask that every orbit has a point like this. And what is going on with this condition? Well, the reason why it's a natural guess is because a similar thing is true for torque rays. thing is true for toric varieties. So as I mentioned, toric varieties have finitely many orbits, but there's also this fact that every orbit in a toric variety can be reached by a one-parameter subgroup of the torus. And not only is this true, but it's actually fairly important when you construct the fan of a toric variety. Because the way you construct, if you're given a toric variety and you ask what is the fan, you consider limits of one parameter subgroups in the torus, and you ask when are two such limits the same. When are two such limits the same? And this data is exactly the data of the fan. So, if something like this classification theorem were true and it worked in a similar way, then this sort of one parameter subgroups idea could only see part of the boundary. So, this was sort of the idea. You want one parameter subgroups to see the whole boundary. So, that's the idea of this condition. So that's the idea of this condition. And I'm actually running quite fast. So I have one more slide, which is the ideas of the proof. So I'll spend a few minutes on it and we can leave plenty of time for questions. Yeah. Okay. Cool. There's a few other things I can say too if you want to ask me a question. This went quicker than I did, but. Okay. So. Okay, so there's these two conditions, finitely many orbits, and this sort of funny condition about one-dimensional subgroups. And what do they give you? What is the idea of the proof? So here's the informal slogan, which I'll make more precise in a second. So the slogan is that each orbit has a well-behaved normal slice. And this normal slice is a smaller, well, it's also an equivariant compactification. Equivariant compactification and it inherits the same properties as the bigger one. So, to be a little more precise, suppose that I have some y. y is an equivariant compactification satisfying the hypotheses of the theorem. Then it has some translation stable neighborhood u. And this u will split as a product of two things. There's a z, which is something. There's a Z, which is something, and there's also the group modest stabilizer, an affine space. And this Z, this normal slice, is preserved by the action of the stabilizer. Okay, so this is what I mean by a well-behaved normal slice. And I sort of think of this as really the main point. So these two conditions I mentioned will imply this. You sort of use these one-dimensional subgroups. One-dimensional subgroups to construct this slice. And this first bullet point also implies the condition about lines. So I think of this as sort of an equivalent way, this first bullet point, of listing the second condition, but it's a little more cumbersome to state. But I sort of think of this as the main piece of structure, the existence of this normal slice. And more is true, in fact. True, in fact, which is that this normal slice z, you know, under all these hypotheses, it's actually an equivariant completion of the stabilizer. And it inherits the same properties. So if I assumed that y has finitely many orbits, and you can reach every one with a line, then z has finitely many orbits by the stabilizer, and you can reach everyone by a line in the stabilizer. Okay? And I want to point out that actually the hardest part. Want to point out that actually the hardest part of this statement to prove is that Z is complete. So I have some open set U, and I've told you that it's a product of two things. One of them is complete, and the other is an affine space. That's not a trivial statement. But the upshot is that it's an equivariant completion satisfying the same thing. And we don't understand the boundary of y, but we can understand a neighborhood. Can understand a neighborhood of a point in the boundary of y by simply understanding the boundary of z. Because a neighborhood, really the only interesting part of the boundary is in this normal slice. And we don't under z is an object of the same sort, but it's smaller dimensional, except if you do the all-infinities point. We have to deal with that separately. But in most cases, z is a smaller dimensional object of the same sort, and so you can get this inductive control of what the boundary is. Controlled of like the Gonjas. Okay. And the sort of original proof of the theorem went just like this. There was an induction, and at every stage of the induction, you glue together an isomorphism between y and a matrix-schubert variety. And this was very messy and sort of ad hoc. And so I decided to instead structure it a little differently. You still have this. Structured a little differently, you still have this induction, but it's a little more contained. And instead, you can just say what the map is: what is the isomorphism with a major exchuper variety. So suppose I have some equivariant completion satisfying whatever I asked it to satisfy. Then I consider all of the stabilizer subgroups that happen to have codimension one. And since there's finitely many orbits, There's finitely many orbits. There's finitely many one-dimensional orbits in particular. And the group is commutative, so two points in the same orbit have the same stabilizer. And so there's finitely many of these distinguished hyperplanes in the group. And this is how you recover the arrangement. So you take these H's and you take their closures in Y. These are divisors, and each DI defines. Each DI defines a map to P1. So you have this canonical map to P1. And proving that it defines a map to P1, you need this inductive control over the boundary. Because I've defined D as a closure. And so to prove that it has a line bundle that's base point-free and has two sections, you need to know what is actually at the boundary. Not just what's in the density install. And Chris just did this. And this is what I think about. This is what I think about where, like, you know, in the dense open cell, if you move the hyperplane a little bit, it won't intersect itself. But in P2, if you take the closure of a hyperplane and you move it a little bit, it will still intersect itself. And this is sort of, this is the sort of thing that has to be avoided, actually. And you do that using this normal size property. Certainly, P2 can't map to P2. Right, certainly P2 can't map to P1. So, anyway. Okay, and then you put together all these canonical maps to P1. And you need even more, so for the D, you don't need the whole inductive control of the boundary. But to actually prove that when you put all these maps together, it's an embedding, you need sort of a little more. And so you sort of also use this idea in proving that this is an embedding. But this is an embedding, and you put it all together. Okay. Yeah, so that's all I had. Thank you very much for the opportunities. Which one do you want? Just the last one. The I was trying to. The I was trying to l listen to this through my through Torak ears and I I'm a little few. So it's sort of superheroes theorem for the first time. But you say again you're commenting about your condition to reverse this enabled. Something about that. Yeah. Can I actually ask, so when you said Simi Kurt's Deren, When you said semi-curious theorem, that's like you can cover by stable affine opens. How did you have in mind the connection between this and that? That's sort of a which one. Maybe this is an after the proposition. So I asked because it sort of sounds like how it goes. So the equivalence. So you want the equivalence of the first bullet point and condition two? Yeah, or the first two, or the first two bullet points. Or the first two, or the first two points I think is two. Or rather, yes. I guess I maybe this is a modern conversation. Yeah, something else. So, I mean, I can try in a couple sentences. So, suppose, okay, so I want to construct this sort of thing, and so I want to construct a map from u to this affine space, and z will be whatever is the fiber of this map. And so, to construct this map, I want to define. To construct this map, I want to define regular functions on U. And in toric varieties, if I have an open neighborhood of my torus, and I have a character in the dense open torus, and I want to ask, does this character extend to a regular function on the neighborhood? You can pair the character against all of the one-parameter subgroups that go to that neighborhood. And if it pairs positively with all of them, it means there's no pull at the boundary. And this is the same sort of argument. And this is the same sort of argument. Yeah. And so that's my message. Okay, let's call it here. Just upload the question. Just a little Christmas show. I think it's really nice.
