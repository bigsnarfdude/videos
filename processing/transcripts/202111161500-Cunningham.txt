Thank you so much to the organizers for the invitation to speak today. And I'll join the chorus of people wishing Bill a happy birthday. I remember giving a talk at a CMS session a long, long time ago and some strange man who I wasn't sure hadn't walked off the street heckled something during my talk. He yelled something out and he just said, you need the Greenberg transform. And I Greenberg transform. And I, yeah, I was okay, sure, fine. And I did my homework. And, well, it wasn't the first time in my life that I learned something important from Bill. So thank you very much and happy birthday. This talk, I'm just going to skip over the introduction because this talk is going to look a lot like the last one. Here's Fredun giving a talk in May at the CIRM in which he described what He described what he's calling an enhanced genericity. Is there an echo? Is there a strange echo? Let me see if I can fix that. I can fix that. Is this better? Okay, super. Thanks. Okay, so yes, Fredun described a conjecture, an extension of a conjecture that he made earlier, of course, concerning genericity, which concerns A packets. And here it is from his slides back in May and copied off again on the left. And the conjecture is that an A packet contains a generic representation. A packet contains a generic representation if and only if it's uh-oh. Okay, let's try this again. Thank you. Monica has some nice flowers if you want to show those. Okay, so let's try this again. That's good. No, that's Fray Doon, right? Yes, exactly. And the slide advanced just there? That looks good. Now we see number four. Yep. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Tasha. Yes, okay. So I'll just back up and say that my point of departure. And say that my point of departure for this talk is this enhanced genericity conjecture of Freydung that he stated back in May. And the version of this that I'm suggesting is that we simply adapt it in a relatively straightforward to ABV packets. So in this talk, I'm going to review what are ABV packets for p-iatic groups, and I'm going to explain how the conjecture above relates to Above relates to Shahidi's enhanced genericity conjecture and also the gross-prasad conjecture on genericity. I'll just point out that in the statement of the conjecture, phi here is an arbitrary Langlands parameter. And the claim is that the ABV packet contains a generic representation if and only if the adjoint L function is regular at s is equal to one. So I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about ABV packets. bit of time talking about ABV packets and how to interpret how to relate this regularity at s equal to one to a geometric notion and then back to something that we see in Frederick's conjecture. This is a tempered packet. Nope. No? Okay. So here, yeah, so here phi is an arbitrary Langlands parameter. Of course, it will not always be the case that. It will not always be the case that the ABB packet for fee contains any generic representations, but if it does, then that conjecture is that that will correspond to the regularity of the adjoint L function. And maybe I'll back up and mention the same thing here, right? So in this version of the conjecture, you've got an A packet, and the claim is that it contains a generic representation if and only if the parameter is tempered. The parameters tempered. And I think your question is basically: you're expecting to see something over here that looks like tempered. And I'm going to explain the, in fact, I'll do it right now, the connection between that notion. So this condition, regularity of the adjoint L function at s equals 1, turns out to have a very pretty geometric characterization. Very pretty geometric characterization in terms of the moduli space of Langlands parameters with the same infinitesimal parameter as Ï†. So, what do I mean by that? So, by an infinitesimal parameter, I mean this homomorphism from the V group that's produced by the Langlands parameter. And so, you get them according to this formula. So, you get a little, this is described a rule that takes you from a Langlands parameter to what I'm calling its infinitesimal parameter. Parameter. And this function has a kernel, has fibers more precisely. And that's exactly what this moduli space of language parameters with shared infinitesimal parameters describing. So I'm going to describe that moduli space for you in just a moment. But before we do that, right away, this I think answers Jim's implicit question, which is Implicit question, which is that the regularity condition that you see in this conjecture of the adjoint L-function is precisely the statement that the Langlands parameter is open in the sense that its orbit in the moduli spaces is open and dense. That seems like a good geometric candidate for genericity. You might call that generic, but the word is taken. I can't use it. Word is the word is taken. I can't use it without presuming results here. So I'm calling it open. And so it's not too hard to prove, and I'll say a few words later about how you prove this, that this notion is exactly a reasonable extension of tempered from the case of Arthur type language parameters. So, what I mean by that is that if you look at an open parameter and one that's of arthur type, then it's necessarily tempered. Arthur type, then it's necessarily tempered. In other words, if you go back and you look at this conjecture here and you say, well, suppose we're talking about ABV packets that should compare to A packets. Those are exactly the ABV packets for which phi is of arthrite. And in that case, so if phi is of arthrypel, then immediately this condition on the right-hand side becomes that phi is tempered. So can I just So can I just just for just to check by arthrity you mean it's a psi parameter but it's it's pullback to a Langlands parameter namely a representation of the Vay-Deline group by the SL2 part having the diagonal there. Exactly. That's right. That's a subset of all Langlands parameters. Right, exactly. Yeah. So if we look at the subset of Langlands parameters that are of Arthur type. Of Langlands parameters that are of Arthur type and also open, then that's a characterization of temperance. And remember, we've already shown that this open condition is exactly, well, I've stated it here, and I'll say a few words about the proof later. This open property is the same as saying that the adjoint L function is regular, that S is equal to one. And just to write down the formula that you alluded to a moment ago, Jim. Right, this is what I mean. Phi is of arthritis if there exists an arthur, an a parameter psi, such that blah, blah, blah. And of course, there's a boundedness condition in the definition of the a parameter psi. Okay, so I want to say a few words about this moduli space because the structure Because the structure of it is relevant to, yes. What happens if we replace add by something else? If you replace add. Is there any theorem of any kind that so that's that's an interesting question. I mean, the reason ad shows up is because I'm see, this is what. See, this is what Bill does. Yes, it's good questions. Because in the definition of the adjoint L function, you, of course, have this condition right here. You know what? I'm going to answer that a little bit later, why add shows up. But your question is, what can you do if you replace add with something else? And I have no L function, any obvious L function interpretation around that, except. Around that, except you know, you will, yeah, that's as far as yeah, okay. The audio is kind of bad, Bill, when you ask questions, hard to make you out. Okay, so what do I mean by the moduli space of Langlands parameters with a shared infinitesimal parameter? I just wrote down a way that a language A way that a Langlands, an arthur parameter psi, determines a Langlands parameter phi, but exactly the same sort of formula as we've already seen determines the infinitesimal parameter of a Langlands parameter. So let's fix one of these and look at all the, I promised you that there was a kernel of, or rather there are fibers of this rule. And here I'm just collecting the fiber above level. And here I'm just collecting the fiber above lambda. And it's a simple exercise about the Vaderling group to show that this set is parameterized by those nilpotent elements x that satisfy this condition. So that means that, and this is, this is what I'm describing here is, of course, work that David Vogen explained in his 1992 paper on the language. Paper on the Langlands correspondence. So we just collect all those nil potent elements x that satisfy this condition with respect to the infinite testimonial parameter lambda. And in this way, we describe a variety. It's in fact a vector space. It carries the action of this group, which is reductive, but not necessarily connected. And the vector space. And the vector space forms a prehomogeneous vector space. So, this module space of Langlands parameters with a fixed infinitesimal parameter lambda is a pre-homogeneous vector space. And that means it has a unique open orbit. And not surprisingly, that's going to play a role in the geometric arguments that we're going to use in a moment. And as an example, you can, it's not difficult using It's not difficult using odd orthogonal groups to manufacture this example where the pre-homogeneous vector space is sim squared. And right away we see the famous stratification of this space into orbits. And that describes a space stratified by smooth orbits whose closures have interesting singularities, and they play an important role in the story. In the story. And again, David Vogen pointed out long ago that the fundamental groups of the orbits in this prehomogeneous vector space are the component groups that we could build directly from the Langlands parameters P. And that means we can interpret a representation, even an irreducible representation of the component group of a Langlands parameter as a local system on one of these orbits. System on one of these orbits. And again, go back to this picture. What this means, I've identified the three orbits here in this stratification. You can calculate the equivariant fundamental groups for the action GL2 that's given and write down the corresponding local systems, and they correspond to representations of the component groups. Obviously, we're describing enhanced Langlands parameters in this way. And so, this is the basic story that if you start with an irreducible, admissible, Start with an irreducible admissible representation, and you know the Langlands correspondence, then you can write down its enhanced Langlands parameter, which is to say it's Langlands parameter and a representation of the component group, irreducible, in fact, and then reinterpret that as a local system on an orbit in this pre-homogeneous vector space, and then construct the perverse extension of that sheaf. And in that way, you get a map from. Get a map from all the irreducible admissible representations with a common infinitesimal parameter into simple objects in this abelian category of equivariant perverse sheaves on the prehomogeneous vector space. Now, this is not surjective unless I allow myself to work with G and its pure inner forms. And I'm picking a specific, you know, as in the conjecture that I stated that the enhanced genericity. Conjecture that I stated that the enhanced genericity conjecture at the beginning, I'm going to assume that G is quasi-split, and I'm going to fix work with just that one form. But if you, if you use, if you include all, then you get a bijection between the simple objects here in this abelian category. Okay, so it's a little bizarre to talk about just the pre-homogeneous vector space on its own because the group G-hat doesn't act on that. The group G hat doesn't act on that. So, if we're really talking about a moduli space of Langlands parameters, there should be an action of the dual group on it. Happily, it's not difficult. Again, this is work of David Vogen from a long time ago, to show that you can make that this quotient exists in varieties. And in this way, you can make a real moduli space for Langlet's parameters whose infinitesimal parameter is conjugate by the action of the dual group to the fixed infinitesimal. Dual group to the fixed infinitesimal parameter lambda at the beginning of the story. Okay. And so I'm just stating here again because I can expand on this point a little bit that this regularity of the adjoint L function at s is equal to one is equivalent to saying that the orbit of phi in this moduli space is open, but that's equivalent to showing that the to this to the claim that the To the claim that the orbit of phi in this prehomogeneous vector space is open. But in this case, I'll just remind you that that's the group that's acting. It's not jihad, it's a subgroup. Okay. Fortunately, there's really no loss in just working with the pre-homogeneous vector space because Use vector space because there's a natural equivalence of categories between the G-hat equivariant perverse views on X and the equivariant perverse views on this prehomogeneous vector space. These are classical things. These categories are fairly well studied. And that turns out to be very helpful. Now, in order to describe some of the proof of the Some of the proof of this little proposition that I gave a moment ago, but also to help with some of the upcoming discussion, it's helpful to describe the conormal bundle to this moduli space, or specifically to the pre-homogeneous vector space. So we start with the cotangent space, and there's a beautiful Lie-theoretic interpretation of the cotangent space to this pre-hot. Cotangent space to this prehomogeneous vector space because I'll remind you that the definition of V lambda was all x in the Lie algebra of the dual group for which this is true. And in fact, later I'm going to use And in fact, later I'm going to use y here. So, what that means is that this is picking out a specific vector space appearing in the Lie algebra of the dual group. And likewise, another pre-homogeneous vector space is determined by simply replacing the norm by the norm inverse over here. So, what you're picking out are two different vector spaces in the Lie algebra. And that means you can actually interpret the cotangent space as a subset of the Lie algebra itself by simply taking x, y and mapping it to x plus y in the Lie algebra. But much more useful is the fact that the conormal bundle to the prehomogeneous vector space also admits this Lee theoretic interpretation because the conormal Interpretation because the conormal condition turns out to be just the lead bracket. And for reasons that will be clear in a moment, so down below here is a sketch of this relationship between saying that this little proposition that says that the adjoint L function is regular at s is equal to one if and only if the Langlands parameter is open, its orbit is open in the moduli space, to describe. Space. To describe, to prove that, we need to pass to the regular part of the conormal bundle and prove this little result that says that if you look at the regular part of the conormal bundle that's above a fixed orbit C, and remember these H orbits are describing conjugacy classes of Langlands parameters, that that's contained in the, well, of course, it's the The well, of course, it's the first part is contained in the orbit C, but the second part is contained in the Piosetsky dual of the orbit C. And that's an important fact that gives you the proof of that little proposition. And so here's the crux. You look at the adjoint L function and you observe that it has a pole at s is equal to one, if and only if there's a non-zero y that. That sets this value to one. And that means that y is exactly in this dual to the pre-homogeneous vector space that I denoted v star, and that the element x that corresponds to the Langlands parameter, phi, its lead bracket with y is equal to zero. That's exactly the condition that says that. zero that's exactly the condition that says that this pair is is uh is contained in the in the cotangent space and from this you can show that um if you go back to the regularity of the of the adjoint l function um uh it's regular at s is equal to one if and only if the projection from the conormal bundle down to the prehomogeneous vector space v star hits only zero and that forces this orbit to be trivial To be trivial because this map is surjective. And that means that C itself is the open orbit because the open orbit, the PSETSC dual of the open orbit is the trivial orbit consisting of zero only. Okay. And the I want to say that we have to do that. The I want to tell you something about how you interpret Langlands parameters using the conomal bundle, because that plays a role in the proof of something else that I said earlier, which is that a Langlands parameter is tempered if and only if it's open in this sense and of arthritis. And that is a fairly simple consequence of the fact that if you build from an Arthur parameter, if you build the Langlands parameter, And then map from that to the corresponding point in the moduli space for Langlands parameters. And I denote that x sub psi right here, that that's given by this formula. We saw this earlier. If you then define y according to this formula, so you notice that you go from e to f in the sl2 triple, but you also go from the Deline SL2. But you also go from the Deliene SL2 to the Arthur SL2. That the lead bracket, these two elements commute. That's perhaps not too surprising, but the stronger statement is that the pair is contained in the regular part of the conomal bundle. Okay, and that's an important part of the proof that Langlands parameters temper different only if it's open and of arthritis. And again, just a little sort of comment as Again, just a little sort of comment as we go. Can I ask a question? Yeah. I mean, I had a paper, I think, in this Nagata volume on Kyoda Journal. Then I showed this Langlands, I mean, Langlands parameter attached to RTA parameter. Cannot have a generic one unless it is tempered. Does this have any bearing on what you are discussing? Because you are talking about this. Because you're talking about this language parameter to be tempered. Yeah, absolutely. I'm gonna pass from the ABV version of this genericity conjecture to yours, and I think that will answer your question. But is there a chance that this use of regularity is concerning you? Because it's not connected to in any, in fact, it's really not connected to the temperedness of. The temperedness of the arthur parameter. This statement is true for any arthur parameter, whether it's tempered or not, what I've given here. I mean, in that paper, I used this paper with Jasmine that I have and proved this thing. Yeah. Arthur parameter and you take the Langnon's parameter. And if that is generic, it cannot be generic unless it is tempered. I'm going to refer to that paper right at the very end, actually. Yeah. Thanks. Sure. Clifton, is this regularity you? Is this regularity? You're saying the pair comes from an Arthur parameter, then it is regular. Is the converse true in any way? Is that a characterization? No, it's not. It's very curious. Like the this is not a characterization of points in the in the conormal bundle coming from Arthur parameters. Yeah. Yeah. So it turns out that the element in the conomal bundle that's determined by an arthr parameter, its orbit under the only group in play is exactly the open and dense subspace of the part of the conormal bundle above C. And that means that the And that means that the direct, and again, that's a very, very strong miracle. This is not true for even for points in the regular part of the conormal bundle that come from, that do not come from Arthur parameters. But this miracle allows us to see that the component group that's attached to the Arthur parameter is also an equivariant fundamental group. And that means that we can interpret representations of the component group attached to the Arthur parameter as local systems. The other parameter as local systems, but now local systems on part of the conormal bundle. So previously we saw representations of the component group attached to a Langlands parameter. We can interpret those in terms of as local systems on the orbit determined by phi itself. And now, if we pass to the conormal bundles, we can see the R parameters. Okay, so I want to define ABV packets for you for piata groups, and the functor that plays the heavy lifting there is a functor that reinterprets equivariant perversions on the pre-homogeneous vector spaces as local systems on the conomal bundle. This is an idea that comes from micro-local analysis. And we can recognize, you know, there's. we can we can recon you know there's you take you take an equivariant preferred sheaf on a simple it's a vector space v uh and you're able to reinterpret it uh as a so the sheaf itself is very complicated but you're able to interpret it as a very simple sheaf just a local system in fact but on a much more complicated variety and and the um uh the the functor is defined according to this this uh this rule and here this is uh the vanishing cycles uh functor we use to lean's version we use A functor. We use Delene's version. We use an algebraic version of Delene's vanishing cycles here. And it's designed so that the stocks of the local system that you get on the conormal bundle are exactly these vanishing cycles. And these are known to relate to Morse groups or groups given to you by micro-localization. I should mention that. And I should mention that this functor, and in fact, the whole game is an attempt to take the book by Adams, Barbash, and Vogan for real groups and adapt it to p-iadic groups. Of course, the outline of how to do that was also part of Vogan's 1992 paper. Sorry, what is F in the subscript for the drive pushboard? Yeah. Drive push forward? Yeah. The vanishing cycles? Yeah. So here, CalF is a preferred sheaf. In fact, this functor makes perfectly good sense on the whole derived category, but it won't land in local systems more generally. So f is on V, and this is a sheaf on V star. And so the product is. And so the product is on the box product is on the cotangent space. And the F that you've asked about is the killing form. Okay, cool. Yeah. Again, it goes back to that fact that we have this leaf theoretic interpretation. And that gives us, that's an important part of interpreting using Deline's vanishing cycles functor here, right? Because I'm going to have to introduce. Because I'm going to have to introduce a trait from, I need to introduce a scheme over a trait in order to write down this vanish and calculate these vanishing cycles, but it just comes from the Killing form. Okay, so with this, we can recall that the ABV packet for language parameter phi is simply defined by Is simply defined by taking any irreducible admissible representation with an infinitesimal parameter lambda, and we can choose that to be the one that's attached to the original Langlets parameter if we want. Interpret that as simple perverse sheaf using a little sequence that I indicated: how you go from an irreducible admissible to a complete language parameter to a geometric language parameter, and then to a perverse sheaf. Line loads parameter and then to a perverse sheaf. So you throw that perverse sheaf into that functor, EVS for vanishing, of course, functor. And if you get something that's non-zero, then you include pi in the collection that forms the ABB packet. Just as an aside, these packets come equipped with coefficients that should be exactly what are required to make. Exactly, what are required to make stable distributions out of these ABD packets? And again, that's part that's an idea that Vogan explained in that 1992 paper. I'm going to give you an example of those in just a moment. This EVS functor is eminently practical in the sense that we can actually calculate these ABV packets in all sorts of cases. We did a whole bunch of them a while ago for odd orthogonal groups. While ago for odd orthogonal groups, we've computed all these ABB packets for unipod representations of the exceptional group G2. We've played around with general linear groups and observed that if you look at a Langlands parameter that's not of Arthur type, you may get a non-singleton ABV packet. That's very weird, but actually you see something similar in the real group's case, so maybe not that weird. And just as a little example of Of ABV packets. In this picture, I've selected six interesting representations of the exceptional group G2, one of which is Unipotent Supercospital. Unipotent supercospital and depth zero, and arranged these six representations into L packets. So we know the local Langlands correspondence for unipotent representations of G2. And the L packets are indicated here with the squares and rectangles. So this is the tempered. So these six all appear in this model. So, these six all appear in this module. They all have the same infinitesimal parameter, and they're the complete list of irreducible admissible representations with the infinitesimal parameter of this one that's dead in the middle of the story. And the group that I've just circled, that's the tempered L packet. The other three are not. But the ABV packets exactly pick up. So the ABV packets are given by these grouping. Given by these groupings. Okay? So each of those describes an A. So for example, if you start with this representation pi 1, that's its own L packet, but the ABV packet picks up these other two representations, this pi 3 epsilon and this pi 2 that appears here. And in fact, using the, I said that this functor is eminently computable, using the machinery given right here. Using the machinery given right here, you can calculate what the coefficients are in the putative stable linear combinations that you get from these ABV packets. And one of these is a tempered packet. And if you assume that this tempered L packet actually defines a stable distribution, then you can show that these other three also define stable distributions. So that's pretty strong evidence, I would say. So that's pretty strong evidence, I would say, for producing stable distributions from these ABV packets. Okay, so I think it's fair to say that Vogen's 1992 paper makes this prediction that this machinery should recover eight packets. So specifically, the claim is that if you start with an arthur parameter and then you Arthur parameter, and then you pass from the Arthur parameter to its Langlands parameter. And then you calculate this ABV packet machinery. You should exactly recover the Arthur parameter that's attached to the Arthur parameter. Sorry, the Arthur packet that's attached to the Arthur parameter at the beginning. This is not a theorem for p-adic groups yet. Again, we verified, we went through a whole mess of examples where we calculated this and also calculated those coefficients that appear in Arthur's theory, the ones that you use to build stable distributions from, and compared those to the coefficients that we defined directly from these ABV packets and verified that they match up. We did lots and lots of examples a while ago. Proof for general linear groups is well in hand, and one of my graduate students, Mashti Ray, is writing it up. Is writing it up. And the case of you might start by testing this conjecture on Arthur parameters that are tempered. And we can prove that this conjecture is true for those. And I'll write that down in just a moment. But I think this goes back to your question, Fredun, you asked a moment ago. So the point is, if you... If you think about that ABV genericity conjecture that I made a moment ago, but now you restrict to those parameters, Langlands parameters that are of Arthur type, and then you also assume that this ABV machinery is recovering APAC, then you exactly get your enhanced genericity conjecture. And that also uses this relationship between this notion of open and the adjoint L function, and when the parameter is of author type, that's exactly saying that the parameter is tempered. So you get the arthur packet on one side and the claim that the parameters, sorry, you get a generic A packet, an A packet that contains a generic representation on one side and a tempered parameter on the other. And a tempered parameter on the other. And those are the two that you matched up in your conjecture. I mentioned that we can prove the tempered case of Vogen's conjecture. In fact, we recover it by showing that if you have a length parameter that's open, so again, that's this sort of generalized notion that, well, it's exactly saying that the adjunct L function is regular at s is equal to one. Is regular at s is equal to one. In that case, the ABV packet is just the L packet. And so in particular, that implies that if you've got an open parameter and it's also of arthrypel, well, that means it's tempered. And then we see that the A packet that's attached to the tempered parameter, of course, that's just an L parameter, is indeed the ABV packet. Is indeed the ABV packet. So this machinery is compatible. And the crux of the proof of this proposition is again a direct geometric calculation of these vanishing cycles, but it again uses the fact that the open orbit has the property that its Piosetsky dual is the closed orbit and actually just the origin in the pre-homogeneous vector space, V star. And that makes calculating these vanishing cycles quite strong. Quite straightforward. And that's the key ingredient in the proof of this proposition. Okay, so now I want to make the connection to the gross side conjecture that predicts that, of course, g is quasi-split through all the back in this entire talk, that the adjoint L function is regular at s is equal to one, which we've already seen is equivalent to saying. To one, which we've already seen is equivalent to saying that the parameter is open in this geometric sense, if and only if the L packet contains a generic representation. So, in other words, this conjecture is equivalent to saying that phi is open if and only if phi is generic. Okay, so if we assume this ABV version of this claim, then we get one direction. We get that if the parameter is open, Then the packet contains a generic representation. I want to finish by just mentioning that the reverse implication follows directly. Follows directly from the Kaushan-Leuustik hypothesis for pietic groups. This is, I think, a really strong evidence, I would say, for this whole perspective, because the proof is profoundly simple, but it's inherently geometric because we're using the Kaushan-Lustik hypothesis. So, what is that? That says that that's the prediction that. The prediction that irreducible representations appear in standard modules according to multiplicities that can be exactly recovered by looking at the appearance of standard sheaves in perverse sheaves. And the representations need to be paired with the perverse sheaves according to the machinery that I showed you a moment ago. And the standard modules need to be paired with standard sheaves in the way that the language suggests. In the way that the language suggests, a standard sheaf is just a proper extension by zero of a local system on one of these strata. So you make an analysis, you do an analysis of the representation theoretic multiplicities. Again, these are ideas that go back to Vogen and Adams, Barbash, and Vogen. You do that on the geometric side. And in this way, you're able to show that if you If you start with a generic representation, you discover, well, let me just say that the proof uses the result that says that if you start with a generic representation, then that standard module is irreducible. So that's one key ingredient. And again, that goes back to a prediction, of course, that appears in this paper by Castleman and Shahidi from 1998. And work that's been done since on that by Heyerman, Optan, Muich, and Sarah Dieschols, in fact, also. Okay, so I think I'm going to stop there. And the results that I talked about today are some of them are in this paper, which is still in preparation. But most of the results that I've talked about today. But most of the results that I've talked about today are available in papers that are already published or on the preprint, on the archive. And I'll finish by just thanking a whole little army of people who are playing in this stuff with me, including Sarah, who I generally. Thanks very much.
