I'm looking forward to meeting some people that I haven't met before and acquaintances. So, at any rate. So, I wanted to mention that first, if I can get this stop, right? So, I'm going to talk about some generalizations of Cartan inclusions. There are lots of them, and I'm only going to talk about three. And they're my favorite ones. Um so um pointing out the computer that I've got the screen pointing to slip, pointing towards the screen. Yes, there we go. Well done. All right, so what I'm going to do today is I'm going to do a little bit of motivation, just a tiny bit, and then I'm going to talk about inclusions and their dynamics. I'm going to talk about I'm going to talk about cartan inclusions. By the way, I was told to give a talk for non-specialists, but I look around the room, and lots of you are specialists and know far more than me. So anyway, so there we go. So I want to talk about Carton inclusions and some of the groupoid models for them and some nice properties. Then I'll talk about some examples of non-carton inclusions. And then the generalizations I'll talk about are again. I want to talk about our gamma Carton inclusions. That's been worked with John Brown, Adam Fuller, and Sarah Reznikov. We did a few years back. I want to talk about weak Carton inclusions, and then a newer version, pseudo-carton inclusions. So here's my little bit of motivation. So back in the late 70s, Feldman and Moore defined the notion of a Cartan NASA sitting inside a von Neumann algebra, inseparable pre-dual. So they recognized the mass as an L infinity of space, and they've used the properties of Cartan masses to define a Borel equivalence relation on the space X and had countable equivalence classes, and it was a two-haunt cycle that they defined on it. But the point was they could recognize the original von Neumann algebra as an algebra of functions on the equivalence. On the equivalence relation. And that allowed them to view the original von Neumann algebra as fancy matrix algebras. So the original von Neumann algebra were functions on the equivalence relation, and the original D, the L infinity space, was functions supported on the diagonal of the cool installation. And they got a nice correspondence between A nice correspondence between unitary equivalence classes, what they call Carton pairs, and the Berl equivalence relations. The sigma was just a way of modifying usual matrix multiplication. This was really useful and it's been hugely influential. So, back in about 10 years afterward, Kungjin started looking for a Seastar analog of that, and later on, Renault built on his work and found one. I'll talk about that a little bit. Okay, so for me, for me, he's going to be talking about inclusions, and for what that is, is a pair of C star algebras. I have the D sitting inside of C, and D is going to be abelian, so nothing more than that. I like to think, when I started thinking. I like to think, when I started thinking about these things, I was thinking, gee, we're going to use the sub-algebras to study the big algebra, so that's why I write the big algebra first, but other authors tend to write it the other way around. But you get bad behavior and that much generality. So there's some non-degeneracy conditions. The C and D is unital. If C is unital and D contains the unit. So there's not much to that. Approximate unit property, if D contains. Unit property of D confrain is approximate unit for C. But people call that non-degenerate. I looked at a paper of Sarah and a co-author of hers, and they like that word. So I decided I better use a different word for this other condition, weakly non-degenerate. And that's where if you look at the annihilator of D inside C, so that's everything in the big algebra. When you multiply by an element of the little algebra, you get zero on either side. Little algebra, you get zero on either side. When that annihilator is trivial, I want to say it's weakly non-degenerate. So it's very easy to see that these three conditions I've listed in stronger to weaker, and you can't go backwards. The reason for introducing something like weakly non-degenerate is because then you have nice behavior when you take adjoined units. Alright. So let me So when you have the inclusion, I will often use X for the pure state space of D. And I'll write D bracket X just to be the Galplan transform of D on F. Okay, so now we come to normalizers. A normalizer is nothing more than an element of the big algebra that conjugates the little algebra back to itself in this way. To itself in this way. So B D V star, and the other way around, back in D. And so this N of C and D is a set of all normalizers. It's very easy to see that the set of all normalizers is a star semigroup. But less obvious is that if you fix a normalizer and you take any element of the little algebra, when you take the V V star, you can B V star, it commutes with D and it multiplies D back to itself. And I have to give a shout out to Anna Dwenig. She was reading the paper that we wrote on gamma-carton occlusions, that I'll talk about in a minute, and she noticed a gap. And this kind of relation we implicitly used in that paper, but she pointed out it needed a proof. So that led to a suite of results that have been useful. So one of those useful things. So one of those useful facts is that when you take this BB star D or V star V D and you multiply it on either side by V, you get closed ideals. So that allows you to get a partial automorphism from one closed ideal to the other. And you just take V V star times D and you send it over to V star D V and get a star is quantum. This one here? Yeah. This is what I meant. Okay. So it's going to take that ideal to this one. And if you think about this one a little bit, that's the same thing as if I put V on the left, V star on the left and V on the right. So it's this is what I meant. Okay. So These theta v's, these partial automorphisms, dualize to partial homeomorphisms of the pure state space. And so I've written down their domain and range. It's just where the Gelfand transform doesn't vanish for either V star V or V V star. And what you wind up getting, And what you wind up getting is an inverse semigroup of these partial automorphisms, or partial homeomorphisms. And they multiply in the way you hope. The item potents are just the theta d's where d belongs to the little algebra. And this is often called Reviel semigroup. I'm I'm confused. What's the difference between this inverse semi-group and the star semi-group that you had before? Oh, this one is a star semigroup of partial automorphism homeomorphisms of X, where the previous one was with ideals. So I had an ideal here. So is that your question? I guess I don't understand what a star sending is. Understand what a star semi-group is. I know what a number semi-group is. I know what a star semi-group is. So, what I mean here when I talk about a star semi-group is if you take a normalizer, you can take its adjoint and get another normalizer. And if you take the product of two normalizers, you get another normalizer. That's all I mean. Okay. Okay. So you get with this file. This bile semi-inverse semi-group, you get a groupoid, and it's inspired by the groupoid of germs for that inverse semigroup. So I'll let the y be this ordered pairs of vx, where v is normalizer, x is a domain. And two elements are equivalent if the two pure states are the same. I'll call that x. And there is a pair. There is a pair of elements in D so that the Elfon transform of each one of them on X is different from 0. But the key thing is that V1 times D1 is equal to V2 times D2. And equivalent pairs mean if you multiply both sides of that equality by V2 star, then you're getting something that's in D. What that ultimately means is that these two, beta V1 and beta V2, have the same germ at X. Have the same germ at X. So you can't go backwards on that in this generality, but that's why I say it's inspired by the Glipoid terms. Okay, so there's a natural way of putting the product on. If you have a couple of pairs, oh, I forgot to say that when you put brackets around, that's the equivalence. Line modded out by that equivalence relation. You get a product. A product in the usual way. Well, so when x1 is beta v2 of x2, then you can multiply them in this way and then inverseness. And there's a topology that I won't go through, but the point is, I've written it down, but the point is you get an locally compact topological groupoid. The unit space is, in fact, Hausdorff, but the whole groupoid needs to be. But the whole groupoid needing the, and this is what I like to call the vial groupoid of the inclusion. What is the unit space? What is the unit space? Yeah, the unit space here works out to be, the unit space is just the set of. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I just actually hadn't seen that G0x. Yeah, the G0 is just X. So it's the, well, the Gelfand space of the D. Gelfand space of D. So the assumption on groupways, so I don't forget to mention it, they're always going to be locally compact and tall, and the unit space is going to be Hausdorff. All right. You can work a little harder and get a line bundle over this groupoid. And so, what you do to do that, I'll just briefly mention it. You take the complex numbers across this y, and you take two elements in order to. And you take two elements, and you want to put an equivalence relation on it, so lambda 1, v1, x1 is equivalent to lambda2, v2, x2. If, once again, the x1 and x2 are the same, and I want the b1 x1 to be equivalent in the sense I had a moment ago, to the v2, x2. So there's the di's, so that they multiply. But then you want to keep track of this ratio. Lambda one to the value of d one at x, lambda two to the value of d two at x, those should be the same, okay? Those should be the same. Okay. And that gives you an equivalence relation. You modify the equivalence relation, you get what turns out to be a fell line bundle, and you have products that work well. And adjoint, so also works nicely. And there's a topology. And there's about 10 axioms for foul line bundles, but they're what you sort of expect. You have a line over every element of the Of the groupoid. And it does nice things when you multiply elements of the groupoid. The line, the twisting of the line, does what you want it to do. And I also want to mention that you can do this, the same construction, using an appropriate star semi-group sitting inside of normalizers. So I get this spelled iron bundle from the conclusion. So where would the, where would we use the star semi-group in this case? I'll come to that. Okay. The point is, you want to be, oh, I guess I'll say it, you want to be able to multiply the product here is going to behave well, so the line bundle will move according to the products. So I don't want to go into great detail on that, because, as I said, this was supposed to be for non-special. As I said, this was supposed to be for non-specialists. All right. So I should mention that often you see these line bundles written as twists, and that is the central groupoid extension where you have G and then the circle across a unit space embedded into another groupoid, and then you have a quotient. You can go back and forth between these viewpoints. The point is, if you Viewpoints. The point is: if you had a line bundle, over every point, you basically had a one-dimensional C-star algebra, take the vectors of length one, and then gives you something n sigma. And you can go back the other way from a central groupweight extension like this. There's a standard construction for building a line bundle. So I'm going to use whichever viewpoint is convenient. I'm going to call either one the vial twist for the inclusion. All right, so now if you think about a group, you can look at the group algebra over any field. And so doing something very similar, you get a star algebra over certain continuous, not all of them, but certain continuous compactly supported sections of the line bundle. And you can make it into a star algebra, and it's inspired by the Star algebra, and it's inspired by the idea here behind the groups. Okay, the point is, you get various C star semi-norms on this star algebra. And what I'm going to do is take an appropriate C star semi-norm. What you want it to do is the restriction to the continuous functions of compact support on the unit space should be the same as the usual sup norm. And if you have a semi-norm that has that property, you Norm that has that property, you can mod out by the kernel of it, and then you wind up getting a star algebra when you complete, and then you get an inclusion. So that's the basic idea here. And so here's the big hope. You start out with an inclusion. You build this file twist. Then you can build this new inclusion back. New inclusion back. And the goal, you hope, is that what you started with and what you wound up with are closely related and if it's really good, then they're isomorphic. So that's what you really want. But unfortunately, it's quite possible for the normalizers to be small. In fact, you can wind up having only D for the normalizers. And in which case, when that happens, you get basically nothing. You just get everything turns out to be a triviality. So when the set of normalizers is too small, you don't have much hope of using this constructed line bundle to analyze your C. Does it give you the D part correctly? It does give you the D part. You get the D back, but not much else. And so it can be sort of useless for long. Can be sort of useless for wanting to study things. A simple example of where this happens is if you take on big L2 and you take a look at the continuous functions acting as multiplication operator and add the compacts, you'll find that the only normalizers are the continuous functions. So for something like that, you run into trouble. So I want to restrict my attention. So, I want to restrict my attention to regular inclusions, and that's when the span of the normalizers, that will be the star algebra, but I want that star algebra to be dense. All right. So now I can tell you what a Carton inclusion is. You start with a regular inclusion. It's a Carton inclusion. If D is a mass of sitting inside of C, and there's a faithful conditional expectation from C on to D. And it turns out that part of the Out that part of the suite of results that from the gap that Anna pointed out is that regular mass inclusions automatically have the issue approximate unit property. And while inclusions of regional axioms are different, the C-star diagonal works out to be a Cartan inclusion where every pure state of D extends uniquely to a pure state in C. And so, simple examples. In the abelian case, well, just taking C equal to D, you get a carton. Prototypical example is n-by-n matrices with the diagonal n-byns. If you have a locally compact Hausdorff space and a discrete group acting topologically freely, then you take the reduced cross product and the C0 is embedded in the reduced cross product in the usual way. You get a Cartan pair. And certain graph algebras wind up having Cartan pairs. Pairs. And O2, ON does, for example. Okay. Yeah. Just a question. We have an ismolis nice seminar. I'm sorry. In general, we will have an ismolis nice seminar. Yes, I'm going to talk about that. I'm glad you asked. So there is one. So I've given you some examples. I want to mention that the very nicest property that I, from my Property that I, from my point of view, is that carton inclusions have a C-star, are the C-star Algebraic version of the Deldman-Moore carton. And the point is that if you have a Carton inclusion with an associated vial twist, then the original inclusion is isomorphic to the reduced c-spiral algebra of that twist together with that. So that's an appropriate norm that I mentioned. On the other hand, you get all Cartonic clues. All Carton inclusions built this way from Hausdorff and Tau effective groupoids have an appropriate line bundle. You wind up getting a Carton pair. Renault was interested only in C-star algebras that were separable and second calibility for groupoids. And Ali Raab pointed out that you don't need that. You can relate that. So now, whoops. I'm going to come back to your question. So. So, some facts about cartons that I like. One, I've had the pleasure of being around Chris Schaffhauser, and he likes to think about classification theory. And it turns out that Barlock and Lee pointed out that if you have a unital nuclear separable C-star algebra, which has a parton mass assistant in it, then you can get this universal coefficient here. I don't know what to end up about that. I'm one of the non-experts. I'm one of the non-experts on that, so I don't want to tell you what that is. Somebody here could. But on the other hand, now, coming to your question: if you have a star semi-group of normalizers, and I'll take D sitting inside of it, it turns out, and you, with the property that the span of those normalizers are dense in C, then the inherited, you have lots of C star norms you could put on the span, but the inherited C star norm from a C star norm from the original carton is the smallest C star norm. In general, there isn't a smallest C star norm when you have a star out, even though you have lots of C star output. In this case, there is. And then there's a result that recently appeared that my co-authors, John, Adam, and Sarah proved a regular ideal. Ideal, and that just means I talked about the annihilator. So for an idea you can take an ideal, you look at the annihilator in the same sense that I had before. You take the annihilator of that. If you get back to what you started with, then you have a regular ideal. And when you quotient by such an ideal, you also wind up getting a carton. And one of the things I think is sort of interesting about cartons, and it also works for the Sugo cartons that I'll mention in a little bit. I'll mention in a little bit. But if you had a pair of algebras, but not necessarily star algebras, in between, intermediate to, and if you take an isometric isomorphism from A1 to A2, nothing more than that, it uniquely extends to the generated C star algebra sitting inside of C, to the star isomorphism to the generated C star algebra of A2. So in particular, if C star of A1 was all of C, C star of A1 was all of C, and C star of A2 was 2, then the non-self-adjoint algebra carries a lot of information about the self-adjoints. So I find that sort of interesting. So about two, you really need that the pair is a carton pair. You need the pair to be a cartan pair. You can get away with cartan. And I've shown that. And I have shown that the pseudocartons that I have have similar properties. Yes, but what I mean is that you need some kind of quantitative spectrum. You need something like that, yeah. So take the continuous functions on the unit circle. Perfectly good C-star algebra. Look at the dense thing of trigonometric polynomials sitting there. There are lots of C-star norms on trigonometric polynomials. You know, just any closed infinite set, restrict the trigonometric polynomials to that, you're going to get lots of C star norms, and you're going to You're going to get lots of C-star norms, and you're going to shrink your set to get no minimal one. So, you definitely need hypotheses. So now I'm going to move away from the carton setting. And I want to give a couple of examples. The first example is abelian. But even in abelian cases, it's interesting. So if you start with continuous functions on the unit interval, and then you think of C of T embedded in the continuous functions, C of t embedded in the continuous functions on the unit interval just by functions that agree at the endpoints, you get a regular inclusion, certainly not a mass of, and there's no conditional expectation from C of 1 onto C of T. Next example is another one that I found useful when I think about examples. If I take a look at continuous functions from minus 1 to 1 into 2 by 2 matrices, that's my big algebra. The smaller algebra. The smaller algebra is set up elements in here, where on the left, for t less than 0, I want it to be in the C star algebra generated by this flip. And on the right, I want it to be in the C star algebra generated by this other self-adjoint unitary. You wind up getting a regular mass inclusion when you do that with no conditional expectation. But that I find in I find an interesting example. So, I want to move to classes now of C-star algebras where you don't have a MASA or maybe both you don't have a MASA or no conditional expectation. So, the first example is a setting is where I'm going to relax the MASA condition, but I'm still having a faithful conditional expectation. These are the gamma-carton inclusions. Cartan inclusions that I worked on with Arlon Fuller and Reznikov. So the idea is you have a discrete Achmelian group, and the dual group acts on the Caesar algebra A, and you have a fixed point algebra A, well, dual group. And then I'll denote omega goes to alpha omega and the automorphism group. So an element is homogeneous of degree t if it's an eigenvector. If it's an eigenvector for the alpha omega each automorphism. So alpha omega of A is omega T, but that's the pairing between the dual group and the group for every, that should have been a gamma Carton pair. Start with an inclusion that it better be regular. I don't want to give that up. And that A D sits inside the fixed point algebra as a Carton pair. Simple example. time pair. A simple example where it's not a mass is if you have the circle acting as just acting on continuous functions on the circle, you just rotate the circle underneath the function, and then you have a Z-carton occlusion. Now the homogeneous normalizers, so the normalizers that are homogeneous of some degree, that's n sub H. That'll be a star-sembling group. That'll be a star semi-group, and the span of those guys is going to be na. And so you can do this construction of you have this gamma-carton pair. You can form the bile twist using homogeneous normalizers. And what you get is you get a twist, but then the way I constructed g and sigma is G and sigma is where you looked at normalizers. If they're homogeneous, then they have a degree. So you get a degree map coming down from G to omega or gamma and from sigma down. And you get what we call degraded twist. So it's a 80-null twist. Every such thing yields a gamma cartonic clinically when you use the reduced cross product. Okay, reviews. Sorry. On the other hand, if the graded twist arises from a gamma cartonic, Twist arises from a Diamond-Cartan inclusion, and you return what you had before. So you get a no-style theorem as you read. So that's a theorem that I was pretty happy we were able to get. But now I want to move on to when you have no conditional expectation. The situation gets far worse when you have no conditional expectation. The reason is, suppose, I'll tell you a result. Suppose you have a universe and random. Suppose you have a unital and regular and a massal sitting inside of C. Form the vile vergoid, it's Hausdorff precisely when there's conditional effect. The other people knew that, but I don't know if they did. So the point is, if you have a regular massive inclusion, you're going to get group points that aren't Hausdorff, and that causes trouble. What do you do about that? So there are two choices. So there are two choices, as I see it. You can accept it, look for groupoid models for C and D, non-house or groupoids, or you can fight it. I've done both. So finding a means to look for a carton inclusion closely related to what you started with. And I'll talk first about accepting it, and that's the idea of weak carton inclusions, which is Of weak carton inclusions, which is purple Fourier. So, here we're going to be looking for groupoid models with possibly not the cost-sort groupoids. I need a bunch of backgrounds, so bear with me. So you start with your inclusion, once again, x is the pure state. A point is free if a pure state on D is free if it extends uniquely to a state, which I'll call phi sub x on c. Phi sub x on c. f is a set of all possible free points. When that's dense, the inclusion will call, Ruby and I call the inclusion topologically free. So Kungjin's C star diagonals have that property. And it turns out any separable carton inclusion, you can use Bear's theorem to get topological freeness. Alright, so you can refine this notion to be appellant wise. So if you start with a little C and the big C, relative to that, whenever you have a... Relative to that, whenever you have a pair of states on the big algebra which extend your pure state x, then their value on the little element is the same. So f subc is a set of free points relative to this element. And the element is smooth if the interior of the free point relative to free points is dense. And it turns out that for a mass inclusion, a mass inclusion, every normalizer is smooth. Smooth inclusion is where you have a star semigroup of normalizers so that every one of the normalizers is smooth. And it generates in the sense that the d bimodule generated by this R semigroup is dense and steep. And as I mentioned, well it turns out regular mass inclusions are smooth and you can take Of inclusions that are smooth, and you can take all of the normal answers. Now, there's an ideal that shows up when you're dealing with something like the setting. And the ideal is what I call a G for gray ideal. It's a set of elements. Well, it's the intersection of the left kernels of the extensions of the 3 to all of C. So you take a n, you look at the intersection of all the left kernels, you wind up getting a close. Left kernels, you wind up getting a closed two-sided ideal. We call it the gray ideal. And when it's we have topological freeness, the gray ideal doesn't see the ideal topological size of the intersection stream. And the gray ideal is maximal with respect to having trivial intersection. Okay, now at last I can tell you what a weak carton inclusion is. Non-inclusion is. It's an inclusion. It has the approximate unit property, inclusion in the sense I just talked about. You have enough smooth normalizers. And the gray ideal I mentioned vanishes. The vanishing of that gray ideal is a replacement for faithfulness of the conditional expectations when you have cartonic coherence. And I gave you a couple of examples a few minutes ago where those are all meat cartonic. Those are all wheat carton inclusions. Every wheat carton is regular and topologically free. If you know that you have a smooth inclusion and it's also topologically free, you can mod out by the gray ideal to get a wheat carton inclusion. In a case where your C is separable, if you happen to be carton, then you're automatically weak carton, but that's not always true in the non-separable case. You can get bad apples. Okay, so now I can tell you. Oh. Okay, so now I can tell you our theorem. The theorem is this. Start with an inclusion that's separable. We're seeing Calzberg is separable. So suppose you have a weak Cartan inclusion and you take a star semi-group of smooth normalizers. Build this bile twist using that star semi-group like I mentioned. And it will satisfy the following properties. It's second countable and topologically. Second countable and topologically free in a certain sense, which I won't say because I think it might be a microphone. You can get an essential norm on this convolution algebra. Cover your original effect of the semi-norm. That's very nice. That's very nice, and it turns out that all weak carton inclusions come from twists where you have this orange condition satisfied. So that is the Renault-type theorem for weak cartographic clips. Now we turn to fighting. What do we do about that? So, what I'm going to do is So, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to reframe Cartan enclosures. So, here, if you just had one C-star algebra sitting inside another one, I'm going to use B-supers. Relatively common time. And the inclusion has the ideal intersection property. Whenever you have an ideal in the big algebra having trivial intersection with the little algebra, that means that the That means that they started with had to be zero. I wrote down the standard axioms again for Carton. The alternating axioms are going to be the following. I don't want to give up regularity. But this time, I'm going to say that the relative commutant has to be abelian. Intermediate algebra, the relative commutant. And then I need the ideal intersection property for both. A protection property for both of those two conclusions. The last one was where I had a faithful conditional expectation. This time I removed the faithfulness. I'm going from the standard axioms to alternate axioms since we've had, had to work a little bit to get to the alternates to apply the standards, but they do. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to throw away this last condition. So large families of non-common Large families of non-carton occlusions if you were at that last incentive hexium. So you've got a pseudocarton with irregular and the relative commuton is Belian and both of them have the intersection property. Carton inclusions have the approximate unit property, but a pseudocarton may not. But luckily every suiton inclusion is weakly not. Inclusion is keeping an idea. Here's some examples. Every Carton inclusion is a pseudo-Cartan inclusion. That's good. It's not surprising based on the equivalence that the chart I just showed. I'm going to mention virtual Carton inclusions. That's just a regular mass inclusion with the aluminum suction property for D sitting inside. D and spellative comment are the same. Are the same. And I studied those a few years back, and they got further studied by Jonathan Taylor, but he called them essential carton inclusions. Every weak carton inclusion is a carton inclusion. When I started studying these, I didn't realize that, but they are. And so necessarily, all well examples I gave a minute ago. Now, you might have a third set of examples is the abelian case, and that's interesting too. You might have a pair of locally compact ausdor spaces, and you might have embedded the function vanishing at infinity x into those of y, and it might have the, and you want to do it in such a way that has the ideal intersection property. And you wind up getting a pseudocartile inclusion. If I started with C0 of X and you looked at its multiplier algebra, you'd be getting a pseudo-Cartan inclusion, but without the approximate unit property. And have an ideal sitting in there, having the approximate unit property. So those are some examples. So, what do we do to handle that? So, this is where I'm going to be fighting. So, I start with an inclusion. I want to call an expansion. Inclusion, I want to call an expansion, is a triple. A contained in B, so under inclusion. I have a star monomorphism going from C. But I wanted to carry the little algebra of into the other one, into the smaller algebra here, so it behaves well that diagram commutes. Um I want to say it is a regular expansion. If you take the normalizers for the left inclusion and apply the alpha to the set. Apply the alpha to the set, you get normalizers for the right. So that's what the regular map is. But the reason you want something like that is you want the dynamics here to have something to do with the dynamics. Okay, so I proved a theorem, oh, gee, 12 years ago or something ago. The following are equivalent for a unital and regular inclusion. You can embed C and D regular. Indeed, regular or into a carton equation. Second is you can embed it, equivalent to being able to embed it into a C star diagonal, so certain radical advantages, certain radical advantages. I wrote down what it was, but I'm not going to go through that idea in this. So that's all well and good, but there are problems with it. Problems with Problems with the theorem is that you can embed a given inclusion, maybe multiple ways in unrelated ways to cartons in various ways. And to just not much relation. The carton inclusion that I built using the theorem didn't have anything to do with the inclusion. Awful. So, what we need to do is. So what we need to do is um choose particular kinds of good kinds of embeddings and expansions. So algebra, pair AB just happens to be carton. I want to call that a carton expansion. Um a package where is there going to be expansion? Alpha is a regular map, so you're carrying normalizers into normalizers. There's a faithful conditional expectation delta from the big algebra A into the variants A and B in the following sense. You have the image of C under alpha. You can apply delta to it. That brings you down to something in parallel generated by it. That should be all of B. And then together with the image of alpha, um alpha. Alpha, you want to get the whole C-star Alsbrick generator, it should be all of that. Not assuming the energy is Cartanium disclosed here. Turns out that alpha of D sits inside the intersection property, then have an envelope. And a carton envelope, if you have A and B is carton, and the intersection, and you have the M. So that's more. And you have the Carton envelope age. Alright. Um suppose you happen to have a carton envelope for a regular inclusion. Turns out that it's C is simple, if and only if A is simple, and separability being if and only if A is separable isn't hard. But some things I've been around. Hauphauser, he likes to think about these things. So I want to know, and I haven't been able to prove, that C is new to be done with the program. Unfortunately, I don't know either one. It just seems to me one ought to be able to answer that. And I think it's I think it's true. I think it's true. So I'm going to go stick my neck out and say it's true. But I don't know for sure. Okay. So can you say why do you think it's true? Because I haven't done very much. I've got this generating property, right? I mean, I've got all the dynamics here, and I'm just adding a little bit of extra stuff. And so that's my intuition. But that's terrible reasoning. So that's why I have to leave it as a conjecture. So that's why I have to leave it as a conjecture. Yeah, you know what's up. Is there any uniqueness about the news? Oh, I'm going to tell you. Art? Anticipating what I'm going to say. So anyway, that's a conjecture. So I want to characterize the regular inclusions out of the Cartana envelopes. For that, I need to talk briefly about local multiplier algebras and injective envelopes. So if you have any old C star algebra, a local multiplier algebra is just a multiplier. Multiplier algebra is just the multiplier algebra is of essential ideals ordered. When you ideals are partially ordered by reverse inclusion, you get an inductive system and you deductive limit. That's the local multiplier algebra. And since A is an essential ideal in itself, you've got A sits inside the local multiplier algebra. Now when A is an abelian C star algebra, or local multiplier algebra, it turns out to be the ejective envelope, Hamana's ejective envelope, that's Hamana's ejection on war. That's a result of Frank Paul's. And so, um, one of the other things, the side of this local multiplier algebra has the idea of intersection property, important for me. So, I started thinking about injective envelopes before I thought about local multiplier algebra. So, I'm going to write injective envelope instead, and I'm going to use IOTA for this inclusion now. So, we've seen examples. So we've seen examples where you cannot have a conditional expectation. The good thing is you always get something called a pseudo-expectation. So here's what that is. Take, you have your original inclusion, you have iota taking D respective envelope, and want a contractive and completely positive linear mapping E, so diagram can use. Selection of all of them, I'll write new consists of expectations, a set of all Expectations instead of all of them. And as I said, because of the injectivity of I of D, always are present. Okay, usually there are too many of them. So when C is unival, if you look at the inclusion, just scalar multiples of the identity together with C, you get the state space. So there are tons of them usually. But sometimes you're lucky. Sometimes you're lucky and you have a unique one. So if you happen to know that the set of um pseudo expectations is a singleton set, I'll say it has a unique pseudo expectation property. If you happen to have that property, it's unique, and the pseudo expectation you get is faithful, then I'll say it has a unique faithful pseudo-expectation. Yes, the edition is unique, so I want it, and I want um this should have. This should have pseudo-expectation property and it's faithful. So there's only one and it's faithful. Turns out that every mass, regular and mass inclusion has property, but that pseudo-expectation may or may not be faithful. Okay, so now I can do the theorem. Um, k can you go back? Uh is the proof of the theorem constructive? The proof of the theorem constructed? Like, it does it more, like, does it is it what I think it is? Well, I don't know. So, so, so you take a normalizer and then you restrict the unit space. We might do that. The way I did it is I looked at this beta v's and I looked at the charts. It is what you think it is, though. And it's not faithful, though. But not necessarily. Okay, it does. It might be. But. Um, but here's the theorem that I wanted to show you. So, here's a characterization of regular inclusions having Carton envelopes. So, you start with a regular inclusion, following our equivalent. You have a Carton envelope, if and only if you're a pseudo-Cartan inclusion, if and only if you have the faithful, unique pseudo-expectation property. Whenever you have any one of those three, you have a uniqueness statement. Statement. The Carton envelope is unique. So if you had a pair of them, then you're going to get a star isomorphism matches up with the embeddings. And it's also minimal. So if you had a carton package, there's always an ideal sitting inside A. She doesn't see the image of C under alpha at all. It's just trivial. But then when you quotient, you wind up getting Wind up getting the Cartana envelope. I have to tell you what the Cartana envelopes are for those examples. So the first examples where I had C of the unit interval containing continuous functions on the circle, you don't do much. You just expand that continuous functions on the circle, continuous functions on the unit interval, and you just have the inclusion map of C of T in there mouthful. So that it's not too interesting. It's not too interesting. It's a little more interesting for this other twisted-up version that I talked about before. Here, you're going to take a look at your A. It's going to be continuous functions from minus one to zero into M2, direct sum from zero to one into M2. Functions from minus one to zero, where you have you land in this abelian sea and you correct summit with the same thing on the right. with the same thing on the right. And if you started with a function, um you just start with the alpha but you restrict to zero one, that gives you something up here. And you got some carton f and restricted to minus one zero on the left and one zero on the right. And that's the carton envelope. Okay, I guess I'll mention that this result you can build pseudo You can build pseudo-Cartan inclusions from a Cartan inclusion. Start with a Cartan, and you have its conditional expectation. Take a sub-algebra of B, as the ideal intersection property, and look normalizers of D. That can be a lot different. Trying to normalize D might be very different than normalizing B. So you can wind up with something rather smaller. Rather smaller. And if you take the span of the normalizers, you get that way. You get a pseudo-Carton inclusion. And if you look at the generated algebra in the sense that I mentioned before, then you wind up getting a Carton envelope for C and D. Mentioned that B prime that I've built here may be proper contained in B prime. All right, so I want to give you two questions that came up that may not be very good questions. Came up that may not be a very good question, so that's why I say they might be naive. But every unit of pseudo-Carton inclusion regularly imbends into a C-star diagonal. But not all Carton inclusions are C-star diagonals. So I'd like to know, if I start with a given pseudo-carton inclusion, not a Carton envelope, can I give you, can you tell me, can you predict based on just what I started with when I get a C-star diagonal? I get a C-star diagonal. So this says something about dynamics, but I don't know exactly what. And the second question is: alright, so we have a pseudo-carton, so D is a pseudo-carton inclusion in C. Does C automatically have a carton is? Oh, can you, can you, can you start with a pseudocarton to build the map to the carton? And I have no idea how to do that. So I've talked about group-wide models for other settings, so I should talk about that a little bit here. And I'll briefly mention what that is. So start with a pseudocarton inclusion. You have an envelope for it. And what I'd like to do is tell you how to build 3D jobs. Kungjin had this idea when he was dealing with his work. He used a conditional expectation to get a certain Conditional expectation to get a certain family of linear functionals. So, what I'm going to do is replace, use his ideas, and replace the conditional expectation with the pseudocarponents, the pseudo-expectation. So I'll tell you the init space first. So, I started with the pseudo-expectation, and then so carries me into the injective envelope, and then I take a pure state from the injective envelope, and I take the composition. So, the family of functions. Composition. So the family of functionals is a family of functionals on C now. That's going to be the unit space. For any normalizer and something one of those functionals so that it doesn't vanish on V star V, then you form a family of functionals. This is the same formula that Kungjin used. And then you look at the collection, sigma is going to be the collection of all such things. And so now I have a family of. Then, so now I have a family of linear functionals on C. And I take g is going to be the absolute value. So I mean just compose one of these linear functionals with the absolute value function. That's all I mean. And all of these can be equipped with the topology of point-wise convergence, and you wind up getting a twist. And the good thing is you get something that's housework. So here's a group ride description of the Carton envelope. So you have your pseudocarton. So you have your pseudo-cartonic inclusion. You build this central extension that I mentioned. And so you get a Gelfon map. So it's like a Gelfon map. Remember, sigma consists of linear functionals. So I'm going to say applied to a linear functional, it's just a Gelfand map. You look at a smaller algebra, the ones where the image is compact, you get a dark dense star sub-algebra. And then this mapping, Geoffon transform restricted to the smaller algebra, is a star monomorphism where you have the convolution multiplication on here. And it extends uniquely to our monomorphism of all of C into the reduced algebra of the twisted part of the reduced C star algebra of the twist together with Algebra of the twist together with the functions on vanishing affinity on the unit space. That gives you the carton envelope. So there's a sort of a group point description of it. I'm going to close with a question. I kind of like this question. So I'm going to start with a second countable, topologically free, but not necessarily help store for group 4. So if I start with a line bundle over that group, If I start with a line bundle over that group right, I can form the weak Carton inclusion. That necessarily is a pseudo-Carton inclusion, so therefore it has a Carton envelope. And so once I have the Carton envelope, I can get its bile twist. I want to know what's the relation between the started with, the G, L and G, and the line bundle from the car. Einbundled from the Carton envelope and the Carton envelope. So, in some sense, what I've done is I've started with a not necessarily Hausdorff group point, and I have a method for producing a Hausdorff one. I would like to know what the relationship is, and I'd like to know whether that GA depends on the choice of a line bundle. The line bundle really affects dramatically the essential bundle. So, I don't know of the answers to those questions. I don't know the answers to those questions. I'm not sure how to handle that. But it seems to me ought to be asked. That's what I had in mind to tell you this morning. So thank you very much. Um so I have minutes, but I will make one
