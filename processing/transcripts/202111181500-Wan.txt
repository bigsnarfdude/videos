Okay, so thank you for the introduction and thank you for the invitation. So it's my great honor to speak in this conference in honor of Pierre Kesima. So actually when I first start to learn representation theory of periodic groups, I think Kesima's famous lecture notes was one of the first few papers I read. And then you know like until now, I still go back to that paper from time to time. And when I have questions. When I have questions, so I'm so yeah, so it is really happy to speak here and happy birthday in nine days according to Wikipedia. So, okay. So, today I'm going to talk about multiplicity formula of K-types. So, basically, the goal is basically to for any real reductive group giving you an irreducible representation and also a k-type. I want to prove a formula for the matricity of that k-type in terms of the horizontal character. In terms of the horizontal character of the representation, okay, so let me first fix the notation. So let GB connected real reductive group and K be just theta be a maximum complex subgroup. So theta is the Catan evolution. So, Shita is the Tartan involution. So, in this talk, I will be a little bit abusive of the language. So, I will use G to actually denote the R point of the group. So, I don't want to write R everywhere. And then we let Pi be an irreducible representation of G. So, i, irreducible cases molecular representation. Sorry, Chen, about your abusive notation, is it G that is connected or G? Ah. I guess the group is connected. So maybe the real point may not be connected. Yes. So like I can use G01. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, thank you. So, okay, reduce a casual wallach representation. And I let tau be an irreducible representation of k. And I want to study the multiplicity of k type m pi tau, which is just the dimension of home k pi tau. Okay, end of the goal. Okay, and the goal is to prove a formula, a marketplace formula m pi tau equal to m geometric pi tau, which I will define this m geometric pi tau later in this talk. So well this m geometric pi tau is defined. Is defined with the horizontal character theta pi of pi and the character theta tau. I mean, tau is finite dimensional, so theta tau is just the trace. Okay, so uh, so before I So, before I define, go do this K-type case, so let me take a step back and explain where this formula comes from. So, actually, so this kind of matricity formula actually comes, I mean, it's not originally from K-type. This was actually coming from the local matricity problem for free varieties. So, let me before we move to the specific K-type case, so let's first consider the local multiplicity. Lacticity of spherical radis and it was to mention this GK is also a spherical idea because K is a symmetric subgroup. Okay, so now I can like say G be a connected reductive group defined over any local field F. For safety of curiosity zero. Okay, and let H inside G be a spherical subgroup. So this means the it acts on G code B with admins open orbit. And we can still let tau say be a finite dimensional representation of H. Representation of H and of course, in most cases, I just let it to be a character. Okay, and then we can still study this M pytal, which is the dimension home, H pi tau. So this multiplicity of spherical varieties. And so, and I think in the past, especially in the past like 10 or 12 years, the one of the quite productive ways to study this matricity. Way to study this matricity is actually to prove a matricity formula in terms of the horizontal character. And then you use the matrix formula. You usually combine with the theory of endoscopy or local linear correspondence and the twisted endoscopy. You can actually explicitly compute the matricity in many cases. Okay, so still like no one still wants to. Tau equal to M geometric Python and then one can sometimes in some cases not definitely not in all the cases this one can then use some theory in local government correspondence to study this market and like yeah Mark busy, and like there are a lot of known cases. So, for example, like the long cases, I think the first case is the Widaga model. It's due to load for split group and due to mobile for quasi-spring group, and also to mature motor for the act medium case. And we can also study the most non-U case, which is the group case. The group case, which i.e., is when g equals h times h, and this is related to the orthogonality of distribution characters of discrete series. And then, and then these two are like quite a long time ago, maybe like more than 30 years ago. I'm not very good at history. So, keep track of that. But I think then in 2009 and 2010, so what's 2010. So, Wasfije developed a method to prove this Mafrin's formula by using the local trace formula method. And in his work, he applied this to the unit orthogonal Gangross Plus models. And later was also extended to the unitary case by Rafael Bada PC. So, we also have the like Gangross Prasad model. And then after what we do. And then, after one treatment work using ideas or using trace formulas, then there are a lot of works in this direction. Like you might see this, I did the Ginfogeris model. And you also have, say, the Gavoa model did by Rafael. And in a joint work with Rafael, we did the Chalaga model. And actually, there are a few more exercises. Okay, so like for all. Actual things. Okay, so like for all these cases, you can actually prove such a formula. And but then the thing is, like, okay, although we have that many cases, but until like recently, so for each cases, this kind of formula is kind of like an ad hoc way. Like for each model, for example, for Widaga model, I come up with the definition of this M-geometric part. And then we basically prove the formula. And by then, I think in about two years ago, so based on all this result. So, based on all this result, non-result, I actually give a uniform definition of this M geometric pi tau, which I sometimes call the geometric multiplicity. And in a previous paper, so I defined I gave a definition. Also, this is any geometric pi at all for general spherical rights. And I also showed that my definition actually recovered all the non-cases. So, in other words, in all the these non-cases list here, my definition actually recovers all this. So, in other words, it's kind of like it's natural to expect this actually is the correct definition for general case. So, I proved that my definition recovers all the non-cases. Okay, and then a special case of my definition or Definition or and after I define this, of course, I can formulate the conjectural Maxwell formula and the local choice formula for general spherical varieties. And a special case of this kind of business is the case of k-type. And so, I mean, at the moment, I have no idea how to prove this conjecture multiplicity formula for general spherical varieties because it has a certain, I think, at least like several obstacles in the proof of the trace formula in both the geometric and the Trace formula in both the geometric and the spectral set. I cannot, I don't know how to solve it. But it turns out, at least for like for the case of K-type, it actually can be done. So, okay, so in a special case is the case of K-type. Okay, and this is roughly where this kind of market. This kind of Marquis formula comes from. Any questions? All right, so let's continue. So I just, and I also want to make a remark for experts is that, so in general, this kind of Matthews formula, you shouldn't expect it to work for order representation. This is, for example, like in the group case, you only have the orthogonality of distribution character for discrete series. You cannot do it for templates. It doesn't make sense. So, and in fact, this. So, and in fact, this formula will only work for certain representations, which depends on the analytic property of your subgroup H. So, basically, depending on whether it's strongly tempered or tempered or not tempered. And in general, if you wanted the formula to hold for all the representations, then I think the correct setup is you need to replace the matricity by the Euler-Ponkuri power. But I mean, that is, I mean, not the topic today, but now in the special case of K-type, because the sub-group. case of k-type because the subgroup h now is k is compact so the matricity just equal to the oil convergence so it's actually why we'd expect and in fact we'll prove today so that this matrix formula actually holds for other representation no okay so now let me first uh recall a briefly tell you recall like how to define this geometric multiplicity uh for the general case and then we'll i mean i'm not going to define all the notations but then we'll move to the special By the time we'll move to the special case of k-type, where I'll give you the specific definition of all the data involved. Okay, so now let's give the definition of M geometric title. So this is still the general case. Okay, so to define this, we first, which I just need one ingredient, which is the joint expansion of. Which is the giant expansion of our genuine character, which I think already mentioned in Laurence's talk on Tuesday. So we just need the ingredient, which is the giant expansion. And in fact, I only need the regular germs. I don't need all the other germs. So which is, we do have for x inside the semi-simple element, we can write this theta pi, x and the exp, say y. say y as sum of all inside the neopotent orbital integral of gx and see theta pi o of x and j hat o y and plus capital O of a flu value of one okay so we have I mean I don't I don't I mean for example like in PID case you can you can understand what is the Can you can understand what the rest they are given by the remaining non-regular Nearport orbit, but in the Archimedean case, this is actually an infinite summary. So, but for the purpose of geometric math basically, we only need this regular geometry. Okay, and then what should be the math physical looks like? Well, so we can look at, we can say, first say a baby case. Now, if GH is a finite group. A finite group. Then we know what it looks like. So then this m geometric pi tau should be just like you can write one over h sum h inside h of theta pi h theta tau bar h. And another way to write it is with sum over the conjugacy class of H and we write theta power of t theta tau of t bar divided by the normalized the centralized of so where t is any element in this conjugate class and z h ct is the centralized so we can write this Essential lab, so we can write this. So, as a result, I'm motivated by this. So, for the general case, it also looks something similar like this. So, for the general case, now for the general case. So, it will be looks like similar to this, except there are like three obstacles. So, other than these three, so it's almost the same as. So, this in general, this m geometric pi tau is equal to the integral. So, LX. To the integral, so I will explain this notation in a moment over certain conjugate class over this. So we have the y determinant to normalize it, and we have we still have this theta tau t bar. And then we need to add a few normalizing factors. So I will explain this in a moment. And then we need to use, instead of using the horizontal character, because it's only defined on regular semi-simple element, but a lot of element in H may not be regular semi-simple. So instead of using the horizontal, we use its regular jump. So, but so we need to have some GT HT. HT and summation O inside GTHT and the C seta pi O T D T okay so this is the formula and obviously this requires some explanation. So well this gamma gh is the subset. It's not all the conjugate stuff. This is the when All the conjugate stuff. This is when a difference is we are not supported on all the convex class. It will only support on certain conjugate scales. For example, think about the group case, it only supports on regular elliptical conjugates class. It's a subset of conjugate class of H. Okay, so I will not define this for the general case today, but in a moment, I will move to the But in a moment, when we move to the K-type, I will define all these data. And this GT is basically the neutral component of the central ladder of T in G, and similarly for HT. Okay, and then we also have some constants of this C and D. So this C. And D are some integers, are integers, are positive integers associated to the free pair of GTHT. So, roughly speaking, this CT, this everything in the denominator, this so this everything. So, this everything in the denominator, this is dht equal ht times this c, this is kind of an analog of this things in the finite group case. So, this is not a big deal. And the thing in the numerator, this dGT, HT actually characterizes, for example, the matricity of unrannified representation for like when the parameter is in the generic position. So, it was equal to the number of open boreal orbits times the quotient of the y. Times the quotient of the wire group of the group divided by the beta wire group of three varieties. Okay, but anyway, so these are some positive integers. And more importantly, this NGTHT is only a subset of the regular neopotent object on the centralizer. Okay, so you don't use all of them. The easy example is the for Widaga model, you actually only use one regulator. You don't use like all the regulatory. But for some other cases, you can use some. So this will, and this will be defined actually using the tangent space of the spherical variety and also the cost transaction. Okay, so in other words, so when we define this for general case, the main obstacle is really to define the support, this gamma ch. To define the support, this gamma GH, and also to define this constant C and D, and also to define the subset of regular neopoten orbit where we are using its jobs. But this definition, I mean, it's a little bit complicated for general sphere varieties, but when we come up to the K-type case, this thing actually becomes quite straightforward. So does gamma consist only of regular? So does gamma consist only of regular classes in H? Oh, no. Actually, to be special, gamma contains all the conjugate classes, such as that first, its centralizer in G will be partially split. And the second, the spherical variety, GTH, will be what I call a minimal spherical variety, which means that the dimension of HT is as small as possible. So in order for H to be a spherical subgroup, you need the dimension of H to be at least the dimension G minus. The dimension of dimension G minus dimension B. And we say it's minimal if it satisfies this condition up to the center. So this is actually the definition of gamma. So I'm sorry, maybe I missed it, but why is theta tau defined at those non-regular classes? Oh, I mean, the easiest example you can think about is you can let G equal to PGO2 and H equal to GO1. And in this case, And in this case, this gamma gh is actually just the identity point. You're only one point. Sure, no, I'm sorry. What I was asking is why is theta tau defined at such non-regular conjugacy classes? Why? Yes. After you prove the Matrix formula, it is defined in the good answer. Does that do the answer? I'm probably out of my depth here. Maybe we can talk about it after your talk. Yes, okay, okay. Okay, other questions? Okay, so now let's now we are done with this general case. Now we for the rest of the talk, we basically focus on the K-type case. So in other words, we have our G is the real reductive group. And the K is Jeta. So now let's first define all this component, all this data like ingredient in the geometric matrixity. And it turns out that's quite easy because like, so we first define the support. So we define this gamma uk be the set of conjugate class. Say T, I'm using T to say any element in this context class. Okay, such that GT, the centralized, is split modulo the center. Okay, so this means like, for example, this means the difference between the rank of G and the split rank of G is. Split rank of G is the same as the difference of the rank of the center of G and the split rank of the center of G. So, for example, in this sense, U11 will be split modulo center, even though it is by no means a split since. Okay, so you based by splitting modulo center, I mean you push on the center, then you will get something split, okay. And then now for t inside this gamma g k we let this. We let this consonant C G T K intersect G T R be the number of connected component in this B T inside inside K intersect with G G. A well B T is any Is any boreal subgroup of GT. Remember, GT is split, at least split modulo center, so you do have Boreal subgroup. So to think about this, like for example, if your group is GON, then this constant is just like this 2 to the nth power is where your maximum contact O n intersects with the diagonal matrix. So you get 0 to the to the nth power. So it's cardinality. So its cardinality is 2 to the n spawn. Okay? And in this case, the good news is this set of neopoten orbits is just all the regular nearpoton orbits. So this makes the whole formula quite easy to understand. So as a result, we only have this. Just for my, these are all For my, these are all conjugate over the algebraic closure. The regular nil closure. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah, yes, yes. Yes, but over rational, sometimes you do need to make a choice. You understand, yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, I'll ask the questions. Okay, then we define this M geometric theta theta k. So I'm defined for the general case. I'm defining it for the general case. So gamma GK over one C G T K intersect G T R. This constant we just defined and the times this ZK T cosi out K intersect Gt. So this factor is really complete analog of the factor decentralized in the finite group case. And the good news in this case, the D constant. In this case, the d constant this d constant will be equal to one, so we only have one in here. So the formula make it much easier. Then we again we have the y determinant theta k t and the c theta t d t now well this c theta t is the because now we are choosing the whole unipotent the first set of neopoten orbits so this is the average of the regular joints. Regular jumps. Okay, so you don't need to make a choice of a subset of this nearbot and orbits. So you just choose all of them. Okay, so and so we can define it for all. So well. So well, oops. Theta is a quasi-character. Theta is a quasi-character on G and theta k is a smooth function okay that is the environment on the conjugation. Okay, so here I'm using CTA general quasi character instead of just the horizontal character of representation because later we want to also use this definition to define the geometric set of the trace formula. So those quasi character is basically some kind of functions behave exactly like the horizontal character. You have this geo expansion stuff. And okay, so this is my definition of the geometric market. And for k-type, and they don't even want. And for k-type, and there is only one issue, which is this integral is not convergent. And I think even in SCL2 case, you can already find that this is not convergent. So, and so as a result, but to define it, the good news is we can still regularize the integral to make it well defined. So, almost specifically, we should put a star here. And what do I mean by star? So, the way I mean star is the integral, the star. This star is really defined by limit s go to zero plus, say, as a real number of this gamma g k. Sorry, Chen, what is your measure on the cell gamma gk? Oh, yes, yeah, I will explain the measure in a moment. Yes, this is cool. Can I also ask you something about the definition before? So you're not assuming that anything about G, right? G can be non-split, can be anything. Can be non-split, can be anything. No, no, no, I don't assume anything. G is a connected real reductive group. Okay, but your definition of gamma GK was the stabilizers, the centralizer should be split modulo its center. Yeah, modulo the center of GT. Yes, yes. Modulo the center of GT, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, thank you for learning. Okay, so with Okay, so we define it to, yeah, I will explain the measure in a moment. So, so the same thing here, but instead of using dk, I'm using dgt one half and the theta k t c theta t and I'm using delta t to the s minus one half dt. Well here delta t is d. delta t is dg t times d k t to the minus two. So this is this is the same kind of regularized process as in the unitary Gangros Plus case. So and the claim is for any s for any s greater than zero this integral is convergent and moreover the limit the right limit actually exists so you actually defined to be this and now back to To be this, and now back to Yannis's question: what is the measure? The measure is actually defined that so locally, this gamma GK, locally, I mean, you take a context class and consider its neighborhood. So, either this is a discrete point, in that case, you just give it identity. So, it's isomorphic to a product of C1 to some else power. And we just give it the measure. And we just give it the measure that comes from the canonical hard measure on C1, whose total volume is one. So then we can the measure comes from the hard measure only one with total volume one. Okay, so you can see that like to define this geometric matrix for K-type, it's actually the ingredient is quite simple. Like it's much simpler than the general like straightforward attic case. So, and later at your moment, I will, after I state the theorem, I'll give you a few examples, like what kind of, what does this set really look like? What does this set really look like? So, then just let's first let me first say the theorem. Sorry, you don't understand what it means that this is locally isomorphic to a power of C1. In fact, so I can write this as a union of some translation of a few torus. And each of these torus is C1. Up to some while group action. Up to some while group action locally. Up to some while group actually locally. So, in fact, yeah, but what about the points that are fixed by the while group? What about the irregular points? Oh, those are major zeros. You don't need to worry. I'm not talking about, I'm not talking about maximum torus. There are any torus. I'm also counting a point as a torus. So, yeah, maybe could you wait until I give, for example, I will give you an example and you can see like. For example, I will give you the example and you can see like what but just can I clarify for example if the group G is split the the trivial element will contribute will contribute discretely right yes then just the summation you're not thinking of the trivial element as being the trivial element in a torus so no no no no no it's just a torus itself it's just it's just the identity it's just the one point okay okay okay so Okay. Okay. So so the the theorem is so for this is Waltz Project. You have a W there. Oh, I'm sorry. You mentioned Waltz Project earlier. Okay. I beg your pardon. Can I ask before you state the theorem? I have one more question. Yeah. There's a there's a one half. There's a D square root somewhere. DG to the. Uh, dg to the I forget, scroll up a little bit. Yes, yes, yes, is that a real number, positive real number you're taking the square root of? Uh, yes, yes, yes. Okay, yeah, why determinant is the absolute value of that Jacobian? Absolute value in it. Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, I'm not taking imaginary, yes, yes, yes. Go ahead, thanks. Yes, okay, so for inducible smooth representation, high of you. Pi of G and for inducible representation tau of K we have the formula M pi tau equal to M geometric pi tau okay so this is uh the the theoret so uh so uh So, uh, so uh, and uh, there is also so maybe let me give you some examples to see what exactly is this set. So, let's consider, for example, g is g O to R. Then what is my set, my K? My K is O to R, right? So, now on K, I have actually three types of conjugacy class. So, on K, so the conjugate class, we have three types, and in this case, exactly, all of them are supposed. And in this case, exactly all of them are supported. So the first type is I have one, one or minus one, minus one. This is my first type. And the second type is I have one minus one. This is the element in O2. And the third type is I just have the cosine theta, sine theta, minus sine theta, cosine Sine theta cosine theta and uh i want to say i theta cannot be equal to okay uh zero and pi i hope i didn't miss anything else yeah so now what is the now what is the gt for each of the case now for this one is g o2r so it's split and for the one minus one this is g o one r times g o one r this is This is also split. And for the last one, the centralized is G01C. Well, GO1C is not a split group, but it is a split modulo of the center because itself is the center. So now back to the question about what's the measure. So what is the measure here? Is you treat these things as just points. So each of them had total volume one. But you treat this kind of cosine theta sine theta minus sine theta cosine theta locally as just the torus isomorphic. Locally, as just the torus isomorphic to C1. And you're giving it that measure. Because in this case, you have a while group X on it. So the 1 minus 1 X on it. So locally, but locally, it's still isomorphic to C1. So this is where the measure comes from. Okay, but for this example, I mean, in a way, this is not that good example because all the 20 fixed classes are supported. So maybe let me give you another example where not all of them are supported. So when G is the SP. Support it so when G is the sp4, then K is U2. Okay, and then okay, and then in this case, we have which kind of quantity class we have. So, well, in U2, I'm just writing matrix in U2. We have something like, for example, we can have, we still have plus minus one, one. We still have class minus one, one, and I also have a conjugate class of like one minus one. And so I have the conjugacy class of A, well, A inside C1, but A not equal to plus minus one. And I also have the conjugacy AA bar, where A belongs to C1 and A not equal to. And A not equal to class minus one. And lastly, I have the conjugate class A B sorry, I have more. So I also have the conjugate plus minus one B will be not equal to plus minus one, but it belongs to C one. Okay. Okay, and finally, I have the conjugate class AB, where both AB belong to C1, and AB are not equal to plus minus 1, and also A is not equal to E or B conjugation. So, I hope I didn't miss. These are all the conjugation classes in U2. And now, if you consider the central light of each of them, the first one gives you SP4. The first one gives you sp4, so that's fine, and the second one gives you sp2 times sp2. Now, the third type gives you two r so this is bad. This is not split. While the fourth one gives you U11, this is still good. U11 is not split, but it's free modules of the center. And the fifth one gives you SP2R. R times u1 well u1 is this is also split modulus center and the last one is actually a regular elliptic element so u1 times u1 so you can see that in this case among this config class either what's supported on all those config class except the third one and the measure here is given by so for this the first two we give it points and for the this one we give this is local This one we give, this is locally isomorphic to C1, and this is also locally isomorphic to C1. But this is locally isomorphic to C1 squared. And this is where the measure comes from. Okay? Questions? And you can see that sometimes it will support on element like this one minus one and like will make this thing kind of not connected. And this is related to the fact that the Spriggle variety have happy end roots. The spring variety have happy and roots, and this will always happen. Okay, so now we have this theorem about the Matrice formula. So we also have a parameter which is in terms of the, this also gives the expression of the k character, the so-called k character. So for this is the I see at least I find this in the Rio Redaki book by Wola. In the real reductive book by Warlock, so I will say if Wallach proved this so proved that so for any pi inducible of g, so you can find a continuous linear functional for this theta k pi which is on the infinity k. Infinity k this is called the k character and such that this theta k pi f is equal to tau inside the irreducible of k of the multiplicity and the integral over k of theta tau k f k d k so So in his book, Warnock proved that this is actually a distribution on K. This is a well-defined linear function. And he also showed that this theta kπ is actually equal to the horizontal character when you only consider regular element. Okay. Okay, but it did not say anything about what it looks like in the singular. So, a query to the matrix formula we have is that we actually have a complete formula for this k character. So, in other words, this theta k pi f is equal to this m geometric theta pi theta f. Well, this theta f of k this is just the orbital indicator. This is just the orbital integral of the function. K0 uns k0 d k0. So in other words, this means that we first recovered one actual result, which is theta k pi is really equal to theta pi on regular semi-simple elements. But we also know that it's only supported on, so in other words, this means theta k pi is only Kπ is only supported on this gamma GK and its value is roughly equal to is equal to the regular joint of the horizontal character. I mean modified by this constant up to the integer. So up to the integer. One or three something. Okay, so in other words, we actually. What do you mean to say that the support is this gamma GK is not a closed subset? What does it mean to say that the distribution is supported there? I guess I shouldn't say support. Yeah, this is a good point. Yeah, this is a good point. Yeah, I only want to say the formula only involves this regular element. Yeah, maybe I shouldn't say support it. I have to. Yeah, you are right. Let's not say, okay, let's just have this formula. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you for pointing that out. Yes, so yes, okay, so we just have a formula of this k character, which are really in terms of this horizontal character. Okay, I think I'm already out of time. So let me just say, maybe just spend two minutes explaining how the proof goes. So to prove the so to prove the Mafrich formula for order representation. The Mafridge formula for order representations, we basically have two steps. So, the step one is to show that both the matricity and the geometric multiplicity behaved nicely on the parable induction. And this part is almost curio. Like for mass species, this is just the Frobenius reciprocity and also the fact that we have the Yuasawa decomposition. And for the geometry massivity, it more or less comes down to our definition of the geometry multiplicity. And you have a formula which, if your quasi character is induced from a levy subgroup, then you can write the regular germ of your quasi character as the regular germ of your induced data. And by using this, Use data. And by using this, you can actually prove this. And once we are done with the step one, then we are reduced to the case of elliptical representation. That is enough to consider elliptical representation. Or like, or like, also, we can just consider all the temporal representation. So, for example, this will already prove the formula if you use induction. This will already prove the formula. Induction, this will already prove the formula if your group G does not have regular elliptical elements, because then you don't have elliptical representation. Okay, but then to prove this, then the step two is to prove it for temporary then is to prove a trace formula. A local trace formula. Sorry, doesn't every real reductive group have regular elliptic elements? Oh, so why figure out? So when I say real, yeah, we may have different definitions for regular Education. When I say regular Egyptian, I mean it's centralized, is a torus that is compact modular the center of the group. For example, when it's greater than like GLN, one and greater than two, I can say that there's no yes. Okay, so Peru is also free formula for the K-type. And so, so let me conclude by just write down. So, let me conclude by just writing down what is the local trace formula. So, the formula is of the following form. So, we take F b Johnny Caspito function, Horizon Schwartz function on G and define our distribution to be the integral over K of F of G inverse GK Kg and the theta tau bound of K D K. And then integral G co k. integral j co k eg and the geometric expansion it's just the geometric marketplicity applied to zeta f and the theta tau bar okay well zeta f is the quasi character associated to f we are the weighted orbital integral So I guess I do have orbital integral in my talk. And the spectral side, of course, should contain the matricity. So is the integral over this XG is the set of virtual temporal representations. And d pi is some constant that is not very important. Is some constant that is not very important, and theta f pi, this is the weighted character, and we have m pi bar, the mass plus. So the local trace formula we have is basically we have this IF tau equal to I geometric, f tau equal to I spec f tau. respect f tau and then after you have the trace formula then it's quite quite standard a way to you can show that the market formula actually holds okay i think that's all for my talk sorry for the overtime thank you
