And I'll turn it into speak here. So to start the talk, I want to quote an opening statement from a paper by Dewey and Andrew in 2011, which formulates the phenomena which I'm trying to follow in this talk very closely. So many properties of the non-commutative algebra in the world of quantum groups are known to be, or may be conjectured to, Or may be conjectured to be reflected by the properties of plus sunlight algebra, which are arise at the semi-class limit. Of course, that may be paraphrased a little bit. So what I do in this topic is to review a few basic backgrounds with a focus on many examples, or maybe just two five meters examples, together with. Never mind, I'm behind the curtain. Sorry, I'm trying to turn on the board lights. Behind the curtain. Sorry, I'm trying to turn on the board lights. There we go. So hard. So who's analog we're trying to review or establish on the Poisson algebra side? Of course, arguably one of the most important learning examples in the study of non-commutative algebras would be Of non-commutative algebras would be the wild algebra and their generalizations. So I'm going to start with this classic example, which is non-commutative. So to start with, I'm going to recall the definition of the well outburst and also a a big question which is now known as the Gigsmere conjecture. Conjecture. We could let the f to be a field of any characteristic for most results. But for the conjecture itself, we want to have zero characteristics. So here's the setup. And we also just have extra condition. Equals here. So by definition, what is the n well? What is the n well output? So you know this by a n with the base field k. So that is a k algebra generated by two n generators normally denoted by x1, y1, and xn. And subject to the relations, so xi, xj commute, yi, yj commute, and xi. j commutes and xi yj commutes when that ij is not equal. So we have xi equal to times xj is equal to xj times xi and yi yj equal to yji and then we have the xi yj minus yj xi and you're getting the chromat. And you're getting the chromium delta for the idea. So that is the algebra. Of course, the study of the wild algebra was motivated by the necessity in the creation of the quantum mechanics. According to my knowledge, I think the first such set of relations actually appeared in the work of Dirac in 1925. Actually, he started this algebra with the name Algebra with the name quantum algebras in a 1926 paper. So I probably put it there. This is it. I think we are already 100 years later, so I'm at 191st. And then, of course, the mathematician learned this example and went ahead to study its basics. And when they have to study its basic properties. So, first of all, since the field is to is assumed to be zero characteristic, so this algebra is simple, I think this first such study would be due to the D.E. Little. I think it's a 1931 paper. So, this is the A1 was. This is the A1, because they use the complex number is a simple algebra. What he did, of course, for the first time he constructed a basis for this one. Realize to generate x and y as infinite matrices. So that actually gives you a natural explanation in terms of the perspective of the polynomial. I mean Of the polynomial, I mean the differential operator algebra with polynomial coefficients. And then in the 1960s, the study on the well algebra gained more traction due to its close connection to a primitive quotient of the universal remodeling algebra, the equivalent E-algebras. So, in a 1968 paper, so Diggs were So Diet Spear established a few basic properties about these algebra even for n larger than equal to. Of course, as you can predict, so the a n, again, he assumed to be algebraically closed field, or maybe over the complex numbers, and it's again simple algebra. And in addition to that, it determined the It determined the automorphism group for A1. So I'm going to denote this by of any case field K. And of, so it's a 1k and this is known. First of all, the Xmir this The 60-80 paper, and then Malcolm Limonoth. It's the A4 publication. Of course, that works for any base field, even positive characteristic. And the McNeil's result actually gives you another proof for Dixon's result in the zero characteristic. And even you don't need out-rate closed field at all. Close field at all. Of course, the 1968 paper by Dietmir is very influential in many perspectives. Now, according to my understanding, at least two perspectives. One, of course, is to study the automorphism group, right? On the other hand, at the end of this paper, he raised a question whether each endomorphism whether each endomorphism of the first well algebra of the zero caliphacy field is a an automorphism. Now you know with its higher dimensional analog this is called the Dixman conjecture. So let me mention that. I'm going to write down this conjecture by the symbol DCN. That's the extra conjecture for To make conjecture for the rank end. Why, first of all, this question makes sense because the white algebra is simple, right? So it's injective in the first place. Then it makes sense to conjecture it's bijective, but that's a difficult question. If you want to prove it's bijective, it's hard. So each endomorphism Of the A and K is bijective. So it has inverse. So there has been a lot of study on this problem. Actually, many connections are found to other very important questions. So to mention one of them is a So to mention one of them is actually a job coding contributor. So just a little bit of background, right? So I'm going to again have a notation for this. I'll do note this by J, C, N. So let phi consisting of phi 1 and phi n. And if V and be an animorphism of the polynomial algebra kx1 and xn. Then you can form the Jacobian matrix that you can take the determinant. So when we set the j of this phi is equal to, of course, this phi To, of course, this phi1, phi n should be polynomials. So you can take the partial derivatives with respect to xj, and then you can take the determinant of this matrix. Now the Jacobian conjecture says the phi is an automorphism. If and only if the geocoding of this phi actually is a non-zero constant. Of course, the conjecture is trivial for n equal 1. For n equal 2, it's a lot of work, and the answer is not known yet. So the connection between these two is what? Between these two is what? So if you look at the Dixme conjecture, suppose it's true, and then this implies the Jacobian conjecture is true for N. This was noted in the work by Bas Cornell and Wright in 1982 paper. So this I'm going to just mention B C W and it's 82. Of course they mentioned this actually was noted to them. Was noted to them by baseless teen and also Karts. Now, what about the other way around? Well, that takes more work. And 20 years later, probably, if you know the Jacobian is true for 2n conjecture, that is proved by Trish Moto. I think it's 2005. And also can I love and with Consul Wich independently, I think it's 2007 and this implies the Dixman conjecture is true for N. We know the Dixman conjecture is even open for n equal to 1. So that brought me this story about the wild algebra. Again, this About the well algebras. Again, this is a very limited perspective on the wow algebras. So, this is the first set of examples I want to recall. Of course, the next set of examples would be a second running of the example in the study of non-computative algebraic geometry, which featuring as important example in the AS regular algebras. Fortunately, James just recalled the definition, so I don't have to see anything at all. So, I don't have to see anything at all. So, what I do, again, I'm going to look at some basic examples. So, we've got a quantum of spaces and the torus. So, those are the basic examples in the AS regular algebra, right? So, in the early 1990s, and the people Early 1990s, and people started looking at the of morphisms of these algebras. Since they always come as families of the algebras, depending on the permit or multi-parameters, right, you want to classify them up to isomorphism. So the first such work I want to mention again probably is due to Aleph and Jean-Ray, which is 1992 paper. 92 paper. So they're looking at the unit primary case. First of all, what is the definition? I haven't told you yet, right? So we're going to just mention up there since it's too low over there. So again, first of all, of course, it depends on the q. Again, you can generate by x1 and xn. Now, by definition, this is me what, let me actually still use the shop right there. So it means this. So it means the xi, xj commutes up to a multiple qij times xj and xi. So what is this q? This q is a square matrix consisting of those q i j is completely Obligatively skew symmetric. Then is the Qii equal 1 and Qij equal to the inverse of the Qji. So this is the F and then since those Xij commute with each other up to mode 4, so there are normal elements. So you can localize this, you can actually is you can actually get the skill ruling polynomials, right? Well, we can also call the Mikama and Petit algebras. So we can also call the quantum torus. So you can also form this K cube. But this time it's generated by x1 plus minus 1 and xn plus minus 1. Again the same relation. Relation between them. But the question is: what? Why we introduced this example, right? Because you want to find a multiplicative analog of the y algebra, which is simple. So now you want to know when this is simple. So this was first studied by McConnell and I put it. I think it's the maybe 1988 publication. So this algebra is simple. That means it only has the zero and the algebra itself as so actually I have a simple notation, right? Without writing down the connection, just write down kq square bracket plus minus one and 1 and x n plus minus 1 is simple if and only if its center is the base field. So they also of course noted this by passing and when these two quantum torus are isomorphic. So the second result is So the second result is, so we have k q x 1 plus minus 1 and x n plus minus 1. And it's isomorphic to this k. So you get another q prime with the same property like the q, excuse me metric. And you have you can use different generators y1 plus minus 1 and yn plus minus 1. Y n plus minus 1. This isomorphic to each other if and only if there exists an invertible matrix, the g, which are denoted by g ij. And this is an integer matrix, integer entries, but it has determinant either one or negative one, such that so. So your number ij, I'm sorry, QB IJ is equal to the product of this a Q i j raised there to a key. So I have to use the K T so K T I'll sum up one from again of course this is another condition first. Again, of course, this is another condition. First, u m has to be equal m because the dimension consideration. So once they're equal, so you can use the g ki and then times the g t and j. And this is true for any IG. So this is a practical can mention that. Of course, then you may want, okay, since the picture is Okay, since the picture is missing for the automorphism group and isomorphism, right? So now actually, the first result I want to mention is, like I mentioned a couple minutes ago, is the paper by Aleph and also Shamre in 1992, which says we know the authorism group. So this time Time. So, this is 1992. So, we would set the Q ij equal to Q and not root of unit for I straight to the j. So, if this is the unit from the case, and also just. Unit from the case and also generic because not the unit. Then we have the following. So we know the automorphism. So I'm going to use the KQ, X1, and XN, and over-base field K. So it's isomorphic to a torus of rank N. Of rank n if n is not equal to 3. Now what happens if n equals 3? So you get again the tours of rank 3, but you have to send me direct product or at least a copy of the base field page. Copy the base field K itself. So basically, if you take any spillet, right, what you do, you map, suppose you had, you denote your generators as x1, x2, x3, then x1 mapped to x1 itself, x3 mapped to x3, but x2 is mapped to x2 plus that scalar times x1 times x3, right? So that's how uh this group acting as the automorphism. As the automorphism. Then, what about the tours, right? We mentioned isomorphism problem. So, what about automorphism? I think the first work would be due to Alan and with collaborative for Chelsea and Small. So, this is the Kirkman. I think this is the 1994 publication. So if you look at the optimorphism of a quantum torus, which is of course, this time it has to be uniparameter, right? So you get it by kq and xy plus minus 1. And then this is isomorphic to again that they To again get the REC2 torus, and you have to semi-direct product with the SL, 2x2 matrices, integer matrices, and input. And also, not just input, but of the determinant equal to 1. So now I'm motivated by this result, right? And then more people, of course. And then, more people, of course, look at this problem. So, given a non-commutative algebra, how do you classify the automorphism? Of course, it's a general phenomenon noticed by many people. The quantum algebras are sort of rigid, has small automorphism groups. And in addition to that, you want to classify the isomorphisms based on the condition on the parameters, right? So, that's how it goes. Right, so that's how it goes. So then we recall another result due to the Ospo and Passman. I think this is the 1995 publication. So with some restriction on the permits. So the result can be quadrilinear. So the result can be, of course, there are many other results. Let me summarize the part which is mostly related to what I would try to talk today. So the first one is if you want to make sure the n is larger than equal 3, that one is actually, because equal 2 is already resolved, right? So, and if you look at the quantum torus, again, this is the quantum torus X1. This is the quantitative x1 plus minus 1 and xn plus minus 1 is simple. Then each automorphism of this quantum torus k2, x1 plus minus 1 and xn plus minus 1. xn plus minus 1 is of the format. So I'm going to denote this by phi. So you map each generate to either a scalar multiple of itself for any i from 1 to n, again alpha, of course, non-zero. Oh, sorry. I got myself carried away. I'm a single i. I mean sigma i. That's what I meant. And for some computation sigma of the one of the index 1 through n and such that the sigma you look at the qij and then you look at the q sigma i and sigma j and then you And then so this is the first part of the result. Alright, the second part, of course, what about the automorphism of the quantum torus, right? Again, there is a condition involved here. So the second part. If you know the multifaceted subgroup Generated by this cube ij is of rank n times n minus 1 over 2 then each endomorphism automorphism Of these coordinatorists, kq x1 plus minus 1 and xn plus minus 1 is again of certain, a very restrict form. So I have to play a notation for that guy here. So there's two scenarios. First one, One each map the generated to a scalar multiple of itself, and for each one of them, because the condition on the parameters, we don't have any other variations, i is equal 1 to n. And what if you have other thing? Yes, you do, you can also map to the inverse, you can actually map xi to alpha i to xi. To alpha i2 x increase for all of them. So, therefore, again, this is true for all one and through the n. So, one more result I will recall here, then I can move to the outside. So, then at the same time, I think it's unmoved and with power in a 2001 In a 2001 publication. So they actually look at the mixed case. So with the same condition on the parameters. So suppose a subgroup of the K multiplicative group, right? And it's generated generated by QIGA. Qij is again of the maximum rank. The positive one is the n times n minus 1 over 2. Then each end move, also there's one more condition, and let phi this time is not automorphism anymore, it's only endomorphism. Anymore. It's only endomorphism. B and endomorphism of the mixed quantum polygon of the algebra. That means you invert some of them but not the full tors. So it's the, yeah, you know this might k q but this time I play invert 2 from x1 all the way up to xr plus minus 1 and then Minus one and then xr plus one and all the way we should make this a little bigger of k q x 1 plus minus 1 and x r plus minus 1 and then x r 1 and then x n. Such that that the image of is not equal 0 and xj not equal 0 and then x k not equal to 0 for three distinct ones. Then this phi is an alpha system. Automorphism. So, of course, it also has a description on this kind of automorphisms as well. It essentially fades the same phenomena, either like the case discussed by Osborne and Passman. But I do want to look at this case. So, in this case, if you have the full torus, right, if you invert all the way to up to the end. Now, because the The end. Now, because the condition on this generates Qij and the utaurus is simple, right? So, in this case, the utaurus is simple. So, his result tells us, of course, the image of any invertible generate is non-zero, right? So the condition is satisfied. And you want to assume the n is larger than equal to 3. Now, what about n equal 2? Well, that can be verified directly. Every endomorphism is automorphism if the q is general. Is automorphism if the Q is generic, not of unit. So now the question is. Sorry, if I said some questions: So the IJK, they're different. You can just choose real them. Yeah, they're different. That's the only condition. Distinct. Yeah, I didn't write this. So let's see. See, distinct IJ. Okay, of course I have to make it. Okay, of course, I have to make the n larger than equal to 3 to make this happen. Yeah. Otherwise, you cannot find 3 of them, right? So now the question is, is this true? So the question is, is each endomorphism not Not the ending quantum torus, right? What about the simple quantum torus? Is an automobile the question is answered affirmatively by Richard. By Richard, probably the same time because he was working on his PhD thesis. The publication probably was a little bit later, it's in 2002. The answer is yes. So this is the Richard's result. So this is a 2002. So I'm going to summarize this different there are three There are three or more results, and I'm going to summarize them together as one big theorem. So, first of all, as I just mentioned, each endomorphism of a simple quantum Taurus is an optimism. So then he also gives a condition C when you have endomorphism is also bijective for not necessarily simple climate torus. So the second part statement would be to let Phi be endomorphismor. The endomorphism of a quantum torus, then phi is an automorphism if and only if they follow. And only if they follow two conditions are satisfied. Number one, a fee stabilizes the center of the torus. So once you have number one, you can stay number two, and the restriction Our phi to the center of the torus is actually an automorphism. So, so this statement and the C is actually an application. So, because we have a So, because we have a quantum torus, right? And you'd like to know what about the fraction field? Because it's the Gaudium ring, right? You can look at the quotients, right? So, the C is actually have a application if. So, let, I can put out there. We just mentioned C here. So, C, let. So, we're going to use the K L Q. Q This I denote the formats x1 plus minus 1 and xn plus minus 1. Suppose they have the same rank already, so they have to if you want to the isomofin drop. And another one is K Q prime, you can use the Y1 and all the way to the Y. and all the way to the y n and plus minus one e two quantum alright and with one of them to be simple of course the other one is simple as well if they're isomorphic I'm taking x1 plus minus one and xn plus minus one Mx n plus times y simple and a k q x plus minus 1 and x n plus minus 1 isomorphic to k q prime and y 1 plus minus 1 and y n plus minus 1 and if and only if And if and only if the fractal field x1 plus minus 1 xm plus minus 1 is isomorphic to the fraction field yet, okay, just a fragment. And a K Q prime and y 1 plus minus And y1 plus minus 1 and yn plus minus 1. This is the arrows header. Of course, the study of the automorphism group is a very important actually fundamental question. There's a lot of resolved, basic questions. And also, there's many people working on this. Many nice results are obtained since the 2000 in the 2000 in the generic non-volted unity case due to the rigidity of the quantum torus by Mino Yagimov and also the extension by Kenny Goodell and also the discrete method by James and his collaborators and many other people working on this. So I won't go into that. And there's also a very nice isomorphism number due to Jason Bale and James John. It tells you when to connect to that To connect to the graded algebra generally in degree one, actually are isomorphic as graded algebra. And also, Jason Gaddis didn't work in this part as well, so I won't mention the detail. So my apology for that part. Alright, so now, I've been talking about everything on one side, right? So the balance is already lost. I have to say something once again. I have to say something on the second part, right? So, the second part: the statement, as you probably projected, we got exact analogs and we have the semi-classical limits of the proofs for the Coisson case. So, what we're trying to do is, of course, is just look at some results or make some observations. Will make some observations to further bytes the phenomena outlined by Goodell and Manoa Dertikini. So first off, I think I want to just mention the definition, right? What is a Poisson algebra, at least for myself, right? So the second part, I think, let me just turn this as the second part, even I didn't write down the official number one part today. The official of number one party. So fast algebra and some observations. Just to mention, so what is a Poisson algebra? So there's many nice folks and also next notes by By Kenny Brown and Kenny Houdell, and also Dumas. You can look at their lecture notes as well. It gives a very nice introduction to this topic. So a Poisson algebra is the commutative algebra A and together with a I linear linear map which goes again by bracket goes from A cross A to A and such that so if you take the A with this bracket you get operation right so A with this opera operation new newly defined operation is a Li opera Lie algebra. So that means it's symmetric, bilinear in the first place, and satisfy the Jacobi identity. And we want more. And also we have the Leibniz rule. So we just define. So if you take a element from the A, you define the operation. So if it goes from A to itself, of course it's K linear, and it's actually a And it's actually a derivation of a drive. Now, what are the examples? How do you know better than me? The examples would be, yes, you can do it, right? Duck the way here. So you can look at the Poisson. The Poisson well algebras, of course, of rank n. So, this is a polynomial algebra in x1 and xn, because it has to be commutative. It doesn't have to be, you can also have a definition for non-commutative. I will focus on the commutative, plus on algebra. And with the bracket xi, again, x2. Again, xj commutes and yi and yj commutes and xi, yj and you get delta ij and delta. So this is the problem with delta. And it's a simple Poisson algebra in the sense, so the only Poisson ideas would be either zero or the algebra itself. So Poisson ideas basically is that a commutative idea. It's a commutative idea, and also it's closed on the operation of the bracket. So, a second example you can measure is what? There should be a match of the quantum orphan space and the quantum torus, right? So, the second example, I also want to mention this. So, we got, I don't know, this is a standard name. I don't know this is a standard name, but following the Aleph, I'm gonna call them quantum space. Yeah, I don't, because so like we're running our name in a way. So again, this is the kx1 and the xn and with the bracket xi and xj, so it's named ij, xi and xj. xi and xj. So what is this named ij? So namda is a matrix is this time scale symmetric to this day. And then we want to look like a very nice feature is what? The Poisson bracket is. Is what? The Poisson bracket is compatible with localization, which is very nice. Very, very nice. So you can do the Poisson quantum of torus. So this should be the Laurent polynomial algebra, right? So you just involve everybody to generate x1, xn. x1, xn, n plus minus 1. Again, with the same bracket, because it's uniquely determined by this generator xR and xj so it's number iga xr and xj. So the same condition on the number. Condition of the number. And also, if you follow the idea of the McConnell and Peter, and you can have a nice result, see when this Poisson torus is simple, right? So this is a result of the Dancliff. So now we're going to assume the field is of zero characteristic. That's a standard setup. So this, I think I have to put a number. Have to put a numbda here, right? Just for the record. So the k nambda distaurus and plus minus 1 to the n is Poisson support if and only if it's a sum. Hansam Center is the baseball cage. This was noted by Vancliffe in the 1999 publication and then also Budel. Of course, it's over C case, but it's working for any base field. This is a 2011 publication called the Devon Beginning. Now we can ask the same questions, right? So what about the Poisson endomorphism? So what is the endomorphism, by the way? That means it's a cumulative algebra endomorphism, and also it respects the Poisson bracket. But before I But before I go ahead and state the last result, I want to mention a result of Goodell and Nanoa in that paper, which is actually, among many other important things, is to address the isomovism of the Poisson field. Because for this one, you can actually go ahead and define the Poisson field, right? So I'm going to actually put one more thing up here. It's the Poisson quantum. Quantum, our field. So use the same notation, just use K number, but you use the smooth bracket x1 and xn. So it's a field, right? And then you can extend the Poisson bracket from the previous cases to this one. So now we have a theorem. This is Medill. This is Mgo and a nano and two thousand eleven so with some condition if a group generated by this number ij as a Bini group right is of Of rank n ten n minus one over two, or if the cyclic or is and the matrix number equal to number ij is invertible then the isomortism of the The isomorphism of the Poisson quantum torus, I'm going to give you this xi plus minus 1 and to this k and since we use little lambda right for little mu and then x use the yi plus minus 1, they're all the same right, right? And this is only if and only if they correspond being k namda. being k namba xi plus minus 1 is isomorphic to the k mu xi plus y i so this of course already assumed the energy quotient so they solved in three major cases so one last line I want to state here is we have a We have an exact animal of this one with some clarifications. So I'm going to just put this here as and then so the major result is what? Each and the Muslim Of a simple Poisson torus is and automorphism. And with the same applications to the study of the Poisson field, so we can actually prove a little bit beyond these three cases. Beyond these three cases, when they pass on, so the second one is just as a patient. So this k lambda xi plus minus 1 is isomorphic to the k mu y i plus minus 1. But they are isomorphic, right? And if and only if the corresponding torus, K lambda x plus minus R isomorphic. But this is of course not always true if in the case k lambda the torus xi plus minus one is simple. And we also And we also have a criterion. So each endomorphism phi of this Poisson total k lambda of xi plus minus 1, nothing necessarily simple, is an automorphism. So just mention. So just mention to complete the picture if and only if so first point is phi stabilizes the parcel center and the restriction of the fee Of the phi is to center is and optimalism. Yeah, that is all I got to say. Thank you. Any questions? In your statement too, in the birational equivalence automation, do you have exactly when these lambda mu's are isomorphic? Yeah, they actually, you can, because when you can mimic the common predictor condition, basically this time you they have to require the existence of a matrix you call G. G which is invertible, of course. Such that the lambda is equal to, it depends how you multiply it from the left or right. So if you use the notation, the transpose is on the right hand side. So I follow the retrospect sort of notation, it's on the left. So it's the transpose. That's on the left, so it's the transpose times the mu merge. So this implies actually: so the k number xi plus minus 1 can be 1 L here plus 1. Okay, you can check that. Does that answer your question? Yes, I can. Are there other questions? Are there other questions? Are there any questions in Zoom? I don't know why I'm yelling at them. But nonetheless, thank Speaker Gun. So we have lunch now, and there's no
