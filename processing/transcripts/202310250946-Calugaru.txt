So yeah convince you that the heavy fermion paradigm is really a very intuitive and natural way of thinking about the twisted bilayer graphic problem. So before we get started, I just want to say that this presentation is a result of a theory, experiment, and heavy numerics collaboration between Arni's group, Professors Velik, Tima's experimental group and the DMFT groups of Professors Valenti, Sangiovani and Welling. Professors Valenti, Sanjovani, and Welling. And most of the results that I'm going to show are already published, with the key exception being our newest theory backed by experiment calculations on transport, which will be on archive soon. Okay, so throughout my talk, I'll be primarily concerned with twisted bilayer graphene, with the caveat that heavy fermion descriptions can be formulated successfully in other platforms, other monographs. In other platforms, other monographing systems such as twisted tri-layer or twisted double bilayer. Okay, so what makes twisted bilayer graphing so interesting is that close to the so-called magic handles, we all know that the interlayer hopping hybridizes the Dirac point stemming from the two different layers and gives rise to these flat bands near charge neutrality. In addition to that, these bands are not atomic. Are not atomic. So, first, based on topological quantum chemistry, they were shown to be topologically fragile. And further investigations have shown that actually they harbor stable topology, which means that you cannot build any lattice model with any number of bands that correctly reproduces this flat band. So, placid bilayer graphene is a very interesting material, not necessarily because of its wire pattern, but because it combines some correlations with topology. With topology. So, this later combination of non-trivial topology at the single particle level and strong interaction makes TBG so special. So, usually one of these two ingredients is enough to render a material very interesting. So, as a result of these two, a lot of interesting physics has been observed experimentally in Listed Vilographine. As we all know, the most well-known are its correlated insulating states and the superconducting phases that occur. Superconducting phases that occur in between. So, in addition to that, we have many other exotic phenomena that one could spend hours talking about, such as strange metal phases, Pomeranchuka effect, fractional churn insulators, and many, many others. So, by far the most ubiquitous and unconventional, nevertheless, phase of matter measured in DBG systems have been its correlating insulating states. So, as seen in these upper plots, these induce resistivity. These induce resistivity peaks at integer fillings of the flat mass. In between some of these correlated insulators, we find superconducting phases in a picture that is somehow reminiscent of cuprates. The DPG superconductors can thus be understood as stemming from the doping of the correlated insulator. So, if we have any hope, to have any hope of understanding the superconductivity in TPG, at the very minimum, we need a very accurate. Very minimum, we need a very accurate and intuitive theoretical model that can clearly capture the correlated insulators. So, before attempting such a theory, it's worth pondering about an apparent contradiction seen by experiments on TBG. So, on the one hand, you have experiments that suggest TBG is basically governed by local moment physics, and chief of which are And chief of which are quantum dot-like behaviors seen in SDM, Pomeran-Chuck effect, and even these ferromagnetic correlated incidents. Can I ask, at least for the mathematicians, can you define a local moment? Local moment. Think of a spin. Think of a spin that doesn't really talk with other spins, right? Like that that would be a local moment. Like, you know, you can you can you can uh imagine an electron, right, and the charge degree of freedom is frozen, so the electron is always there. Frozen, so the electron is always there. The electron still has a spin, right? Point up and down. Yeah. So, on the other hand, right, you have experiments that suggest that DBG has a delocalized nature. And of course, you have experiments showing metallicity and superconductivity. So, the heavy fermion model tries to model the physics of TPG in a way that solves this apparent dichotomy. No more question. Sure. Sure, go ahead. I just wanted to ask if the STM blockade is really, like, would you expect to see the same thing in, like, for example, at L level, where there's strong flow of interactions? I mean, I don't know off the top of my head. So it might be the case that you can see something similar, but I don't know off the top of my head. So the real evidence for fluctuating moments is probably more so the PongRank chart than. Humoring shark. Yeah, probably. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So the starting point for studying TPG is the Bisitzer-McDonald model. However, the Bischitzer-McDonald model is in momentum space and momentum space models often obscure the more intuitive physics. And that's why many times physicists prefer real space description. However, as we discussed previously, the flat bands of TBG have non-trivial topology. So if one computes this So, if one computes this momentum space irreducible representation for the flatbands, we find that they cannot be expressed as an atomic limit. However, as I said, if one insists on preserving the particle hole symmetry of the model, which in some limit is an excellent approximation, you find that no lattice model with any number of bands can realize the DPG flatbands. So, the heavy fermion model gets around this. This obstruction in a very clever way. So, the approach it employs is the following. Suppose that I can somehow borrow this gamma3 I rep of the remote bands. Then I find that I can trivialize the two active bands near charge neutrality. They actually correspond to Px plus minus Py one year orbitals. So I take these orbitals, I call them F electrons, and I can see that, as shown in these dots, they As shown in these dots, they already reproduce more than 95% of the flatband. So in order to model the remaining 5% of the flatband, the heavy fermion model introduces anomalous C electrons. So one way you can think about the heavy fermion at the single particle level is that you have these localized F electrons, which sort of carry the flatness, right? And to that, Flatness, right? And to that, you add this double Dirac cone formed by the C electrons, which carry the topology. And by hybridizing the F and C electrons, you get these flatbands and the necessary band inversion that recovers the correct topology of the platinum. At a single particle level, the topological heavy fermion model has very few parameters, and most like all of them. And most, like all of them, have a very clear meaning. For example, you have this: the width of the flat bands is given by this 2m parameter, the gap between the flat bands and the remote bands is given by the gamma parameter, which also sort of quantifies the hybridization between the C electrons and the F electrons. What's a C electron? The C electron is, like, the F electron is basically covers nine. F-electron is basically covers 95% of the flat land. And to get the remaining 5%, get the correct wave function near the gamma point, introduce this anomalous C electron. You can think of them as some kind of double Dirac cones that you need to add. So once you have the single particle model of TBG, obtaining the interaction Hamilton becomes a question of simply projecting the Coulomb repulsion into this F and C basis. This F and C basis. So, can this procedure be understood as a manual way of doing this entanglement? I mean, yes, but at the end of the day, it's not manual, because we still use one year 90 to sort of one yearize the bands, right? But we one-yearize within a window that includes a bit of the remote bands, right? So that's why I said that I'm borrowing sorry, that's why I said that I'm borrowing these Said that I'm borrowing these IREPs from the remote bands, right? And I model the remaining stuff, you know, these gamma 1, gamma 2 IREPs, by these anomalous C electrons. The 198 has a built-in disentangle procedure? Yes, yes. You only use, you don't use this. No, I do use the disentanglement procedure, yes. So, like, I fix my disentanglement window to include this, right? And I ask one United to project on Px and Py orbitals, right? That gives me these red dots. That gives me these red dots, which are the flatbands, mostly 95% of the flatbands, and I model the remaining state sort of manually by adding these C-electrons. So the 190 only gives you the PXPY, so it's a fixed number. Yeah, but you can you can model that from one in 90 because you know the projector, you can build the projector into the remaining bands, right? So you can also find that from the one in 90 results. Find that from the 1 year90 result. But you can also find it just by symmetry arguments. Yeah, we can chat about that afterwards. Yeah, so as I said, once you have the spaces, it's very easy to build the interacting Hamiltonian. You find four key terms. So on the one hand, you have a Hubbard interaction of the F electrons. Then you have some Coulomb repulsion between the F and C electron, this density-density interaction. You have some ferromagnetic. Interaction, you have some ferromagnetic exchange coupling between the F and C electrons, and then you have a Coulomb repulsion term for the C electrons. So, as a summary, the topological heavy fermion of DHF describes TBG as being made up of two per spin and per valley F electrons. And these are localized, they have zero kinetic energy, and they experience a very strong correlation effect. And then you have the C electrons, which are strongly dispersive, and they are weakly correlated. Dispersive and they are weakly correlated carriers. Sorry, the localized modes, are they placed on a particular sublactis? They are the F electrons, you mean. Yeah, so at the Moire level, they are localized at the A sites. At the graphene... No, sorry, these F electrons at the A sites, but these C electrons, they're sort of delocalized in the entire in the entire I mean like at the gr at the graphene level. Oh, you mean like at the gr at the graphene level? Yeah, they're they're on both sublattices. Yeah. And that comes out of the binarization by this AA wave function comes out automatically by hand. Yeah, yeah, but by hand. Yeah, but what I'm going to say is that we have actually found a way to approximate all of these analytically. So first of all, we try to extend the heavy Extend the heavy fermion model away from the magic angle. And we find that remarkably the Hamiltonian stays exactly the same. All you have to do, if you go for like 0.3 degrees away from the magic angle, all you have to do is rescale these parameters. And moreover, we have found that to an accuracy of ten percent to twenty percent, we can find analytical approximations of these parameters and of the Gaussian wave function of the F electron. Wave function of the f electron. But for our calculations, we obtain those Gaussian wave functions. They're not really Gaussian. We obtain those localized one-year orbital wave functions numerically to one year nine. Yeah, so yeah, this is basically what I'm saying in this slide, that the THF model also works remarkably well away from the magic handle. Yeah, so how come everything is for the forgotten part? So Yeah, I mean this is the interaction part. The the non-interacting part I didn't really show. I mean it's like we can we can chat about it, the single particle part. It's basically a Hamiltonian governing this this double Dirac cone, then nothing for the F electron and then uh uh hybridization between F and C electrons. Yeah, for all this. Yeah, but molten electrons are a lot there are four of them per spin and per battle. Four types of C electrons per spin and per battle. I can tell you more about this. Okay. Sorry, before you go on, but just a quick question. Are C's momentum resolved? Yes, they are momentum resolved. Yes. So the C's are, the C's, because of their anomalous character, they sort of need to live in momentum space, but the F electrons, they In momentum space, but the F electrons they live in real space. Okay, another interesting thing is that you know that TBG of, like, because it's an engineered heterostructure, it often suffers from effects such as strain or lattice relaxation, right? So it's very interesting to see that both of these effects leave the heavy fermion picture intact. So, for example, if we implement heterostring, we find that the main String, we find that the main effect of string is to split these F modes, right? Like the F electrons, you have eight of them in an unstrained model, they're completely degenerate. Under strain, they split into four plus four. If you implement relaxation in the manner that Oscar has derived, you find that essentially in the heavy fermion model, you only need to add a relative chemical. Only need to add the relative chemical potential of the C electron relative to the F electron. So of course the single particle parameters change, but the sort of Hilbert space, the Hilbert space of the model does not. What are the dashed curves? Yeah, the dashed curves are original VM model, and the colored curves are the heavy curve model. Okay, so now that we've sort of established. Now that we've sort of established that the THF model offers a great description of TBG in pretty much any experimentally relevant limit, we turn to our initial goal, which is understanding the correlated insulators of TPG. What is very nice is that the THF model features a very simple limit that you can start with. And that limit happens when you turn off any hybridization or any hybridization. Or any hybridization between the C and F electrons. Then your Hamiltonian simplifies significantly. At the single particle level, you only have a double Dirac cone for the C electrons, and at the interacting level, you have Coulomb repulsion between the F electrons, Coulomb repulsion between C and F, and Coulomb repulsion of the C electrons. One interesting thing about this Hamiltonian is that if you assume uniform filling of the F electrons, then you can actually solve this equation. Electrons, then you can actually solve this exactly in this limit. So you can start, for example, at charge neutrality, and at charge neutrality, you have four of the eight F electrons filled, and you have filled the Dirac C of C electrons. As you start doping, you find that most holes will prefer to go into the C band. Why? Because the F electrons have a very strong one-side repulsion, so there's a huge energy barrier to add. Energy barrier to adding an F electron. At around μ is equal to minus 5, you find that it suddenly becomes energetically favored to lower the feeling of the F electron by 1 and compensate by raising the feeling of the C electron. And this situation sort of repeats itself around all integer films. So, from this picture, we can see that there are two main regimes in the In the physics of TDG, depending on the filling. So around the integer filling, you have some local moment region. So the charge degree of freedom of the F electron is frozen, right? And all the physics sort of happens in the three electrons. And in between integer filling, you have strong fluctuations of the F electron charge, and we call this the mixed balance regime. So by analogy with the typical Analogy with the typical interaction at the infinite temperature. It's a fixed thing. Yeah, it's a fixed thing. Because here you also have the C. So, how do you do that? It's just in the same way. So, yeah, so it's. Up over the F and the C. Exactly, exactly. And the C. Exactly, exactly. So my interaction is basically an F yeah, go ahead. The C goes up to arbitrarily high energy. So how do you do infinite temperature on the C? Uh how do I do infinite temperature? Well, I can still introduce a cutoff for the C electrons. But it's also probably depend on the cutoff, right? Not really, right? Like once your cutoff is high enough, right? Like the and the physics is mostly governed by the subtracting off infinite temperature, if I understand you. Of infinite temperature, if I understand you correctly, high energy states. That essentially entails that I'm measuring the charge from charge neutrality. So my interaction is basically V times Nc minus a half squared, something like that. Yeah, I mean, we can chat about this. Okay, so yeah, so like by analogy with like typical heavy By analogy with like typical heavy fermion compounds, you find that the physics of the heavy fermion model is basically governed by competition between local moment physics. And in the local moment physics, you have RKKY interaction between the F electrons. And what that leads, that leads to these ferromagnetic ground states and leads to the development of long-range order. In between, Order. In between, like in between integer fillings, you have FC coupling, which favors the formation of a Kondo singlet. And in this regime, the fluctuations of the local moments are quenched, and you see the emergence of a zero-energy single-particle excitation in the spectral function, also known as fundoreson. And as I see, I'm a bit running out of time, so I'll have to sort of skip. To have to sort of skip some of the slides. So, one thing that comes out of the heavy fermion very naturally is that one can understand the charge one excitation spectrum of TBG. And the way you do that, you start from the zero hybridization limit, for example, at half filling. Then your F electrons are split into four plus four bands, right? Four bands, right, you have a situation like this. Now you dope and go at nu is equal to minus one. One of these F electrons jumps from here to here, and then there's a mismatch between the W and the U interaction, so there's actually a relative shift between the C and F electron bands, and the zero hybridization band structure looks something like this. Now you add F C hybridization, you open gaps, and lo and behold, you get a very You get a very nice intuitive understanding of the charge one excitation spectrum of intensity. Very briefly, I'm gonna say that one additional thing that comes out of this heavy fermion formulation is that you can determine the wave function of the celebrated interteculus spiral state. So, as many of you know already, IKS was proposed. IKS was proposed as the ground state of DBG with strain. What we found previously in the heavy fermion model is that strain essentially split, breaks the U8 symmetry of the F electrons and breaking them into 4 plus 4 bands. So if you then, like if you will then have this picture, if you then realize inter-valley coherence within the lower band, then you immediately get the wave function of this intercalculate spiral. Of these intercacule spirals in terms of these F-electrons. And I mentioned that this is very important because when they first proposed this model by using momentum space formulations of TBG, they were not able to get an analytical form for this very much. Of course, another thing that can be very nicely explained in the Heavy-Fermion formulation is that once you include the relaxation effects, it's very natural. It's very natural to explain why the correlated insulators on the electron side are more strongly correlated than the correlated insulators on the negative healing side. And if people are interested, I'm happy to discuss this after the talk. But very briefly, I want to mention all of what I've said so far, one can argue that can be of One can argue that can be obtained already from the BM model, so why bother with this whole heavy fermion machinery? Now I'm going to talk about something that the heavy fermion allows one to do naturally and that is very awkward to do in momentum space formulation. And that is transport. So from a transport standpoint, the fermions of TBG in the heavy fermion model are naturally split into two species. So on the one hand, you have F electrons, which are dispersion. Have F electrons, which are dispersionless and correlated, and therefore have a large scattering with a great low lifetime. And on the other hand, you have C electrons, which are dispersive and weakly correlated, and they have a small scattering rate. And as a result of that, one conclusion you can have already is that in all transport experiments, the physics will be dominated by C electrons. And out of, like, for transport signature, what I would do is. For transport signature, what I would want to focus on is the Seebeck coefficient. So, Professor Efetov has a device for measuring this Seebeck coefficient. Very briefly, the device is a double junction, right? You can imagine putting a certain correlated insulator here, let's say Nu is equal to minus 2, putting another one here, and then heating the sample with the aid of a laser. So, as you heat the sample, you have a temperature. So, as you heat the sample, you have a temperature gradient developing, and as a result of that temperature gradient, due to the thermoelectric effect, you also have a voltage gradient. So, this device essentially measures that. The specific voltage difference corresponding to a certain temperature gradient is known as the Seebeck coefficient. So, why would anyone care about this rather obscure transport coefficient? Well, the Seebeck coefficient. Coefficient. Well, the Seebeck coefficient basically tells you what type of carrier dominates transport for a given killing. So if you consider a typical semiconductor, you will find that the Seebeck coefficient looks pretty much like this inverted sign. So if you dope into the electron bands, you expect a negative Seebeck coefficient. If you dope into the whole bands, you expect a positive Seebeck coefficient. Because D VG Because DBG harbors this correlated insulator states at integer filling, you would expect that at all integer fillings you will get these oscillations in the Seebeck coefficient, right? And the Seebeck coefficient crossing zero at around the integer filling. However, this is not what experiments see. So this is real experimental data, and I want to focus at positive integer feelings. As you can see around feeling one and around feeling two, the C-back. Feeling one and around feeling two, the Seebeck coefficient does oscillate, but it never causes zero. So this kind of breaks down this conventional picture and sort of points that electrons dominate transport for TBG around the positive integer feelings. And the heavy fermion provides a very natural explanation of that. So if you consider the band structure of the heavy fermion around feeling nu is equal to one, Feeling nu is equal to one, and you consider the two doping scenarios, doping into the electron band and doping into the whole band, you find that the carriers that you excite are markedly different. So for electron doping, you excite C electrons, which are very good for transport, right? And you have this very sharp sort of quasi-particles, which means that they are long-lived. If you dope into the whole band, you're exciting these super-flat F electrons, right? And as you can see, they are. Right, and as you can see, they are very not very sharp, so they're very bad for transport. And so, if you go ahead, use second-order self-consistent perturbation, and sort of simulate the Seebeck coefficient, you find that the results very nicely match the experiments. And you find, for example, around nu is equal to one, that electron excitations really dominate transport, and the overall C-beck coherence. The overall C-beck coefficient is negative. Of course, around charge neutrality, you have C electrons both for the electron and the whole excitation, so you get the C-beck coefficient, which looks very much like conventional expectations. Yeah, so I'm going to leave this conclusion slide here, and I'm happy to take questions. Can you put numbers to the three interactions you mentioned? U, V, and O? Yes. So, I mean, these are highly angle and sort of.
