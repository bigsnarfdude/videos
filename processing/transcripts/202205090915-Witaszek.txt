So, yeah, we're very happy to see you all here in person. It's nice to see all of your master traders. And we're very happy that our first speaker is Jonathan Gipsak. So tell us about the project for the next group. Hello, thanks a lot for the opportunity to talk here. So my talk is going to be kind of in a mixed world between positive and mixed characteristics. So the notice I'm going to talk about are kind of a purely positive characteristic. Purely positive characteristic, but we are going to use mixed characteristics to define them together with the vectors. I've been thinking about maybe giving a more mixed characteristic talk, but somehow I've been a bit too excited about this classier splitting. So we've been thinking about, I've been thinking about them for maybe like last two years. And finally, we are putting things on the archives I would like to share with you at this development. I should also say what I'm going to talk about is only scratching the surface. Somehow, the theory of splitting has been developed for many, many years. And so it probably takes some more time for the quasi-splitting to kind of mature enough. So I'm going to mostly talk about the first paper. We have kind of like almost like five papers lined up to write. And yet that's probably more will be needed to kind of sort out maybe the full potential of this notion. So throughout this talk, K is going to be a perfect field of characteristic. Of characteristic of characteristic p greater than zero, and for simplicity, it's fine to assume that k is a finite field or is algebraically closed. I won't need any other fields in my talk now. X is going to be a projective normal variety, projective normal integral variety over k, and d is going to be the dimension of x, but sometimes x is going to be a singularity. Singularity for. And F is going to be the frubiness of this. That is the frubiness. Okay. So let me talk. We start my talk before I really delve into these notions of quasi-splittings, kind of an introduction to various measures of pathology in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, which is of pathology. I should also say, so Chapel is also going to give an independent talk later on. So he's probably going to focus more on the algebraic side. So I decided. Focus more on the algebraic side, so I decided maybe to focus more on the geometric one. Okay, so let's start with liftability. So I'm going to take a variety over finite fields. This definition can be extended to other fields. I'm going to mention that later on, but for now, let's x be finite fields. And I'm going to say that it lifts to characteristic zero if and only if there exists a flat scheme over Zp. Over Zp whose reduction modulo p is x itself. If I base change to fp, that's going to be isomorphic to x. You could pick somehow any other mischaracteristic, maybe DVR or dedicating domain here, but then somehow some statement might change. So for simplicity, I'm picking ZP. But taking a number field or like localization of a number field also gives like an interesting notion. And we are going to say lift modulo p square. If the same is true, square if the same is true but over z over b square let me give you some examples also i have one hour right okay example so you could take a hypersurface over finite fields so defined by one homogeneous equation and that's going to lift to x tilde inside the projective space over z p or over z over p squared in the second or over z over p square in the second setting and you just take the equation and lift the coefficients so if you take x square plus y square plus z square this is congruent to zero modulo p that's my original variety i can lift it to just x square plus y square plus z square equals to zero of course there are many other options i could for example pick p plus one x squared plus y squared plus z square i could take any coefficients which are congruent to one modulo p uh p so you can ask why that's P here, so you can ask: wait, that's this should show that every projective variety singularity should lift, but that's not true, it's only true that this lift is flat if you have one equation, or in general, a complete intersection. Thus, flatness encodes and suits that you are equidimensional. But take something which is not a complete intersection. After you lift it, it might become a complete intersection. In particular, the dimension drops. So, somehow the positive characteristic thing might have a higher dimension than the lower characteristic, the characteristic zero thing. And somehow then you can't compare these two varieties. then you can't compare these two two varieties and the notion is not and the the leaf is not flat okay now let me give very briefly a non-example the experience i've never had a ladder being used during my talk but so let's get let's go back to more less interesting things let me give another example which i really like is due to ahingers danovich just going very briefly you can take a blow up of z inside the variety x times x where x is some Some at least two dimensional, general in a very vague sense, just you don't pick some, like, don't pick something tory, but if you pick like a blob at P2 at four points or K3 surface or whatever, whatever you like, then these are the example is going to work. And you take Z to be the graph of the Frobenius morph. So, because you are using a positive characteristic information, the Frobenius, you don't expect this thing to lift. And in fact, one can show that it does not. One can show that it does not lift. And if you want to have a singularity, just take an appropriate colon over that projective variety, you're getting a singularity which does not lift. So the second notion of pathology I would like to talk about is ordinarity. So very briefly, I'm going to say that X is weekly, but I'm going to drop this weekly throughout my talk for the ease of notation. Ordinary, if and only if the Frobenius acts. The Frobenius acts bijectively on the highest coherent coherent. Again, for all these things, I assume that X is projective, a projective variety, which is bijective. Let me give you an example, which is kind of a canonical in number theory. So you take an elliptic curve of an algebraically closed field, and one can check that it's weakly ordinary or ordinary if and only if. Or ordinary, if and only if the number of torsion p points is equal to p and it's non-ordinary, also known as super singular, if and only if the number of p torsion points is one. So normally in characteristic zero, you would expect the number of n torsion points to be n square. Like you take a lattice and you take all this like quotient by n, but something in positive characteristics always drops. But ordinary is kind of the drops the least. And in the super singular case, it drops as much as possible. Okay. As possible. Okay. Okay. So now you should think: okay, well, the ordinary varieties. So they kind of independent notions. There is this famous ordinarity conjecture that if you reduce a characteristic zero variety, modulo in 3D many prime number is going to be ordinary. And they kind of attach upon different properties of variety. So for example, if you are liftable, in particular, liftable, or just liftable modulo p square, you get central vanishing theorems by the celebrated results of the linear Z, so-called Kodira vanishing. Codera, Kodira vanishing. On the other hand, the ordinarity tells us something about p-torsion points and some kind of another properties of cohomologies. So now you should ask: so, in particular, things that are ordinary and liftable, they usually could be relatively pretty nice. But you can ask, okay, maybe you can measure super singularity. Maybe there are super singular varieties. They're not too super singular. And such a measure is given by the R major height. Okay, but before I define it, I need to make a small feature and talk about v vectors. And talk about V vectors. You're going to be the key player in my talk today. Okay, so I'm going to pick R to be a ring of characteristic P. It is not strictly necessary, but then you need to be more careful with certain things. So I'm only going to be interested in rings of characteristic P. And I'm going to define the ring wn of R. That's going to be a ring. As a set, that's going to be just a collection of n tuples of numbers. Numbers where this a0 a n minus one are in the ring R. But I'm gonna pick interesting addition and multiplication. By interesting, I mean it's not gonna be component-wise, as you may be expect in a product. Okay, so before I do so, let me give you the following fact. And this object is of mixed characteristics. It's gonna be defined over Z over P to D. So let me give the following. So let me give the following fact that after one constructs such an object, one can check that W n of Fp is isomorphic to Z over P to the N. And then one can also define the full width vectors, which will be the inverse projective limit over all truncated width vectors. So in this particular case, going to be the projective limit of W and FP, and that we know is just equal to Z, or isomorphism. Okay, so. Okay, so the idea of vectors is that I'd like to kind of define the ring z over p to the n, but not as a quotient, but kind of explicitly. I'll kind of write down some coordinates here. I kind of write down explicitly what the addition multiplication is. So you should think of elements of these v vectors as some kind of a sums, a0 plus a1p plus all the way to a n minus 1. Let me just put p in front. All the way to p to the n minus 1, a n minus 1. A n minus one. Okay, the same you would maybe draw right in z over p to d however that doesn't necessarily work. The reason if we could do such a thing, we would usually say that every ring has a universal lift. So the problem of liftability would be super easy. So one, there is certain forbidden twist necessary to define this ring in a universal way. So we are going to write down one, like the denominator, the exponent one over p here, and one over p to the n minus one. So we are kind of taking each of the coordinates with a certain Frobenius twist. This does not affect the answer. twist this does not affect the answer if we work with perfect fields then somehow these forbidden twists are are negligible but if you work with arbitrary rings then kind of you get a slightly different answer so this may be thought of for arbitrary rings as the closest approximation of a lift which you can define in a universal way lift to z over p to d okay so i said a lot of words let's write down an example okay n equals to two then w2 of r is a collection of two tuple of a Is a collection of two tuple of a two tuple A0A1 and the addition is as follows. You have A0A1 plus B0B1 equals two, and the multiplication is going to be A0A1 times B0B1. Let me write down the multiplication first because it's maybe easier. It's going to be A0B0, A0 to the P B1 plus B0 to the P A1. And that's very natural if you look at And that's very natural if you look at this formula row here. It's really kind of from this kind of formula, it's not hard to see that that should be the multiplication for n equals to two. And the addition is slightly more complicated on the first coordinate. They're just going to add these two numbers. But then imagine you add two numbers smaller than p. If you add them, they might be bigger than p. So you need to take the remainder and put it on the other side. And together with the Frobenius twist, that gives the following term is A0 plus B0, the power P minus. The power p minus a0 to the p minus b0 to the p divided by p. I'm slightly cheating because I'm dividing by p in a ring of positive characteristic. So what I really mean by this this this term here is the following sum. So I'm using the binomial coefficient and coefficient by p before I write it down. So I'm getting p minus one factorial divided by i factorial times p minus i factorial times a zero to the i. times a zero to the i b zero to the p minus p right and if i write it this way these terms are not divisible by p so it really makes sense to quotient in in a ring of positive characteristic by these numbers so that's kind of a whoopsy short way to a short way to write this down right it's a very explicit ring and you can do a similar thing for for higher n the thing that's going to be crucial for us is that this ring of v vectors comes with the fravidious morphs Morphles and non-surprisingly, we are just gonna act by the Frobenius component once. And one can verify that this Frobenis is a ring homomorphism for vid vectors. Okay, so with that introduction, I can finally talk about the art major height. But at least, as far as I know, this is only defined, or this kind of makes sense in this generality for Calabia varieties. I'm going to restrict for now to Calabia varieties. And for me, Calabia varieties is going to be axis smooth projective. And the canonical divisor is isomorphic box. This is something which is called a weekly collab. Yeah, in particular for me, alabedian varieties are collaborated. me alabedian varieties are are calabia i would like to point that's my setting so i'd like to point out by viceruality the hd the dimension of h d x o x is equal to one why this is dual to age zero omega x but omega x is trivial so there's only one global section okay so that's defined there are multiple definitions of the of the There are multiple definitions of the artimajor height. I'm going to pick maybe the one that is the closest to the definition of ordinarity. So, the height of x is the minimum over the numbers m in natural numbers such that the Frobenius acts non-trivially on H M, sorry, H D X W M O. There's the Frobenius acting on the V vectors, so there's the Frobenius acting on the cohomology. So, there is a freebie section on the cohomology. Now, let's be very careful. WMOX is not a coherent OX module. It's not an OX module itself. It's just a abelian sheet. But I can still take its cohomology as usually doing in hardship. Okay? So the first observation is that height of x equals to one if and only if x is ordinary. Maybe be careful because normally we say bijection. You be careful because normally we say bijective for ordinarity, but remember that hdx of x is dimension one. So acting non-trivially is the same as acting bijectively. Right? And we see that if f acts non-trivially on hdx, w1 ox, which I should add, w1 r equals to r. And the whole construction generalizes to sheaves. I can do it like locally, and then I get a get a sheaf, wmox. So this is the same for m equals to one and h dx ox. m equals to one on h dx ox and acting on trivially on something of dimension one is the same as acting by jeff so this really is the ordinary and somehow the the higher the m the more super singular i am okay so given examples so e is an elliptic curve then the height of e is equal to one or two and one means ordinary and two means supersingular In fact, elliptic curves, super singular elliptic curves are very mildly super singular according to this terminology. So, how to cook some of something of, oh, I should also say or infinity if no such m exists. Okay, so let's cook up something of height infinity. Let's take E to be a super singular elliptic curve and take the height. And take the height of e times d. Then one can check that that is infinite. And this might be thought of as extremely super singular. Somehow, it's very hard to use such an object in this world. And maybe last, I should mention the case of K-free surfaces. So as checked by Artin. As checked by Artin, if X is a K-free surface, so it's a collabial surface of dimension 2 with vanishing H1 XOX, then the height belongs to the following set, 1 all the way to 10 plus infinity. And in a certain way, by a tape conjecture, we have a classification of the modular species of K-free surface by Picard rank in character. By Picard rank in character, but in positive character, there is this additional highest Picard rank. And using the height, we can further stratify that part of the moduli space. So we get kind of a relatively nice certification of the module of K3 surfaces using the notion of height. Okay, so that's about the Artin major height. Now I'm going to go back and talk very briefly about F-splittings that all of you know very well, but let me just go super briefly. So F-splittings. So X is F squared. So X is F split, if and only if, for Venus morphism splits as OX modules. And now let me give you a few properties of F split. They're interesting, maybe more from the geometric perspective. Well, so first, F split implies ordinary. Not too hard to see because if I am acting split Ox, then I'm also split after acting after applying cohomology. It leaves modulo p square. It loves the modulo p squared. Maybe there's a Mechtasrunivas who first proved it, and there are now multiple proofs of this fact. They satisfy Codera vanishing. So they seem to have all the nice properties you may have from things which are, you know, should be least pathological as possible. However, F-Spliners also imposes certain geometric. F spinners also imposes certain geometric conditions. So it implies that the Codero dimension is at most zero. If you don't know what Codera dimension is, let's look at the case of the case of case of curves. This tells us that F-split curve can only have genus zero and one. If the genus is two or higher, it's never F-split. In particular, as ordinarity is interesting for things which are kind of a calabiao in general type, F-splitness is more interesting in the range of Thanos and Calabiaos, which is maybe more. Which is maybe more relevant for applications in geometry. That's why they have this notion, it really kind of for the case of Phanos as Calabianos, it really encompasses the class of varieties that are the least pathological as possible in a certain way. Okay, and you also point out that if X is Calabiano, then M split is equivalent to ordinary. So for the sake of the future comments, let me make the following comments. Let me make the following collary that ordinary Calabiao varieties lift modulo B square. Right? F split things lift. Ordinary and F split are the same for Calabiao, so ordinary Calabiao varieties lift. Okay, so finally, I can define this notion as. This notion on, you know, I will focus my talk on, and that is these are quasi-F-splittings of your book. So, your book is one of the co-authors of these papers I'm talking about. Quasi-F-splittings by your book. So, the same way that F-splitness for Calabio is an analog of ordinarity, I would like the quasi-splitness to be an analog of Artin major height. To be an analog of R T major height. So let me give the following definition. I'm going to say that x is quasi x split. Okay, now use it. There's still some subtitles of the notation, so it might slightly change over time, but let me use, for the sake of this talk, let me use the following one. It's quasi-split at height n if and only if the following is true. So I have wn of x because the Frobenius of WNOX. Of w n o x and i can ask let's split that map, but that's extremely rare, like it's it's almost never happens that this map would this map would split. But what we can do is take the restriction. So, in other words, I'm restricting to the first coordinate, and I can ask if this map, if this map exists. So, after restriction, there's a split. Let me make a few remarks. So, are there any questions about this definition? So, firstly, quasi f split, height one is the same as f split. Because then it's just Ox to push forward of Ox. Okay, now quasi-f split at height n implies quasi-f split. Once you have split at height n prime greater equal, it's not too hard to see, but it goes for some argument. In other words, if you can split, if you're F split, you're going to be F split at every other height, height one, height two, height three, height four. If you're a quasi F split at height two, you're going to be quasi-split at height three, four, five, and so on. And then you can define the quasi-F speed height to be the minimum of such n. Okay? Okay, so in particular, if I take x and I take that this quasi-f split of height n, or in other words, height n and no smaller. And this is the same as saying that the Artin major height is. Again, it calls for a proof, but it is true and it's not too harsh to see. So this really is some kind of a Really is some kind of a notion that would measure this quasi-split, this argument measure height. Okay, so let me tell you a few theorems about them because I gave you a notion, but it could be completely useless. So theorem, this is the result of Yabuko in the smooth case, and then generalized to by Eckinger's Danovich, the singular case. So X is So x is quasi-f-split, and this implies that it lifts modulo p squared. You don't need f-splitness. Quasi-F split is enough for the lifting. So we get a really nice corollary due to Yabuka. It was this original motivation for introducing this definition, is that Calabia varieties of finite height, finite height and major height, lift modulo to square. And that was not known. That was not known. No, before. Yes? Oh, sorry. Yeah. So if it quasi-split if it's quasi-spit of finite height. So if it's quasi-spit at some height. That's my shortening. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks so much. In other words, this is kind of a way of measuring quasi-splitness, but what will matter mostly if it is quasi-spit of some height or if it's not. Okay. Okay, and then we also have the following theorem due to your book on Akajima is that X smooth quasi F split implies Codera vanishing. That's another very nice notion that is true for F-splitness and is also satisfied for quasi-F splits. Okay. Okay, so this is the whole introduction. I wanted to introduce, and now we're going to move to new results. Are there any questions? Oh, this is relatively new. I would say. I mean, your book interesting a couple of years, a couple of years ago was as part of his thesis. So three, three years, maybe? Four? I actually cannot see it from here because I don't have a path. What is the map that you actually sorry? This is the definition. Sorry, so this is a map to OAC. Is it a big problem for everyone? You can't see. Can we turn off the light, possibly? Okay, this is WNOX. WNOX to OX and now I have the push forward of WNOX and I'm going to OX. Is any other board this commutes? That's what I'm only saying. Nothing splits. I'm only saying that it's trying to commute. Is there any board that looks better? Like, is this one the worst? Or all the boards are bad? Okay. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, sorry, sorry. I will try to read everything carefully, but let me just rewrite this definition because, like, if anything, you should get out of this talk, it's maybe the definition. Right? So, if WNOX, if I push forward, wn ox, the restriction map to OX, and I'm asking if there is such a map which renders this diagram commutative. Exactly, exactly. Okay. So imagine that. No, no, no. Well, there is a way to define in terms of splitting, but I'm not going to go into that in this. Okay, so I'd like to say that's what you, yeah. Okay, so I should say, like, it looks very tempting because it seems like, well, there are many more things that are quasi-effsplit. At the same time, this quasi-explitness seems to have very similar properties to have splitness. On the other hand, if you look at the definitions, like, how can you prove anything about it? How do you calculate it? However, the longer we work on this project, the more it was clear that somehow there is a way to. somehow there is a way to to to do things with it and that's becoming i was becoming more and more excited for two reasons firstly you can now apply possibly methods you could you know potentially if the theory is developed enough you can apply uh you can apply the the kind of a more committed algebraic methods or more like effective methods to try to calculate if they calculate things in our arithmetic geometry if you calculate this quasi-exploitness it can often tell you give you information about the christian go homology so you can now you know take equations and and and and then kind of derive certain information about And then kind of derives their information about the Christian co-homology from these equations or from some geometrically constructed objects. And for the second reason is like, if in the ideal world, this quasi-f-spitness will have exactly the same properties as f-splitness. So I would take every single paper that like Carl and others wrote, I'm going to add quasi-in front of every f-split and hope that all the statements are true. And then with every, the stimulus will be true, but they will be applicable in a much wider range, I mean, relatively wider range of possibilities. Relatively wider range of possibilities, so you get many more examples or cases of theorems you can apply it. Of course, the world is not ideal. So it turns out this quasi-splitness is not a magic wand that you kind of apply to every explicitness and you kind of upgrade it to quasi-explitness. However, quite a lot of things are possible. And I really hope that maybe over time, we at least some of these applications would be able to be pushed and extended that we're known for F-splittings. So I'm going to now tell you, maybe focus on the geometric applications that. Maybe focus on the geometric applications that I was motivated in part because of the minimal model program and then go through different kinds of ranges of applications. Okay, so new results. Okay, so I'm going to talk about KLT singularities. These are very mild singularities. So they're all normal and they have very nice properties. So example of such. So, the example of such is our rational double points. The dimension of rational double points, which are, for example, given by x squared plus y cubed plus z four equals to zero. Okay, and I don't want to give the formal definition, but what the scale to singularities really are, they are deformations of cones over funo varieties. So, funo variety is So, final variety, these are kind of the building blocks in algebraic geometry. These are varieties where the minus canonical class is amp. Okay, so you take counts and you deform them. Okay, in practice, you need to take orbifold counts of a log final varieties, but somehow that is, it is a after some modification, this becomes a true state. Okay, so these are kind of a very nice class that comes very naturally when you do algebraic operations and also comes up naturally. And also comes up naturally, in a way, in the comedian algebra. Okay, so we have the following result of Hara about splitness that, in a way, I treat as one of the kind of foundation results, especially for the relations with geometry. So Hara showed that if you take X to be KLT, two-dimensional singularity, when P is greater than 5, then it is a split. Or maybe I should point out. So I'm going to first important. So, I'm gonna, for simplicity, only talk about F splitness and non-distinguishment between F purity and F splitness. So, when I'm talking about projective things, then F splitness is a global notion. If I talk about the local singularities, then F splitness becomes a local notion. But every time I talk about local situation, I really mean like F pure F pure here. Okay, so in particular, all rational double points for P greater than Phi Ver have split, but that's false in general for graphics two, three, and five. So, we have the first result. So we have the first first result, K T T W Y Y is that if x is scale t two-dimensional singularity, p is greater than zero and it's quasi-spirit. In particular, it's also in characteristic two, three, and five. And maybe much more surprising is that if you take a pair x, delta, it's also going to be quasi-exploit. And for every boundary, you don't even need to assume so-called. And for every boundary, you don't even need to assume so-called standard coefficients. That thing is always such KLT pair is always going to be quasi-estimated. So now let's move to higher dimensions. So one of the very first projects I was thinking about as a graduate student is try to understand if higher results could be generalized to higher dimensions. And Carl was extremely skeptical, and rightly so, because there is no hope for that. But let me just point out. But let me just point out the statement one can get. So, it's the result of questioning generalized myself. So, for every prime number p, there exists a actually generalized, I mean, maybe not for five, but replace five by 1000, one million, or 17 million or whatever. Maybe there is a bound for which this statement of hara is true in dimension three. But it's not. So there exists. But it's not. So there exists a Kelti three-dimensional singularity in characteristic p greater than zero such that x is not x such that x is not f split. You can explicitly write down the, in fact, the equation of such a singularity. And so there's no hope for any bound for f split. No hope for any bound for F splits. So here comes the maybe the main result from a paper, I mean the main application. There exists a number P0, which is really, well, possibly large. That the X is KLT, but I'm going to tell you what it is in a second. So that X is KLT, three-dimensional singularity in characteristic P greater than. In characteristic p greater than this bound p0, universal bound independent of x is quasi-elsp. So in particular, in particular, x left modulo p squared, right? Because quasi-xplink splits thing left. So I was very kind of excited because I always try to shout. Kind of excited because I always try to show that singularity is lift, but I never had methods to do so. And but somehow, if you can show this quasi-exploitness, then you immediately get that you immediately get that the lift modulo isquare. And that's really hard, you know, this would be really hard to do using, say, deformation theory, right? Because this deformation theory of singularities is governed by the Cotagian complex. That's rarely computable in practice. But somehow, by using this quasi-off splitness, we can show that these singularities lift. Okay, so now let me tell you, give you a few remarks. Let me tell you, give you a few remarks. So, firstly, the bound P0 equals to 42, assuming certain conjecture on log liftability of the log Dolpet surfaces with standard coefficients. So, there is a result of Arvidson, Bernasconi, and Lachini when they show log-liftability of Del Peto surfaces, and one is a slight generalization, they're also standard. One needs a slight generalization thereof with standard coefficients. And assuming that's very natural generalization, you can really show that this bound is equal to this 42. Okay, and you can, and this is not random. This really is because we can also construct a counterexample for p0 equals to 40. And to be a counterexample, I need p greater equal to p 0. So there exists a KLT singularity characteristic 41, which is not quasi-ising. And you can ask, okay, so what's this? And you can ask, okay, so what is you know, why 42? So, you know, there, if you've read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, you know that 42 is the answer to the ultimate question of life, universe, and everything. So it's been calculated by this supercomputer called Deep Thought. I spent seven and a half million years trying to calculate this answer to that question. And when they finally the answer went out, it turned out to be 42. And you know, the descendants of the original creators of the machine realized that, you know, they got the answer, but they realized they don't. you know they got the answer but they realized they don't didn't know what the precise question was for this this precise question for the for the you know uh ultimate question for life universe and everything is so it was not the very the most useful answer for them however for us we know where 42 comes from there's a certain bound on the agency threshold for for calabiel surfaces proved by colla in characteristic zero that's exactly the number that kind of comes comes up here okay i should also mention some i think at this point we probably can we can still give an explicit Point we probably can we can still give an explicit bound, and I think we can do like four times 42, like 168, and maybe we can push it. It just is under development, it becomes technical, but you can push these things to kind of give you an give you an explicit, explicit bound. Okay. So no, no, we don't get it, we don't get it, we don't get it here, but I'm gonna elaborate a bit on that on the on the height in a second. Here we only just get that the height is high enough. Get that the height is high enough, however, let's think a little bit about how one approaches these problems. So, there is a method called TLD blow-up of an extraction of Colars component. And the way to think about it, I have a KLT singularity. This corresponds to an cone over a final variety. And in fact, for every KLT singularity, there is a way to extract that final variety. The very final variety, I am a deformation of the cone over. Okay? Column of. Okay? And now, so usually, so how would we approach this problem? Is you're going to first use some form of inversion of a junction to reduce the checking of this quasi-off splitness of the singularity to the quasi-offsplitness of that final variety that my singularity corresponds to. That's kind of a very common theme in, say, in birational geometry. In other words, I take singularity, there's a local global principle that I get a variety. And if I show quasi-smoothness of one, I'm getting quasi-smoothness of another. Smoothness of one, I'm getting quasi-ness of another. I mean, that is one of the results I'm going to talk about. It's non-trivial, but let's assume that we can do that. Okay, so we have three-dimensional KOT singularity. So we need to understand two-dimensional surfaces. Okay. So you have the following theorem, the same authors. If X is a KLT Del Petro surface in characteristic P greater than five, then it's quasi F. Then it's quasi projective TLT Dilpetta. Dilpeto means final dimension. Okay, you can ask where, but where is this 42 coming from? So, well, in practice, you need to add these standard coefficients, and you add standard coefficients, and five becomes becomes 42. That would happen here. I mean, there are other results you could talk about, about this quasi-splitness. So, for example, you can generalize the result of Carl and Karen Smith. The result of Carl and Karen Smith and get Carl Matto Vivek vanishing for this quasi-splitness, you can show that the Kodara dimension is at most zero, which you kind of expect from the F-split picture. And there are many kind of other properties, but let me not maybe talk about these now. So now I'd like to, since it's more of a, you know, it's kind of a mix between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, I'd like to talk a little bit about calculation. So the Tape is going to say much more about that, but let me just go very briefly. Much more about that, but let me just go very briefly, kind of convince you that this is not a completely crazy notion, like you can rephrase in a way that is relatively easy to calculate, say, for a computer. Okay, so I want to emphasize it here. So, calculations, so quasi of splitness can be explicitly calculated. It's not like plus regularity, which kind of It's not like plus regularity, which is kind of a crazy calculating practice. So, say, if you if you give me an equation, I can take this local cohomology and do some kind of like you know, hand hands-off, you know, like a very explicit calculation of local cohomology to check that some singularity is or is not quasi-ester. Okay, so let me give one example everyone can get from, say, calculations using local cohomology. But again, I'm emphasizing everything I'm talking about here is now much more general, is generalized to a much higher degree in the work of. To a much higher degree in the work of the three sub-authors in this collection, and Tepei is going to talk about it more. In particular, again, some super exciting applications to arithmetic geometry. But yeah, let me not delve into it. Let me just give you one example of kind of what kind of numbers come up when you want to calculate quasi-studies. Okay. Okay, so you take a homogeneous polynomial of degree. Of degree f equals to n. And you can ask whether the quotient given by this polynomial is quasi-f split. So I take a singularity given by a homogeneous polynomial. And this homogeneous polynomial is degree is degree n. So that should corresponds to like a cone of a Calabria hypersurface. Okay? So, this holds if and only if the following is true. Let me go on the other board. So, first, we check that something is quasi-speed of height two. I should first check if it's quasi-speed of height one, right? Which is the same as f split. So, I'm going to have the usual feathers criterion: fp to the minus one does not lie in x1 to the p, xn to the p. And that just feathers criterion. Just feathers criteria, okay. So, suppose this is not satisfied, so I'm not a split, so I'm not quasi-speed of height one at height one. So, now I'm going to check if I'm quasi-speed at height two on the nodes. Okay, so the second condition is you take f to the power p square minus p minus one. I take delta of f, which I'm going to define in a second, and I'm going to ask if this thing does not lie in x1 to the power p square all the way to xn to the power p square. So, it's some polynomial I'm going to define you in a second. So, how do you define it? So, I'm going to take delta f, and to define it, I need to write my polynomial as a sum of monomials. So, it's a i to the x i, where i is in the multi-index, a i are in the field, i is a tuple, i1 to i n of positive of positive. Numbers, non-negative numbers, and x to the power i is x1, i1, all the way to xn. I literally just wrote my polynomial as a sum of non-dominant using this kind of cumbersome notation. Okay, so what we are going to do, we're going to take one over p. We are going to take our polynomial f raised to the pth power. So in other words, you're going to take the sum of a i xi, the power p. But I could have also just written f to the p here. But now the second term is funny because Now the second term is funny because I'm gonna raise all monomials to the pth power. So I'm gonna write a i x to the i to the power p, but the pth power is in size. Okay, and that is my definition of delta. So for example, delta of x1 plus x2 is a monomial, is a sum of two monomials, is the same as one over p x1 plus x2 to the power p minus x1 to the p minus x2. One to the p minus x2, and we saw that in the definition of this addition individ vectors. So that is like one example when you can explicitly calculate these quasi-explanaties. Okay. We have around 15 minutes now, right? Yeah. Are there any questions? Right, yeah, yeah. If you take like there are tons of the tons of them that are not a split, but they're all quasi-split. I don't have an example explicit, but there is like a Artin's, I think, list, and then you can read the text. Okay. Oh, right, yeah. Okay. So what what happened in your theorem when you plug in your like a similar architecture or something? What height did you get? So we did not we did not check we did not check that. Okay, so your question about height. So what we can do is we can say outside of some bounded family of the petrols, the height is going to be two, but there is some kind of a small small but bounded family in which the height could be. but bounded family in which the height could behave in a kind of a kind of an interesting way and that's what we what we know but i don't think you expect the height to be to be it's almost always going to be bounded it's bounded in dimension the height is always bounded in dimension but you i don't think you can i don't expect you can say anything like very deep about it unless you have a have an explicit equation then you can calculate the height explicitly yeah i understand that the perfect condition is not explicit Yes, usually, usually, usually not. The point is, the first one is the Speather's criterion. So, I'm asking: if I'm F-split, then I'm quasi-split at height two. But if I'm not F-split, then I need to check this another additional condition. Yeah, so that's what Tepe is going to do. There's a slightly different statement there, and then Tepei is going to talk about it. Gonna talk about yeah, yeah, kind of like this sigma that comes up in you know list of Frobenius things. Okay, now let me move to liftings of sections, all right? So I told you about this inversion of a junction, but it was kind of a use in this strategy, so I'd like to elaborate on that, okay? Like to elaborate on that. Okay, so for simplicity, I'm going to work with X to be smooth, projective, S to be a smooth divisor. I'm adding a lot of unnecessary assumptions to make things clearer and not to add additional difficulty. Okay, L to be Cartier, B Cartier divisor, or any divisor because I'm smooth, so every divisor is Cartier. And I'm going to assume that L minus Kx plus. That L minus Kx plus S is ample, and I'm going to call this A. Okay, so this is kind of a natural setting in which you lift sexual single birational geometry. If that looks confusing, it's kind of the reason that it comes from kind of a direct vanishing type statements. I want it to be in this form. Okay, so in characteristic zero, capital. Capital Kx. Yes, yeah, that's a canonical device. No, not the field. Okay, so now the question is, which always comes up in, say, by rational geometry all the time, can you lift sections from the line bundle associated to L from S? So I'm restricting L to S and I can ask myself, is this map subjective? Okay, so I can offer leave sections that can tell you, tell us a lot about the line button on X, on X itself. Okay. Button on x, on x itself. Okay? And this is true because if I calculate h1, I have a short exact sequence OX minus x, OX, OS. Let me just add it here. Minus S, O X, O S. If I tensor by L, I see that what I need to check is that the first cohomology of O X L minus S is zero. But L minus S is the same as by definition as As by definition, as kx plus n, and so this is exactly the same as for direct vanish. Now, in characteristic P, there is the analog of that, of power, in various settings, you know, in various settings, various papers, with other coaches, is that. Is that I still have this objectivity if I additionally assume that my S is globally F split. I just emphasize globally. So if S I'm lifting section from is F split, I can lift sections. So this really is the statement about certain, there is a certain S0 of Robinian stable section. And I'm saying that this S0 is surjective from X. Saying that this s zero is surjective from x from x to s, and this s zero on s becomes h zero if s is globally of split. If you solve this, but in general, if you can lift sections from globally of split centers, that's what this really says. So, you can wonder, is there an analog of that for classical splittings? And the answer is yes and no. So, what happens is this is still true. Still true, but I said before, if S is quasi-F split, globally quasi-f split, and plus some other assumptions. And let me not write this down. If you're interested, I'm very happy to tell you more. The problem is other assumptions are painful. In a lot of situations, you don't have these assumptions, and this makes the situation much harder. However, in some situations, you do have them. And somehow that is maybe the, you know, the beauty or the bad. The bad thing about these quasi-splitting. So, let me just point out that using this kind of lifting results with additional assumptions, you can get some partial geometric results on inversion of quasi-F adjunction. Okay, so what do you mean by this? Okay, so what do I mean by this? So, for F-splittings, if you have a hypersurface that is F-split, then the ambient space is also F-split. That is what I mean by inversion of F-adjunction. Again, hypersurface, F-split, and the ambient space also F-split. Again, nearby and assuming Gorange and assuming certain assumptions, in the neighborhood of that hypersurface. Okay? But that statement in this form is false. This is inversion of for quasi-F adjunction, that statement is false in general. Is false in general. So maybe Tepei will give a commutative algebraic counter example. But you also, well, you would expect that, in fact, so there's this example of Cashinian Tanaka in dimension three in characteristic two, for certain PLT singularity. And this would also be most likely the counter example to that statement too. So you do not expect the inversion of quasi-objection to hold. But in certain cases, it does hold. And that was enough for us to kind of Was enough for us to kind of get these results on KLT on KLT singularities. Okay, so let me not go deeper into this topic because it's relatively technical. And somehow one of the difficulties now in geometric application is kind of how much to push these partial results to recover as many applications as possible. So now I told you about reduction from dimension three to dimension local to dimension two global. Dimension local, to dimension to global, but I didn't tell you much about how to do the global case. So, in practice, we apply certain techniques from the Cashini, from certain results of Kashinita Naka and myself on the alpeto surfaces, and it's relatively technical, but somehow, at least conjecturally, I assume that conjectural log liftability, there's a certain way to reduce it to certain very natural statements involving Cartier operator. So, there is a Cartier operator type criteria, and I'd like to talk about that now. Okay? And now, okay, so criterion using higher party operator. So it's a theorem the same six authors. X is smooth projected. X is smooth projector. Again, a lot of these assumptions can be dropped, but let me not go into details. And I'm assuming for simplicity is a final variety. So minus case is ample. Let me just remind you. Like P1 or the petal surfaces. Okay, now suppose that for every i greater or equal than 2, the following is true. So first, H D minus I. H D minus I X omega X I minus one tensor omega X equals to zero and H D minus I X omega X I tensor omega X to the P is equal to zero. Now, I'm swapping certain details under the rug. There are certain twists, higher powers also need to consider, but what I'm writing is really kind of the key. The other things are kind of negligible. Are kind of negligible in a way. Assumptions are kind of negligible and always follow. Okay, then axis global equations. So there is a certain analog of that for strong F regularity or F splitness. If you know the proof of the fact that KLT singularities are strongly of regular type, that's what's really featured in a way in that proof. And the statement that's very similar is that there is a certain shift. You need to check. Is that there is a certain shift? You need to check much like fewer cohomologies than the original criterion for F-splitness. Okay, and the proof goes via usual proof goes via Cartier operator, but there is a certain higher Cartier operator featured in the crystalline theory of crystal cohomologies, and you apply that higher Cartier operator, you're going to use such a statement. Okay, so let me give you an example how to apply it in practice. Also, a few words. If you're more geometrically inclined, this kind of a notion. This kind of a notion, this cosmology should almost always vanish if you're at least liftable by so called Akizuki Nakano vanishing. This is a part of the Delini Iluzi datum. So this is kind of very related to liftability. And the second one is on the borderline of that assumption. And so you should normally not expect this to be true. However, you are taking the pth power here. So if p is large enough, then omega x is anti-ample. So you would expect this to be zero by some kind of serve vanishing type state. Type state. It is philosophically. They are shifted. I think there's a shifted. Yeah, I think it's I greater than one and maybe some additional additional one here that comes. Right, that's what we have. Yeah, there's a log version of that and there's yeah, it's much more general. Just wanted to give like a, you know, just like a baby, baby case, very key for us. Okay, so let's give you an example how to apply it. Like X to be a smooth alpeta. X to be a smooth alberto, then I'm gonna show in characteristic P greater than zero. I'm gonna show it's always always quasi-f split. Now, I'm assuming smooth. Otherwise, I would need to have p greater than five. As I'm assuming smooth, that's not too surprising. Okay, let me just write down everything first. So, I'm gonna check these two conditions: d equals to two, so I only need to check h0x, omega x. Omega x tensor omega x equals zero and I need to check h0 x omega x two tensor omega x the p is equal to zero but that thing is by definition omega x p plus one right this is just just small a small omega small omega x okay and then it's not hard to see that these are true because well so every every such one they maps to a here to a heretic surface you can reduce the here To a Heresy-Bruce surface, you can reduce the Herestabrouse surface case, and then you immediately get that this is true. Or you can use liftability to get the first one, and the second one is going to follow by being del peto because this is anti-ample. There are many ways to see this. It's completely almost automatic for these smooth del peto surfaces. Okay, but this implies by the previous criterion that X is quasi-space. It's also interesting, so there's this recent results of like Karen Smith and Janet Page and Tim Ryan when they study kind of cubic surfaces and the geometry. Cubic surfaces and the geometry based on the splitness. And if they are split, the geometry differs and they're not that split in low characteristics. But somehow for quasi-splitness, we won't see that. We just immediately all of them would be quasi-split. So the remaining two, three minutes of my talk, I'd like to tell you a little briefly on future directions. So, first, if you're maybe geometrically inclined, after what I saw, a very natural question to ask: can we apply in the minimum model program? In particular, the five in Haras result was exactly the thing that restricted minimum model program dimensions through three by Hague. Programme dimension through three by Hagon and Shu. And there is also P greater than five in that result. Okay, so you can ask three-fold MMP P greater than zero now. So replacing P greater than five by P greater than zero. Or you could ask four-dimensional MMP in full generality, but maybe now I'm going to assume P greater than 42. The hitchhikers, hitchhikers guys bound. Okay, the point is, in the ideal world, the first thing would. In the ideal world, the first thing would follow immediately by just replacing F split by quasi-F split in Hakon and Schuse paper, but we don't live in the ideal world. The lifting are not as strong, and we need to put more effort. However, I'm very optimistic. It really calls for maybe a much more detailed proof and analysis, but I'm kind of optimistic that these methods will be useful in attacking the minimum model program. We just need more need more time to develop that. No, I'm not sure you don't get any any new thing at this point, but the Point, but that is the ultimate hope after the theory is developed more. Okay, and the second thing I'd like to talk about maybe that is going to be the third paper on the line that is lined up to be written. That's going to be due to Tanaka, myself, and Yubuko. So you can ask if all these notions, all the other notions in positive characteristic generalize to this setting. So you can ask, is there a notion of quasi-fregularity? Or is there a notion of quasi-plus? Or is there a notion of quasi-plus regularity? In fact, there are no question marks. So you can really develop the theory, a similar theory for these notions. However, the situation is much more complicated. We spend like, I think, more than a year trying to cook up the correct definitions because the usual ones don't generalize nicely. You need to put more effort. There is certain, you know, yeah, a lot of other technical issues, even to just write down the definition. However, it is possible to do so. And then you can slide. It is possible to do so, and then you can slightly, or less so slightly, get stronger, get stronger results and drop certain assumptions that you would have if you only work with just quasi-espirators. So maybe one thing to finish with is that using this notion of quasi-F-regularity, you can show the following statement that quasi-f-regular singularities, unfortunately, with an additional assumption that dimensions at most true. Dimensions at most three are coin markons. So we know that strongly of regular singularities are if they are q factorial, well it's at q factor, you know, but that's not necessary, but that's okay. Let me ask you, okay. Let me add q factorial because I'm sure that I don't think it's necessary, but anywho, so we know for strongly irregular things, these are called Macaulay. And it turns out that the same will be true for quasi-if regular things. At this point, we can only prove it up to dimension. At this point, we can only prove it up to dimension up to dimension three, but hopefully that is true in higher dimensions too. So it still has these notions will have relatively similar properties of strong to stronger regularity. Okay, so at this point, that's all I want to tell you. Thanks a lot for listening to my talk. Several things in that have been done in splitting. What about there is something have you talked something about like a quasi FQL threshold? Right, so that's the fourth paper that is lined up. So you can define using these kind of the things that I didn't talk about, you can define the quasi threshold and you can try to calculate it. So you are in the process of doing so. But yeah. Can you repeat for the sure? So the question was if there is a is there a Sure. So the question was: is there a quasi-can I talk about quasi-f-regular threshold? And the answer was that there is a way to define it, you can certain things you can calculate, but there is still a lot of things we don't know. You're only like just scratching the surface of that topic. So I'm super excited because I feel like there is a lot of things that, you know, these quasi things could talk to, to maybe people doing research in the regularity of splitting. So if you see some connection with your research, I'll be super excited to hear about it because maybe that these things would talk to each other. maybe that these things would talk to each other so please find me in the either ask me now or find me in the during the conference because i i'm kind of really looking for kind of a new directions or new potentialities for that for that notion with prismatic chromology right so i gave you one definition of this quasi split but that's more of a corollary to the original definition there are two ways two equivalent There are two ways, two equivalent ways to define this height. One way to define the height is as follows: The height is going to be the dimension of the highest cohomology of the v vectors, the full v vectors. And I'm going to take the rational part. So I'm going to take the capital K and the capital K is very hard to write on the board. It's going to be the fraction field of the ring of V vectors of my base field, small. And I'm going to tensor this, write this capital K. Write this capital K. And I'm going to take this dimension if it's non-zero and infinity otherwise. So I'm looking at this rational cohomology of the width vectors. And if this thing is completely zero, I just plug in infinity. If it's non-zero, it has its known dimension. And that's going to be the height that. And that's going to be the height, the height of x. However, if you look at this object, this thing is exactly the zero-one slope of the crystalline cohomology. So it really recovers, in fact, for a K-free surface. If you know this part, then you know, I think the whole crystalline cohomology of a K-free surface. Irrationally, of course. Irrationally, there's much more to be said. That's one definition. I think the original definition of RTM mazer height comes from certain formal groups. Formal groups. So let's just start a dimension one first. So, what you can do, you could take the tangent bundle to the Picard functor, pig zero. Okay, it's not completely formal. Well, you can think of pig zero being some scheme as a tangent space, and this tangent space comes with a formal group. And the formal groups come with height. And that height of that formal group is exactly the Artin major height. Of course, this thing doesn't really make sense because you're going to. Of course, this thing doesn't really make sense because zero is non-reduced. But still, abstractly, you can really think of this formal group as being kind of the formal group of the tangent bundle to the Picard function. Now, if you go to dimension two, you're going to look at the Brouwer stack. And if you go higher dimension, you'll use some kind of a derived higher Brouwer stack. Maybe it's written in a slightly different language, but philosophically, that is what this height is. Last question? Can I ask a question from Zoom? So, if so, in your explicit example, right, with where you had like this affine hypersurface, this polynomial delta of F, what ring is it living in? Like, is this over Z mod P squared or is this over the P-adx? So, that's a great, that's a great question. The point is, as I said, let me just repeat the question. So, the question was, when I defined So, the question was: when I define you this delta f, let me define it again. That was really equal to 1 over p, the sum of a i x i to the p minus the sum of a i x i to the p. And this thing does not make sense as positive characteristics, but this is a shortcut. The same way I told about the second big vectors, I'm unraveling these binomial things, I'm quotiing by p every coefficient, and then I'm getting a very explicit formula. And then I'm getting a very explicit formula that is defined in a positive characteristic. So you don't need to go to p-adix or go to z over p squared if you write this down, this thing explicitly, which I don't want to do because it's going to be some kind of a higher, high binomial of a formula. Does this answer your question? Yeah, I guess so. You define it over Z and then you go mod P again. Yeah. Right, I could do that, but it's not, that is not necessary. In fact, so let's go back and I could just do, let's look at I could just do. Let's look at this. This is it. This doesn't make sense, but I can take something like a sum over p over a1 an okay p factorial, p minus one factorial. This is some a1 factorial times a n factorial times a whatever that is going to be. You know, yeah. Okay, and then some some terms here. Some terms here, and then that's going to be an explicit formula. I'm just unraveling this. So, in a way, this is what you're doing, but I can write this down explicitly. I don't even need to talk about lifts. Yeah, I see it. I see it. Thank you. Thank you. But maybe I should mention, but there is a way. So, in fact, there are some way to calculate this quasi-F, this argument measure heights explicitly. I don't remember who was the author, but somehow there is a way to calculate certain like zeta functions. To calculate certain like zeta functions of the formal formal groups in arithmetic geometry, uh, and what is different from this formula, and this is even more different. So, what the pay is gonna talk about, is somehow these formulas here, they're purely positive characteristic. Where the original formula, they really need the whole lift to characteristic zero, and they were because of that, they were much harder to calculate by computer. But somehow, this new formula are in this way better because they're purely positive characteristics. But again, that is like the pace and you. And you should have results in this full generality. That's another great question. So I shouldn't. Okay, so one thing we did not know. Oh, so I think we have now a shot at it. We are maybe close to that, but for most of the time, we didn't even know the following. the time we didn't even know the following that quasi f split implies locally say locally quasi f split implies locanon that is a known at this point i think we have a shot now to to attack it but it's kind of a not completely not clear from um from the definition in the global setting it's not clear that there is a there is a local abi alpa so we know lc type yes yes yes lc type or even just you Yes, yes, LC tech. Or even just assume Q-Gorring, Q-Garring, okay, just for simplicity. So, what we know is that, say, now in the global setting, in the global setting, we know that the x is quasi-f-split, then there exists a q-divisor delta such that kx plus delta is q equivalent to zero. So, kind of a local abuse, but we don't know how to control the singularities of that. Well, not yet, we don't know how to control them. So, but in How to control them. So, but in general, you should think of the quasi-f split as being the same as log canonic. I don't think there should be any geometric difference between quasi-split and ex-split. I think the arithmetic part is kind of what differs. So, another natural question to ask is about ordinarity. Maybe the ordinary conjecture is stronger. Maybe you could expect that for infinitely many p's, not just for infinitely many p's, but for all by a finite number of p's, their reduction is ordinary. But that's that's not true. Just like a very simple example: either take like a from a cubic, from a quartic, or just take an From a quartic, or just take an elliptic curve times an elliptic curve. We know that for infinitely many p's, that's going to be super singular by LG's result. So, for infinitely many p's, the height is going to be infinity. So, you can't hope for kind of a stronger ordinarity conjecture, unfortunately. So, you guys have some notion of compatibly quasi-split sub-varieties? Right, so we have a so not maybe not for a So, not maybe not for higher code dimensions yet, but at least for divisors, there is a notion of pure quasi-f split from which we do which we do do lifting and inversion of a junction. It's kind of funny. So, there's another thing I was very surprised about, is that in F-splitness, we usually either consider F-split or sharply F-split. But there are some old papers, originally, Haras' definition of F-split was different than what anyone people further defined. Further defined it. It kind of was something in between sharp and usual F split. And it seems like that analog is what works best in a K. So in fact, this quasi-f-split at height one is not exactly the same as F-split for log pairs for this technical reason. No pairs. So the quite so just for pairs. Not in this l we we have not thought uh uh not f uh thought about it okay no further questions those things are coming up
