Session of the workshop on totally disconnected locally compact groups and via group actions. And our first talk and evening session is by John Bamberg of University of Western Australia. John's known for his work on finite permutation groups and finite geometries, and he's going to talk to us today about some results on finite permutation groups that relate to. Groups that relate to something that Simon Smith talked about earlier today when he was talking about local actions. So, thank you, John. Thanks, George. Yeah, so this grew out of a problem at a research retreat that we have in Western Australia. And you'll see the co-authors for a theorem later on in the talk, but it was from a couple of years ago, and it was motivated by. A couple of years ago, and it was motivated by a result of St√©phane Tournier, who's going to be speaking later. And there's actually a nice finite permutation group theory problem linked with it. I should also thank the organisers for setting up this conference, in particular the Australian George Willis and David Allingham. So to start off with, need a definition that was introduced by Stefan that, well, the problem. That, or the property itself, we call a property star P. And you start with a finite permutation group. So G is a subgroup of Sn throughout the talk. P will always be a prime, and capital P will be a CLOP subgroup of G. And the property is that whenever you take a point stabilizer, so the point stabilizer inside P, it will be a C LOP subgroup of the Of the corresponding point stabilizer in G. Or in other words, taking a CLOP subgroup and a point stabilizer commutes. Okay, so this is an unusual property, perhaps. There are some natural examples for which this always occurs, some trivial examples. So, for example, semi-regular groups, so that's where every point stabilizer is trivial, will clearly have property star. will clearly have property star p because the point stabilizes point stabilizers down here will be trivial and we'll later see because i want to stress that there's sometimes a number theoretic condition which imposes property star p so we're going to have that np n subscript p is going to be the highest power of p so it's a power of p dividing n okay Okay, and so if you have g is transitive and p is greater than the p prime part of n, so n divided by n p, then g has property star p. Okay, so that's going to come up in the talk. In particular, this p times np will feature in some older results too. Okay, so this was motivated by So this was motivated by local actions of compactly generated TDLC groups. So you have a automorphism group of the n regular tree, T subscript N. So you're going to probably see this picture many times during the conference, but you have your N regular tree. This is three regular. Three regular and it keeps on going, and you have your vertex in the middle, say, and your finite group G, you want to think of it as the local action, and there's a way to do that. So, there is a construction of a group called the universal group so that it induces the group G on the neighborhood of this vertex. Of this vertex. And in particular, it's so u of g is all the automorphisms of this tree such that you get some nice, I'll explain what this means in a second, you get some induced automorphisms. So you want this to belong to G for all. You want this to belong to G for all V, and this L map here is like a colouring of the edges. And it's U of G is G is nice if it's transitive. It's going to be independent of this colouring. So you fix a colouring, the edges, and you can intertwine your action onto a local action. This is a colouring. Okay, so. Okay, so, and what Stefan showed is that this goes back to some paper of Colin Reed in 2013, where he defined a local C LOP subgroup to be sort of an analogue of the C LOP subgroup for TDLC groups, so maximal pro-P subgroup of a compact open subgroup. And what we have here is if you have a finite subtree of Tn, siglop P. Of Tn, C LOP subgroup P, and you take the point-wise stabilizer of this subtree inside of the universal group of P, then this will be a local CLOP subgroup of the universal group of G fixing the subtree if and only if we have this property star P. So there's this nice interaction between the local action and this universal group. And Stefan also showed that, in fact, he classified when the alternating and symmetric groups have this property star P. So you take G to be alternating or symmetric, and you have this condition come up again. So G has property star P whenever P dot the highest power. P dot the highest power of p dividing n is greater than n. All right, and in fact, this property had kind of already been studied by Cheryl in her, Cheryl Prager in her third paper, 1974. So you have a group G which is not containing the alternating group here. So this is different to Stefan's result, but it's too transitive. Okay, so it's a finite. Okay, so it's a finite two-transitive group, and you want p to be dividing n so that don't the prime p only appears once in factorization of n. So np is equal to p. Then g has property star p if one of the following holds. So p does not divide the point stabilizer, that's kind of you trivially get property star p in that case. Property star p in that case. So if that doesn't happen, then you get one of these two cases. And what's remarkable is that little p is two or three here. And there's only two different cases, and it's very low degree, n equals six and n equals 12, two transitive groups. And it never, otherwise it only occurs in trivial situations. This is when np is equal to p. Okay, so now let's go through some. Okay, so now let's go through some basic properties of this property of property scipey. That's going to be a mouthful, but there are some very basic things you can deduce. For instance, you can reduce to transitive groups immediately because if you're property star P on each orbit, you'll clearly be property star P everywhere because it's for all little omega, remember in the definition. Now, suppose you have a transitive subgroup of SN. A transitive subgroup of Sn and a C L O P subgroup P, then actually we have a P sub orbit, sorry, a P orbit of size N P. So this is a generalization actually about the smaller size of an orbit of a CELO subgroup. And this is the, yeah, so this is the smaller size of the orbit and it is attained. And I'll just show you how you prove that. So let's have a look at the basic So let's have a look at the basic setup. So we have G and we take a, well, we take P and a point stabilizer. All right, now take a CLOP subgroup of the point stabilizer. So it's going to be Q. Okay, so this is CLOP subgroup of the point stabilizer. In particular, it's a P subgroup. In particular, it's a P subgroup of G, so you know, it's got to be contained in a pseudo P subgroup of G. Let's call that P dash. In particular, Q is then equal to the point stabilizer in P dash. And therefore, you have that P dash has an orbit of size this. This index, of course. So we have, let's say, we've got p-dash here, and we've got the point stabilizer there. So this index is the size of the orbit of omega. So that's p dash q, the index of q and p dash. And then if you realize that p dash was a silo p subgroup of g, then its order is the p part of g and G and Q has order P part of the point stabilizer in G and this is applying the orbit stabilizer theorem again and we see that two things cancel and so we see that we have an orbit of size the p part of n Of n in P. Can there be a shorter orbit? Well, no, because if there was a shorter orbit, let's say delta to the p, then you take the stabilizer of delta in p, which is the size of p divided by size of your orbit. And this would be strictly greater than. Would be strictly greater than if it were shorter, it would be strictly greater than this quantity, but this is equal to the size of Q, and that's a contradiction. So they're meant to be the same. Okay, so this is a nifty result. And in particular, we can prove more in the case that you have property star p holding. Property star p holding. The key limit is that if you have property star p, then all orbits have the same length. And that's an if and only if. So now you've got a different definition, if you like, of property star p, in case you've already forgotten it. Just think of it as that the action of the CLO subgroup, it has all its orbits of the same length. And in fact, the length will be the p-part of n. Part of n. Okay, so now originally I should really put transitive here, but we can actually remove that after I've proved it. So we're going to temporarily put that G is transitive here. So suppose, yeah, so we know that, so to prove this, we already have from the previous result that P has an orbit size M. Size MP. All right. Let's suppose that's omega, the orbit of omega. And then let's play this out. So it's just repeating similar arguments to what we had before. You see now that the stabilizer in P has size the stabilizer, the p part of the stabilizer in G. And so if all p orbits have the same length, which has to be np, because one of them is length np, then this is if and only if. Then, this is if and only if the size of P omega is equal to the size of G omega P for all omega. And this is if and only if we have a C LOP subgroup of the point stabilizer, and that's property, that's property star P. star p. So this is a very important way to think of property star p. And in particular, if you have a faithful group action, so if g has property star p, then the group induced on omega has property star p. So we can look at just when the group acts faithfully. All right. So let's summarize some results. So there's some more here. We've got that, let's suppose G is transitive. And if G has property star P, then P has to divide N. Okay, so this is when we have a faithful group action now. So So, if it didn't, then you'd have, let's see, so we've got property star P and we have P co-prime to N, so N of N P would be equal to one. And so the C LO P, all orbits of P have length N P from the previous result. But P acts faithfully, and so the CLOP subgroup. So P would be trivial. Okay. And so P does not divide the order of G in that case. So I should put that P divides. Yeah, that's what's missing here. So P has to divide in order. So p has to divide the order of g. So g has probably star p, then p must is forced to divide n. Next, if p does not divide the point stabilizer, then g has property star p. Okay, so if p does not divide the point stabilizer, then the psilocy subgroup here, the stabilizer and the psilo p subgroup, would be trivial. And you trivially get a You trivially get a CLOP subgroup of G omega. Okay, so that one's fairly clear. The next one, if P N P is greater than N, then G has property star P. So this is that condition coming up again. To see this, think about it's basically the way things would fit into. So we have the p orbits here, let's say. P orbits here, let's say we have a couple of them of size NP. Let's just imagine that we have some which are not equal to NP. So this one here would be NP, this would be NP, but these ones would be, say, greater than NP, let's say. And in particular, they would be, because the orbits would be the size a power of a prime, these would be at least p times np. Okay, so once you see that. Okay, so once you see that, you see it immediately follows that you would exceed if you if p times np exceeds the total size of the set, then it forces all of the orbits to actually be equal to np and from the previous the orbit lengths to be np and from the previous result g has property star p and finally if you have this a really nice condition that uh very useful condition that if you have a transitive subgroup of of g Of G and G has property star P, then H will also, so that this property star P goes down to transitive subgroups. And that's fairly clear by taking the usual argument, take a C lo P subgroup of H, it's contained in a C lo P subgroup of G. And so all the P orbits of H have size at least N P, but the P dash orbits have size. P dash orbits have size equal to mp. So that means all the p orbits of h have size equal to mp. You can follow that. All right. Okay, so we have all these really nice properties. That's what we were able to derive, and they were important in proving our main result, which will come up soon. So we've looked at transitive, we've gone. We've looked at transitive, we've gone from intransitive to transitive. What about primitive groups? Well, this is where it gets a little bit more tricky. So I won't go through the details. I'm just going to state the results. So suppose we have a system of imprimitivity, curly B, and we'll take a block of that system of imprimitivity, capital B. And these two groups, I might just write them down for the Two groups, I might just write them down for those people who are not used to this notation. But if I have just G subscript B, that means the stabilizer of the block, and then the group induced on that block. So the permutation group induced by GB acting on B. So we're inside the symmetric group on this block. On this block. And likewise, if I write g to the curly b, then this is the group induced on the blocks, the set of blocks. So we would be in the symmetric group on curly B. And if both of these groups have property star P, then G will. And there's a little bit of a few lemmas that get you there. So I'll have to refer you to. You there, so I'll have to refer you to our paper. So, we look at the look at a general wreath product in primitive action, and then we use our transitive subgroup results and things like that that I just showed you on the previous slide to get there. If G has property star P, so going back in the other direction, then one of these permutation groups will have property star P, okay, this first one. Okay, this first one. But it's not necessarily true that the action on the blocks will have property star p. And in fact, we have counterexamples. And a good instructive counterexample would be A5 on 20 points. So point stabilizer is cyclic group of order 3, group generated by 3 cycle. And it looks like this. So it's probably good to draw a picture. It's probably good to draw a picture. So we're acting on 20 points and each block has size 2. So it's acting imprimitively. And we have lots of blocks. Each one has two elements in it. So there are 10 blocks, each with two elements. This is curly P. This is the full set. And in fact, this will have, this has property, this will change. This has property. Sorry, should we be seeing something just now? I'm not seeing anything after the blue G equals A5 acting on 20 points. Yep. Okay. Let me just reshare my screen. Thanks for that. Okay, we're back in business, hopefully. Yeah, it runs better. Cool. Okay, so let me go back to that. We have G5 acting on 20 points. We have split up our 20 points into the block system that A5 admits. So we've got 10 blocks of size 2, just like. Blocks of size two, just like that. And in fact, this action of A5 on 20 points, it's not hard to see that a CLOP subgroup, which is a client four group, a CLO2 subgroup, which is a client four group here, all of its orbits have size four. So this has property star two. It's very easy to see because the point stabilizer has order three. Has order three. So if you intersect with the point stabilizer, it's trivial. Now the action on the blocks is A5 still, it's a simple group, and it's on 10 points. We understand that action better. It's on ordered pairs. And so if you take the CLO2 subgroup here, which is the clone 4 group. Group. It's probably good to write down its permutations just so you can imagine what's going on. So we're acting on pairs, remember? Acting on pairs. And so if you take, if I write down my CLO2 subgroup, so it's supported by the first four elements, then you can see that the orbit sizes on the blocks will be two, two, two, that's six, and then four, and that orbit is the orbit of the pair one, five. Pair 1, 5, okay, because 5 is not supported. And so you get a regular orbit of this 02 subgroup. And so this doesn't have property star 2. So we have the action, the imprimitive action of G does, but the action on blocks doesn't. And we have a general method in the paper which basically you can take any transitive group. Where your CLOP subgroup acts semi-regularly on the moved points. So take away the fixed points from your action and you want it to be semi-regular on the remaining points. And pretty much you can make an imprimitive group out of those ingredients for which the action on the blocks does not have property star P. Okay. Okay, so hopefully it's still stable. There we go, that's good. So now, what about if you know something about primitive groups, you might have encountered the Onan-Scott types. Don't worry if you haven't. But basically, you can divide them up into different types. I'll use the five-case distinction here: affine almost simple diagnosis of dereference product action. And in our paper, we And in our paper, we ruled out diagonal type and twisted wreath. Can never have property star p. Okay. Now, the affine groups doesn't take long to work out that if you write down your typical looking affine group, so with defining characteristic p, so your set has size p to the d, that it cannot have. You cannot have, so cannot have property star R when R is not equal to P. And this is also supposing that R is a divisor of your group, order of your group. And so it can only have property star P. Okay, so that's kind of resolved. And if you look at the almost simple At the almost simple case, this is still very much alive and open. There are examples, but we don't know all of them. And in product action, we can kind of reduce to looking at almost simple groups. So typically write down G is inside of a wreath product acting in product action, and your H subgroup here, which is in sim delta. Delta is of almost simple type. So this is primitive of almost simple type. And if you take the kind of component of g, so you've you stay, you fix the first coordinate and act on delta, you think of that as your h, then if g has property star p, then this will. Okay, so there's kind of a reduction to the almost simple type, which brings us to Which brings us to the following question. Determine all the almost simple primitive groups that have this property star P, we want P to divide N and P dot N P to be less than N. So we don't want all these trivial cases. And also P to divide the point stabilizer. And think of Cheryl's result for two transitive groups. For two transitive groups, you get very few turning up here in the almost simple case. The affine case is contained in this example here, if you're wondering. So two transitive almost simple groups, you have a classification. So now the question is, what about primitive groups? We haven't tackled that, but we have extended Cheryl's result by dropping this condition here that NP was equal to P. Equal to P. So here is the joint result of our paper. This is Alexander Boers, Lisa Villas, Michael Judasi, Cheryl Prager, and Gordon Royal from the research retreat. We have a two-transitive, a finite two-transitive group, and G has property star P, then you either get these trivial results, trivial Results, trivial types when it happens. Or you get one more case than Cheryl's list. So Cheryl had these two: A5 on six points, M11 on 12 points. But you also get P gamma L28 acting too transitively on 28 points. Now, PSL28 also has properties star 2, but it's not too transitive. But if you're interested, that's kind of interesting. Interesting. But it's also we also have the phenomenon that P is still small, two or three, and the degree is small. So the question you might be asking, it looks like we're going to finish early actually, is what happens? Well, first of all, I'll say a little bit about how we might have proved this, but then I'll give some computational results at the end. So how did we prove this? Well, I won't. How did we prove this? Well, I won't go into the gory details, but you start off with your list of almost simple two-transitive groups. So they've been classified. And in particular, I'll say something about the Suzuki case. Now, remember that this is kind of complicated because property star P goes downwards to transitive subgroups, not upwards. So really, you have to consider. Really, you have to consider your group, your almost simple group G, which you know has, say, Sokol, the Suzuki group, but it can be as large as Suzuki group extended by field orthomorphisms. Now, so the Suzuki group acts naturally on Q squared plus one elements. If P divides Q squared plus one, the degree, then it's actually going to be a primitive prime divisor of Q to the four minus one. P will divide. P will divide q to the 4 minus 1, clearly, because q squared plus 1 does. But the property star p condition, if you think about it, means that p has to be a primitive prime divisor and of one of these, q minus 1, q squared minus 1, or q to the 4 minus 1. In the background, we also see that the Suzuki group is acting naturally as a subgroup of the symplectic group sp4q. That's important. That's important here. And so this point stabilizer has order dividing q squared times q minus one, possibly with f on the end. And so p will actually divide this index. And so this means that your C LOP subgroup is actually one-dimensional semi-linear. So the upshot is you have a lot of control of your C-lop subgroup. You understand a lot about. Understand a lot about its order and what it looks like and how it acts. Remember, we're acting on a four-dimensional vector space, really, in the background. And we have this technical emma, which I must say is solely due to the next speaker, Michael Judici. It's really a beautiful result. It's hard to appreciate right now, but we were doing lots of different cases, and this seems to be the unifying. Lemma that you need to treat all of them. So initially, we would have done, say, PCU3Q, and the Suzuki groups, three groups, all separately. But what's actually going on there is in each case, you have a one-dimensional semi-linear C LOP subgroup. Don't worry about all the other mess on the page here. But you will get a contradiction for the Suzuki group case for the two conditions D and E. So you ask yourself what can happen to an L. Happen to an element of this LOP subgroup and how it acts, and you'll get that the number of fixed points clashes with your degree of your action. So that is our technique for ruling out many of the cases. That was interesting. And then some of them we had to go a bit deeper into the subgroup structure. So in each case, it wasn't just a matter of Just a matter of using pure permutation group theory, we had to use a lot about our knowledge of classical groups, groups, to deal with these cases. The sporadic two transitive groups, we just did by computer. Finally, some computational results. So this is quite interesting. We saw that with two transitive groups, the only examples you get are low degree and low prime p. Now go to GAP or magma and have a look at the primitive. And have a look at the primitive groups library degree at most 4095 and ask which ones have property star p, and also not having these trivial conditions, okay, which force they would force property star p, then you still only get degree at most 135. So out of all 4095 degrees, you only get up to 135 PSP62 and that action there. Action there, and I'll just leave it on that note. And thanks for listening. Thank you, John. Are there any questions for John? John, you don't seem to have the P gamma L2.8 in the list. Is that because of so maybe? So, maybe not too transitive. Let's add that to the slide. Yeah. But PSO25 said. But M11 is too transitive. You know, I copied it from our paper. So something's wrong. Oh, no. All right. So, yes. Thanks for that. Double check the paper. It could be my copying of the paper wasn't good. That's most likely what. Do you think this list is complete, or do you think there'll be infinitely many examples? What's your feeling about this? That's a very, very good question. I don't have any intuition for what. I mean, we have this number theoretic condition, and we know that primitive groups don't like to have a lot of large. Primitive groups don't like to have a lot of large prime divisors, but still, I can't see why you can't get P equals five or seven and large degree. I mean, that's it is a bit of a mystery to me, but it would be interesting to see if there's a way to bound the degree. I don't see why. Yeah, P Gamer L28 is not in our list. Table one for the paper. Oh no. But in the paper, it says. In the paper, it says except the ones that have soccer PSL2Q. Ah, thank you. Table one lists everything that has, except the ones with Soccer PSL2Q. Of the grade Q choose to. Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, it's very easy to forget. So there is actually an infinite family that John actually came up with with pair cell 2QQ even acting on Q choose 2. Q choose two points, so that's not there as well. My bad. Okay, probably star clue. So another question. How do you think that's the only infinite family? Very good question. I reckon that would be worth conjecturing because here's a foolish, naive reason for that, is that I think that you mop up a lot of the start of your infinite family. A lot of the start of your infinite families by looking at those small degrees, in almost simple, that is. So you actually treat a lot of them. And if it doesn't, if you don't get them in the small cases, you're not going to get them in the large cases either. So that would be the naive reason for it. Yeah, no more infinite families. Yeah, that would be safe. I think that's a very brave conjecture. Yeah, I know. But we didn't see anything up to 4095. Yeah, that doesn't rule out exceptional groups of lead type, I guess. Do we even know that the PSL2s give an infinite family? Or we just found a lot of them? No, no, it's infinite. They're 4.10. Okay. Okay. Okay, are there any other questions? All right, well, if not, let's thank John again for a very nice talk. Thank you, John. And we'll be back in about 20 minutes for the next talk by Michael Giudici.
