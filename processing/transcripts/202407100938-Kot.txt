And I will be showing well what exactly I will be showing. I will be showing numerical simulations of soft matter simulations showing deformations of elastic materials, where we can observe what's happening inside of them and how the tensions inside materials can be Potentials inside materials and would lead to cracking. The main idea here is that I represent an elastic body as a system of mass points. So, for example, a cube would be discretized as a set of mass points. We can do it on the regular lattice, or the distribution of the points could be randomized. And the model I use basically connects the closest neighbors with springs. Spring is really just a concept of connectivity between two points. Basically, you say that these two points will be interacted. Say that these two points will be interacting somehow. The simplest interaction is just a linear force, but in principle, we could put anything in there. And then we will expose such system to, well, we could expose it to external force, see what's happening, and these external forces cause the formations. And it cracks. I mean, cracks could appear. So, the networks, the looping networks, that we'll hopefully be able to observe are coming from cracks that evolve. We can have different crack patterns. And yeah, that's the short story. I will quickly show you what I mean by And by is it with periodic boundary conditions or is there a boundary to that? Usually I don't do periodic boundary conditions, but it's possible, yeah. I mean, it depends on the setup. Just just to uh show you. Show you what I'm talking about when I say simulation. So, I have something like this, which I built for my master's degree in computer science, because I like games and I wanted to, you know, simulate things that actually perform and behave in an interesting way. So, for example, these are like two objects. Most simulates their behavior. Alright, so I can do it step by step. You can see they collide. That's my own code before we catch. Well, I mean, so these So these these are just points uh but well they are visual as the points but actually for the collision purposes they are spheres so they are bigger than that and yes and then you know it hits the ground, bounces off so so this is basically a physical simulation of the of the salt. physical simulation of the of the solid body. And then and then what what what we can do here, for example, is uh sorry okay let's let's say it's like this. I can I can you know form it somehow you know run the simulation, let it relax Run the simulation, let it relax and see what happens. I will ship it too. Okay, so that's the basic idea. I can have things like this. So this is like a ribbon. Right, don't they have the same story? Yeah, I can I can take different play with it and well, but the physics is happening there. So the main idea is that we have a material represented in basically this way. We're format. And then you can impose a condition on a string like that. So this is the view, you know, like if you look at it. If you look at it, how it's actually composed of springs. And then we can say that if a spring deforms too much, it breaks, right? That's like a simple way of simulating something like that. And then with that setup properly. set up properly we could for example these are results from my uh master's thesis uh university physics so basically we're trying to recreate the hexagonal patterns on the dry material so then you would have a well a piece of material dry it top to bottom and and when material dries well dries Dries. Well, dries in this case, it's not drying but actually cooling because these kids appear when magma, lava, cools down. So the top layers shrink and they crack, and the crack progresses down inside of the material, evolving, the shape can evolve. Can evolve, and on these pictures, you can see this is the top of the sample, and going down on the top, the pattern looks well not very regular, but as you go down, it kind of evolves towards sort of regular hexagonal-like shapes. And excuse me, your basic interactions are only like uh sprays. Yes. Like springs. Yes. Like F equals KX, like we are talking about. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, exactly. So the model is very simple. This is another example of cracks that I can get. So this is like a top view of a flat surface that was drying, and also because it dries shrinks, it doesn't cut something like that. And all these. Both these are basically points and strings, and what you see here in the dark contours is basically broken strings. And it sort of resembles cracks like this you can have on the surface. So the main idea here is that, well, you take a piece of material. You take a piece of material and it undergoes some phenomenon. It could be either drying or shrinking, or either drying or cooling. In both cases, it shrinks. So when a material shrinks, what will happen? Let's say you have a cube like this. You change the natural length of each spring and then run the simulation to let the system run. The system relaxes, so it will shrink. In this case, it will simply shrink uniformly, right? And nothing will happen because there is no mechanism that would lead to rising tension. But if you have if you divide that, let's say, cube and shrink on the top part of it, then Then, suddenly, the tension rises because the top wants to be small, the bottom wants to be big, but they are connected. So you get tensions, and these tensions lead to cracks. If you continue this process, that's what will happen here. This is a different type of shrinking. So instead of shrinking uniformly, Of shrinking uniformly the top part of the material, we do something like this basically, and then the result is like that. Kind of similar, but you know, slightly different. So, this top part actually, if it wasn't a dynamic Actually, if it wasn't attached to the bottom, we would want to in its natural form it would take like a U shape. But because it's attached here, that's where most of the forces will go and that's why it breaks in these places. But if the sample is bigger, it will actually something like this will happen. So actual cracks will appear in the middle. Here in the middle of the material. And basically, it looks like the width of the sample in this simple setup determines whether the crack will appear from the top, whether the thing will break in half or peel off. So if it's small enough, there will be not enough tension. There will be not enough tension in here, in the middle, to form the crack, and it will simply lift. If it's big enough, it will crack. If it's very big, it will crack with a characteristic spacing that kind of corresponds to this threshold here. So it will form islands without cracks of the size of basically the. Of the size of basically this thing. Same thing in 3D pulling or like shrinking the top to bottom. So this is a cylinder. After the simulation it looks like that. And these are cross sections. Like on the side of it. So you can see that that You can see that that's uh yeah, it it it looks very similar to two-dimensional uh case, either peels or cracks in the middle. The other interesting uh phenomenon here uh that we can observe is for example a disk when you When you impose this sort of deformation on the disk, so you shrink the top, but leave the bottom unshrunk, and then there's a linear function of the shrinking intensity. This would like to become a ball, basically, right? And Right? And in this case, the whole disk springs well deforms, but it's not attached to anything. Just because of this shape change, enough tension will appear to form cracks. And the reason we have The reason behind it is that in case of two-dimensional structure, let's say like this, this thing actually have an equilibrium configuration when it takes a U shape, right? There is a radius of curvature and and then it if it wasn't attached to anything, it would break. To anything, it would break, it would not break. In case of a disk, each cross-section would be like a U-shape, but then on the circumference, these springs along the circumference, they don't have any reason to shrink, so they resist the process, and that's why it cannot become like It cannot become like a true bulb. It's getting basically pushed apart by its top, and that's what happens. And interesting thing is that when you observe it, it's bending like this, but it's the top that experiences elongation. Elongation and the bottom is actually exclusive shrinkage. And experimenting with different ways that you can deform this part of the material. For example, this is. For example, this is the function of wetness or how the material streams, the bottom of the material, the top of the material, water concentration. So on the top, water evaporates, and then we have a profile like that, and this is basically the shrinkage profile. And left to right, it would lead to a pattern like this, which is kind of similar. Similar, I saw that on the this is a form on gas in the library when I was where I was studying. Different biote number leads to slightly different patterns. Linear front, we get a pattern like this. The top of the sample and the cross sections going deeper on a Deeper on different layers. I'm just gonna show you like various patterns that I can get from this. And basically, all you change is this shrinking function. And yeah, this is a cylindrical geometry where Geometry where starts shrinking at the center and the current propagates upwards. In certain cases, you can get reconnections here, in others, you can get reconnections of a different type. Yet other Yet, other cases don't reconnect at all. Yes, if the material is strong enough, it wouldn't start breaking until it builds up enough pressure. This cracks, this is a cracking that's going instead of the center outward, it goes from the edge. From the edge to the inside, and this is also forms a completely different pattern if you compare it with this one, for example. If the wavelength doesn't change, you don't get bifurcations, and then you can have multiple fronts, and then it leads to patterns. Well, patterns like that basically. Yeah, that's that's all. Questions from Mary Jungston? Um something good. How how are you defining uh breaking? So you have a special button? So you have a special definition? The breaking happens when a spring is longer than a certain percentage of its natural length. So you have this parameter that you can vary in the different solutions? Yes, exactly. Looks very cool. I've been working a little bit with a similar system. A little bit with a similar system, and I was then thinking about how to map it to a continuum material. And what was very difficult for me is to define something like a Poisson ratio because it depends on the local connectivity. And once it starts to break, the local connectivity changes. So, have you thought about how to map your system to like agreeable real materials? Actually, I can tell you how to do that, because I I did a PhD on that. I did a PhD on that. But the answer is it is possible. Well, cracking is a different phenomenon. I think you shouldn't mix things like passenger with cracking because you talk about puzzle duration when you have uniform homogeneous material. But basically, the short answer is that in In a mass spring system where you have central interactions, the Poisson ratio is set. It's one for three-dimensional structures. If you want a different ratio, you need to introduce something else to the model. And actually, I have a nice one here, which is um like dispersive interactions. So actually actually I even have a slide on that. Actually, I even have a slide on that. Basically, if you consider that normally the spring acts on the node, well, as the springs do, you can introduce this concept that, okay, let's take this force, the normal healer, this is a spring, right? Two big particles, this force that would appear there, and imagine that. Appear there. And imagine that it's actually dispersing, you know. So if you had like theoretically 10 Newtons of force between two particles, you apply five Newtons in the normal way and the other five you sort of radiate from these particles in all directions. And this creates a kind of like fluid-like behavior where instead of shear. Instead of sheer stress, you introduce the pressure in the material, and then when you have this gives you the additional degree of freedom to get a whole spectrum of Poisson ratios. I want to ask, can you introduce some significant heterogeneity into your initial splinks and will it be like correlated to the locations of fractals later? Yes, definitely. I mean, you can locally, you can set the springs to anything you like. You can vary the strength and the resistance to breaking. But then it's difficult to study, but it's difficult to kind of describe these sort of materials because you are dealing with very specific cases then. Yes. Uh yes, but definitely possible. Quick. Have you ever looked at the statistical distribution of your crafts? Did you find some significant distribution of size of your like craft regions? Yes, yes, these are more specific studies. I I actually now I'm I'm doing simulations con mostly Doing simulations mostly for Staszek, and he's doing a statistical art. So maybe he can answer your questions better. Okay, thank you. So now coffee break and we start again at ten. Thirteen. Can I ask you a question?
