Good. Okay. Thanks very much for the introduction. Thanks to the organizers for the invitation. So this will be a chalk talk. And I'll try and make best possible use, optimal use of the chalkboard differences among chalkboard. So I'm going to write the title. Among chalkboard. So I'm going to write the title here. If you can't read it, it's fine because you already know it. It's a descriptive approach to manifold classification. And this is joint work with Ian Smythe. And I should emphasize that this is work in progress. And I should emphasize that this is work in progress. It's been in progress for some time. It's closer to being finished than it ever has been. Of course, that's a tautology, but it's one that I find strangely reassuring. So I'll begin by sort of unpacking some of the words here, what I mean by these words here. So, number one, maybe one A. And please let me know if anything is not visible, legible, comprehensible, audible, any of the above. So, by descriptive set theoretic study of classification columns. Columns. I mean, so, in other words, by a descriptive approach to, I mean, principally the study of one analytic Analytic equivalence relations E on Polish or standard Borel spaces X and typically I'll just write these Tax comma E. So these will be the objects of study, and we'll be studying Borel reductions between or among them. Just to recall what those are. IE. So a Borel reduction is a Borel function f from X to Y, where X and Y are Polish spaces, maybe standard Borel spaces, for which little X is E equivalent to little Y, if and only if. only if f of x is f equivalent to here we'll write x e less than or equal to borel to record the existence of such a reduction are we clear for the moment then we have number three um these x e These XE, okay, the study of analytical equivalence relations E and Folish for standard Borel spaces X, these X E parametrized classification problems from broader math in parametrizing as I wrote it. Firstly, the study of XE parametrizing classification problems from broader mathematics. This is bad English, from broader mathematics. Enjoy a certain prominence. Okay, what am I trying to communicate here? Okay, what am I trying to communicate here? Of course, as set theorists, as descriptive set theorists, we can say a lot of things about there being no universal Borel equivalence relation or things like this. These are sort of internal descriptive set theoretic statements, but part of what animates the subject is its relation to outer mathematics, the outer world of mathematics. So, this is a framework within which I want to engage with. Engage with questions of manifold classification. Would it be useful to review some of the key sites, the key benchmarks, the key sort of equivalent relations within this framework? Because they'll come up in the course of the talk. Okay. So I'll attempt to map some of the essential ones just as nodes and a partial order. Low down here is what I'll write, E R equals, which in that notation might be better written R equals. Here the Polish space is Here, the Polish space is the reals. The equivalence relation is just that of equality. Equivalence relations which reduce, which are rel less than or equal to this, are called smooth. And below it, we have even. Equality on the natural numbers. Next up, what I want to chart is E infinity. E infinity is maximal or it's universal for what are sometimes called Siebergs, countable Borel equivalence relations. Of course, it sits above ER equals. And I mentioned that this has a lot to do, a lot of, this is highly informed by broader mathematics. So these benchmarks, these locations, these Borel complexity degrees are instantiated by particular problems within mathematics. For example, finitely generated groups, this is due to. This is due to Thomas and Velichkiewicz, finitely generated groups. There's a natural Polish parameterization of finitely generated groups and isomorphism. This is an instance of this Borel equivalence relation. Perhaps you might say that countable Borel equivalence relations are not what it sounds like. Yeah, a lot of the names, a lot of the names in this subject are poor ones. So countable. Are poor ones. So countable Borel equivalence relations means that each equivalence class has countably many elements. Up here is something that's sometimes called Borel complete. That's a really bad name. But I'm just going to denote this EG. And things here, things falling below EG, okay, so what? Okay. Okay, so what? Okay. If I wasn't clear, this Polish space and equivalence relation is universal for this class. Everyone in this class admits a Borel reduction to this degree, or to this in particular. Another instance of this is two to the F2, where F2 is the Uh, two to the F2, where F2 is the free group with two generators and the shift action, um, with the orbit equivalent to the shift action. Um, so up here we have groups ISO or which is rel equivalent to graphs ISO and something tacit, and everything that I've written here, here, here is countable. Here, here, here is countable. So these guys are countable, and then there's a natural way to parametrize these. And these guys are universal for classification problems, which is just another way of talking about such X comma E classification problems, which are classifiable by countable structures. These are also universal for equivalence relations, which are given by an action of the Polish group S infinity, the permutation group. So this is sort of, I don't know, this is the chart that will be relevant for what we're doing today. Is it clear enough? So that's the DST part, the descriptive approach part, and then we want to talk about a manifold. So, what do I mean by a manifold? By manifold? I mean, the standard pictures. And a standard picture is something like this. So here's M. M is the manifold. And then you have some open sets which correlate somehow to a U here, maybe a V here. Maybe a V here. And these U and V are open sets in X, the model space. This is sometimes termed the model space. And examples, of course, would be R to the N, but also we might have spherical manifolds or common. Have spherical manifolds or complex manifolds or hyperbolic manifolds. Any of those could be the model space. And then these open sets, their images or their correlates, should cover this manifold M. So, and then we have these maps here, P. And for each such as P and Psi. P and psi, phi composed with psi inverse. So you kind of have an image of this overlap. And phi composed with psi inverse is going to take this to this. So it's not defined on, or this to this. It's not defined on the full domain. And I won't denote restrictions going ahead. Is a structure. Structure preserving bijection where structure topological structure structure At the very least. Okay, so let me stand back from this for a second. What I'm clearly interested in here is as much what this picture doesn't specify as what it does specify. In other words, well, to take an even further step back, this is a well-developed and really pretty viable. And really, pretty vibrant area of set theory, area of descriptive set theory that engages with classification problems throughout mathematics. Remarkably, though, it hasn't engaged a whole lot with manifold classification. A standout name within this subject is Horth, and the first example that he gives of a successful classification in his book. In his book, is the classification of closed surfaces. In other words, compact surfaces. Now, with these, we know to count the genus, pay attention to the orientability, and clearly there are only countably many of them. So clearly, this, if you check that everything's Borel, which in fact we will, this sits right here. Sits right here. There are really two other results, one of them locating here, and one of them locating here, in a subject that by now is about 40 years old. And the first mystery for Ian and me is why there aren't more. Particularly when, now last thing I'll say in terms of background is: I don't know a lot about manifolds, or I didn't know a lot about manifolds, and I wanted to, or I wanted an excuse to learn. As we begin to look at the theorems, a lot of them seem to have. The theorems, a lot of them seem to have really plain or unambiguous descriptive set-theoretic content, and it was remarkable to us that that hadn't been recorded more. As it turns out, some of the difficulty in our experience and others' experience, much of the difficulty is in parametrizing manifolds, spaces of manifolds. You want to talk about spaces of manifolds, and it's not clear. And it's not clear how, in general, to do that in a nice or appealing or tractable way. So much of the initial work for us and much of the work that we value, I mean, I think we conceive of this work fundamentally as foundational, as opening up a way of working on lots of problems in this area, is we wanted something that could We wanted something that could accommodate really the generality that we see in this picture. And so that's what I'm about to describe. So what I mean is every one of these guys, when you open a book on manifolds, if it's a topological, well, if it's any manifold, if this is going to be required to be a homeomorphism. But if you're talking about smooth manifolds, the key is that this is going to be a C infinity. This is going to be a C infinity, it's going to be a diffeomorphism. We're talking about complex manifolds. The key always is what you require here, how much structure you require this to preserve. The overlap needs to be open. In each pre-image, I think of that as sort of built in here because this is going to be open here, this is going to be open here, and these need also to be. These need also to be structure preserving. Well, this will be open. This will be open. You didn't say that. It's going to say all I see is. No, I didn't say that. That's true. That's true. These guys are open. And these guys are going to be bijected. And these guys are going to be bijections. And in fact, M is just a placeholder. We don't actually care about M ultimately. The shaded part here does have, yeah, it does have to be open. In fact, this leads us, since there's been a lot of hand waving, bad diagrams, and words, I'm going to put something mathematical on the board. Which may address some of Alan's concerns. So the key notion here, which I hadn't been aware of, but I'm now very fond of, so is a pseudo group. A pseudo group G on a topological space X is a set of homeomorphisms between open status, between Open subsets of X satisfying some baby stuff. Number one, you want this to cover, you want the domains to cover your X. Now, generally, when I say X in this Now, generally, when I say x in this talk, you should think model space. It's the thing that we're taking pieces of, pasting together to make the manifold. This should equal x phi mg. So for any element of the pseudo group and open subset of the domain, the restriction should also be. The restriction should also be in the pseudo group phi psi in G implies that phi composed psi is in G. And again, this composition could be like here where the domain. Here, where the domain we lose some domain. And then, four, there's a locality condition, which is a little annoying to write down, but it's but basically there's there's there's a picture, there's an idea here, which I think this sufficiently conveys. And examples, we want the inverse. No, we certainly want the Andrews. And let's put that. I'm surprised it's not here. Thank you. I think that's complete. Okay, so an example would be talk. would be the and in fact this is the maximal pseudo group on x. In other words for any x the pseudogroups are they're related by inclusion and if you just have every homeomorphism between open sets that defines a pseudogroup which we'll label top more restricted pseudogroups More restricted pseudo-groups would be maybe x equals Rn and then G might be smooth. In other words, it would just be the homeomorphisms that are infinitely differentiable. Or we might have x equals c to the n, and we might have the biholomorphic pseudo group. So anytime you have some transformations of the whole space, Time you have some transformations of the whole space, then you can restrict them to, you know, some homeomorphisms of the whole space, you can restrict them to the open sets, and this will generate a pseudo group. So you can also sort of conflate the global and the local in this way. And then lastly, time permitting, we'll be talking about x metric. So x is any metric space, then, for example, Hn, then G equals isometry. Where what? Locality roughly means that if I have an open set U and I have pseudo group elements on the restriction of a collection of U sub alpha whose union is U, then just assembling them together is an element of the pseudo group. It's very sheaf-like, yeah. Okay, so now is this okay? I saw that question. I saw that question coming from you precisely. Let's put a definition on the board. On the board, obviously, since I want to do like Polish stuff and descriptive, like sooner or later, that's going to come in. So that sooner is now. So, okay, so definition A G X Atlas on M Is as pictured. I did it again. But a GX atlas is going to be, it's going to be a collection of open subsets of M together with maps from those open subsets to open subsets of the model space with the property that each of these transition maps falls in the pseudo group. Um and if all phi voes reside inverse R and G and an M or on X? G is a pseudo group on X and it determines structure on M and taking thinner pseudo groups corresponds to strong Thinner pseudor groups correspond to stronger structure, yeah. Um, okay, so an M possessing a GX atlas is a locally G X space and And is a G X manifold if M is T two and second countable. So, as many in the room know, there's a very interesting. There's a very interesting subject of non-second countable, non-Hausdorff manifolds. So yeah, we're going to focus on these. And actually, life would be easier if we didn't care about house store. It's fairly hard to specify house, like to write this down and to verify, or it was hard for me to verify that that's going to give you something Barrel, to write it down in a Barrel way. But anyway, Away. But anyway, we have as examples. That hand isn't moving. So it's about 32 after right now? You've got 32 more. 32 more minutes. Okay, thank you. Team two and second time. I'm sorry, that doesn't necessarily mean my. That doesn't necessarily imply T3 or reprisibly. Well, actually, in general, in general, ask the experts. But in the case of manifolds, as soon as you're house door, you're normal. I guess I'm supposed to be one of those experts. I hope I passed. I hope I passed. Okay, so if we say topological manifolds, the more formal way to write that in our language is a top, Rn manifold. This is the pseudo group, this is the model space. Smooth manifolds are Rn manifolds, etc. I'm not going to write down hyperbolic manifolds, but you could. And And okay, so we have the definitions out of the way. And this are there questions In our own training, if we had even any training in manifolds at all, like they're often presented as. They're often presented as very ad hoc. Maybe you care about smooth manifolds, maybe you care about topological manifolds. But as I've learned more about this, the study of manifolds often concerns questions like when structure of a given sort implies structure of a stronger sort. So it's relations between the various pseudo-groups that you might want to keep track of. And so this framework is really useful for that. It's most closely associated with the name of Thurston. Associated with the name of Thurston. But Wikipedia traces it back to Cartan and even Lee. So the point is that this parametrization affords us a very general approach to parametrizing manifolds. So let's name that approach the parametrization. Uh Please. So I'll write it down here. Will I? For what we want to do for the parametrization, I mean, this parametrization will work for anything. Will work for anything. I mean, in principle, it makes sense for any choice of X. To get a standard Borel space, we're going to want to restrict to locally compact Polish spaces X, which will certainly subsume anything that we might have in mind in a manifold basis direction. So the parameterization PGX of locally compact, no, of locally GDX spaces consists of pairs u, C. U is for a collection of open sets. C is maybe for charts where u equals u i. equals mu ij for ij omega squared. These are a bunch of open subsets of the model space. And then c equals the ij, which will map u ij to uj i and again this is for i j omega square. Omega squared and this also will be a subset of G and a picture ui which is which will be this and then a u i j u i j will always sit within ui i that's the first condition um so we're recording both you know the open sets and the images of the overlaps um satisfy Of the overlaps satisfy one u ij is a subset of uii, which we might just write u i for all i j omega. And then there's a two through three, two through four, which are just going to ensure that the equivalence relation on The equivalence relation on this, which is induced by these transition maps, well, that's it's an equivalence relation that it's and a nice one. So we'll want the ii to just equal the identity. We'll want the ij to equal the ji inverse. And for is a transitivity condition having to do with if you have this and this and this, the way that, oh no. The way that these guys interact, if you write it down in your IJK, for all, let's say these guys, one, two, three. These guys. One, two, three, four for all I say. Okay. Defining the point is that these conditions define a closed equivalence relation on, as indicated, the use of eyes. Close equivalence relation. Let's mark it like that. And we'll say m of u, c equals this u sub i modulo that equivalence relation. In other words, this is the manifold. It's encoded by these collections of open sets together with the transition maps. And I'm proposing that that fully encodes the manifolds. And then I'm also proposing that these are. And I'm also proposing that these are, well, this will be the next theorem, that these are fairly basic conditions, basic enough within this context that it's not hard to check that this will, for locally compact Polish X and a Borel, in a suitable sense, pseudo group G, this will define a standard Borel space. And then we'll be good to go. We'll be able to proceed with these descriptive set-theoretic analyses. Theoretic analysis. But do you want U to be a base or something? U is just the collection use of eyes, these are just covers. So you have these use of eyes, and they should exhaust this manifold. But actually, this picture is a little deceptive. This M is just a placeholder. There's nothing happening in this M that isn't just induced by these guys. It just allows us to speak of this structure a little more simply, but you can also just view it as. More simply, but you can also just view it as a quotient or a co-equalizer or something like this. Yeah, it's a recipe. And so the major in the in in in the in the history or the the the the zoo that I was sketching here, the major work on Sketching here, the major work on manifolds and descriptive set theory, invariant descriptive set theory was by Hjorth and Kekris. And they don't so much, I mean, they kind of looking at these guys, but they're also looking at M and they're looking at a lot of times when we think about M, we think about how it's embedded or there might be a metric on it, but we don't really care about the metric. It's not intrinsic for a topological manifold. We would like to not worry about it when we don't want to. But X should be, like I say, just locally compact polish. It could. Now, in the cases that I'm talking about, I mean, people even talk about like, I don't know, David, do you know about these things? People talk about manifolds of like totally disconnected manifolds and things like this. I mean, you can put these things together, but that I won't be worried about that. Yeah. Should you be a base for their. Be a base for x? No, I don't at all require that u exhausts x. No. So I haven't thought too much about the more, you know, the more out-of-the-box types of types of assemblages, but I mean, mostly I'm looking at sort of the the classical mainstream ones, but certainly that they would work within this framework and they're probably good questions, yeah. Framework, and they're probably good questions. Yeah. So, ah, I was erasing to make space for a theorem, which I think will be our first. Okay, so theorem, if G is a Borel pseudo group. Pseudo group, which I won't define on a locally compact polar space. But I will note that as all we've mentioned so far. So far R then P of G X is a Borel subset of the standard Rail space O divided by x to omega squared times g to omega squared. So we have a collection of open sets. Given a Polish space, there's a natural way of putting, well, given a locally compact Polish space, there's a natural way of putting a topology on the collection of open sets, a Polish topology. Here we have a countable product of those. And then there's, it's not so easy to put a It's not so easy to put a topology here. There's just sort of a standard Borel structure here in general. So, what we end up with is a standard Borel space here. And this is just the opens. This is the opens with no, it's the full collection. So, we're taking the countable collection will be an element of O to the X. collection will be an element of o to the x o to the omega squared and then this has the fell topology or the chabouti topology is sometimes called although that that's typically defined with with respect to the closed subsets of x but just by taking complements you have a topology on the open subsets of x um and it induces the effro-sporel structure on o of x um if that's something you're familiar with um so we have a polish topology here A Polish topology here, in general, and a Borel structure here. And so we have a standard Borel space here. And recall that any Borel subset of a standard Borel space is also a standard Borel is a standard Borel space. So therefore, well, not therefore, therein, the household parameters. UC. In other words, the UC, which defines a Hausdorff manifold MUC, define a further ERL subspace of GX manifolds. Manifolds which we denote M G X moreover the relation of G equivalence On the elements of either is an analytic one. Okay, so when I say g equivalence, if we're in this setting, our g is top, so we have a space m. So we have a space M top Rn, which is a space of topological n manifolds, and then we have a notion of equivalence between them associated to the pseudo group we care about, which encodes the structure that we care about. And that equivalence is just homeomorphism. This says that in great generality, this consideration of manifolds can be translated into the class. The classical descriptive invariant descriptive set theoretic framework. How am I doing on time? And are there any questions? 18 more minutes. Okay, good. People who work on manifolds, often they have very nice spaces of manifolds, like Teichmüller spaces, spaces that are very geometric. This is not very geometric. That's a price that you pay for the generality. That you pay for the generality. One sign that it may be harder to do better is how hard it is to write down Hausdorff in a Borel way. In fact, a lot of the subclasses of manifolds that I'll specify, well, I'll say compact in a moment, and I'll say that's also Borel. The way that you show that it's Borel is that you write down one definition. Is that you write down one definition which is analytic and then you write down another definition which is co-analytic? Yeah, good. So for compact one, there are of course other parametrizations. So for instance, you can look at this outdoor ground of space without metric and just look at the hybrid space of that. And can you prove that they are equivalent is to? To install the so-called because this seems rather ad hoc. So it's one could argue that maybe there is a different equivalence related. So when you say there's a Gromoff parametrization or something, what exactly do you mean? Well, there's this Ausder-Gromov metric which do every compact, which tells you differences between compact metrics. Okay, so you want to talk about the manifolds which are embedded. So, you want to talk about the manifolds which are embedded in some R to the N. And you want to look at the compact ones as a compact. Okay, to say that you're only looking at the manifolds and that that collection forms a Borel space is not so straightforward. So you can say, okay, I'm looking at compact sets. But how would you argue that all possible parametrizations give you the same type of thing? Yeah, this is like the church's thesis. Yeah, this is like the church's thesis of invariant descriptive set theory. And yeah, that's an open question. I mean, this is theology. But you argue that it's gone well so far, I think. But the theorem that I'm about to write down will connect with what you're asking. And basically, it says that compact is not interesting within this framework. The bottom line here. The bottom line here is that, well, first we have to say that, okay, yes, yes, more or less yes to everything everyone is saying. To write it with some formality, for any end the collection you see yeah. Yeah, such that M of U C is compact defines a Borel subset of and of op all right um And then the corollary is the problem of homeomorphism for topological N-manifolds for compact topological manifolds is Borel. URL equivalent to n equals. So yes, very discreet in principle. And as is that for smooth manifolds. So, this we can even prove. But actually, I think, okay, there's something that there's something that should be said here. In terms of manifold classification, manifold classification does have historically some interaction with logic, but it's more at the computability theory level. It's more in terms of where does the word problem maybe manifest. In other words, it's more a question of what can you do sort of in finite. A question of what can you do, sort of, in finite time. Invariant descriptive set theory is more a question of what can you do in sort of countable time, to speak very loosely. In terms of classifying, in terms of low-dimensional topology, we as a community have been successful at classifying two manifolds for sure, compact three manifolds. And then it's sort of proverbial, it's well known that, I mean, It's well known that, I mean, if you talk to people in the field, they'll say, well, you can't classify four manifolds, even compact four manifolds. Why? Because the word problem embeds into the fundamental groups of four manifolds. And if you could classify them, then you would. But this is saying that, I mean, you could focus your attention on dimension four. You could look at all compact topological manifolds simultaneously. This is saying that, from the descriptive set-theoretic perspective, that Perspective, that obstruction, which is due to Markov in the 60s, to classifying more for manifolds is a very low kind of obstruction. So, when there will be time permitting, when there will be a few other theorems showing that we have other classification problems that are higher on that hierarchy that I was showing us, basically, one value, if there is any, in this framework that I'm talking about, is it gives us a much richer class of degrees of different. Class of degrees of difficulty with which to talk about manifolds than people have had hitherto. So, anyway, this thing that people say could never be done, the classification of compact four manifolds, in fact, from this within this framework is very, very low, almost minimal. And this we can prove. How much time? Okay, let's prove this. So the key point. So the key point any well Euler characteristic is that wouldn't be satisfying that would be satisfying right so um one thing that this is saying is that Euler characteristic is is Borel that's a Borel computation and Euler characteristic would assign to and you can add in orientability so if you're looking at two manifolds then compact Looking at two manifolds, then compact two manifolds, and you can assign, or I mean, it's another way of saying the same thing. You can count the genus, you can write down another, and that's that's an assignment, it's just a natural number, essentially, too. And this is saying that in principle, although it doesn't always, I mean, it's saying it very abstractly, you're right, that's maybe a deficiency. It's saying in principle that that's just always the case for compact manifolds. And that assignment. And that assignment of invariance, it might not be computable, but it's always going to be Borel. So classification point here is not Borel points to saying there are simply countably many? Yeah. So there are in each case only countably many. There are many types of manifolds. This might have been known before, but there's a 1970 result that there are just countably many compact topological manifolds. Once you know that the, so I'll just talk out the rest of the proof. Once you know that the relation of G equivalence is analytic. Analytic. If there are accountably many, let's just take a Borel map which maps each equivalence class to a natural number. Well, the pre-image of that is going to be an analytic set whose complement is a countable union of the analytic sets, whose complement is analytic. In other words, it's going to be an analytic and co-analytic set. And therefore, it's going to be a Borel map. So anything that you do that's just geocoding. G equivalence invariant is going to be Borel, and you're done just because of this. So, again, yes, in a strong sense to what you just said. Well, what I said was important right, man. It sounds like it's the same as saying there are countably many equivalence classes, and each class is for L. Yeah. Go ahead. It's saying there are accountably many equivalence classes, each class is analytic. In conclusion, each class is for L. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So one other thing that this does, this focuses our attention. If we're going to have anything interesting to say, we're going to have to look at non-compact manifolds. This is another stimulus to this work because I was in Moralia and there were people who were very interested in non-compact two manifolds, big mapping class groups. And so I was. Mapping class groups, and so I was increasingly aware of theorems and work on non-compact manifolds. This is something that people are paying increasing attention to. I think in the interest of time, I'm sorry to keep seven more minutes. In the interest of time, I'll just record a few last theorems showing that non-compact manifolds are quite interesting. In this framework. And that varying G also gives very interesting answers. And I'll record a couple of questions. And if I run out of time, there's always the problem session tonight. So, theorem and then talk. And top are two. Yeah. Okay, so I'm just saying the homeomorphism problem for two manifolds, possibly non-compact, that this is universal, eg, for countable structures. So maximal complexity among the things that I wrote down there. There. And if you're interested in the proof, we can talk afterwards. At around the same time that Ian and I were looking at this, Ianella and Weinstein, formerly. I don't know. Ian El Einstein report proof that this is also true for n equals three. So, the classification of three manifolds also is of the same complexity. One wonders if one of these is going to be turbulent, if it's going to be. So, this brings us to question one, n greater than three. More formally is M of top. Top R to the N. Top. Is this Borel reducible? Is it classifiable by countable structures for all N? An even more maybe embarrassing or weird question is monotonicity. We don't know if this is monotonic. In other words, does Does M less than N imply that I'll just say topological M manifolds homeo is Borel less than the same for n manifolds? For in manifolds. So that's a very open question, and it's a surprisingly open question. One of the issues is that you can have a lot of manifolds. I mean, a way that you might try to reduce the M case to a larger N case is by multiplying by, say, R. But you can have lots of non-homeomorphic manifolds, uncountably many non-homeomorphic manifolds whose product with the real line then is homeomorphic. So this would take cleverness. And how many? Two. The last thing I'll say is that you can take you can take X. You can take X equals Hn, hyperbolic N space, then you can take G equals isometry. And then theorem that for all n greater than equal to two, this is the name of the name of the norm Is the infinity. It's bireducible with E infinity, that middle one that I gave. And actually, the interesting thing here is that, okay, in the same way that you have S1, and there's a close relation between this discrete subgroup of the isometries of R. In general, there's a strong relation between hyperbolic N-manifolds and the discrete subgroups. And the discrete subgroups of the isometry group of Hn. Equivalence on this side corresponds to a relation of conjugacy on this side. And there are some descriptive set-theoretic results that we are improving on in order to prove this. What we do here, 30 more seconds, what we do here, what we're using here is the presence of F2. Abelian group, non-free abelian group on two generators within the discrete subgroups of isom H2 or Hn because F2 contains as a subgroup F infinity. So, one question, which is more or less due to Simon Thomas, is whether you can do this. Let's do to Simon Thomas is whether you can do this if you restrict your attention to finitely generated discrete subgroups here, which would correspond on this side to the algebraically finite hyperbolic manifolds, which are those which have a finitely generated fundamental group. When n equals two, that classification problem is smooth. When n equals three, that classification problem is smooth by way of theorems that are less than 20 years old. By the way of theorems that are less than 20 years old, and when n equals anything larger, the question is wide open. So, thanks for your patience, and I'll stop there.          Two manifolds with boundary. There's no sound.
