Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. So I try to explain as possible for some questions and notations for the branding problem in the real estate. Okay, so So, this is not necessarily a setting, but we just warm up what was a ranching form and giving our representations of the group Z on the vector space V, and then giving our subgroup Z prime. And then we want to understand how the restrictions behave as a representation Z prime. And typical examples is Is a tensor product of two representations, which may be viewed as the branching of the outer tensor product of the direct product to the diagonal sub. And by branching problems in a broader sense than the usual, we wish to understand how the restrictions behave as a zip file model. So as I'm warming up in the real setting, As I'm warming up in the real setting, we consider geometric branching problems in the following sense. Given a manifold a variety X and its manifold Y, and suppose that they have their own symmetries described by the group action with Z and its subgroup Z prime. If we linearize these actions, namely think of the function space on X or a cohomology space on X, then on which the On X, then on which the group acts as a linear representation. Then, geometric branching problems, we may wish to understand these two functions based on X and Y through the subgroup action Z prime. Then we have two possibilities to consider, namely, morphing from the large space to the smaller space. This is referred to as. Phase. This is referred to as symmetry baker operators. And another direction is from small to large. This is referred to as holographic operators. And understanding such a homomorphism will be referred to as stage C or branching problem later on. And then now I want to enter more about real setting. And then we want to understand local operators. For simplicity, let us. For simplicity, let us just consider one variable case. And the local operator, I mean that it is a linear, continuous linear map from a function, one variable functions to one variable functions in this element examples. That does not increase the support in this sense. And in the category of continuous functions, such a local operator is just a form of the multiplication operators by some multiplication. By some multiplying some functions on R. So this is just some multiplication operators, which is local patients. But in the category of smooth functions, in the real setting, and then such a local operators is of the different derivatives of finite objects. Okay, now let us go one more. Now we more now we consider a pair of the manifold y is the submanifold x so the simplest example is that y is one dimensional and x is two dimensional and considered as some manifold and then uh local operators um from two variable functions one variable functions we mean that the support uh of t does not increase in the following uh sense that In sense that TF is contained in Y and support F for any. Then again, in the continuous setting, in the category of continuous functions, this is again multiplication operators composed by the restriction to the sum manifold. But in the category of smooth functions, then such operators is of the form again differential operators. More precisely that it may have a derivatives. It may have a derivatives along the submanifold, and also it may involve normal derivatives. And all the leaders, and then we after that, we restrict to the submanifold. So this is the general form of such local vectors in the real system. And in the branching problem, sometimes one of the difficulties of the branching problem in the real setting arises from isolated operators that we refer to as sporadic. Referred to as sporadic symmetry vacuum operators. And such operators cannot be obtained as a relative of any minimum family of symmetry vacuum operators, but just arise isolate operators, and often arise as a local operator in the previous sense in geometric models that may involve normal derivatives and derivatives along the money. And this difficulty we may encounter again in the end of this. Counter again in the end of this introduction. Now we consider again a general setting and first think of what kind of the pair we may think about the restrictions in the real case. And some classical studied case is, for example, fusion rule. So this is a tensor product of representations and how it composed, particularly studied for the compact groups. So it's a finite dimension case. So it's a finite dimensional case. And also in the real reductive case, that the k-type formula is also one of the crucial machinery to Anderson representations, where G is a real reductive Lie group and restricts to the maximal compact subgroup denoted by K. And these two examples have special cases of symmetric pairs that we recall now. So let Z be a group and the sigma be an involuntary automobile. And sigma be an involutable automorphism, and then we consider the subgroup consisted by a fixed point of sigma, and then the pair of G and G sigma is called a symmetric pair. And if G is reductive, this is called reductive symmetric pair. And from the perspective in the differential geometry, sometimes that we also allow H to be an open subgroup of this sigma, which has at most finite many connective components. So, this is the reduction symmetry pairs that we have already seen that the fusion rule for tensor product, this is the previous case. In this case, the sigma is the set of the factors. And the Riemannian symmetric case, this involutions is we take care of involution. But also, there are some other cases like GRNR and OPQ, and also And also GLNR and block diagonal matrices. And the last examples in the special setting, for example, in the case P prime equals zero and Q prime equals one correspond to the local gross plus conduct. But symmetric pairs, we can also consider arbitrary attitudes. Okay, so this is the example of symmetric pairs. Of symmetric pairs. And now we talk about these classical cases, namely restrictions to maximal compact tables corresponding to the data inversions case. And then the celebrated high-speed admissibility theorem says that for any irreducible unit representation pi to z, each k-type, in this case, the k is a maximum compact subgroup. case maximum compact subgroup like O and then such a finite damage representation in this case appears at most finitely many times so this is an individual finiteness theory and but this has a very has a crucial role for example it opens up algebraic studies of representations of real reductive groups through the notions of so-called game Notions of a so-called gay model. And also, this high-sender admissibility theorem guarantees that the real reductivity groups is type 1 in the sense of so this is for unit representations, but also we may think of this property for non-unitary representations. So, a continuous representation which is not necessarily unitary is said to be admissible if. HK type appears with finite many times. Okay, now also I like to fix some notations. They have to be the unit ideal, namely it's a set of irreducible unit representations of the group 3 up to unit equivalence. And then taking smooth vectors, then we get Taking smooth vectors, then we get them smooth vectors on fresh spaces. And this is denoted by pi infinities. And more generally, if we give a continuous representation on the Banacha space, and then taking the smooth vectors, gives rise to fresh representations that is also called smooth representations with model tiers, such as Castle Man-Wallach globalizations. Globalizations when the representation is of finite length. And then in this category, that the smallest object would be denoted by E. So this L is not necessarily viable. And then since this taking the source vectors, it injects integral to this substitute. So mainly we discuss of these two objects as representations. Okay, then for unit representation. Therefore, unit representations by using the notions of direct integral due to Fendn's, any unit representations of a locally compact group can be decomposed into the direct integral of reduced representations. And as I mentioned, that in the case of the real reductive setting, that such a decomposition is unique by high-chander missivity sequence. And the matures is a This is measured functions on the integral of the subgroup G prime. If we consider the restriction problem, namely starting from unit representations of the large group Z and the restricted Z prime. So this is a branching law in the unit s okay. And this matrix is in the sense of a direct integral, and then it has an upper bound and a lower bound. Upper bound and the lower bound for this smooth representations, namely, has an upper bound of the dimension of the symmetry breaking operator from large to small, and then lower bound from small to large. So, this is the dimension of the photographic operator. And in general, that when this is non-compact, these three numbers are different. And then back to again look at the classic. At the classical case, Heisenberg admissibility theorems concern the restriction to the Riemannian symmetry where a case is much more complex solution. Then we saw that this is must be in this case, all three must be the same, and then this is individually final. But for more generally, for reductive symmetric pair like G N R containing OPQ, where P plus 2 equals N, and then it may well have. And then it may well happen that the multiplicity is infinite, even in any sense of the matrix that this matrix may be EP for such a cases. And also, similar that if we consider theta products of 300 root, again, that, for example, if we consider X-ray. For example, if we consider XLNOR, and then when N equals that distance product was not studied by Repka, but also Kandusky and Williams earlier. And in this case, the multiplicity is infinite one. But if we consider n is greater than three, then multiplicity may be infinite. Genetic ones, the multiplicity infinite. And also like representations from GLP plus QR to GLPR. And then if p equal one or p equal one and then multiply one third also became one third. But also if we consider a more general block diagonal cases, then multiple usually. Okay, so with this in mind, we want to consider divide branching problems in three stages. Problems in three stages. The first stage A, so this A stands for abstract feature of the restrictions. For example, think in the intricate case, if the direct integral is discrete or may have a continuous spectrum and also continuous both. For example, so as we saw that any unit representation is decomposed in the direct integral, and sometimes And sometimes no discrete spectrum in this direct integral, and oppositely, sometimes no continuous spectrum. And we say that if it is discretely composable and each mass twist is finite, like high standard space, then we call that this restriction is G prime admission. And if such a restriction does not have a continuous spectrum and each mass Spectrum and each matrix is finite, then in such a framework, one expects a detailed study of the branching or of the restrictions by algebraic measurement. Then natural questions is for which pair triple that this compression is admissible. And the special case is when J prime is k, this is a high-cender case. But that says that even if z prime is non-compact, sometimes Uh, sometimes uh, this discrete composite admissible selections are happening, and now uh, in the last three decades, that the uh this criterion for admissibility is known and also that fiction theory has been also developed for the trials. Okay, so this is the part of the observed feature restrictions, but also uh we may think about maturity that already we mentioned, uh, sometimes multiplicity. Sometimes the matrix is infinite, and also the notion of multiplicity is there are varieties of notes of matrix, unintelligence, smoothness, and so on. But also, we want to find a nice framework like a finite multiplicity or better multiple conditions bounded or the best condition would be multiplicity one theory. And there are also a lot of multiplicity one theory for the brand. Mostly one theorem for the writing in the real setting developed in the last several decades. And then, and I'll be back to this problem again later. And then also we may think of the branching levels. So this asks the components of representations. And then, but this is not the end of the. But this is not the end of the stages. Also, we may think of the constructions of symmetric weighting operators or holographic operators in geometric models. The first two does not depend on the geometric models, but the last one depends on geometric models. But sometimes this knowledge gives very important information on the state B sometimes. And this corresponds. And this corresponds to the decomposition vectors. For example, if you think of the Fourier transform, and then the Fourier transform is extremely useful in the study of facet differential equations, because we know the composition of the functions. We know inverse Fourier transform, French type theorem, and so on. Not only abstract Francial formula like Existence of such the coefficients of the very express forms. So, this is a state C. Okay, and let me give one example, element example. In the case of the XU12 and the corresponding element, we may think of the upper half plane by linear fractional transformations. Then, we may think of weighted Bagman space. This consists of Polmott functions on Bagman. Consists of Holmot functions on the upper half plane with some L2 conditions depending on parameter lambda with this weight, which is L2. And then this is non-trivial if lambda is positive, lambda is greater than one. And then on this hubic, and then give some hubic space. And then if S2R acts on this space as irreducible representations, it lambda equals 234. Lambda equal to three four, it is a homotic discrete representations. Now, we, as an example, consider take two such homotopy discrete representations and then consider fusion rule. And then what is A and B and C. So of such a features of the tensor product of two such representations, the answer is that the tensor product decomposed discretely and multiplicatively freely. And maturity free. And each property is descriptive compositive has generalizations, and also multiple freeness also has a generation for different directions. But in this case, at the distance about that has two properties. And then B is branching loss. And then in this case, that the classically known branching loss and the same type of representation appear at the direct sum with my. appear at the direct sum with multiplicity free flow independently by retica and marginals. But then we want to understand the construction symmetry operators, which is intertwining operators from this space, right space to this space individually in a geometric model. And by Schwarz lemma and since this is multiple, such operator should be unique after scalar multiplications. And actually it is And actually, it is unique, but the formula is not so obvious. This is the rank equal bracket, ranking coin by differential vectors, which was partly found in the context of automotive forms to produce higher form of higher degree from lower. And that it's, you can see that even in this case, two cases than formula is. This is a dual case formula, it's already constructed. So, this is a typical example of ABC stages. Okay, now I have explained some questions. Each stage has still a lot of problems. And now, back to this question a little bit in stage A. So, if we want to develop stage B and stage C, then we want to find a nice framework. C, then we want to find a nice framework to go on this set VLC. And then, next framework is that, for example, Mark 50 is individually finite or uniformly finite. So, this is even better situations. So, this is the conditions of the pair of G and Z prime. So, the question is, what kind of the pair G and G prime which assures finite individually finite mass rest property and also even better. And also, even better conditions that uniformly bound them as fitting for any choice of reduced representations of the large groups and smaller groups. And then, the complete answer is known in this setting, namely, this individual finiteness conditions can be charactered by the geometric conditions, namely the double coset of G from left minimum fabric subgroups, and then from right a minimum public subgroup of. A minimum flag subgroup of the smaller ones is finite C. So, in other words, the real flag variety is zip and real strict. And the second conditions is the stronger conditions that uniformly bounded whatever in this representation of the large group and small group is. And this is characterized if and only if we take a complications. This conditions is characterized by complications. And then the double concept space of GC. double cosmic space of GC by boreal subgroups of G C and the smaller boreal subgroups is finite shape. But in other words, through plagiar varieties of G C is spherical with respect to this plan. So this is a necessary subject condition. And since this criterion is very expensive, also there are the classifications. And so this is the previous conditions. And then Um, the um uniform boundary conditions, the prefix is very simple because this uh conditions is written in terms of complications. So, essentially, that this holds only in the case GLN, 0n minus 1, or ON or ON- So this corresponds to gangros versus quantity techniques and after Abelian practice and so on, okay. Okay, then but for we to condition individual find that this has more examples and but the classification is not so large, so the classification list is one page or two page list of the pairs for G. But this depends on the real forms. For example, if G prime is maximal compact, K and then of course this is always true. But if we consider a non-compact symmetric pair of this form and then Of this form, and then this condition fails. So, namely, multiplicity may be infinite. And in the case of the tensor product case, if the group is compact or SON1, including SO2L or SO2C, and then this individual finiteness false. But for other groups, that must be maybe if. Okay. Then But then we may want to find more refinement because, for example, in this case, that some infinite dimensional representations must be infinite. But if we consider for small representation, for example, in the case in the sense of the Galvant Gilof dimension is very small, then we may anticipate that the still remote species is reasonably under control. And so as a result, And so, as a requirement, we may ask if there exists an interesting family omega in the set of the edit representations, such that still the uniformly bounded multiplicity property holds for the branching problem, in the sense that the pi for the larger group is taken from this interesting family and tau taken from the all representation z prime and when this happens. And when this happens. And here are some answers. So, again, the problem is any reduction between pairs. Then, in the special case where this variable conditions hold, then omega can be taken to the whole representation. But also for any symmetric pair, that if omega is taken minimal representations or omega is taken by Taken by Zackerman's HU lambda modules, where Q is theta 3 public sub-algebra with U advariance, or omega is standard public inductions where P is the maximum power sub with the N advariance for highest module. In such a case, one can prove that this bound must be uniformly bounded. And then this And then this opens up further and future challenging questions to go on about branching problems in that case, to find a branching law in the unitary case by using an indirect integral, or in the coniter case to find the expressed formula of multiple pieces like Ganglass and Gross Plus connection. And also our concept. And also, concept of the symmetry breaking operators is also a challenging problem. That is just for the last 10 years, that there are a lot of work on this question. So the final topic about this symmetry working operators that I mentioned this general questions that transconceptions and the classifications of a symmetry operator Of symmetry-based operators with standard representations. For example, think of the induced representation from travel subgroups and then smaller parabolic subgroups. And assume that the finiteness of the individual multiplicity force. And special, so we want to understand all the asymmetry making of it, so namely J plane home motion. And very special case is when T is the... Very special case is when T is the local vectors. And already, this local vector is important and challenging case. And some special cases have been studied earlier. For example, as we saw, ranking and the coin for H2R case. And also in the conformal geometry, that we use operators about 10 years ago is to discuss about such operators in the connected with the conformal. Conformer connected with the conformer unit, but already this is a challenge problem. But we want to understand all the operators and our assumption that individual finiteness, as we saw that this is equivalent to the geometric condition, that double coset space of z modula minimum fabric or the smaller minimum public is finite. And then in particular, that for any fabric, that this is finite. And then by using Finance. And by using this, we want we give a scheme of classifications of this problem. And here's a diagram that we consider any intertying operators from large space to smaller space. And then such operators can be written by means of the distribution kernel by Sharp theorem. And then the support of these kernel functions. Of these kernel functions are kernel distributions by the intertwining property that this support is not arbitrary, but it is a p prime invariant closed set on the mode p. So namely, it is considered as an element of the closed set of the double cos set space. But this is a finance. So this is an important parameter to understand how this intertony of data. Of vectors. And in the very special case, when this supposed is one point, then this T is a local operas that I explained at the very beginning of this introduction. And the opposite case is that this support T has an inner point. So in this case, this we call rigorous multiplication operators. And then the first complete result of classifications and the construction. Classifications and constructions of all symmetry-based classes, including the local and non-local ones, in such a setting of orthogonal groups with various. And this strategy is to capture all intermediate, all symmetry operators, also intermediate ones, by the inductions according to from large to smaller. From large to smaller ones. And then the last case is to classifications of local and namely differential paper, which is very notable. Okay, but this induction finishes in principle because there are only finitely many objects. Okay, so this is the general strategy for classification scheme, but still in many cases, such as the only So, this is only in the last 10 years, and I thought in many cases, such a question is open questions now. Okay, so I think it's the time to stop. So, thank you very much.
