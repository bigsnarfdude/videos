Thanks, organizers, the main Nong Hua Wei and the Yao Chung for the invitation. So it's my great pleasure to give this talk here. Iron and we enjoy so. So, this morning everybody talked about the equation. Therefore, I don't have to say it about the equations. So the thing is with the Poisson equation here here, rho is a density, and of course, and V is the velocity, and here S is the entropy. And so the first three equations I looked at. So the thing is coupled with the Poisson equation. So on the right-hand side, you have this term. And the Poisson equation is this. And this equation. So what's talked about this morning. Uh, I talked about this morning by Professor Pen. And so, here the free boundary problem is uh, so here big dt is a material absorbator, okay. And uh, so here is an assumption on the on the on the pressure, pressure function. Uh, a physical background, uh, so so the formulation of the problem is like this. So, so initially, we give an initial domain called the D0 here, so which is the So, which is the simply clactic boundary domain, R3. And in this initial domain, we are given the initial density, velocity, and entropy. And so, therefore, we are to find the set D, so because it's the free boundary problem, so the boundary is a part of unknown. We will have to find. And also the scalar functions, rho, and the S and the phi, and also a regular field, V. So, so solving the So, solving the equation. And so, this is the initial data. And also, we needed the boundary conditions. So, how does the boundary move? Boundary is moving with fluids. That means the normal velocity of the boundary is the same as the normal component of vector field. And on the boundary, the pressure P is a constant. So, we consider the positive constant, which means we don't consider the vacuum state here. We don't consider the vacuum state here. And also on the boundary, we are prescribed. This is the potential. Okay. So background, so as introduced by Professor Penn this morning, and this means it models plasma of cold ions and hot electrons. Electrons. And so rho here is the density of ions. And the heat electrify according to the Maxwell Boltzmann relation is given by this. Okay. Yeah. Here is a physical background. Boundary don't have self-struction, therefore, you need the Therefore, you need the stability condition to under those stability conditions, we want to get the a priori estimates of the suburbic forms of the fluid variables, rho, v, s, and phi. Also, the bounds for the geometric quantities such as the of the surface, such as the geometric quantities. The geometric quantities, including the second form, the middle form, and the injectivity, which is of a low-exponential map. That's about the incompressible Euler equation for the boundary problem. So because today I'm focused on the compressible stuff, therefore I just Stuff. Therefore, just this less you can look at it. For example, the first breaks were by Gerbo for the rotation, and then there are many, many studies. Everybody loves that. Oil full compressible oil, so here the boundary is given P, pressure P, and the boundary is moving with the fluids. And so here is the problem. The free boundary problem of the boiler, you could consider the two case. The boundary is a vacuum state. That means rho is zero or non-vacuum. That means. Or lam vacuum, that means rho is positive. So, in that case, for this Long Terra case, so the local opposing for this free boundary problem was the first proved by Takini. Yeah, so he is for the case when the free surface is a graph, okay, and the gravity is included. So, here his approach is based on the symmetrization of hyperbolic systems and also the And also the Nauschmosier iteration. So, in his proof, the assumption that the free boundary is a graph is very crucial. So, there is a thing of loss of derivatives. So, because he used Lashimosa iteration, that means in his result, In his result, the initial data, rho 0, V0, S0 is in Hm plus 7, requires that M is greater than or equal to 6. And also the initial boundary is also in this space. So, and but the solution as T is positive, the solution was six derived. So, here is Like a case of the Euler equations for the zero boundary domain, that means the boundary can be done have to be a graph. And it was by the first by the Linda Brad. And then the higher order energy estimates without Rosen to work was given by Linda Brad and Cheng Ying Ru. Yeah. And the general line is entropic case. So in the isentropic case, the pressure is only a function of a density function. Therefore, you can introduce the enthalpy. So those three things are equivalent. So in the isentropic case. So actually, So, so actually, in Nindebrad and the run row, they use this edge as an independent variable. And so, it's satisfied a very nice solid equation. But for the large and tropical case, there is no way to do that. Discuss about after what you tie on. So for example, for the compressible oil equation, so this Taylor-Sun condition is important for the stability, for the well-pulsedness. And without this stability condition, so some kind of worry tailor instability may be. Very tailor instability may occur. And for example, the counterexample is Appen for the incompressible oil and how and myself for the MHD, okay, incompressible. So for this problem of compressible oil covered with a loner puzzle, so we found that only the Taylor sound condition on the pressure will not be sufficient, will not be but why? Why this? So let's motivate the stability condition like this. So the moment of equation, we restrict it on the boundary, you get this equation, right? Yeah, yeah. Of the boundary, okay, of the boundary. So the acceleration of the boundary is due to two parts. One is this part, another one is this part. So therefore, so if we it's uh it's uh so so if we want to accelerate the the the boundary so it's uh lateral to to to to to to to to require this without without this uh uh person so you only have a tailor sign so but with this person so we may we may we may There is some requirement of the potential, electric potential, like this, okay, to guarantee this acceleration. Yeah, you may think, oh, maybe we will just put the combination together, but that won't work. But in the isentropic case, we can do that. Because in the isentropic case, P is only a function of a. A function of a density. Therefore, the momentum equation can be the following question. Therefore, so this motivates us in this case, this generalized Taylor sign condition may work. That's the case, okay? In the isentropic case. Yeah, then we have a. Then we have a have a have a neat stability condition why why would why the last isentropic case in this uh isentropic case could be different for the for the uh uh for the stability because on the isentropic case so isentropic case so so so so this is the h rho minus phi this uh this quantity is a constant on the boundary therefore there there therefore we have this gradient is uh it's just like this but we're in the unit on normal therefore uh we can we we we can we can get this uh uh this uh this this uh this quantity this this equation this equation is uh important on the boundary here here this p is uh just this quantity and the eta is a is a is a And the eta is a is a is a due to the stability condition. And of course, the question on the boundary is very important. The boundary is very important. When you do the high-order energy estimates, so this serves a boundary condition. Okay, yeah, that's important. Yeah, so here, therefore, in our case, on the boundary in the isentropic case, you really have a very nice equation. However, for the Laisentropic case, because in the Laisentropic case for the momentum equation, it's impossible to write this quantity as a gradient of a. As a gradient of a scalar function. So, this, therefore, this, you cannot have this kind of Last equation. Therefore, this is a difference from the non-isentropic and the isentropic graphs. Result. Let me introduce some geometric quantities on the free surface. So here we use this big pie to deloot the projection of. The projection, orthogonal projection to the tangent space of the boundary. That means for tensor, zero alpha, tensor alpha. So we, so it's a projection. So you just subtract the normal part. So you get the tangential part. Okay. And then in that case, the tangential derivative is really the co-gradient project to the tangent space. Okay. Then the second fundamental form is nothing but the It's nothing but the tangential derivative of unilormal. Very important injectivity radius. So that means from the boundary. So at any two points of the boundary, you draw two lines along the normal direction. And the first one, the largest number, such that The largest number such that they don't intersect, that's what we derived by eta zero is this injectivity radius. So the lower bound of this injectivity is important because it prevents the surface from self-intersecting. Another geometric quantity. So, and so that means on the boundaries. So that means on the boundaries, so prescribe epsilon one. And so you introduce eta one. Eta one such that when two points on the boundary, less than this eta one. So the normal difference is less than epsilon one. So this eta one is equivalent to the eta zero when the second function form is founded. And the things that to work with, work on this Î”ta one. This Utah one is easier because it's very easy to get its evolution. A quadratic form, okay, because we will construct a higher order energy functional. And this quadratic form is like this. So basically, the quadratic form should satisfy the following conditions for any zero R tensor alpha and beta. zero R tensor alpha and beta. So when this quadratic form restricts to the tangential component restrict to the boundary, so it's equals to the inner product of the tangential components of alpha and beta. However, in the interior of it's away from boundary, it's in the interior, it increases to this. So this includes four components. Okay. Yeah. This uh this uh quadratic quadratic uh uh thought. Cojotive form is to you see, you have this kind of Hawtz type inequality. You control this term, and also the divergence and the curve of a vector field. Then you control the R velocity structure of a high-order integer functional. The zeros order is a pretty straight. order is uh pretty uh straightforward uh because it's uh it's uh it's uh it's given by this this people is uh is a is a is a value of uh pressure on the boundary so so here is a kinetic energy and this is the kind of uh internal energy and this is the contribution of the surface energy is that is uh some some something complicated uh yeah  quadratic form for the r derivative so so the first uh three terms q and the and the curve and the the the and also uh that one is the second one should uh control the r square of the pressure and the third one uh i mean here here we have a have a uh entropy r square of entropy yeah and that Yeah, and that controls the entropy. So, this interior integral. Yeah. And also, we need a boundary term, boundary integral. Boundary integral, so here is a tangential part of os derivative of p of the pressure, and also oscillator tangential derivative of a tangential component of os derivative of phi. And then here you have for this, you have those two factors. One is a new. Two factors. One is a new, another one is a new. Those are really from the stability conditions. Okay. They are positive. Yeah. And also we get a PRT to control the pressure. And this is because of pressure, somehow it's set for the wave equation. Therefore, this is the standard because the P derivative rule is the speed of the sun and it's a speed of sound, square of the speed of sound. So the R total inert functional is really. Total inert functional is really this ER plus this P R plus the R s derived P because here it doesn't control the R s derived P and also the R s derived pi and phi and so we need four derivatives to cross estimates. Initial data initial data set Initial data, initial data set, row is a lower and upper bound, so that's away from vacuum states. And on the boundary, initially, the stability conditions are satisfied. And also the initial geometric quantities of initial data, initial boundary. So it satisfies this continuous second of the uniform, this lower bound of injective radius of exponential map. Therefore, with this giving you. map therefore with this given initial data we can get the get a get a time this uh depends on the on those uh quantities uh continuously such that before this time before this time uh function is uh is controlled by the initial inert and also the control of uh of density and also the the the and also the the the the the this this control uh uh stability conditions that's satisfied in this time interval and uh and uh and uh and uh and also yeah and also this uh controls the uh the geometric quantity of the boundary it's a upper bound of uh bond of uh inferior bond of a second one interpol and also a lower bound of uh injectivity radius so here here is the main theorem So here is the main theorem. Yeah. That's that's theorem is for the general non-isentropic Euler Poisson equation. For the isentropic case, I mean, the entropy is constant in that case. As I said, we just need this. This is stability condition, right? But in that case, but in this case, In that case, we don't have a because we don't have a condition of phi on the boundary. So, therefore, we don't get the estimates on this boundary term. Therefore, in that case, we cannot use this projection formula on the boundary to get the upper bound, the estimate of a second boundary. Okay, so uh so but but in that case, why we try this uh formula, another one this uh projection formula, but but the thing is that the estimate on this second derivative involves uh the bound of theta, so it doesn't work. So in that case, in the isentropic case, we use an evolution equation, theta, okay, to obtain the bound of the of the of the theta, so which requires one more direction than Requires one more director than that case. Yeah, so that's the price to use this blue stability condition. Don't require the pressure to satisfy this Taylor sign condition. So that means we, with the help of this electronic potential, the stability condition could be different. To the full compressible Euler equation, so without coupling. Without coupling with the electronic potential, under this Taylor sign condition for the compressible weird equation, we can still get the destinies on the H5 norms of rule US and also the boundary. This estimate is a is quite different from the estimate given by Takeni. I I give a comparison here. I give a comparison here because, in the case of Tarkani's paper, for the initial data, it needs at least 13 derivatives and it rules seven derivatives. And here, in our case, in our estimates for the full conversible EU equation, we only need the five derivatives. And also, we get the estimates without loosened derivatives. Here is one common. Uh comment I want I want to make. Yeah, the idea of appropriate. So so first, so we will work on the on the on the on the so the key the first thing is to get this estimate on the tender of our higher order energy function and to to prove to prove this this under the assumptions on the Under the assumptions on the on those quantities, yeah, those yeah, yeah we can we can we can uh we have to then we we verify you have to justify those uh Then it's quite involved to verify those bounds, a priori bound. So one thing is to use a superior embody to prove they are controlling. Controlled by the high order inert functional. Another thing we have to use various elliptic estimates to get the estimate on the AI. Thank you very much.
