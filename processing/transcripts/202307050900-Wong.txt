Okay, we are starting. Hi, good morning, everyone, online and in person. We had some technical issues, as we can see, but Benji is collected enough to fathom that. And I'm basically saying that you are. You don't have a choice. Anyway. Anyway, yeah, so we're starting this morning with Peng Zhi Wong's lecture on Zorfi regions of Dedekind Zeta functions and the During Hellbron phenomenon. Thank you, Peng Zhi. Thank you. Do I wear the microphone? So it's all you're all on this camera. So happy. Okay. Can I pull this camera here so that I can? Can I pull this camera here so I can just speak around here? I need to. No, no, no. I need the space to require. Can I hear me? Can you hear me right? Can you? Okay, we got a thumbs up. Okay, nice. So I'm pretty happy to go back to Canada, especially after the COVID pandemic. I didn't expect I can go back to Canada in three years. Come back to go back to Canada in three years. So it's pretty lovely. And also, I'm so happy to see my old friend and especially my teachers, Professor Ramurti, and also Akya and Adia. So it's feels like the Queen's number series seminar again. So I'm great happy. And I also presented the similar topic. So today I will talk about the zero regions. Well, the original title is during Havenburger Phenomena, but at some point another server version I would like. There were several versions I would like to talk, but it turns out that I feel that I should emphasize the zero-free or standard zero-free regions for data in zeta. So you know why we wanted the second phenomena. So it turns out that no one covered the deadlink data so far during the last so I decided to recall or define the deadlink data. So yesterday, So, yesterday, Krannika introduced what is an integral ideal, or at least you see here, is OL is a ring of integers of L. And then you can consider the integral ideals and the prime ideal on it or over it. And so if we collect all integral ideals and we put a known, and there is a teeny tiny F here, and we can find the data function. And also, we have the similar OER product because we know that this known is the multiplicative. Multiplicative, and you can split this one. And we have also a dedicated domain, so you have the unique factorization for these things. And so you have this all your product as well. So it's not super hard to check by the basic property of this norm of ideal. It's this one will convert absolutely. Well, well, on the right hand, namely the real power of S greater than one. Okay. So in that you can do a bit more. Do a bit more is that it's also not hard to check that you can extend this sort of the convergence or extend this one a little bit more to the one line. And then you can use a standard so-called Artemis 341 trick to show that this one is not the this probably I should just write here right let's just say Same up three, four, one three draw system one for a real power of x equal to one. Okay. Equal to one. Okay. So you just like the remind zeta function, you can use the automatic string for one trick to show that at least the zeta function is also not managed on one line. And so, well, probably I should say a few more. So particularly, if you take the L equal to Q, and you will recover, or we will recover the standard or lovely Riemann zeta function. Okay. What do I say if you want? Okay. Okay, so however, you can see that we probably the Riemann data function is the world the most well-studied object in the number theory. So we are going to exclude it because we can do much better for the Riemann data. So through our talk, we will consider a number field. So we will write a capital L is of degree N L and it's greater than one. So throughout my talk, this one will never be. hope this one will never be never be never be one and with the absolute discriminant dl so by absolute means that i i secretly put the absolute value here so it will be always positive otherwise you will see a result there will be a teeny tiny problem above uh the well you will see a very strange uh innovation okay so do I have enough space to say these things? You say these things. Okay, so now we are going to. So I believe most of you already learned what are the typically error functions. So technically error functions, they also have a standard zero-free region. So I can draw it both ways. So, you know that there is telecom that well. So, Debic La Long can have a standard zero for you. Look, something looks like this one, you have the least strap. And so, for us, this one is also true for the deleting data, where for sure the implied constant dependence won't change. Okay, so first of all, I would like to recall a result. Recall a result, I think it's due to a start. Okay, so first thing is you can probably you already see this one yesterday in the Abivas. Oh my god, two days ago in the Abivas talk, and that for a data king data function, it has this probably I should change the colour. Has at least probably colour tutorial as we're going okay, so uh so uh let me say a few words about these two they are far away from the half-line okay so Okay, so you can see in this uh uh square. Uh, this square is uh yeah, probably I shouldn't it's not square should be rectangle, but whatever it's like the rectangle like the stuff and the formed by this phone because yeah, it's a yeah, it's really rectangle, it's not square. So, okay, okay, I have no idea. Okay, okay, so there is a square in yes, two square. Oh my god, I feel it is so challenging to write. However, so if you write this one in this phone, you can see you have a two square of dump. And this one for example C and your height is so let me say this is a square root of this. The square root is about C1 over here. Okay, so in this square or the rectangle, that has no zero, except for the one exceptional zero, usually called a stock zero or stock C0. And this zero inside is a teeny tiny box, if it exists, it has to be real. So you can recall. And so you can say recall this, and you also have at least fact if I go back to a David Calero function. If you have the David Calero function, it emits itself zero, it is a standard zero free region. The character has to be real and in fact a quadratic. And then you also query it came from. So it's a similar thing to happen to the deleting one. Okay. So in fact, a stock show that around 1974, the C, this C. Before the C is C, you can take as four. Okay, and it was improved in firstly by Abiba. You can take a C equal to two and force BL sufficiently large. And her method was also improved by An and Kwang to C to be two. I should add it later. Okay. And also, let me give you some favor about why the during Hamburg phenomena is that when this Phenomena is that when this lovely or still be exceptional stock zero exists, you can extend your zero region, surprisingly enough. So, for example, probably a weak form of it is that Abiva and I always show that two years ago. If LED really, let's accept zero exists, you can even take a C equal to 1.7 and you can enlarge your zero free region. So you can see it's something from there's a trend about if you have at least bad zero, you can If you have at least bad zero, you can have a better zero value for other zero. And if it doesn't, it's a your zero strap. Okay. So and so now you might ask about how about our high. You can see this high is pretty low, it's all up to the one over zero PL. Up to the one over zero dl, and when dl is large, it's almost zero. So, how about we go to high uh when the real power less than one? So, it means that you ask about between the one and plus one and negative one, how many is what the evaluation is at any zero or not. So, again, this result due to the Abiba herself is when our discriminant section large, you can take that this arc, little R, and so about the 13 or 12. About 13 or 12.8, if it's smaller, 12.74. And then improved by the easily recently to 12.5 by 12.44, I believe. And so it means that you can do so. It means that if you go to the one, you can go much better. Okay. Much better. Okay. So it's a green one. It means that you can see you can go up to the one, and so I will say that. Well, it's really this proportion as well. So you can go up to one, but your zero really will go inside much more. Okay. And so let me say, okay. Okay. And also, you can ask about how about the old number field. About how about the old number field. So, you can see here is the subjectively large, and uh, uh, rare mass that I didn't tell you why is that even meaning for a substitution large is means that it's a super large. And in fact, I think if you go through rare paper, you can determine how large this DL has to be. However, for the all-number field as a result due to the ion quantum four years ago, is that uh, you can take the R like the third 90, is that 29.6. 6 or 29.57 times the one plus 2, and that means that you could use 3 to use 0 for region, but for all number of fields. Okay, and that too, if you go back to CLF very invalid, prove more general results with the dependence on the discriminant and the degree. And so here, we use a Minkowski farm or weakest farm of area. We found the degree of We found the degree of number field by two times the log dl divided by three. So this is why we get this two here. Basically, this is another log three cancel is log three. So for sure, you can see that this one we will see that all the disc scope improve this function when the DL is sufficiently large. Oh, by the way, if you want to know or review why it's a Mingowski bunk, and you can check the Professor Murti's archbrand. Can check the Professor Murti's archbrain problems in archbrain of theory. That's a beautiful source to learn this topic. Okay. Or you can check, but for this one, you can also check Anand Kwan's paper. They have this slightly modified payphone of them because you need to do something to get this fault. Okay, so now you can see if. Okay, so now you can see for our zero standard zero fusion, there are three colors is pink and a green one, and the last one is at least the purple one. You can see the purple one is at least you can go even further and further out. And the list one is probably most your familiar type of zero-free region. It's also have a similar form for the Directly function. So let me go down. So you, I see, I believe all of you know about the last one of this purple zero provision. So I am going to stay the result is like this one. Okay. So that means that we are working for the zeros with imaginary part greater than one. So we know this Debian zeta. Uh, depending setup function will never manage in the region like this one, this form, and you can see there is the discriminant and the degree and the log this one. And so, compared to the data king or the directory, directly usually looks like ah it's okay. I'm just wondering if these derivative and zeta functions of course have factorizations. And many cases arise in which the art and L people function is holomorphic. And so if you were to play And so if you were to play your game on each component, then you'll get better results, won't you? Okay, thanks. Yeah, it's worth a try. So it's worth a trial. Okay. So let me say, well, blue plus one, yeah, blue plus one. So you probably some of you are already familiar with the standard. Of you are already familiar with the standard zero-free region for the difficulty error functions of conductor or marginalized Q. You manage T is an image of these zeros of a DBCLA and Q is a conductor. And so you can compare these two is for the directly. So you basically have everything said. Our conductor for the delivery, you have two things here: discriminant and degraded. And so for the result, Result Abhibak proved that you can take the C1 equal to 12.6 and the C2 go to go between well equal to 9.7. And this one is improved by Ethan as well recently to 12.3 and 9.6. So what do I want to say for this one? Okay, there are some few. So, okay, there are some few remarks. First thing is that their improvement or these things are basically the all idea is basically go back to the non-negative trick polynomials and static trick. And also in Abiba's paper, I don't know who you said is something you didn't make it super clear. Is that some people will cite this result that okay, it's for the also between large L. It's not the case. In fact, you can these results. Case in value and this results true for the whole number. And secondly, like the remark by the Professor Murty. So if you really consider about this standard zero region for the delta zeta function and compare it with the deviced one, and you might figure out it's why it's much, much weaker than what we have. So in fact, We have so, in fact, enough. Okay, I'm trying to do that. So, I will write the list for people who know what's really going on. This KQ is the Q cyclotomy field. Okay, so for this, KQ is the Q's psychotomy field. It means that you join the Q primitive route Unity tool or KQ. So, I see again values. Okay, so we know one thing is the theta k q equal to a product of the directory character mod q okay like this one uh we have a lovely fragileization oh we have a list of federalization of the the uh fuel sector field okay. A few sectomy field. Okay. So you might see if you look at this one, and let me give you one more information right here. So the discriminant KQ is roughly Q to the I think I will say 5Q. Okay. It's like five usual OER five function. So if you compare this to result, if you look use this statement combined with Straighterization combined with the standard zero-field region for a difficult error, you see the quality you have in the denominator here is q. However, we do use this general result for the number of field or the number of data theta. You put this picture q3 by q here, you will get the phi q times dot q. It's much, much weaker than what we have for DBK. So in fact, I believe that is even the remark in the paper or in papers or in papers of the professor. Papers or in papers of Professor Kumar Martin, he said one should really form these things or at least a stock, even for the first stock zero in terms of articulation. And if you learn more, is that there is a for general number fields, you can decompose it into the product of all so-called articular functions. However, there will be a teeny tiny problem is that not all articulate functions are known to be holomorphic. So the standard energy motion. So, the standard and deep machinery will fail. So, you need a so-called artist holomorphic conjecture. Okay, so let me mention this one first. So, like the Riemann hypothesis, we have a generalized remote hypothesis, so-called a judge. It said all these things should be improved more significantly. Should be improved more significantly. Namely, all non-trivial zero of the zeta function should be with the real power equal to half. So namely, you push all zero away from the away from at least this three region, you go to the half, far, far, far away. Okay, I can. And also, okay, now we are going to talk about our computer easier to use. Nice. Okay. So for people recall so let me say so let me just the the order should be like okay before I tell you what is a during Hamburg phenomena let me say another few words on the list except non-zero. So you know for the depicted error function, there is a result due to the goal, probably I should include Lang Dao. Is that you know how to find the You know how to bound the distance from this exception zero to one, and it's like the one over q to the epsilon for sorry no the c epsilon uh to the uh look epsilon so let me go to this way so Okay, so what I'm writing again and turn off this and it's all okay. So for a delicate error function, we also know that a flame is set on the weight non-divided beta one. And this away from is the distance always greater than some. Always greater than some infective constant over a Q to the epsilon, like this one. And you might wonder if we have any similar result to the, and at least epsilon can be obviously small. And then you might wonder if we can do a similar thing to the data king. So the answer is yes. So I think the first result is, I think, again, due to the stock itself, it's a pretty bare constant. And then improve or give a precise. Improve or give a precise version or effective version by Lagarias, Oda Lisco, and Mogamari. And then the several results are given by, I think, Nelson, Abiva, and so many people about what can we do for this to get a result of this type. So let me say the so far the best result I know is the negative, if you can do the distance one over DL27 something. And at least one invite improved the previous result. And at least one proof of previous result of AC, he got, I believe, like he got a 16.6. Okay. So let me say fewer again. You can see this result is pretty bad in many, many sense. First thing, you see, if you really got detailing data function of the Q cyclotomic field, and then your discriminant. And your discriminant is basically Q to the Q. And if you put a Q to the Q, this one is super bad. It's like Q to the one over Q to the seven times Q. And it's super much, much, much worse than this one. So you can say once you really work in journal and try to parallelize your tabloid setup function so that you do the correct way. Okay. And the second thing, not mentioning the direction. Also, you can see that constant wise is also bad because they for a It's also bad because for a standard z go zero, uh, we got an optional epsilon. You can basically this epsilon goes to zero, just a small enough, but you can see here we cannot even defeat one. It's seven. It's bad, super bad. And for more, for the most application, it's not enough. But like you want to study a question called the finiteness of the C and field over the totally real. Over the totally real fields. And this bound is too bad. Okay. But the non-service will be sufficient if you want to deal with the least frame tripato loop density theorem. And also, let me say this, this seven, you can do this one to eleven something eleven point seven. Okay, and our people and I, probably last year, well last year, we showed that for all number of fields, you can take, surprisingly enough, you can tell it to be the 11.7. For all number of fields, you have the bound for your exceptional zero. So it means that this exceptional will not go. Will not go to one at the end. So you can see you guys are slightly tiny distance to prevent some bad thing happening. Okay, so so about we I hope you gain some knowledge about why it's a zero fusion, why is it really falling on and they are pretty important, well super important to have the effective version of the tripletor density theorem. It's like if you want this again, goes back to if you want Goes back to if you want to have a good estimate for the prime number theorem for arithmetic progression, you need to come and uniform for the Q. You need to have a good control for its exceptional zero. So if you want to do a sensing for the tributary density theorem or the prime number theorem for the number field, you need to have a good control for its exceptional zero. Okay. Okay. Second copy. Okay, so our second topic is during herbal type of zero frequency. It means that if we so we at the very beginning, we already see that if you we didn't have the exception zero, we can slightly erupt the stock zero frequency. So how about the general this uh standard zero frequency? This standard zero-free region. So the statement says that when that exceptional zero exists, you can push your another zeros in this way, in this manner. It's the one minus log one minus beta one dL. There is some magical constant dl. So if you're the first time, if at least for my first time to see this, I thought what does it do? Is something weird and it's a There is something weird, and it's about so. Let me say, if you were, you can think about it. If you are this acceptance zero, it's super close to one, that means that you go to sort of zero things, and then you will pull through it really far, far, far away. So you can think about it if you try. But let me give you one more concrete example. So remark is that if R1 minus beta one is roughly the size D L minus L minus y c okay. So if you really put this one minus beta one is a distance about the minus c, I mean pretty close to one line. And we can, so you can see in light of the last corollary here, it's that it's probably the lowest you can get. And you put it inside this one will be one minus C. Uh C one P 114 poly one four four and minus uh you okay for erasing our result. Okay, probably something like this one. So, what I'm saying there is that if you know the real size or distance from this exceptional zero to the one, it's roughly a size of DL to negative C, and you replot it back. And you can see for this very first, you take out you will get yeah, so you pull this one. So, you can see you have a low D L and log directions off. So you have the one minus C over the 40 points. Over the 40 point something, and at least these things. And then you can say when D L the discrete pretty large, the second term basically is zero. It goes to zero. So for all sorts of really large DL, you don't have that aspect. So you can say it means that when really bad exceptional zero exists, and we push all zeros away from this one. So you can see there's sort of a quasi and certain five high one, the high one quasi generalized. Possibly uh generalized reminder passes, and it's pretty helpful if you want to do a certain estimate. Okay, so for sure, you can ask: How about if we don't have this base zero, it's like a decision about a log DL, and our life is easier because you can see that it means that you have the sort of the quasi-so resolution of the zero zero seams. So you can see it's a trap between the distance of the uh this uh between the the exceptional zero through one and uh this uh another zero d or another location of other zeros. Not the location of all the zeros. Okay. And also, let me mention a few RCPs here: is that the first release result is due to AC, he got the 36 over there. And in place of our 14-something. And also, you can do this result for the only real zero. You just want to push another real zero because if they. Another real zero because if it later is that we are concerning the real well zero and then zero of the data key up to the high one, so you can hop on real zero. But real, real surprisingly enough, we can half the concentration over there. They will be the 7.07. And there is no coincidence that where you get the corollary. Basically, you are using the information of another real zero to bound the distance of the between the one and the Of the between the one and the beta one. I want to write this one. So let me say again. So again, this one for this theorem, this seven point something you can This seven point something you can improve in the sense that you can say here again, we need to work for the discriminant for sufficiently large. So for all number fields, I'll be by nine, we improve. I think we prove this one. You can take a nine point something something by KW for all number field. All number field. Okay. And also for the first one, the certain height, you can also. A certain height. You can also do this for the O number field with a weaker constant. Again, that is by the first result due to Anen Kwan themselves. And they get a pretty bad constant over there, but they shut the result. And then Avio and I, we can do that like for 30, I guess, something each. No, 20. So basically, I will know we can prove this one is 20 for all number fields. Okay. Okay. So for the remaining part of my lecture, how many times do I still? Oh, my time. 45 minutes? No worries. So for the remaining part of my talk, I'm going to explain our paper life by line to you. And oh well. Oh well. Okay. I was thinking I was trying to make a slice in fact and invite an edit. And if you said it's basically a copy pass with a better view of these things, but it's basically copy paste. If you're like, okay, no, it's not a way. And then you know, it's occupy too much space and I cannot write properly. So our goal is that I'm not going to prove going to prove everything, but I'm going to prove the theorem 1.2 and I'm going to try to The theorem 1.2, and I'm going to try to collect all necessary information for you to prove this one. And I believe it's important or somewhat hopefully helpful for some people as a part of during Harrisburg research project as did by the ASIF for the difficulty one. Oh, I should mention this one. In fact, I see the ASIF and JC, JC Soner, they gave also the result for. They gave the also the result for the heckler error functions. And then you basically say, in certain sense, you can fetch the data key in a way if you have a large obedience of extension, Gaua one. And then you break down into the Hacker error functions, and then you can prove a similar result. So you can say machine learning basically the same, but sometimes you will get a weaker concern. I will see why you will get a weaker concern because there's some positivity argument. Basically, only support. Argument. Basically, surprisingly enough, all our arguments require certain positivity arguments. And before I start everything, today you will see we use this thing so many times. So it's the most important inquiry we have to know today. So we said the one plus cosine x is greater than or equal to zero. Okay. So now so two. So now to prove the during her birth, this we are going to use the Turong PowerSun method. And the original method is not in this form. This one is, I think, due to the Montgomery. And he used that to prove the During Herb for Durham error functions. And also, there is another way to do this one, I think, due to the Bombay Ring, but I can check it. But anyhow, at least one is a most elegant one, but it's a surprising. Most elegant one, but it's surprising is that they use a metrical kernel again due to the Mokumaru. Is that first thing we consider this kernel is like this form? So, quite briefly, this is what it is. It's basically this cosine function or trig function. Yeah, trig polynomial. Okay, so it's summation j value one to be capital J one minus j over capital J plus one R to be J cosine. J plus one R to be J cosine J theta. Okay, and I will tell you why it's really coming. So, for the people who are familiar with the Fourier analysis, basically it's coming from the Fourier, but you don't know. So, it's invest our first time. So, we are going to use this magical kernel or magical function to prove our Turan's power sum. So, let us collapse some important property. It's that we know this magical function has a nice lower bound greater than half, negative half. Negative half. And for one, zero, it's j over two. So let me prove the second one for you parody. So if you really put r equal to one, it's one. And zero, again, it's second one. So you are summing this one. I think go back to elementary or high school math, whatever. You can sum it. It's basically J over two. It's pretty easy. So the second one to be the first one is no deep math. You really do a usual summation. And the last one. Okay, and the last one is that the most important part is that we know in general this you have a lower bound greater than negative r over one plus r and in this region. Okay, so previously this one was this the first two were given in the by the I think the Lagarius, Odelitzko and Montamari. And the third one also is aversion due to the land self and also improved by the Artif. And also improved by the active. And what are these, but we improve this one a bit more. And you see a remark for this lemon, you will see the part word obtained previously. Okay. So for the first thing, we are trying to prove lower bounds. So let me say this again for people. If you twice or double this function and the plus one, you will. Uh, function and the plus one, you will get the failure kernel. And for this failure kernel, it's always non-negative. So you know that this P1 theta will be in the first dot. This one is a failure kernel with this R equal to one. And it's not negative. So if you do a simple calculation, you will have a low boundary equal to half negative half. So how we get the for the OR is that we are. Uh, OR, is that we are using a following trick? Uh, is that notice that right here if we are using z equal to r i theta, and it is corresponding to x y r cosine r sine. Okay, so if you use this uh So, if you use this Cardiac polar coordinates correspondence, you have this one. And for this one, you can see it's basically the real power of this one, to reset, the real power is to eject. So, in fact, the key observation is that 2 plus 2p equal to real power one plus two. One cross two day I gave okay a currency okay so if you replace this one you observe that in fact this one is a real part of the list function. The real part of this function because you only take you only take cosine. And if you look at this inner function supercapitally, it's a complex polynomial, so less holomorphic. So because it's holomorphic, a real problem will be a harmonic function. So normally our one plus two p is harmonic function. And so by the maximum or minimum principle, if you like, it's maximum or minimum or having a boundary. Our boundary is a unicircle on a complex plane. Unicircle on a complex plane. So we know on the boundary, we have the boundary thanks to the population greater than one or is greater than negative half. You know that everything inside will greater than the negative half in this range. Okay, what we said, the second is a direct calculation. And the last one is probably the most important key new input in this paper is that we use, we make the use of Use uh, we make the use of for the half-narring inequality to get this lovely lower bound. So, let me say this one here. Why do we want why don't we write this one? In fact, yes, I write this one here and I find that my handwriting is so ugly. So, I feel like today I just improved my handwriting over the night and I ah, okay, set up it. So, now we have this one, and what's really going on there is that if we want to bound the harmonic function over the open ball, and it's pretty good to use a hard line. And it's pretty good to use a hard nine quality. And so, the way is that first thing, we need to let me stay the hard nine equality right here. So, Hard 9 equality is that if you have the, so let me emphasize, it's the non-negative and harmonic. So, if you have a non-negative harmonic function defined over the open ball, and basically its lower bound is dominated by its central value dual zero, and for sure, it depends on your the And for sure, it depends on your distance from this zero, so in this form, totally. And for people who are interested, I will put it as an exercise. You can check the paperless elegant proof and relatively easy exercise in the complex analysis to get this point. Okay, so remind. So let me remind you that why is our topic is that we know. Topic is that we know our function is non-negative. So, what we are trying to do is that we are not directly working with our p, but the one plus two p, because we know this one is basically not active one I feel I missed something. I feel like I missed something here. Ah, I feel that is why. For the people who cannot figure out why we can apply our argument to this one plus two p r theta, it's the first thing is that we call for the first one. We already know that this one coming is a harmonic function because it's a real power of this one. And we also know that for this one plus two p. For this one plus two p, when r equals one, you get a failure connector. So basically, it means that when r equals one during this boundary, it's always non-negative. So it means that lower bound is one. So now you can apply the minimum principle to deduce that this harmonic function in this open disk is always non-negative. So it's probably key to so keep this as a non-negative one. So you really need to. So let me say this one again. Why we can apply our theorem to read one plus two p? The reason is that we. Plus 2p. The reason is that we already know this one is a harmonic function and also it's a failure to know. So we know the for with the r equal to one. So why we can push this one to r less than one is that we know because during this boundary among this boundary or over this boundary, it's non-negative. So we know lower bound is zero. So use a minimum principle, you get the non-negative T over this couple. So probably I should prove this one. So also you need to. Uh so many notes okay so now we are really using the this we are letting the list F equal to the well L F equal to one plus two P R theta so and with this capital R equal to one you get this and if you get this phone and the old And if you get this form, and all you need to do is calculate the F00. And the F00 is basically you have nothing to do because if you have R00, you are in the center. So you can see from this one, you get a zero right here. So you only have a one. So it's not super excited. Okay, but no, nonetheless, you know this one, and you can see the okay. And then with this one, and then you plug back the And then you plot back the well, the definition of F, and then you do some simplification, you get this lower function. Okay, so I will skip this part, and you can do it by exercise. So probably I should say again, exercise. So the point of deploying hardware is to improve the boundary for God in number one. You know, for the function of R. Yeah. Are yeah, yeah. So it's quite important. I think the this, I don't know. I wrote, I think I wrote this part. I didn't check the non-negativity, but on the negative is basically due to the same argument for the one. So there's some misarrangement here, but okay. Yeah. Okay. So why we want this one? So let me review this property again. So laser hydrogen is going on. So so far we go this far. So, so far, we go this far. Again, we define this metrical function coming from the Hungar Mari or Bayeferno. And we know that it has two nice lower bars depending on the state of R. And we know this value on the one, zero is a half j. And we are going to use this one to prove the two long-power-something method. Okay. So for a troll power somewhere, it's basically. a transpower-song method is basically we are considering you if you like uh you can take all b n equals one for now it doesn't matter because it is in the end of the way we are going to do that so let me say this again if through our argument you can just take a b n equals one that will be easier so basically if you take all b n equals one it's just a powers up and the why is a troubles power sum method is that uh we want the lower bound and here is that because you know it's a complex numbers so we only care about the real part of it so Care about the real power of it. So, the Toronto Power of South method is that first thing, for the Z1, if a Z1 is the largest one, it's non-zero for sure. If all of them is zero, it's quite large. So, it's all zero sum. So, for the first one, it's non-zero and it dominates for all the sequence. And secondly, our all bn is non-zero for sure. Now, we are going to take the bn all equal to one for now. And this magical power summary says we have a lower bound, and this lower bound means. Bound and at least the lower bound means that it's not negative, and so the constant here depends on your first. So, why is the core of this power thumb is that? How large we need? You can see here, this power is j, you are rising the power of the z. And so, the power thumb method told you that you can take some j between the one and basically a times this capital N, so that you have this real populated. You have at least real populated zero things. Okay, so why is this n is only given by this ugly formula, and we will see why we get this ugly formula. And the proof is relative, or it's also an exercise I should ask you to complete by yourself, but let me give you something more like the why it's already going out. Okay. Okay. So, first thing is that I know some part of the most important. And it's probably the most important thing that we are going to consider the following inequality. It's that we are consider the real power of SI and we use something we have seen for the previous function. And we multiply by one plus cosine g theta one. And we are considering small. I think this one is basically neutral Mongolian. And you can consider this inquiry. So first and most important is that we know that this one plus cosine is positive. And the little cosine. Plus cosine is positive, and the leading coefficient is positive. And then you have a two-positive, and then if you take a maximum, you just basically take it out, and you take a sum, and you have obviously upper bounds. So we have this first. And with this in mind, we call the very definition of the P. Oh my God. Usually I will have a P with me. Okay. So the second one, if you really. If you really open these states, and the ride of each the end, so let me put everything together. So, what we just write here is that you recall our essays of this form, if you write there equal to R and equal times, like this one. And you really take a real power for you will get a cosine here. And you have the cosine, and you have the one plus cosine here. So, basically, enough is that you are going to use the product sum formula. Should I give you? Should I give you so uh so you equals some equals summary of the column? Okay. Okay, anyhow, I gave it. So now you see you have the cosine, and then you have another cosine. You use the product and formula, and you get you will recover our function we introduced at the very beginning. Okay, so now the gain is okay. I'm trying to configure everything. Okay, so the remaining part is relatively easy in the sense that as long as with the properties of the P are theta in hand, we can find a lower bound for P. Uh, we can find the lower bound for this. So, now you can see we know the level of the uh 2.15 the list of products on formula in this form. So, if you if we can find the lower bound for if we can find a lower bound for this one, we find the same. So, uh, the magical and most important thing is that you might wonder why. In fact, I think I thought about it for two hours, why we consider this one, why we even bother to. Why we even bother to put a cosine j theta one here. So, the reason why is that we want to use the second property of this p is that if you remember the p10, you will get a 2j or sorry half j. So that half j will save our days. It's most important thing. So when with this formula in mind, you can see if you look at the state, so you can see in general, if you only have this SJ, you will never know if you will get the state. Never know if you will get the theta equal to zero. However, if you multiply by this one by this product, you get this one. For this very, very first term, you will get R R1 and theta 1 minus theta 1. So this one, you will get a P10. And then this one right here, you will get the order J. So this term is the most important term. And then for a remaining term, we are going to use the third property to find a low binding. Property to find a low boundary for the form negative R over one plus R. So I'm going to jump there. And if you use the function for the remaining time, you get this one. And if you combine them together, you will get a very, very baseline. You will get a fairly quarter J and a minus two N. And then why you have redefined this N because you do the third party of the P R theta, because it is like the negative R over the one. Uh, r over the one over R, okay, so you get a result. Okay, so now we just use this JYCD, and you can find a lower bundle. Okay, so let me say this one again to you. If you look at this paper first, in the very first time, is that the magical part is why we pull this cosine j theta one here. We want to create this very second term. And for the very reason, is that when n equals to one, this one, we will get a p1 zero. will get a p10 and this one will give us will give us this uh this important term so let me go this is a very important term here okay so you can try if you don't multiply if you don't if you do not add this term basically you won't have a j here and then you have we have nothing to do for this one yeah what if you use the another non-negative number for longer they won't help for the jet better result Won't help no, they won't help. So, the other remarkable expert professionality. In fact, I try, you might, you, you might also always try probably listening owing to my ability is not good enough. You can replace this one by another trick polynomial. And it turns out, no, not at all. You won't improve anything. Because you can see is that every time you do the different positive, I believe a reason is that you use another non-negative pole. Under non-negative pole, you will decrease the size for this constant. And once you decrease it, we want this one to be large. So once you decrease this one, you just say, no, this one will be smaller. And the remaining part doesn't help too much. So it basically is a for the remaining part, you will affect the size of the medical sum. But you can see if you reduce the coefficient for the capital Z, you will significantly make this one to be large, bigger or small. Okay. So for the proof, and so now I think I have a okay. Okay. So let me emphasize at least the real. So what is really going on here is that we want to find the lower bound for a real powerfully semantical sum, and you can take OPE n equal to one. And the trick is that first, we need a First, we need one assumption only if we take all equal to one. Because we want the observed value of z1 is the largest amount of all this. And then we can find a lower bound for a real path for this one greater than zero, something. And over this region, depends on this n. Okay, so this n is related to is a d and thing. Okay. Okay. And so for the remaining part, I'm going to try to give you a sketch of proof of the sketching better. I will prove everything for the Dumin Haram phenomena. So first thing I will recall, and I mentioned it at the very beginning. We have a Minkowski bound between the given relation between the degree and the discriminant. And this one at the very beginning is pretty weak because Amingowski bound gives us like Bound gives us like an L less than equal to log d l divided by log string. So you can say in general it's a pretty weak. If you want to do a numerical analysis with a better button, but all the disco he proved that when the odd extruder is pretty large, you can improve this two over three significantly by this log 16 and log 22. And all one out of is number of a real and a complex embedding of our number field. Of our number field. And for people who are not familiar with this notation, is that basically what we are going to have is NL equal to R1 plus 2R2. So you can see that with this in mind, basically you have a much better bond on this NL and DL thing compared to Minkowski file. And now the second thing we would like to is we are going to borrow a lemma from the of the out from the of the R C. It said it turns out that we will need to find this zero sum of the data in zeta, f of L and of this form. And we will see why we have this one. But anyhow, I just give you a lemma. And it's that if we introduce some magical function related to a digamma function, and we know how to bound this magical zero sum from the above. Uh, from the above, and I will just give you a formula. I don't kind of discuss it, and in fact, it's a part of our learning activities that figure out or go through the proof of our sif. And I give, I think I will send everyone later for the assignments later. And in this way, and I think it's a good exercise if you already know about something, you know, if you already have some basic knowledge on the development data, this one is a profound exercise for you to do. The exercise for you to do to know this and then how use this and the property of getting this how to find this overboard. And on the other hand, Asif wrote a pretty clear and beautiful argument for this one, much better than what I have for this one. And let me apologize. There's another assignment about a complete second proof for a real during Harrenberg phenomena for real zero. And I will show you pretty soon. Pretty soon, is that basically in our paper, we skip most part of the argument for the second proof. The reason is, you have half responsibility because we want to submit to the pens. The page limit is 15. Original version is like 18. And nothing can do is to say, can you reduce the amount of pages? So I do some metric work to reduce the two page proof to use some hand-waving word to get rid of the proof. But so that's your assignment to configure. So let's say your assignment will come from the remaining powers. Okay. Do I have time? Okay, so I can do it. Okay, so the first thing is that you can see we do this in backwards that you probably are collecting all the important ingredients for the proof. So you won't Ingredients for the proof. So you won't, it's natural for you not be able to see any global picture why we are doing less than that. We will prove them together at the end. So the next layman is saying we are going to apply our torso sum to a certain zero sums for the coming from theta. Okay, so we are going to consider this magical sign that we are introducing some new parameter C, and we consider these two the Consider this to the 2j or negative 2j power of this zero. This row went through all the non-trivial zero. Yeah, all non-trivial zero. All capital mass call S is the set of non-trivial zero of the data and zeta of F. And we consider we collect all these zero and put in the form of the C minus rho and one multiplayer colour. And here is a metrical key. Here is a medical T, and here T is right into cooking T here. Okay, so our why is our T is in this thing? What we are going to do is say we are going to, so we are going, we are trying to push another zero away. So we will say that, okay, we firstly, we assume we have exceptional zero beta one in this our very, very bar stock region, the exception exists. So we are saying that, okay, the second zeros. Now we can second zeros of the row prime equal to the beta prime plus it. So this is what quality it we want to use. It's another zeros of data and detail. Okay. And also you might wonder that how about if you have two zeros of data and theta, they are with the same real part, and we will choose the t to be a minimum or choose a lower one because we will get a better numerical result. Okay. Numerical the result. Okay. So the result goes like following that. If you collapse the information for another zero, basically what we want is that it's a zero T, but imagine power for another zero or non-trivial zero for detail. And then we consider this zero sum. We can find this lower bound. Magically is bounding by this is not only the greater than zero, but greater than this constant. And at least constant, very constant is the important thing that we really. The important thing that we it really depends on the real power on our second zero here. And with this, I'm going to skip this definition of research to another concern. We will figure out why we have this one. So, I will give a quick schedule of approval. The first thing is. A quick schedule for proof. The first thing is that if you recall, the most important thing is that we are trying to use our argument to make our life easier. So we are going to do the key is that we are trying to find this one. So it's a definition of the already joint party. The key of the proof is that, you know, we are trying to start it, the list two. And if you recall this. And if you recall it is a requirement in our power summer, we want the Z1 to be the largest one. So, what I'm trying to do is that, okay, we are defined, okay, this one. We're trying to find a minimum because we will consider reciprocal sum. So, we take the minimum one and just for the sake of argument, well, we will divide this one out. It's not important for sure. You can do this argument without choosing this one again, apply the power-some method, but you will get some tinting trouble. You will get some tin tank truffle. So, what we are going to choose is that we are normalizing all of the we are choosing the using a power sign, we said the following normalization. Originally, we are trying to do this too. But what we are going to do is that we are going to multiply n squared. So, you can say each term will be less than one. One thing that is we are introducing a zero, we are going to multiply the n squared. A zero, we are going multi by the n square and omega rho by n squared. Okay, and you can see because n is over the order zero, so particularly our another zero, beta prime and the t i plus it, also inside this set. So if you put this row, I mean this remember this row prime, this one is the beta prime plus it. So the id i t can solve, you only get c minus beta prime. only get a c minus beta prime as long as this is a c greater than two i believe okay so uh you can see that our original science this one we just take out this n and then you can now we are only need to find this x j prime and then you might okay here's a key why we want to do this normalization because if you do it in this way it's naturally because this this little n is bounded above by c minus Bounded above by C minus beta frame. So throughout this normalizer, you take all this part. And we want this information for you because you can at the end of the day we want to find this beta frame. So this is how we do this one. And then for the remaining turn, is that you see that for this SJ prime, this one is just exactly what we have for the Toronto's power sum. So we are going to apply that on Toronto's power sum. Okay. Okay. Okay, so for Transpower Sound is that for sure we have the following statement is that again, if you collect all possible information, so then you take the absolute value of zero is RO and the omega rho is the sphere. And then you will again recall the transparency. N is looks at this form. Okay. So I'm falling into running out of time. So I'm saying, there are your assignment again. You need to find this. Assignment again, you need to find this end, and the function is not too hard, a standard exercise system. You know, you can find the leaf turn in this form, but you can see at the end of this not computable. So, we have at least two. We want these two. So, there's a t tiny range between each bound to this here. So, your assignment is to prove the equation 2. We know how to find each ROS row individually. ROS row individually, and then you just do some relatively easy calculus, you will get this one. Okay, so why we want to do this one is that now with this 2.15 in hand, and our n is bounding above in this manner. And there's a second exercise that again is a is not good enough. We are going to find a lower bound of it, and again, is your And again, it's your assignment to do to verify this one. It's relatively easy, but you can check this one. So, why we want to do this one together? I think the original story is that Ness and Abiba and I were saying, okay, let us deal with this one directly. And we are going to try to use the, again, the energy property of the deadline zeta. It turns out, finally, it's hard to do so because it is a lack of something, because it is basically going to already know what you won't get its shift. Won't get it shift with this shift is now. So, what we are going to do: the trick is that once we can have this lovely loadout to remove the contribute, we pull these two together, we will get something agree with the one given by the ACIF. And then we can apply the lema what I'm saying, that we can apply the lema. We can apply the we can. We can apply the we can use the boundary assumption to use this one. Okay, so basically it's basically done because you can see once we apply the RSIF sponge to bound n, we know you have the upper bounded n and the remaining part is basically you just do a simplification and we complete a proof. Okay, so it's not so you can. Okay, so it's not so you can see that this layman, the only only two things you need to be careful with. The first thing is that we need to choose, we need to normalize our consideration wisely to have this one. It's a trick. And also second thing is that because owing to our new bound of the next P R theta, you need to do another trick to make the bound of N. So doable or EO doable so that you can. A board your board so that you can apply the RCF spot. Okay, okay, I have 10 minutes. Okay, so let me emphasize our records lemma again. Okay, so this laymark again is again with the two-round power sum method in hand. If we consider this magical zero sums or two z powers of zero sum of the delta data, we know the real power of it will greater than delta times the c minus. times the C minus the beta prime to be negative 2j. And beta prime is coming from the second or another zero of the data of high up to the capital T. Okay, and for June, if you have two zeros with a send real part, you choose a smaller one because you will get a better numerical. Okay. So now is the end. So now it's the end of the theorem 2.6. In here, we are going to prove our during Harrier phenomena. It's that if we have the exceptional zero looks at this one, we do some simple factory. So beta one equal to one minus lambda one over L. And we are wondering if we have a second zero. And again, we are writing the second zero, the rho prime beta equal to beta prime plus i gamma prime. We write this beta prime. Prime. We write this beta prime in the so emphasizing this one and this one. So we all write the real power of them in the formula one minus lambda something over the log dl and the reason let me say why we use a log dl so here this l equal to log here is that why we use this log dual thing. So the reason is that you You recall the result start. We know the exceptional zero is about your inside that one over zero DL box. So you are comparing this one with the thing. So you are wondering how good or how bad this function is. So the result is that in this form, we can see if you accept non-zero exists, it will greater than this one. This one is based in terms of our lambda one. Lambda one is coming from our exceptional zero. We'll show you how you can this analysis that you can use the 2.19 to recover our result. Just put all the lambda in terms of the beta and you can do it. Did you want to put absolute values in the DL? Our DL is already take absolute value. So I asked. DL is only. I have been doing that in all my periods. I said DL is an absolute discriminant. And I think when I will get a referral report, I said, okay, you should not do this. The description is of course important. Yeah. In some cases, it shouldn't. I will use a capital TR4. Use a campaign TL for okay, okay. I can do it in, so give me 10 minutes. So, first thing is the machine learning how to apply this to run some method. Is that the starting point is due to the do I have any space? So, if you check the list paper, uh, it's a logo. Is Lagarius or the discourse? If you use the only one and you use this OER product form of the zeta, and you take a look derivative, you get this one. And for the first one, I say we are using the automotive. Yeah, we are using the automatic. Wait a second. Yeah, we are using an automatic and you take a Automatic parallelization, and you take a look at the derivative. So, I'm going to give you a hint here: is automatization use the automat federalization, you will get the first one. And you can see probably you have already seen this one for derivative error and the Riemann data. And it's basically the same game to do games of this one. And the important thing is that we are going to take derivative 2J minus one times to get this form. One times to get this form. And you might wonder why it is Qj. The reason is that if you do, if you do not take the even times of derivatives, you take r time. They will be a negative sign. It's not surprising because you check this whole argument. So first one you will get a negative sign. But you need to get one more, no, one more time, or the even times to annihilate the negativity. Okay. Okay, so if you take the derivative. Okay, so if you take the derivative with this one, you are using this S with the C and C plus I gamma prime. We call this gamma prime coming from our another zero or another gamma. So let me write it here. Our other zero beta prime slash looks like this one. Okay, so this one is our another zeros. Okay, so you plug each one, you get identity. Okay, so first thing, again, you might wonder. First thing, again, you might wonder again why we are doing you come use laser twice. Originally, you can say, Okay, we are not going to do that, we are going to deal with the count of time directly. So, we don't have this C, so you don't have this one here. So, you are in trouble because you can say this one is not positive. We need a positivity. So, we plot one here. And again, it's my actual purpose: can we use another positive or non-negative trick polynomial? The answer is: so far, I tried it. No, I didn't get anything. I tried. No, I didn't get anything. It seems to be best possible to have this one. But you can try, you can try to replace this one to use another combination. But so far, we know the whole property because you can say every term here is positive. And the last one is a one plus cosine, something. You just use each mention, you get a cosine if you take a real part. Okay, so I mean that the first is from the V. If you take a real part, the last will get a cosine. The last curve will get a cop side, so it's a non-negative, so you just basically kill all of them. And then there is a remark due to the orderly scope. It said if you really know how the small price splits, like if you know the two, three, five splits completely in this number field L, we can do much better. But I don't want to try because it will be ugly calculated. But that means that here we trivially function by. Trivially function by bounding the real power junk below by zero, and you can improve this one if you have information about this prime idea about the size. Okay. And how about the remaining part is this one? So remaining part, if we take a real part, you can see that's why we want the trouane's power some less over the previous lemma. Using the last term, this one, if you take the real part, basically you will get, we will find the upper bound or lower bound depending on the. The upper bound or lower bound depending as the sign. So, let me so you can see we already handle the first one, a real power for this one, uh, is non-negative. And now we are going to handle anti-writer. So, first thing we are going to handle the first few terms. So, we are going to when you apply the Turan PowerSun method, don't you need finite sums? Uh, fine, I guess I have S and T or infinite. Have SMT or infinite no, no, Toronto Sounds Power is for the traditional version doesn't define X size, yeah. This one is a different one, but yeah, so now what I'm trying to do is uh so let me emphasize if we take a real power, we know the first one is a real, positive, so we will get the second form. So basically, then you can take all everything. Bound for this basically, you can take all everything to real and so we know is the negative sign here. You pull another side, two once power some method will give a lower bound for each turn, basically. So, we only need to deal with the first filter. So, first filter is, I don't have too much time, but the trick is that you can combine the first one and the third one and the second one and the fourth one. Okay, I'm going to do this without you can combine this one and then this two. One and the least. So, the way to combine this one is to use the complex integration. It's easy. Is that you notice the difference is equal to this integral of to the truth. And you see that the x is real part is real as between the one and beta one. And it's in a denominator. So it's easy to find the outer bound and low bound for this. I think I believe. And then you bound the all the IT prime tribulary by zero, you've got a place output. Drawing up this output. So, with this alpha function, you see this full term will give you 4j times 1 minus beta 1 over c minus 1 to be 2j plus 1. So, again, we can combine all these four terms. We only remember the last one. Okay, so the last one, if you look at it a bit more carefully, is that now we have the trivial zero. The trivial zero is like if you complete your zeta, function remains zeta, you get a trivial zero contributed by the gamma vector. Contributed by the gamma vector. So, if you do the same, uh, you use the automaticization for the data, you get a trivial zero. But unfortunately, is that for the trivial zero? The trivial zero, you can find it nicely because of this inequality. So, I'm going to skip this investigation. You can see what we are having here. Are having here right? Do I miss anything? No, I didn't mean to anything. So what I'm saying is an easy argument to know if you just bound the real power for Z is less than or equal to the upstream value of Z. And you can bound the trivial zero greater than or equal to zero. I think it's not too hard to show. It's easy to vary. By the way, by trivial zero means that the order omega. Trivial zero means that all the omega is less than or equal to zero saying half country. So we know that all the trivial contributes basically nothing greater than equal to zero. So here is a thing. You might wonder if we can do slightly better here by the better bound. The answer is yes or no, because you can see these two basically we rise a power to a new j. So an RJ will be super large. It can be super large. So you may control the some marginal stuff. Do some marginal stuff. So, first, we are going to only triple it by zero. So, collapse at least all these estimates together. Okay, so if we collect these estimates, this is one and this is. Is two by three Ah, I wrong. IP is wrong. I think it's not true to anyhow. By the oldest argument, we see that you can find this one. Basically, you remove the provide. Okay, let me give me five minutes and let me do this again. So, so far, what is really going on here is that, again, use all number validation, the original extra representation for the data, this one. And then we take the real parts of the One and then we take a real path of the first one all well for this one, uh, they are non-negative, so you get this uh star one for the star one. We do control it turn by turn. So, the first thing is that for these very first four terms, we use a trivial bound to bound it to group the first one and the third one and the second one and the fourth one by this two j times uh uh one minus beta one divided by something. So, what we get is uh star truth. So, now we are saying that we know how to. So now we are saying that we know how to control the non-trivial zero by a Toronto's power sum. We need to remove this trivial zero. So to remove the trivial zero, we are going to use this trivial power, trivial identity. So the negative real power z is less than or equal to observed variable z. And we remove it all, and we are saying that okay, all positive. So why I'm saying that here is inside here, all the natural reservoirs removed, and you can feel the further bump only is the thumb or Is the sum over the non-trivial zero for the non-trivial zero things? We are using the Lehman 2.5 to get this Toronto's power summit to get this lower bound in terms of a beta prime. So we combine everything together from the start to the star form to get this lower bound. Okay, and that's for this lower bound and basically we are done. You do some simplification, you can complete the proof. But let me say a few words about how to do. But let me say a few words about how to do this. So, the key to do this simplify in fact is that you put the, you can see you have a C minus beta front here. And the trick is that you move the C minus one to J power to the right. And you get this form, and you exponential it, you get this one. And why we want to do this thing is that, first of all, we notice an important bound is an easy bound. So log one plus X is less than. So, log one plus x is less than equal to the x. So, you find a further lower bound for this. And now, in this way, and you can also find, because you can think of j here, you have negative j here. So you use the outer bound of j. Remember, it's like a times the n, and n you can bound it by in terms of all the l. So, what you get is this one. Okay. And in fact, to have our theorem, you can even stop here. Our theorem, you can even stop here to use this phone to recover our main theorem if you want to, in terms of the beta one and the beta franc. Basically, you can do some simplification to recover with our, you want to stay in our way, you just plot this back. So basically, we are done here. This one is enough for our main theorem. But if you want to prove this theorem because of setting, you just prove the beta one equal to one minus lambda one of L beta prime. Lambda one over L, beta prime equal to one minus lambda prime over L, and you do a simple function, you'll get this one. And last one is rearrange everything, you will recover there or leave it as an exercise. Okay, I think I'm completing everything. So let me show the, I give me one more minute. For the real zeros, let me give you, so there will be. Zeros. Let me give you so there will be your learning activity. So basically, you are going to go through all the proof, and if you can recall the detail or that's the trick I told you. But no, here is a good thing. For the real zero, we instead consider this. If you recall for the real, for the original one, it's an extra sum here. It is C minus IP prime and the minus rho. And that's not very good. It's a real zero. And that's not why it's a real zero. So if you pull the IT point equal to zero, you have a double this one. But it doesn't make any sense to deal with that double one. So you just do the. And then you can say, why we want this one? Because if you have an extra imaging part, you need a positivity argument for because of this, because of this line. But you can see if your imagination is zero, you don't need to do this, the positivity. The positivity argument. So that's why we set factor by two. Okay. So your learning activity is that instead, you consider this sum and you can prove the similar lower bound by the Toronto Power Sun method. And use this Toronto power sum method. You can prove the real zero things. And I give the outline and I did my apologies again. They said, due to myself. Part research here and they said due to myself, I delete like two or one and a half pages about this display for you. But you can, I think you can do it. So, okay, I think I will stop here and I will send, I think I can save. So I will stop here. So let us have a copy break.
