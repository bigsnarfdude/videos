Yeah, today I'll talk about hydrodynamic instabilities in two-layer channel flow involving a fluid with time-dependent viscosity. I take this opportunity to thank the organizer for giving this opportunity to speak in this, particularly Muhammad, Ian, Polo, and all. In viscosity stratified flow, it is well known that a small change in viscosity stratification can give rise to a big effect. And viscosity. Effect and viscosity stratifications are found almost everywhere, starting from let's say earth outer core to arterial flows because of the non-neutrinal nature of the blood, industrial pipe flow. This is a space applications. In space applications, this is a picture of a re-entry vehicle which is entering into the Earth atmospheres. And because of the friction, it actually generates a lot of heat. Actually, generate a lot of heat and which give rise to a huge viscosity stratification in a very narrow region. This is an example of interfacial instability in silicon-water interface. Many other type of instability is also found. For example, in polymer flows, people have observed this coiling type of instabilities and like you know three-dimensional instabilities in magma flows. Of course, there is a big area of turbulent flows and wall. Flows and like you know, in oceans and atmospheres, where viscosity stratification can play a vital role. In all these situations, viscosity varies with either temperature, composition, strain rate, pressure, and sometimes also with time, which we'll be discussing in this talk today. Now, coming to industrials applications like viscous stratify stratified flows are observed in chemical and petrochemical engineering. Petrochemical engineering, space applications, oceanography, atmospheric science. Some of these things we have already discussed in the last few slides. I'd like to highlight two applications here. This is one in refinery. When the crude oil flows through the pipeline of heat exchanger, what happen is it get aspartine materials get deposited on the surface of the pipe. And because of the high temperature, this material gets cooked and solidified. And this process gets repeated and. And this process gets repeated, and eventually the entire pipe is blocked. And if this thing happened, this is known as actually fouling in refineries. This is a very expensive affair for refinery because they have to shut down the refinery and clean this material manually. So the idea is to can we remove this material by creating some sort of instability and things like that. Another example is from Mohamed's PhD thesis in primary cementing of oil gas well, what they do is. Oil gas well bore what they do is they drill the bore and they pass chemicals cement story with chemical was at the front. The idea is to hydraulically seal this bore. There can be some instability here also which can which is not which may not be desirable in this case because it will reduce the performance of the bore. In many of these situations, the fluids can be Newtonian or non-Newtonian or Newtonian, a non-Newtonian, or even they can have viscosity that can change over time. So, coming to interfacial instability, for example, if we have two fluids flowing through a channel or a pipe, and let's say both are immiscible fluid, so in that case, separated by a sharp interface. In this case, what happened is the surface tension becomes very important and plays a vital role in the dynamics. The pioneering was. The dynamics. The pioneering work by Yee in 1967 actually demonstrated the existence of an interfacial mode for long waves at any Reynolds number. This means that such flow becomes unstable at any Reynolds number. Any finite Reynolds number, the flow will become unstable. So we have conducted some direct numerical simulations, but considering Newtonian. But considering Newtonian fluids, of course. So, here, this flat interface, these are three-dimensional simulation: predict boundary condition on the other side, and so on. So, a flat interface like that can develop interfacial instabilities, which are like roll-off structures. When you see the side from the side, you can see this Kelvin-Helmose type instabilities roll-offs coming at the interface. Now, all these Now, all these are for Newtonian fluid. There are some many studies also, many, many researchers have investigated this considering non-Newtonian fluids. For example, if one of the fluid, let's say, is Newtonian or both the fluids are non-Newtonian, either Bingham fluid or some Herzel-Buckley type of fluid. Frigger and Penabasi, they found that under high yield speed. Under high yield stress, when there is something like an unyielded reason appears here, so in that situation, actually, the yield stress is found to stabilize the flow. But before that critical yield stress, there will be completely, the flow will be completely yielded everywhere. Under that conditions, long time before we have conducted linear stability analysis by perturbing, by splitting the disturbance. By splitting the disturbance into an amplitude part and a wave part. Here, alpha is the wave number of the disturbance, and omega is the frequency of the disturbance. So, one can actually easily show that this sign of the imaginary part of this omega can tell us about the growth rate. So, if omega is greater than zero, it is actually unstable and that is known as growth rate. So, here we have plotted growth rate versus alpha and for different Bingham number. And for different Bingham number. And you can, a Bingham number is essentially a dimensionless number associated with yield stress. And you can see that the increasing Bingham number has a destabilizing effect. So all these studies has been done considering like, you know, interfacial instability. People have investigated considering both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid. But to the best of my knowledge, thick trophy fluids has received very less attention, which is the subject. Very less attention, which is the subject of the present work. So, herein, um, uh, which this fluid one is a tixotrophic fluid, and fluid two, which is the top fluid, is a non-neutral, is a Newtonian fluid. And they are invisible, so separated by a serve interface. A direct three-dimensional numerical simulation has been conducted to study this problem. So, the fluid is entering from this side and leaving from this side. This side and leaving from this side, it has top and bottom wall, and the rest of the boundaries are periodic in nature. So, the thicketropic fluid is modeled using a cassode type model, wherein the viscosity mu1 of the bottom layer is some sort of a reference viscosity into 1 plus lambda to the power n, n being a material properties of this layer. And lambda is known as degree of jamming. As degree of jamming. Lambda varies with time as follows by these equations. Herein, you can see this term tau is actually a time scale associated with the building up of the microstructures. And the second term here is beta is a material property and gamma dot is the second invariant of the standard sensor. So this term is actually responsible for the destruction of microstructure inside the fluid. So always there is a competition between these two terms. Competition between these two terms, which can give rise to, which can either increase or decrease the viscosity, which in turn can influence the flow. In the limiting case, when lambda tends to infinity, beta tends to zero, and n equal to zero, this model will get back a Newtonian fluid from this model. So now the governing equations are as follows. are as follows. We have this continuity equation, Navier-Stokes equations, with the gravity terms, the body force terms. This term is associated with the surface tension and included into the Navier-Stokes equation using the formulation proposed by Bregville. And in order to track the SARP interface, a diffuse interface method is used which involves solving a Canhilliard equation. Solving a Canillier equation, which is given by this expression. Here, C is the volume fraction of the bottom layer. Peclet number here is 1 over epsilon and epsilon being the smallest grid size in the computational domain. So essentially, I mean, Peclet number is very large. In the VOF type of formulation, you can see that we solve an equation which is where in the right-hand side is completely zero. Where in the right-hand side is completely zero. But in this case, there is a Peclet number, but that Peclet number is very large. Now, what happened is it will create some sort of numerical diffusion. Even in VOIF, it happens, but in order to suppress that numerical diffusion, there is an anti-diffusion terms. And that has been modeled using this chemical potential. I'll not go into detail of this. If somebody is interested, I can follow this. Uh, I can follow this uh JCP article. Now, these equations are coupled via this relay, uh, via this constitutive relationship, um, viscosity and density. And as you can see, C equal to one for the bottom layer, so it will go back to the thixotrophic viscosity. And if C equal to zero, the viscosity will be one. So, essentially, all these equations are non-dimensionalized using the fluid properties. Using the fluid properties of the Newtonian layer. Similarly, the density is defined as in this way. Now, the various dimensionless numbers in this problem are Reynolds number, which is inertia force by viscous force, capillary number, the inertia by surface tension, fruit number, inertia by gravity, and viscosity ratio and density ratio. And all of them are defined based on the Newtonian layer. Defined based on the Newtonian layer, properties of the Newtonian layer. So now coming to some presenting some results, first to investigate, let us investigate the effect of the reconstruction time scale, tau. So as I said, tau tends to infinity, tau equal to actually infinity in the case of Newtonian fluid. And here we have considered Newtonian fluid. Here we have considered Newtonian fluid tau equal to five and tau equal to one. And in the bottom, in this side, the bottom each panel in the bottom row wise is actually the as the time dimensionless time is varied like this, increases like this. And you can see that in the Newtonian case, what happened is the interface become unstable, forming sawtooth type of instabilities, which actually grows and eventually forms these roll-off structures. Of structures. When we decrease the value of tai to put consider tau equal to five, you can see that the instability still appears, but the intensity of this instability is much are actually much smaller than as compared to the Newtonian case. But for tau equal to one, you can see that the interface remains flat forever. Note that here, initial viscosity ratio is 10. So that means Ratio is 10. So that means the bottom layer is actually 10 times more viscous than the top layer to start with. So now in order to show the clear pictures of the interface, here we have iso surface of C equal to 0.5 is plotted. And you can see that for Newtonian case, the interface becomes more stable, forming this wavy interface. For tau equal to 5, there is Equal to five, there is still instability, but it has been suppressed a lot. And tau equal to one is actually a stable case. Now, in order to understand this, here I have plotted the average viscosity profile layerwise. So, in the x-ray plate, it has been averaged and it has been plotted in the z directions. And this is for tau equal to five, and this is for tau equal to one. And this is for tau equal to one at different times. You can see that as the time progresses for tau equal to five, the viscosity increases and for dimensionless time t equal to six or so, it has gone to something like 22 or something. It is increasing, but it is not increasing at a faster rate. Whereas for tau equal to one, you can see that the viscosity increases significantly, almost actually something like 25 or 26 times as six times as compared to the initial viscosity at time dimensionless time t equal to six also. So when we plot this maximum viscosity versus tau at let's say two typical time instants here, this is the initial viscosity of the bottom fluid. And you can see that as you decrease the tau value, the viscosity increases at any given time, the viscosity actually increases. And that actually increases at a much faster rate, actually. So, and for tau, for this set of parameters, for tau greater than 10, you can see that it is approaching towards the 10, the initial viscosity. So, these are the observation from these results. Viscosity of the bottom layer actually increases with time for all finite values of tau, which in turn actually suppresses the interfacial instability. Suppresses the interfacial instability, the development of interfacial instabilities. Decreasing the value of tau increases the viscosity and it approaches the Newtonian case for tau greater than 10. Now, coming to the effect of beta, which is a material property here, as presented in this equation, you can see that again the viscosity maximum of the viscosity of the maximum viscosity of the bottom layer is plotted versus B. Of the bottom layer is plotted versus B here, beta here, and you can see that for smaller values of beta, there is some sort of plateau. For beta greater than one, you can see that it is actually reaching to the initial viscosity of fluid one. That means the Newtonian layer. So the fluid is behaving like a Newtonian fluid for beta greater than one for this set of parameters in this case. Now, Now, coming to the effect of fruit number, which is inertia by gravity, for in the case when there is no gravity effect, you can see that the interface becomes unstable at very early times, which actually grows and that continues to grow and become very intense at later times. When we have fruit number equal to two, that means we are increasing. 2 that means we are increasing the gravity effects here. We can see that the instability appears, but it appears very slowly at later times. For fruit number one, however, we can see that for this set of parameters, the interface remains stable. Now, in order to understand the effect of surface tension, we varied the capillary number here. When Capellary number equals 0.5, we can see that the disturbance actually grows and settles to some sort of steady interfacial deformations, forming this tiny waves at the interface with very small wavelengths for smaller values of capillary number when the surface tension is significantly large. So, now if we decrease the surface tension, what happened is the instability is. The instabilities, the waves, the wave number actually, the wavelength of this interface actually increases. For capillary number 10, you can clearly observe that the wavelength are significantly higher as compared to that of capillary number 0.5. So, this type of this behavior was previously also observed for in the case of Newtonian freed. So, in order to conclude. So, in order to conclude, pressure-driven two-layer channel flow involving a time-dependent viscosity is studied numerically. The rheology of the bottom layer is modeled using a cassode-type model. The Kelvin-Helmos type of instability, the role of structures observed in the Newtonian case, is being suppressed as the characteristics time of reconstruction tau and the material property beta are increased. It is also observed that. It is also observed that the bottom layer almost behaves like a constant viscosity for tau greater than 10 and beta greater than 1. So, this is something important contributions which we have observed in this study. Decreasing the value of the fruit number stabilizes the interface and increasing the capillary increases the wavelength of the interfacial wave. I would confess that this study is at a very preliminary stage. We are Preliminary stage, we are under, we are trying to develop some sort of theory by considering, let's say, the growth of lambda, let's say d lambda by dt to be assuming that d lambda over dt is small, we are trying to develop some sort of theory and that will actually add a lot of values to this work. This is only recently we have conducted this study and with this. Study and with this, I would like to take questions and thank you very much for your kind attention. Thank you. Right on time. So, we have so far two questions. Maybe say if you want to ask turning on your micro. Sure, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Great talk, Kirty. So, I have one question on the interpolation that you used for density and viscosity. You used for density and viscosity. I think for density, it does not really matter the form of the interpolation, so linear should be fine. I was wondering if there is any effect of using a linear interpolation or power law or different forms that people are using on the numerical results. This is a good question. Actually, I had tested this using an exponential type of formulation. For example, For example, if in the Newtonian case or mu equal to e to the power c lon m, r, for example, I can have used. And then I have inserted this formulation there. Those also has been tested, and I found that there is not much significant effect in terms of the as far as the results are concerned. Okay. Okay. Two formulations have been tested. One is exponential, and this is the linear one. The other forms are yet to be tested. Right. And what's the criterion to say that there is not much effect? Because so, for example, if I plot this viscosity, which is actually playing the important role in suppressing the interfacial mode. So, for example, if I'm plotting this viscosity, So, for example, if I'm plotting this viscosity using different rheological mode formulas, this does not change much. Right. Okay, great. I mean, this has been tested like that, but actually, this in turn influenced the development of this instability. So, they are related actually. Right, right. Okay, so we have one more question by Hussein Ramani. Hussein Ramani, if you want to ask the question by yourself, please turn on the microphone. Hi, thank you very much for the nice presentation. I just was curious about one of the initial slides that you just shown about the stabilizing effects of pink ham. Yes. I was wondering, because mostly in the papers we see that the illustrous has a stabilizing effect. Has stabilizing effects. I just want to know that is it because of having actually larger velocities and larger velocity gradient at the interface when you have yield stress? Because at the end of the day, I guess you're going to have a constant flow rate. Yes. So this is a good question. So when we have a yield stress, which is larger than some Which is larger than some critical values, as found by a very nice paper in 2002, I guess, that it has a super stable behavior. So you rightly said. But when we have this yielded regions, so there is no unyielded region presence, this behavior are observed. The Bingham number, destabilizing effect of Bingham number. Destabilizing effect of being a number. And energy budget analysis also was conducted actually in this 2007 paper, which shows that the tangential contribution, the contribution from contribution to the energy growth by the tangential stress was the main mechanism of getting these instabilities. So, in other words, So, in other words, what I wanted to say is we have splitted the rate of change of kinetic energy into production and dissipation terms. And the production terms is actually further decomposed into, let's say, velocity gradient, tangential stress, and so on. And it was found that the tangential stress at the interface was responsible for these instabilities. Yeah, actually, I think that. Yeah, actually, I think that was also my question: that you have larger elastic gravity and larger tangential stresses that leads to increased production. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you. We do not have any more questions, but and we are right on time. So, thank you for the presentation, Kurti. We are going to move.
