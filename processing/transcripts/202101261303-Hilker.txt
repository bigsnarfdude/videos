But now it works. Great. So, what I'm going to present is joint work with Anthony Sun, who has been a PhD student and who graduated last year, just recently, successfully, as you can see, with his doctoral hat in, let's say, German, a traditional German style. And so it's joint work, and actually, Anthony has. Anthony has done most of it. So, the motivation was that when we started working on coupled human environment systems coming from ecological modeling, we were wondering about the difference between replicator dynamics, best response dynamics, immutation dynamics. When do you use one, when the other? Is there a difference? Does it matter at all? Doesn't matter at all. So we're going to investigate this in a model of lake eutrophication, which is heavily influenced by Yo Iwaza's work and which also showed up yesterday already in Chris Hagerwood's presentation. So we're going to use the same ecological The same ecological model and couple it with two different behavioral models: one represented by replicator dynamics, the other one by best response dynamics. But first, let's consider the ecological part and the problem of eutrophication in shallow lakes. Probably you all know the phenomenon of a critical transition or a shallow lake very rapidly turning into a turbid state. A turbid state. So eutrophication can be understood as a regime shift with increasing input of nutrients, say phosphorus. We can have a critical transition to high turbidity states. And we have this phenomenon of two coupled cellulode bifurcations. There's a very simple ecological model which is able to explain this phenomenon going back to Carpenter. Going back to Carpenter and the pollution level, so the concentration of phosphorus in the lake is changing in time according to an input rate, A, outflow out of the lake and sedimentation with a linear rate here, and some resuspension from the sediment compartment, which is described by this non-linear rate, which is driving. Rate which is driving the positive feedback and the possible critical transition. So for the input, that input is determined by human behavior, by the discharge of nutrients. And we're going to consider that human agents can choose between two different strategies. The first strategy is called cooperation. Is called cooperation. It's characterized by a lower discharge. So, cooperation in the sense of environmentally friendly behavior, but in economic terms, it's more expensive. The second strategy, it's called defection. It's characterized by a higher discharge, so polluting more nutrients, but it's economically cheaper. Cheaper or better for the economic agents. So there's a nice illustration in Steve Carpenter's book from 2003: you know, the water quality determined by strategies of more agriculture or more, let's say, lake ecology-oriented strategies. So, the input is then determined by the fraction of cooperators. Cooperators who have a lower discharge and a fraction of defectors, which are those who do not cooperate by a higher discharge. So in this fraction of cooperators can be modeled in two different ways. On the one hand, by replicator dynamics, and on the other hand, by best response dynamics. The replicator dynamics has origins in evolutionary game theory, heavily influenced by economics. And it can be interpreted in a Darwinian selection way that the evolutionary success of a strategy is determined by the differential. The differential utility, if we consider two strategies. So we assume that we have a population of infinitely many agents. As I mentioned, we consider two strategies and the two strategies are so-called totally ordered by their utilities. So the utilities determine the measure of goodness of the strategies, and that can be The strategies and that can be payoff in game theory sense, in economic sense, it can be wealth in direct monetary or indirect ways, or it could be biological fitness. And this equation can be derived by taking into account the average strategy of agents, and the decision is made fully rational according to the utility. The utility. The best response dynamics also emerges in evolutionary game theory, but has origins rooted also in psychophysics and in psychology, in research on stimulus and response effects. It can be interpreted in terms of a probabilistic choice. That came up already yesterday in a couple of times. So, a fraction of agents can be assumed to change their behavior from one strategy to the other, and that depends on the differential utility. And so, this term, this fraction here, this is a logged log. This is a logged expression of this argument minus beta times the differential utility. The differential utility is the incentive to cooperate. So if it's positive, we tend to cooperation. If it's negative, to defection. And beta can be interpreted as a rationality parameter of the agents. So if beta is very Agents. So if beta is very small, then the decision or the choice is not affected by the utility. If beta is very large, then it's almost a very rational decision. So with a step-like transition here. But for intermediate values of beta, it's more like a decision of limited rationality. We have this sigmohoidal logit formula. Or the logged formulation of the transition. All right. So what about the utility? The differential utility is the difference between the utility of cooperating and the utility of defecting. And we will assume that there's a difference in economic cost because pollutant. Economic cost because polluting pays off economically, let's say like that. But there is an incentive to cooperate when agents have a concern for the environment, and that's determined linearly by the pollution level in the lake. And there is social ostracism or social pressure. So the more agents already cooperate, they exert some pressure on the other agents to cooperate. On the other agents to cooperate as well. Chris brought the example of electric cars in Alberta yesterday, or you can think of farmers helping each other in the harvest, helping out with repairing or technology, machinery, and so on. This is a slightly simplified formulation of the differential utility than can be found in youth. Yo Iwaza's paper, which is bilinear formulation. We found this a little bit easier to interpret, and it also simplifies the mathematics a little bit. So to summarize, we have a coupled human environment system. On the left-hand side, you can see the purely ecological part. It's determined by one state variable, the pollution level in the lake. This increases due to nutrient levels. Increases due to nutrient loading. And there's outflow and there's sedimentation, but there's a positive feedback due to resuspension. And this is driving the biostability. We have also a purely behavioral component of the system. It's described by one state variable, which is the fraction of cooperators. This increases by new cooperators. It decreases. Cooperators decreases by new defectors. This is enhanced due to economic cost of cooperation. And new cooperators are affected positively in a positive feedback loop due to social ostracism. And the two subsystems are linked because co-operators have lower nutrient loading due to their cooperation. And just to remind you, And just to remind you, cooperation means more environmentally friendly behavior. And the impact of the ecological system on the behavioral system is due to the concern of the agents for the environment, which also enhances the new cooperators. All right, that's the model setup, very simple, a two-dimensional model, one way. Dimensional model, one representing the ecological part, the other one the behavioral part. In the remainder of this talk, I would like to focus on the behavioral part, which is described in two ways. One time with the replicator equation, the other time with the best response dynamics. The ecological part always stays the same. And first, I'll establish a fundamental First, I'll establish a fundamental difference, then I point out an intuitive link, and then I go into some more mathematical aspects of bifurcation behavior and some effects of behavioral thresholds and resignation. Okay, the fundamental difference. If you just look at the differential equations for the replicator dynamics and the best response dynamics. Best response dynamics and consider pure strategies, meaning that all agents cooperate, so F equals one, or all agents defect, F equal to zero. Then these two pure strategies are stationary in replicator dynamics. So this is an indication for strong conformism. So if all other So, if all other agents follow one strategy, then this is stationary, and this could be described by agents following mass movements, for example. By contrast, in the best response dynamics, in the logit formulation of it, the P strategies are not stationary. That means at least some agents deviate from unanumnible. From an anonymous behavior. And so a coherent group behavior cannot impair innovation or, let's say, mutation or novel behavior or different behavior from other agents. So simple observation, but a fundamental difference. Okay, now let's look into phase plane dynamics. Into phase plane dynamics, we have the level of pollution on the horizontal axis and the fraction of cooperators on the vertical axis. And we consider the model with best response dynamics. And parameters are such that we have four stable stationary states. They are these black points here. They are the intersections of two. Intersections of two null lines, which are both S-shaped, and the colors in the background are the basins of attraction. And this has already been found by Yo Iwaza and Sutsuki in a paper, and it describes the complex dynamics where we have high pollution with little cooperation. Pollution with little cooperation, slightly lower pollution due to high cooperation, and we can have low pollution states either with low cooperation or high cooperation. So both null clines in this case are S-shaped. Now let's look at the replicator dynamics and we only look at the null cline for the fraction of the co-operators. Of the cooperators. And in the replicator dynamics model, this is shown in red. We can see two trivial null lines that are the pure strategies. F equals zero and f equals, oh sorry, f equals one and f equals zero. And we have a non-trivial null line, which is a straight line. And we can show analytically that all stable equilibria have to be located on this reversed. On this reversed Z or Z. The best response model can have S-shaped null clines or monotonic null clines depending on the value of the rationality. If the rationality is low, we have monotone null clines, but if the rationality increases, then it gets more and more S-shaped and actually converges to this. To this Z-shaped Nulk line of the replicator dynamics. And this provides a very intuitive link between the replicator dynamics and the best response dynamics, because for the rationality of agents in the best response model increasing to infinity, it gets more and more similar to the replicator dynamics. So the replicator dynamics can be understood as a Kator dynamics can be understood as a special case of the best response model for infinite rationality. So we can see this also in a bifurcation diagram, where we plot the equilibria as a function of the agent's rationality. In the replicator dynamics model, here shown in red dashed line, That dashed line that's independent of the rationality because that parameter doesn't exist in the replicator dynamics, and we can see for stable equilibria. In the best response model shown in blue, we have for low rationality three equilibria, the upper and the lower one stable, the intermediate one unstable. And with increasing rationality, we have some settle node bifurcations. Settle node bifurcations. So that for beta becoming large, we also have four stable equilibria which converge to the equilibria of the replicator dynamics. So this confirms that for large rationality, the best response model tends towards the replicator dynamics model. How about non-equilibrium? How about non-equilibrium dynamics? There can be cycles in both the replicator and the best response model. They are shown here in the phase plane. They have a nice interpretation in terms of coupled human environment dynamics. So if we look at this cycle in orange color for the best response model, if the lake pollution increases, Pollution increases, then the agents concern more for the environment, so they cooperate more. Due to higher cooperation, there is less input into the lakes that reduces the lake pollution. So the pollution decreases, then the concern for the environment decreases, and the cooperation level goes down, and the cycle repeats. Cycle repeats. A similar cycle happens in the replicator dynamic model, but it's much more, let's say, violent or with larger amplitudes, because you can see it goes up to almost full cooperation and down to almost full defection. Here is a bifurcation diagram. Again, the rationality on the horizon. The rationality on the horizontal axis. On the vertical axis is a fraction of cooperators, and for the replicator dynamic, we can see the maximum value along the limit cycle and the minimum value in the dashed lines. And this dotted line is the unstable equilibrium point. The best response model has a stable equilibrium for low rationalities. Rationalities. Then there's a Hopf bifurcation point, and only for large rationalities we have a limit cycle emerging. And initially, it has small amplitudes. And only for large rationalities, the amplitudes converge to the limit cycle of the replicator dynamic model. So when the oscillations have very large amplitudes, Amplitudes, we observe that they get close to the pure strategies of full cooperation or full defection. And this can give rise to so-called make-or-break dynamics illustrated here for the replicator model. In the dotted black line, we have a limit cycle, as it happens. Sometimes it's very close to one. Sometimes it's very close to one, sometimes it's very close to zero cooperation. And in blue, we illustrate the same dynamics, but at time t equal to 400, we have a little perturbation which pushes the fraction down to zero, and there it's stationary. And we can call that a make dynamics because then it gets. Dynamics because then it gets stuck at this equilibrium value in the absence of perturbation. If the perturbation occurs at a different time, say at t equal to 500, so it's a different phase of the cycle where we have high cooperation, then this perturbation can lead to a break where the cooperation level gets stationary or gets stuck at a different Stationary or get stuck at a different equilibrium value in the absence of perturbations. So these extreme oscillations can provide these make or break dynamics depending on where perturbations occur along the cycle. Okay, now I would like to devote some time to the bifurcation. Bifurcation behavior, and I illustrate that in the best response model. On the left, we see a two-parameter bifurcation diagram. On the horizontal axis is a social parameter, it's a concern for the environment, and on the vertical axis is an ecological parameter, it's a resuspension rate or the maximum resuspension rate. The larger it is, the more potential for resuspension. More potential for resuspension and for critical transitions to happen. Let's start with the parameter value in this region labeled F, let's say here. And the phase plane is illustrated here on the right-hand side. We see one stable equilibrium at low pollution levels and low cooperation. If we know If we know now increase the resuspension, so if we go up here, we cross two times a settle node bifurcation, and this is the typical transitions happening towards eutrophication. So in region G, we have three intersections of the null clines, giving rise to three non-trivial equilibrium points. Non-trivial equilibrium points, two of them are stable, so we have bi-stability. And if we get into parameter region D, then we have only the high pollution state left, which is here. So that's this ecological phenomenon. If we now increase the concern for the environment, higher values of Qatar, we can see that we need higher resuspendent. Higher resuspension rates for biostability to happen. So, a stronger concern for the environment makes critical transition, makes eutrophication less likely. However, if the resuspension rate is very large, so in this higher region up here, then even high concerns for the environment cannot prevent eutrophication to happen. Eutrophication to happen. So here we were in the high eutrophication state. Then here we have bi-stability between the eutrophic and oligotrophic state. And we would need to go down to here to get only oligotrophic state. We also have the possibility for off-bifurcations shown in this red curve and they happen And they happen in this intermediate parameter range located between the two cusp bifurcations, where the coupled human environment system is a little bit torn between concern for the environment and potential for resuspension and eutrophication. We also have homoclinic bifurcations shown in this gray. A gray curve where the limit cycle disappears. And I would like to show you one example where we have a state with low pollution levels here. If we decrease the concern for the environment, there's a Hof bifurcation. So now we have cycles. And here with a homoclinic bifurcation, which happens to coincide with this settle node bifurcation. This saddle node bifurcation. And this is called a saddle node homoclinic bifurcation, which I wasn't aware of so much before, I have to say. And I found another term for that, namely the saddle node infinite period by focation with the abbreviation sniper, which I like to mention here. Okay. Okay, so much about the bifurcation behavior, bifurcation dynamics. In the remainder, I would like to talk briefly about some ongoing work or very preliminary work where we look at behavioral threshold and resignation effects. Let's start with the behavioral threshold. With a behavioral threshold. What do we mean with that? So far, we have assumed that the concern for the environment increases linearly with the pollution level. And the constant of proportionality is kappa, and that was constant. But it could be that agents do not care so much about the environment unless there is a problem or unless they become aware of the problem. The problem, or unless they become aware there was something, their media reports start to show up, and then suddenly it gets to everybody's attention, and then agents become aware of it and start to worry about it. So, and a simple way of modeling is the following. So, if the pollution level is low, below some threshold level, the concern parameter has a low value. CERN parameter has a low value, and for high pollution levels, it increases suddenly, step-like, to a high value. So, if we look at the replicator dynamic model, in the phase plane, it has the following effect. In blue, we have again the ecological pollution Neural Klein as shaped. Klein as shaped, and we have the replicator dynamic null clines, the trivial ones, full cooperation, no cooperation, and then an intermediate one, which is here when we have low concern, because the pollution level is relatively low. But if the pollution level is above some threshold, then there's a higher concern parameter and the null cline from here on. Null line from here on drops jumps down to this value. So we have a discontinuous dynamical system and this is a kind of virtual fixed point here. And we observe the effect that this induces a limit cycle, so some sustained oscillations here, which is kind of Which is kind of interesting because this increased concern has the following effect. The basin of attraction for the high pollution, low cooperation state decreases. That makes sense. And the basin of attraction for the state with higher cooperation and lower pollution, that increases. But initial conditions starting here do not move to this state, which we might want, or even better. We might want, or even better to this state, but they get stuck here on this limit cycle which arises due to the threshold in behavior. So, if the threshold is not at this pollution level, but at some other pollution level, things can change. We haven't investigated that fully, but we've seen so far if the threshold level. If the threshold level is at some intermediate value, say here, then there is not an oscillation taking place, but instead the basin of attraction of this preferable stationary state is much more increased in comparison to the very undesirable high-pollution state here. Okay, the last point I would like to address is Would like to address is resignation effects. And of course, the concern for the environment can increase the more pollution there is. But at some point, agents might just give up because they see it doesn't make sense anymore and they give up hopes that they can improve the environmental conditions. Similarly, Similarly, the social ostracism can increase first, but at some point it can also go down. And we have assumed a Gaussian, like a Gauss-like bell-shaped function for both the social ostracism and the environmental concern. And then we get for the differential utility function a dome-shaped. Dome-shaped function of the two state variables f and p. So for some part, the differential utility is positive. It's above this gray, how do you say this gray cut and below it, it's negative. And so far, this has been. And so far, this has been very preliminary. We have seen that the area where the differential utility is positive as a function of f and p, that can be this closed area in the phase plane. So it's a closed null line here. It can be much larger, stretching all over here. All over here. It can also take some other shapes and/or it can look like that. And this case is very interesting because here we get even more intersections of the Nullklein, so there can be even more equilibrium points. And this is all we have gotten so far. But I would like to put this out to think about ways. You know, think about ways of modeling how agents might respond to the environmental state or to the state of their peers in a non-linear or even non-monotonic way. So let me summarize. We've compared replicator dynamics and the loggered formulation of the best response dynamics. Of the best response dynamics, we've observed a fundamental difference. So, replicator dynamics may be more applicable to situations where there was very strong conformism between agents. So, promoting stationary pew strategies and logged best response always has a drive towards innovation. The logged best response dynamics has extra parameters. Extra parameters. So you might want to think about that in the sense of parsimonious model choice. It's also more cumbersome to analyze because the expression is more complicated and the replicator dynamics makes analysis much more tractable. The replicator dynamics can be understood as a limit case of the best response dynamics when the agents When the agent's rationality tends to infinity. But on the other hand, the best response dynamics offers or provides a broader range of scenarios. In terms of dynamical behavior, the replicator dynamics is more prone to complex dynamics and to make or break dynamics. So it's always a bit more on the extreme, whereas the log at best response dynamics also takes, you know, is a bit smoother and. You know, it's a bit smoother and is not always at the extreme as the replicator dynamics, and there can be more gradual transitions depending on the rationality of the agents. So, what can we conclude from that? I found it very interesting coming from ecological modeling that there can be such differences between two apparently similar approaches from evolutionary game theory. So, I find it important. Theory. So I find it important to be aware of the different underlying assumptions. And in the absence of evidence for one or the other, it seems recommendable to consider or explore both options. And as far as I know, there's very little conclusive evidence or experimental investigations for one or the other. The other. Okay, thank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to questions and discussion. Great. Thanks, Frank. And there's an opportunity to show your appreciation with the reaction button if you would like to in lieu of the more traditional clapping. Okay, well, great. There were a lot of questions in the chat. So why don't we just sort of work through some of those? Just sort of work through some of those, and I think Lou, you're first. Frank, thanks. That was a very, very clear presentation. I appreciate it. Back at the, we were first talking about limit cycle. This is just a question about intuition. I don't know if you can share your screen again and go back to the slide. It might be easier. It was back quite a ways towards the middle here. The middle here. Right there. Yes. So there. That point there, you get an increase in the best response in cooperation, then a decrease before the limit cycle sets in. Do you have any intuition as to what's going on there as you change rationality? I think you're muted, Frank. Okay, can you hear me now? Yeah. Okay. Sorry for that. So okay, so you refer to this non-monotonic behavior of the equilibrium point and why it goes down here, whereas it goes up here. To be honest, I haven't thought about that. We didn't consider that. And right now, I don't have an intuitive idea. An intuitive idea. I guess it must be related to the null clines. When you increase the rationality, then these S-shaped null clines change. And in some way, the X-coordinate for the pollution level here must be non-monotonic. I don't have an intuitive notion. Have an intuitive notion right now why that should be non-monotonic. It's a very good point, so I should think about that more carefully. But right now, I think I have to think about that more carefully. Thanks. Alan. So, this was just maybe a suggestion more than the question. In particular, for that make-or-break scenario, it would strike me. It would strike me that even weak coupling of two of those would tend to synchronize. So you would get the same behavior over. So let's say that the behavior somehow is translated between two lakes or essentially that it would strike me that because of the nature, it's essentially very close to the kind of limit cycle where even a small amount because Where even a small amount because the same sort of dynamics, it's not the make or break issue, but it's the yeah. So this is just for one lake. Yeah, yeah. So if you had replicated lakes, so you coupled two of these, and then even many of them, you would tend to get the same behavior over a large scale. And one can think of scenarios easily, I think, where the same behavior, if it's your changing behavior, that the behavior would affect. Changing behavior, that the behavior would affect multiple locations. Yeah, could be. I think that goes into the direction that I think Chris considered multiple lakes yesterday in his talk, and Yo yesterday had multiple forest batches, I believe, in the illegal logging model. But when the lakes, or let's say, the patches. Or, let's say, the patches, or whatever it is, if they show this kind of make or break dynamics, then they could show some strong tendency towards synchronism. Is that what your comment is about? Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, thank you for that. Hans. You're currently on mute. Can I make a comment on that answer? I think that we have done some work on this coupling two lakes, you might remember. And we observed not just a synchronization, but it's asymmetric. One lake becomes clean, the other lake becomes polluted. There is a solution we observed also. So it might be useful to look at that one. To look at that one. Yeah, I suspect that you would get that. That would make sense. You would get one or the other. Okay, so I'm unmuted at this point. Yeah. Frank, thanks a lot for a very interesting talk. I'm not familiar with your particular problem, but I've worked on some related problems connected in the context of the complex Gietzberg-Londau equation, the Shishkova equation, and this. And there we observed that if you cross a hop bifurcation line on a time scale that is very slow, you may see delay of onset of instability. I was wondering whether you had done that, have seen anything similar or that you know of any phenomenon like that. So the stability persists as you cross the bifurcation line, but you it's it's But it's, as it were, you build up credit as you approach the bifurcation line. And then when you cross it, you use up that credit, you keep the same periodicity, and then eventually it will hop, it will hop to another cycle. So it's a mechanism to explain the transition of frequencies. Have you ever seen that? No, I have never seen that. I have never seen that. We haven't looked for that because we didn't know about that. It was not in our question. So the simple answer is no. I'm afraid. No. Well, it might be something to consider because it is an interesting, we have found the same phenomenon in explaining. Phenomenon in explaining glacial cycles in the Pleistocene. Glacial cycles have this transition, mid-Pleistocene transition from 40,000 years to 100,000 years. How do you explain that? And it turns out that as you cross the hop verification line, there is a delay. And during that delay, things happen. So it might be applicable here. I don't know. So here I think it's just a very I think it's just a very normal hoff bifurcation. So I don't know whether the phenomenon you describe, whether you need some special ingredient for this delay. Oh, I don't think so. I don't think so. We have seen it in subcritical and supercritical bifurcations. So something to keep in mind. Okay, yeah, think about thoughts on that. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for the discussion. I know there's more. The discussion. I know there's more discussion. How has a question? I think we're going to have to defer that until our later discussion today and just take a short break here for four minutes and come back for Mayoko Nakamaya's time.
