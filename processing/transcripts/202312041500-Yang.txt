So, it's related to the coherent structures and vortex dynamics. So, when we plot our numerical or experimental data, we can see the lots of this kind of structures. But it's challenging to track specific structures and quantify their contributions. And quantify their contributions to the, for example, to the variation of aerodynamics forces and other quantities which could be interesting in engineering applications. So far, there are several structure identification methods based on Olarian approach or Lagrangian approach. But there are some issues in the current. Some issues in the current study of coherent structures or vortex dynamics. But first, there is no consensus on the vortex identification. Maybe even there is no definition of what is vortex. And the other one is, although we can plot lots of pictures, but there is a lack of structure-based predictive models. So in this study, we would like to In this study, we would like to first develop a general flow diagnostic tool, so which we call the vortex surface field. Another, we hope this tool can inspire Lagrangian-based models and simulation methods. So, I studied this for actually over a decade, starting from Decade starting from when I was a graduate student at Caltech. And I joined the Peking University about 10 years ago and I have been working on this. So in this time, there are four parts. So first I will introduce the theory and the numerical methods in the vortex surface field. And then I will report. I will report the flow visualization, modeling, and simulation based on the VSF. So this is actually a very simple idea. So starting from Navier-Stokes equation, we can take the curl and we have the vorticity equation. And the vorticity is a three-dimensional vector field. So if we would like to get some If we would like to get some visualization, we can integrate the vorticity. If we can have the integral line, it's a vortex line, and the integral surface is we call the vortex surface. So each vortex surface consists of vortex lines. So in other words, if we integrate a point on the surface, we can have a vortex line perfectly attached on the surface. So the vortex surface. So, the vortex surface can be a tube-like or sheet-like shapes. So, it has a very interesting property. So, if ideally in invisible flow, so it evolves as a material surface. So, as shown in this movies, so for example, for the early evolution of a vortex ring, it evolves like a It evolves like a rubber band, it's a material surface, like a material surface, and it can be stretched and twisted in Lagrangian view. But this good property breaks down in viscous flows or real flows. So this property is based on Hamho's theorem in ideal flows, but breaks down in viscous flows. So there are some challenges existing in how. Existing in how to construct the vortex surface for any given vorticity field. Another challenge is how to track them in viscous flows. So we developed this method. It's called vortex surface field or short for VSF. It's a Lagrangian-based method. It can be used as a post-processing tool based on given simulation or experimental data. Simulation or experimental data. So the mathematical definition is very simple: vorticity dot grad phi. Phi means the vortex surface field equals zero. So it means that every isosurface of this scalar field is a vortex surface. So we can, it's sort of like a level set method. So we can track this, it can evolve this scalar field and You can evolve this scalar field and take the isosurface of this field, and as we can track a vortex surface field in a flow. Because it's supported by the Highmost theorem or the approximated approximation, so if we extract the isosurface at different times, so the isosurfaces have very strong time hook. Uh, have very strong time coherence as tracking vortex surface. So, if we use the VSL, we can simplify equations for visualization. For example, if we just take the simplest Euler equation like this, if we take the curl, we have vorticity. So, this guy limited non-local pressure. So, the form of equation is simplified. The form of equation is simplified. If we use the VSF, it's reduced to the pure Lagrangian advection equation. So we can use the level sets of this field to track the vortex surface. If we use other vortex criterion, like vortex magnitude and Q criterion, so there are a lot on the right-hand side. So it does not have. So, it does not have the Lagrangian property. For the, there's a critical issue in the viscous flow. So, because the Hampstead theorem does not work in viscous flows. But in some sense, we develop an extension of the Hamble theorem called the virtual Hamho theorem. So, conceptually, we can also track the vortex surface, but not the physical velocity. It's like a virtual velocity. So, there are some modifications, small modifications on the velocity, but based on that, we can still track the vortex surface. So, next, I will talk about how to construct the VSF from a given. The VSF from a given velocity or vorticity field. So it's based on the VSF deviation. So it's cosine of the angle between the scalar gradient and the vorticity vector. So if we look at the spiral-like structure in the flow visualization, actually, it's so this spiral has the gradient in this view, in this direction, and we have. Direction, and we have a voltage in that direction. So it's about the normal. So this criterion corresponds to this picture. So if we have a given velocity field and a random scalar field, so this indicator is about 50%. If we use the vortex identification criterion or passive scalar using Or passive scalar using experiments is about 30%. So the exact VSF is zero. And if we have some kind of approximation, numerical solution, we aim that to reduce the deviation to about 5%. So there are some, we develop different ways to construct the VSF. The first is for some cases, Is for some cases, special cases, we can have the exact VFS solution. For example, Taylor Green initial field, K damp panels, and vortex ring, and the integral ABC flows. We can solve the global first integrals to get the exact VSF. So these surfaces are isosurface of the VSF. So you can see that vortex lines are perfectly attached on the surfaces. Perfectly attached on the surfaces. Another example is we can construct some vortex tubes with complex topology and geometry. So we build a curved coordinate system along the vortex axis. So there are some examples of knotted vortex tubes. And it can be complex. For example, the thickness of the tubes can vary along a center line. Along the center line, and the twisted level can be varied, and so they can vary along the center line and the different ice level sets of the VSF. Here's an extreme example. So based on this method, we can develop a bottom-up approach to construct very complex vorticity of interwined vortex tubes. Interwined vortex tubes. This vortex tube can have arbitrary centerlight topology, different twist, and the variable thickness. So in some sense, we can weave a turbulent field with entangled vortex tubes. So these tubes are also a VSF iso surface. And using this way, we can reproduce. It's very surprising, we can reproduce. We can reproduce some statistical scaling laws in turbulence, like the five-thirds, and some very subtle phenomena like the bottleneck effect in the region between the inertial range and dissipation range. So, my student, Wei Yu Shen, will give a talk for this for details on tomorrow. On tomorrow afternoon. So after upon we have we construct the VSF at a given time we can we can evolve it. So we develop a two-time method for VSF evolution. So it evolved two sub-step. The first prediction step is like solve a normal advection equation. Add vector equation. And if we just solve this like this, like we are doing experiments using dye or hydrogen bubbles. So the initial VSF can deviate from the exact one because of the breakdown of Hamilton theorem. So we also add a correction step to correct the temporary VS solution towards Solution towards the good VSF solution in pseudo-time. So, in this way, we can evolve to see the evolution of vortex surface. So, there's an example interior green flow. So, starting from the blob-like vortex surface, we can show a Lagrangian-like evolution from the initial large-scale structure, and they are flattened and rolled up. And load up at the edge into vortex tubes. And the vortex tubes can be stretched and twisted into small-scale structures. So this process is continuous. We can track them in time. So there are some other techniques to construct the VSF for complex flow field. Although the definition is simple, but actually we found it's not trivial to do this numerically. So we have several methods to accelerate the convergence to find such a numerical solution. So for example, if the flow has a solid boundary or shear flows, we can put the impose the VF constraint at a lateral Constraint at a lateral boundary to, and then evolve this into the whole flow field to accelerate the convergence of the numerical construction. So, this is an example to show the evolution of vortex surfaces in a channel flow. So, for the most challenging case is how to get the VSF in isotropic turbulence. Isotropic turbulence. So we developed an optimization method to balance the VSF deviation and the smoothness. Because if we solve such a pseudo-transport equation, there is no diffusion term. So the gradient of such a scalar can grow persistently in time to develop some singular-like structures. So we add another. So, we add another constraint to balance the accuracy and the smoothness. So, this is the result. So, here we compare the isosurface of the vorticity magnitude, which we usually used in our studies. But you can see that if we plot the actual surface, it's not the real vertex to. The real vortex tubes, because based on the definition, the vortex line should attach on these surfaces. So there are some misalignments. So the deviation is about 30%. So the right one is the isosurface of ESF. So you can see the attachment is very good. So the VSF deviation about 5%. It displays real vortex surfaces. So, we can use this to construct the VSF at more complex cases like the complex domain or unstructured grid calculated from the finite volume methods. So we integrate this module into the open form software so we can show the VSF visualization like a flow past airplane. And we also try this in experimental. also try this in experimental data which can be noisy and under-resolved but this this construction is still still working for for these cases so uh next if we have the methods to construct and evolve the vsf so we can use this tool um apply this to Apply this to various flow cases to visualize the flow and analyze some mechanism of vortex dynamics. So we have applied this method to a series of problems from the isotropic turbulence, transition, moving boundary problems, and Boundary problems and multi-physics coupled flows. So, next, I will pick someone to illustrate the application of the VSF. The first one is the vortex dynamics in isotropic turbulence. It's an ideal case for turbulence community. So, it's an important question is how the scale cascade or energy cascade happens in. Cascade or energy cascade happens in isotropic turbulence. So in textbooks, usually it's depicted as a visual breakdown of based on the isosurface of the vortex magnitude. It's like a division of cells, but it's hard to understand this in terms of a vortex dynamic because it continues in time. So we think it's maybe. We think it's maybe due to the different identification methods. So if we use the isosurface of voltage magnitude, we can see some fragments. But if we use the VSF isosurface, we can visualize a continuous process. Because the physically reasonable dynamics of vortex tubes may be Of vortex tubes, maybe like stretching, twisting, and reconnection. So, here is an example. So, we use the same Telegrain flow at the fully developed turbine stage. So, we visualize a vortex tube in the TG flow and we increase the Reynolds number from 400 to 3000. And you can see that the vortex. And you can see that the vortex tube is gradually becomes more twisted, distorted. But if we look at the isosurface of morticity magnitude, it's like a visual breakdown into lots of small fragments. So the red lines illustrate a Lagrangian process. A Lagrangian process starting from a large-scale vortex surface, they are stretched and twisted by local induction of the vortex lines rather than a breakdown picture. So the second flow case study is about transition. It's how the about the to show the structural evolution from a laminar flow. Evolution from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow. What happens in terms of vortex surfaces? So, in laminar flow, we can consider all the vortex surfaces are planar, plans like this. And during the transition, the planar vortex surface can be rolled up in this way. And we can show this. And we can show this using the flow simulation data. So, from the plan, and there are some disturbance, and then from to form a bulge, and then it grows in time. And it's different from the pure material surface. The vortex surface, the deformation of vortex surface is kind of non-linear. So, the deformation can induce Can induce stronger deformation. So it grows and forms the signature hairpin-like structures. So we can track them for a long time from the planar surface to a train of hairpins, and then it can induce the sinus distortion in the lateral direction. And we can figure out how to induce this from the BL. How to induce this from the Bial Savour law. And finally, it generates a very chaotic one. It's called turbulent spot. And another interesting observation is that we found the deformation visually we can observe in the visualization is closely related to the growth of the skin friction. So because Skin friction. So, because skin friction is very useful in engineering application. So, we find this correlation and it also further inspires to develop some models based on the structure, which will be reported later. And use this, we can create some interesting initial field and find some. Initial field and find some interesting vortex dynamics, which was not easy to be identified using the regular methods. One example is the vortex bursting. So we can construct a vortex ring and this ring in this construction we can set different chiralities like Chiralities, like the two vortex twisted, twisted vortex lines, but their chiralities are opposite at the two halves. So the two twist vortex waves can collide and then burst on the symmetry plane and then to form a very big disc. From a very big disk-like structure. And so, using the VSFS surface, we can clearly identify this phenomenon. But if we use other quantities, sometimes so this part is missing, so we cannot observe this. So, using the VSF, we can construct such a case and observe their. Observe their evolution with some extreme vortex dynamics. There are some other case studies for more complex flows. So it evolves some other maybe physical processes like shock waves or flame or MHD. For MHD. So, this is the example for the it's called Richmir mesh of instability. So, in this case, a shockwave accelerate an interface between two between two fluids with different densities. So, the strong vorticity layers can generate after the shockwave accelerating the interface and triggering. And triggering the instability. So using the VSF visualization, we can elucidate the mechanism for why it forms a so-called spike and bubble structure because we find that there are some effects of the secondary baroclinic morticity. So there are So, there are two sets of vortex rings. So, this one is a set, and there's another set. So, they induce opposite velocities. And due to the secondary bioclinic vorticity, it can decelerate the motion and or accelerate the vortex-ray motion. So the growth rate. Growth rates of spike and bubbles are different to form such a structure. And it can be used in the multi-mode RM instability. And we can use the VASF to show the vortex reconnection time and use this as a typical time and further use in modeling of the turbulent mixing width. Mixing with it will also report it later. And for another example is the vortex-flame interaction. So this is we put a flame propagating in a Telegram vortex. So the flame separates the domain into the unburned region and the burned region. So in the unburned region, So, in the unborn region, the vortex surface involves like in the in that I showed before. So, it can evolve into the vortex tubes or it can have a transition to turbulence. But in the burn region, so the flame can generate lots of heat and then increase the viscosity. So, in such a region, So, in such a region, visually the vortex surface are not stretched. On the opposite, they merge into a bigger one. So, there's no transition. So, using the VSF isosurface, you can clearly see the difference before and after the flame propagation. The final example is about the MHD. So it's a reconnection of two magnetic flux tubes. Because in MHD, there is the Alven theorem, it's analog to the Hamholm theorem. So we can use the same idea applied to MHG flows. So here the isosurface is a magnetic surface, and we can use the And we can use the similar scalar field for showing the magnetic surface. So it's a continuous process to show the reconnection of the two orthogonal flux tubes. And we can identify, very accurately identify the reconnection point. And as a related study is how the magnetic lines can Necklines can be knotted in such a process. And we found an interesting knot cascade in such a process. I guess maybe Renzo will report some opposite approach, opposite way to unknown cascade, but here we found not cascade in MHD flows because of the loss. The Lorentz force to induce the making noise in such a process. Okay, so the second part is as we visualize this interesting results, but for engineering people, they like some models. So we so here we would like to So, here we would like to convert the qualitative observations into some quantitative predictions based on the VSF. So this part is talk about this. The first example is how to use the structure information to predict the growth of skin friction in transition. So, from the visualizations, this visualization in supersonic boundary layer. Visualization in supersonic boundary layer transition. So the scalar field is sort of like a VSF, but with some finite deviation. So you can see the deformation of the patterns here, and the transition is around this region. And inspired by the VSF study, so we first have the So, we first have the flow of data and then we have the characterization to convert the vector field to a scalar field. And then we can seek some robust statistics of such a scalar field and use some correlations to build a predict model. So, here we develop an image-based model just from experimental images and then quantify the And then quantify the inclination angle of the image, of small structures in the image, and to correlate this feature to the growth of skin friction. So there are some ways to model this and based on the theoretical or empirical formulas in the laminar region and turbulent region. Laminar region and turbulent region, and use the angle as the intermittency factor or the as a blending model and to predict the CF, the coefficient of friction. And it has a good performance. And we compare this model just based on the pictures. The pictures and come it agrees, have a good agreement with the DS result of the friction. And the second application is to estimate the drag or thrust of a moving body. It's like we just use the information of shape. Information of shedding vortices in the wake of a biological locomotion or some moving object. It's similar to estimate some information of person, like the height or weight, just from the footprint. So in this modeling, we only use the information in the shedding vertices and to Shedding vortices and to estimate the forces on the moving subject. So, first we use the VSF to for this canonical case as a flapping plate. And we can see the periodic shedding of the vortex surfaces and the vortex lines are on the surfaces. And then And then we just use the information on shedding vertices like this to estimate the process on the plane. So it's based on the impulse theory. It was developed by Professor Jeju Wu, and there are some further developments, for example, by Li Lin Kang, who gave the talk this morning. And there's an important An important issue is how to select the integral domain for this theorem. And we found that the vortex surface is a natural candidate because if we use this domain, it can eliminate some terms in this theorem. And then we can only use this to estimate the force in near and far away. Near and far away. And the third application is to model the turbulence mixing in the RM instability. So in such a modeling approach, we consider the interface with spike and bubble structures as two sets of vortex rings moving in the opposite directions. Opposite directions. So each set can be modeled by a series of vortex rings. So we can reduce the governing equation to simple ODE. And then we have the solution to predict the growth of the spike and the bubbles. And we also validate this. Also, validate this with different experimental and DNS results for the RM instability. Okay, the final part is we use the VSF and to be not use this as a post-processing tool. Processing tool, but we will use this as a simulation method to use it or inspire new numerical methods to simulate flows. And here is some interesting links in as a geometric description of flow dynamics. Actually, it dates back many years ago from Klabsch. He describes the velocity. He describes the velocity, but there are some constraints with zero helicity using multiple, actually, it uses multiple VSFs, like using three scalar fields. And there are some extensions to describe a flow with finite helicity. So the vortex line can be helical. And it's called spherical hop mapping. And in this mapping, a vortex line in A vortex line in R3 can be mapped to a point on S2 sphere. So a vortex tube in R3 can be mapped to a patch on the sphere. Also, it's equivalent to, so the patch area is equal to the voltage stimulate flux. It's very interesting mapping. And using this way, we can also We can also do a quantization. So, in other words, we can use different mathematical representations for the same velocity field. So, here we use the so-called two-component wave function. It can be used in quantum mechanics and to present velocity. Velocity. And from the velocity field, after the hop mapping, we can have the spin vector. And very interesting, we find a very interesting thing is that, so each component of the spin vector is the VSF. And it satisfies this constraint. So for the same velocity. Velocity field: there are four different ways to present the same velocity field using the regular velocity and/or morticity or the wave function. It has two components, or we can consider as a quaternion and the spin vector. And the spin component is a VSF. So, there are some interesting links between the four representations. For different simulation methods or hardware, we can use the most appropriate representation. For example, if we use regular CFD, usually we take velocity, but some people prefer using vorticity in vortex, some vortex methods. In the rest of the talk, we will use another two: the wave function and spin vector. And spin vector. So if we use the wave function of spin vector, so some very complex vortex lines or tubes can be mapped to a very simple, into a very simple region. For example, using the Hop mapping, each vortex line corresponds to a dot on the sphere. So there is a patch covering. So, there is a patch covering some dots. It's simple on the sphere, but it can be mapped into the very complex vortex tubes here. And if you look into these tubes, the vortex line can be attached on the tube. So, it can have very complex global topology and simple local geometry. And based on this feature and the Lagrangian feature. This feature and the Lagrangian feature, they inspire us to develop the VSI-based simulation methods. For example, recently we derive an Euler equation only based on the spin vector rather than the velocity. It's like this. So in the computational grid points, we can discretize the space into many grid points. Into many grid points, and each point has a spin, and there's an effective field. But in physics, it's called effective magnetic field. It's a procession of the spin around the effective field. So there are some interesting links between the ideal flow and the magnetic crystal. And then we can simulate this and for Euler flow. For Euler flows, ideal flows. There are some talks on this morning. So, first, we can construct some new cases. So, here we use the spin vector to make up a case of triphoid vortex knot and use a spin to involve the spin in the direct remarkable simulation. Direct remarkable simulation and to see the evolution of the spin. And we visualize this using a component of spin. It's a vortex surface. So you can see the vortex lines are on the surface. The vortex surface in ideal flow is exactly a material surface. So we can exactly track them in time. And we also derive a non-blow-up criterion based on the Laplacian of the spin. Laplacian of the spin vector. And here we can compare the new criterion. So, this is the gross grosses based on different grid resolutions. This will use the maximum norm of vorticity. This is the maximum norm of Laplacian spin. And for our non-blow-up criterion, here we can see We here we can see double exponential growth of Laplacian spin. And you can see that it's a maybe it's a good criterion because it can show a very much wider time window for the double exponential growth than the growth of maximum vorticity magnitude. History magnitude. So I don't want to jump in the debate of whether or not there is a finite time singularity. But here, this example shows there is no evidence for blow up. So this is a movie simulated by my former student, Shui Ying Shong. After his PhD with me, and he went to Dr. He went to Dartmouth for a postdoc in computer graphics. And he used the VSF-based method used in graphics and to show using the VSF or wave functions to capture the surface, free surface vortices and develop very efficient methods. So such each frame can be rendered on a laptop in several seconds. In several seconds. The final part of this talk is because we it's also very interesting because we find some links between the vortex surface and the Schrodinger equation and it inspires me that why not to use it to do some quantum computing because it's a maybe it's Maybe it's a technique in the future. I understand there are some hypes in the quantum computing, but it could be a game changer. Up to now, there is no effective quantum algorithm to deal with highly non-linear Nevi-Stokes equation. But what we have done is we convert the, we propose this such a Schrodinger equation with two. Schrodinger equation with two component wave numbers. Here we call it hydrodynamic Schrodinger equation. And it corresponds to an equation for a fluid field with a special constitutive relation. We haven't found an exact transformation from a Navier-Stokes equation to Schrodinger equation, but we are working on that. We can transform the We can transform the Euler equation to a Schrodinger equation, but not Navy Stops. But this flow can show some finite vorticity and dissipation. And it can show some tangled vortex tubes in isotropic turbulence. And so, as before, each isosurface of the spin component is a vortex. Is a vortex surface. The good thing is, so this flow can be corresponds to a Schrodinger equation and Hamiltonian system. So it has a unitary operator, so which is very suitable for much more suitable than the original NS equation group of quantum computing. So we So, we developed a method to simulate such a Schrodinger flow. It only evolves the wave function. It's completely different from the existing CIFT methods. So, it's equivalent to a Hamiltonian simulation for the motion of particle with one half spin. So, in the simulation, we just evolve a wave function. Evolve a wave function. If we would like to know the velocity, we need to end the solution and measure it by some measurement. And then the quantum state collapse and we need to rerun the simulation and measure it multiple times to get some statistical estimate of velocity. And we implement this in. In on the quantum simulator, there are some open source packages to do this. Even on a classical computer, we can mimic the quantum computer. So here we use IBM package called Qiskit, and we can do the quantum simulation of 1D flow and 2D 2D flows. It's still We are still working on that. We would like to extend this idea to more complex flows in quantum computing. Okay, so I reported or reviewed lots of things, but all the stuff is related to a very simple idea is VSF. So it's a three-dimensional scanner. Three-dimensional scalar field, its isosurface, it's a vortex surface consisting of many vortex lines. We show some visualization and this visualization can illustrate some mechanisms in flows with essential vertex dynamics, such as turbulence and workflow transition. And its qualifications can review some statistical. Statistical correlations between some geometric quantities and something which are interested in engineering, like the friction, thrust, and growth, turbulence mixing rate. And in recent works, this idea also inspired us to develop some new methods. New method to simulate the flows on the cutting-edge hardwares, like in graphical processor and quantum processor. Okay, so we are still working on that. We would like to use these techniques to more complex flows. So the most of content in the talk is summarized in the review article here. Summarize in the review article here. Okay, so this time there are some lots of people's contribute to this work. So yeah, okay, thank you.
