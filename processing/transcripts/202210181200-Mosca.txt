So, if you can maximize, yes. Can you see it properly? Perfect. It's very good now. So, the screen is yours, Gabriella. Thank you. So, I am Gabriela Mosca. I'm a postdoc in the Plant Morphodynamics Research Unit, which is a German consortium of researchers. And I'm also a postdoc working with Angela Hay, so part of my work is connected to what she presented. But in this talk, I thought to present the research. but in this talk I thought to present a software that I started developing with Richard Smith and we keep developing together so I'm just kind of broadcasting this software and have some questions for you about how to this compares maybe with other level of modelings and how to expand this. Morphodynamics is actually the little child of a traditional software that started with Morphographics, which is way more famous and used for image processes and segmentation. And segmentation. And then Richard Smee decided to add a modeling component to it, which is morphodynamics, which is again a huge framework. And an add-on of it is morpho mechanics, which is the part I developed, which is mostly used to model plant morphogenesis and biomechanics, treating the cell wall as a continuum material, even if we have cellular resolution when we want to. It's conceived to be a user-friendly and interactive framework so that nobody has That nobody has the specific requirement to know how to code to use it. And it's possible, as you can see in this animation, to interact with the meshes and visualize sort of real time the evolution of the deformation of your template. To summarize, this is used to model static equilibrium mechanics problem and growth. I will speak a lot about growth later and about static equilibrium mechanics simulation. Equilibrium mechanics simulation has been used a lot for the quantification of mechanical properties in cell tissues, for example, through indentation experiments or also extensometer experiments, or also just to visualize the state of stresses and strains in the tissue since it's, I think, impossible at the moment to be able to visualize those directly from experiments. And our interest in these quantifications is not just per se, but actually we think that this property We think that these properties and the pattern of strains and stress can also be informative for the ultimate question that I'd like to answer with this software, which is how tissues grow and how cells differentiate and how that then affects tissue morphogenesis in turn. Well, it's highly parallelized on the graphical processor unit, IECUDA, and it handles very realistic templates obtained from confocal microscopy. Thanks to the parallelization, we can handle many cells with a high degree of accuracy. With a high degree of accuracy, but we also handle customized templates like the one I'm showing on the right, which is an idealized embryo of Arabidopsis Talian in the early phases. Here I want to speak mostly about how we model growth, because that's also the part where we have the most things still going on and we are still at time changes. We can model it in a dual way. One is a continuous tissue limit approach and is inspired. limit approach and is inspired, sort of inspired to the work done by Rico Cohen and Richard Skenaway with the Grow Polarizer Framework Toolbox. So we model some tissue not at cellular discretization and the way we use to model grow is by assigning some growth intensities, normally by the diffusion of some so-called morphogenes and then depends what we want to associate those with and also growth directions. In the plane, normally one has two directions. Has two directions, which we call growth parallel and growth perpendicular. And also, those directions can be assigned even locally through pseudo-diffusive fields and we compute their gradients. Here is an example of a leaf. Those are the starting conditions about the two directions of growth. And here is the result. This simulation was done by Sucrit, a student that just joined Myrta's lab for a master project. But we also do growth at the cellular resolution. Here I'm showing an example. Here I'm showing an example where we took the embryo of Arabidopsis Taliana and the cells were inflated with turbo pressure and then we applied a strain-based growth rule, which I will then speak about in a few slides later. This was essential to make sense of the discrepancy between the observed pattern for growth promoting genes, which had a peak at the very, like they had the highest expression. Like they had the highest expression at the peak of this embryo and the relative growth, so the volume increase, the relative volume increase of the cells along this embryo, which were, you know, the peak was expressed at some cells away from the genetic peak expression. But when you combine this expression with a strain-based growth rule, actually you can make sense of the data because the cell surface will also be relevant in contributing to how much cells respond to. To how much cells respond to growth sync. The way we conceptualize growth for both frameworks, this is very general, is basically we describe an initial reference state in the continuous tissue. So each element, maybe in my FEM discretization, has a reference configuration without forces. And when we think that growth is applied, this will tell each portion of my world to grow by some amount. And if those amounts are not uniform and homogeneous, then And homogeneous, then there will be an incompatibility problem, which means that each portion would like to grow a different amount. And the only way to keep all those together is to go from a grown state, which is not existing in the real world, because the only way to have this stress-free is if we would cut the cell wall, to the real configuration attaining in the real world through an elasticity tensor. So we have to combine growth and elasticity. And this is how we conceptualize this. This diagram also tells. This diagram also explains to you already that when you have a non-uniform growth field, it's very likely that residual stresses will emerge. So, besides the presence of thermal pressure that you also don't have normally in the continuous models, for example, through GROW, you can acquire residual stresses. And those are a bit annuisance for us, but also interesting. I'm showing you some examples just to show the features of the software. In this case, I am doing a toy model to try to mimic the growth of the To try to mimic the growth of the corolla, for example, in daphodis, and the rippling that we have at the upper margin. And I'm trying to say with the simulation that you don't need to invoke a genetic patterning, but that could be explained by actually residual stresses that are accumulated on the distal part of the corolla if you have a higher growth field at that part with respect to the basal part. And if you have this progression being not linear, you have this. Not being not linear, you have this development of reports without invoking any special patterning of genes, just through mechanics. Another example that you can explore with the software is the mechanism of imagination. This pertains to animal cells, but I think it's really nice, so I'd like to show you. Basically, in animal cells, we can have tissue and cells that undergo apical constriction. We have these long cells, and on the apical part of the cell, there is a contraction. This contraction Contraction. This contraction on the apical part, if you assume that the cells are incompressible in volume, which is quite realistic assumption, leads the cells to compensate with the bottom part getting larger and getting also longer. And when you do this in a connective tissue, you can have this invasionation process, which has a relevant importance for the morphogenetic events in animal tissues. Okay, this is the idea. So I tried to put this into morpho mechanics. I made this again a time model. I took a sphere. Again, a Thai model. I took a sphere made of solid elements, in this case, not membranes, because I needed to model the thickness of the cells. And this sphere is under the action of a mild turgo pressure, comparable to plant turgo pressure. And I combined this volume metric simulation with a 2D simulation. So I took a portion of this here that you can see in this gray zone, and there I assumed that there's a membrane, a membrane that is overlaid to my volumetric simulation. That membrane undergoes contraction. That membrane undergoes contraction that you can see here from the top. When I show you the animation, you can see that by combining these two, the membrane contraction with the volumetric simulation where cells want to preserve their volume, you can replicate tissue invagination. You will see there's this contraction, this tissue starts to bend, and at a point you will start to appreciate that those cells are becoming longer than the other cells, and you have this bending. Okay, so just about the role of residual stress. So, just about the role of residual stresses in tissues. Now, moving to sorry, okay, just slow transition. Cellularized growth. So, one of the main features of this software is that it's able to model growth at cellular resolution. And we want to do that because we are very interested in how the specific cell geometry and how they are connected in a tissue affects both. Affects both single cell differentiation and the overall morphogenesis of the tissue. So we want to be able to characterize accurately the mechanical state of the cells, as I'm showing in this example. And I'm about to put a rule that would allow us to model also tissue reinforcement. For the moment, it will be stress-based. So I will align cell wall reinforcement in our tissue. In our tissue based on stress cues, but we are open to other ideas like cell geometry or polarization. For now, the point is, I cannot disentangle those. Maybe there's an example in the audio where actually the cell geometry would expect you to have stresses aligned in a different direction than the one you see in this example here, but the overall stresses in the tissue are instead still aligned in the hoop direction. Aligned in the hoop direction, and that seems to point towards stress direction. But anyhow, we want to model cells to be able to capture how they affect growth. And we want to include this effect. It's not yet included in the software. And specifically, to understand the role of cells, we want to understand, we are interested in modeling growth as a strain-based process combined with some morphogenetic factors. So, this is the way mathematically I mostly describe growth when I have cells. Growth when I have cells. It's a strain-based process. So we have a factor that is connected to morphogenetic expression and it's like a multiple factor with respect to the strain that we have on this side. So this will regulate, I would say, south wall extensibility, but I'm open to suggestion. And on the right, we have this strain accumulating the south wall, and we normally assume also this strain has to exceed the treasure. And this is how we model it in the system. And I think at our And I think at our scale, continuous scale, this still works really well to explain what we observe. But it's interesting to discuss then how we can connect these to mesoscopic models. And again, some examples of what we can do, toy models, because I just want to show what the software can do. Here we are simulating a diffusive growth of a conical petal in some epidermal cells. And now we have this protrusion. Now we have this protrusion basically emerging to grow in our cells. And for example, then it becomes interesting to look at what this emergence does to the pattern of stresses in the tissue because it's a rearrangement of the pattern of stresses. Now, moving to one concrete application that I've recently done in collaboration with Angela, and she already spoke about it, we designed this multi-layer tissue model to explain the contractivity that is accumulated. The contractivity that is accumulated in the exocarp layer of cardamomy cells. We came to this idea because we wanted to be able to model with simple and interpretable parameters the different behavior of the cellulose. And so we have two layers that represent, they are dominated by the behavior of cellulose, also incorporate a different orientation. And of the isotropes. And of the isotropic layer that represents the pectin and the amicellus in our vision. The advantage of this method is that we can assign not only different material properties to each layer, which you could do also, you can model in a unique layer fiber dispersion, but we can also assign different growth properties to each layer. We believe, at least for the Cardamin, that this seems to be the case, that the different components of the wall respond differently to growth. So that's why. Differently to growth. So that's why we adopted this method. And it was useful in our case to understand and appreciate the role of fiber tilting in contributing to cardamomic compressibility. And as Angela has already mentioned, also to understand what's the ideal angle for this contractivity process. And we also hypothesize when we do this, when we model the system with cross fibers, the ideal configuration. The ideas: the ideal configuration. We have noticed that the growth as a self-halting mechanism because if the growth is strain-based, actually, the growth tries to reduce the strains accumulating in the cell wall. If you have an isotropic sphere, actually, we just keep growing. But when you have a high anisotropy, this can happen. And this is what we saw in the simulation. You keep growing till a target width. And actually, you don't have at the point any more residual strain to propel growth. Growth. Sorry, I heard something. Is there a question? I'm done on the audio. So maybe your video. Oh, you're having a problem with the audio? Now it's better. Now it's better. Oh, okay. Did you get this? We just have one two-minute call for the. So if you can think of a way of So, to wrap up, we have some questions and are about this multi-layer model. We would like to use this multi-layer model to actually model the aging of the cell wall in the sense of the position of successive subsequent layers in the cell wall. And I'm asking you if you think this multiple cell layer model that I'm proposing is a good way to do that. And how would you do it? Would you have a gradient of stiffness for the different? Would you have a gradient of stiffness for the different layers which are applied? And do you think I need to add layers? You don't hear me. Oh my God. You don't hear me, huh? We do sort of hear you. And I think we get the gist of the questions also. Okay, great. Great. Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you. And I just really making time for a question. Question from the public, Zoom or here? The public, Zoom, or here, do you see anything? No, so I think probably you're going to get more. Ah, yes, here. Thank you for that really super interesting talk. I wanted to ask you if you like proposition why you see the stress pattern that you see in the conical cells, because that's initially I was like, it's quite, you know, surprising. It's quite, you know, surprising. You're asking me if we have experimental evidence for that? Or just offer an explanation of why you see that stress pattern? No, I think it's kind of intuitive because you have a portion of the cell wall that is growing and another portion that is not growing and that it finds itself to be under tension. It's very similar in the sense to what happens when you do cell aballation. So it's actually, I don't think. Um, it's actually, I don't think it's counterintuitive if you think it in continuum mechanics terms. It's um, is the fact that you have a growing portion in contact with a non-growing one and then you have this rearrangement. When you think at the forces that are in at play there between the growing part and the non-growing, it should be quite intuitive. It's not surprising. Good. Thank you. Sorry. Yes. Reski for Pavel. So I was wondering whether you are going to consider the possibility that the new layers, the newest layers that are added to the wall, are not under tension or are in less tension than the old ones. That's exactly, maybe it was not possible to hear me, is exactly what I was asking in terms of how should I do that exactly. That exactly. I'd like to because, yes, that's possible to do. We can set up a gradient of tension from the newly deposited layer if we would do this multi-layer to model the aging of the cell wall. So it would not be three layers, it would be many more. No? Yeah, I'm thinking about that exactly. If it should be, and I would like to see if that will play with, probably cardamine is also a good test case because if you make the wrong hypothesis, you might lose the contract. Wrong hypothesis, you might lose the contractivity. So, yes, exactly. This type of questions: yeah, a gradient in stiffness, like maybe inserted at rest rather than not, or that's what I
