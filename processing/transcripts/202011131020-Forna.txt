So, I'm Alpha. I'm talking about case fatality implications using machine learning today. This is work I did mainly during my PhD, but I'm now at SFU working with Leonid and Max on TB and deep planning prediction of drug resistance. So, this is a work we did where So this is a work we did where we tried to estimate the case fatality ratios for Ebola using a booster regression team machine learning model. So basically the case fatality ratio is the percentage of disease cases dying from the disease. So it's a simple ratio of people who died divided by those who survived and those who actually died. We estimate case fatality issues most times for us to have some idea. Most times for us to have some ideas about the disease and for us to be able to do some form of interventions in a measured and calculated way. So what we did really with the booster regression tree, I think Lenoir has mentioned decision trees. So this is similar machine learning method, which allows us to learn patterns in the data so that we can make predictions for instances, for outcomes that are not available in data sets. Not available in data sets. So, for this, the outcome is survival and death. And so, for some people in the data set, their survival and death outcome were not available. And so, we use this kind of boosted regression three models using covariates like age, country, reporting delay and fever to kind of build a classifier that will allow us to make imputations for cases with missing outcomes. Cases with missing outcomes, and so once we did that, we were able to train a model, just do the traditional things, train a model, validate it, and then get the performance. And then also we are able to make predictions and then calculate the case fatality ratios. And so, one thing we did because the performance of our models were moderate, and so we adjusted our imputation models so that we are. So, that we are able to account for some of the imperfections in our model using the Hogan platin correction method. And so these plots really just shows one of the covariates age. And this is a classical pattern of what you see for ceraphile for Ebola in this case. And where at the extreme ends, people die a bit more, and people in their 20s are less likely to die of. Are less likely to die of Ebola in this case. So, like I've said, this model allows us to see important predictors of case fatality ratios. In our case, things like the distinct of origin, the age of the patient, and also the delay from onset to hospitalization. And so this is just a summary of some of the estimates we had for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia when we made imputations for missing cases. For missing cases. And then there is this next work, really, what we tried to do was to account for the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in case fatality ratios. And so what we did was to look at the residuals from our boosted regression three models and try to see if they this these residuals are spatially autocorrelated and temporally autocorrelated. We saw some spatial autocorrelation but no temporal autocorrelation. No temporal autocorrelation. And we use this spatial autocorrelation to build some very RAM models. And these models allow us to make predictions for case fatality ratios in regions in West Africa, in regions for which estimates we are not reported. And so these are just the variograms using a Geyserian model, which shows a classical pattern of variograms. We are, you see, for each country in See for each country increase in semi-variance, and then it gets constants. It shows some constant, it becomes independent at a particular distance. And so, these are just the clear maps where we are able to make predictions for regions without CFR. So, the conclusion is that we adjusted our CFR estimates by imputing for cases that are missing. We use the geospatial. That are missing. We use the geospatial models, the semi-variograms, to complement machine learning algorithms so that we are able to kind of incorporate some spatial and temporal heterogeneity in our models so that we can explain those spatial and temporal patterns. And then these adjusted CFR estimates and biased CFR maps can be used for feature public responses for Ebola outbreaks. But also, these type of methods can be extrapolated for other epidemiological. Related for other epidemiological analysis and some other research questions in computational biology as well. So, yeah, I want to acknowledge my supervisors for my PhD, my funders, and particularly the WHO who made available to us the West African Ebola Epidemic Data Set. Thank you. Thank you very much, Alpha. Unfortunately, we're going to have to save the questions so David and The questions so David and some others have questions for you, but we'll have to save them for.
