Michael Jompersky from Torpo University will be talking about cold motors, algorithms, randomization, and their memories for two-dimensional maps. Okay, thank you very much. Thanks to the organizers for the take time. So, I can prepare slides explained to an order job, and there's not a lot of space on. Board job, and there's not a lot of space on the board, so it's mostly going to be hand-boated. And that's actually good because I have to tell you right away that I'm a very one-dimensional person, so it's mostly going to be a one-dimensional talk. And also, you'll see that the paramount going to state cannot possibly have anything to do with, say, quadratic annulment. Although the Although the picture that I'll be describing may have something to do with the writing and nomads and may also have something to do with some of the interjectional pictures that Eric showed, which is talk and then open to you. Okay, now one more quick thing. Yeah, so I'll start by drawing you by giving you a handwritten formulation of the theorem. Formulation of the theorem. Then I'll draw essentially one-dimensional lecture, and then we'll extend it to PP and talk about the consequences of that. Right, so I'm going to do a lot of name-dropping of people, some of whom are in the audience. I'm going to get the page from Eric. I'm going to have you away, right? So let me name one of you. Name one of you on AutoCAD. Wait. All right, good. So, first the statement. So the hand-waiting statement sounds like this. One-dimensional thermal rings. Of bounded type could survive small two-dimensional perturbations. Okay, so you see that this is this is a KM type statement, it's local, right? So we start with Linearizable rotational dynamics in 1D, and then we'll take a small decipherment perturbation that's supposed to survive. Now, what do I mean by the survival? If I want to make this more precise, I'm going to say something like this. So, suppose f lambda, where lambda is an n-dimensional complex parameter. Say it sits in the n-dimensional complex disk. Where n as please do is a generic, I'll explain to you what I mean by the term generic in this context in a few minutes, analytic family. Analytic maps such that so you should think of this as taking something like a rational map and embedding this in an a non-like family and parametric in all like family. So at zero I want to have my one-dimensional map. To have my one-dimensional map with a Hermann record. That's the generated theorem with a permanent rate of downloaded pipe. I'm sorry, can I see a shot? I'm sorry, can I see can I see a show of hands? Does anyone not know what bounded type rotation number is? Okay, so that just means you take your rotation number raw, so take its representative in 0, 1, it's irrational, right? And then you expand this into an infinite continuum fraction with positive terms. Such an extension is going to be unique. Such an extension is going to be unique, so in a rational number. And then bounded type here simply means that these numbers are bounded. So that su AI is finite. So that's equivalent to saying that the rotation numbers define them with exponent 2. Right? But that's somehow more important. Right, but it's somehow more informative from the point of view of dynamics. Right, so then there exists a one-dimensional submanifa, one four-dimensional submanifold. So n minus one-dimensional. S in En which passes through zero. Passes through zero such that well, I'm running out of runway here, so such that I don't know, maybe you really cannot see if I'm right there. All right, so then it's I thought I was gonna. That frame in lambda in S F lambda S a Hermann frame with the same rotation of okay? So that's sort of what you would expect from chaos state. Yes? Yes, yeah, these are dissipative, right? These are small ground. These are small perturbations of two-dimensional maps, so they're decided. So, they so you are going to have a cylinder over one-dimensional harmony, right? So, they yes, that's exactly right. So, the tractor, the attractor in that cylinder is going to be a one-dimensional terminal ring, right? It's biomorphically embedded annulus on which you have rotation. Where is the Guffman that defined this in the dev map? Yeah, so I want to be very vague. So these are local. Right, so I don't want to drown you in technicalities, but what I should really be saying is that there exists some choice of a domain, right, some politics, which last. So this is a local statement in some banana analytic maps. But I meant the analytic maps. But I meant the analytic maps themselves are defined on a two-disk or a what dimension are you map? Oh, yeah, so I don't really care, right? So this is this is yeah, so that's an Excel. So there's another dimension that's involved. I'm sorry, I'm being a bit too rushed. We're not saying that these are two-dimensional, right? So to be but it really is irrelevant to, I mean you could Is irrelevant? I mean, you could look at this if it perturbations. I'm just a concrete person. Yeah, no, no, no, no. It's a chat like the transverse dynamics. Do you know like it's attracted to the hurl arena? Is the cohesion in the transverse direction? So transverse to the transverse to the Hermann ring? Yes. So locally just a product, right? So locally just a product because it's specific. Yes. Locally just a product because it's specific, yeah. And globally, I don't know. It's not a global statement. This is all very local. Very one dimension. Okay. Yes. Just one additional question. You s keep saying uh for the disk do you need come and ring across the disk to avoid that in the Avoid that in the sorry, sorry, no. Holodisk is where my map is defined, right? Here it's in the neighborhood of the harmonic. In the neighborhood of the harmonic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just there I asked where these maps are defined. And I said that there is really variant here. There is a choice of a domain of definition for these maps, which is a full disk, which contains the art convert for the one-dimensional map. No, I don't assume anything, right? I don't need to assume anything. So let me actually explain what's going on. Okay, so how about you forget about this for a few moments? Let me handle you through a one-dimensional picture. It's a one-dimensional renormalization picture. This is Normalization factor. This is this this is a joint work of Natasha and Teru. Okay, so yeah, I should say that this this result is not really so much a new result as a new synthesis. So this kind of brings together several different results. The results of the last few years. Okay? So here is a picture that we constructed with the question. Pinter of soul. And I'll explain how this is related to that theorem, but for the moment it's not going to be related at all. So this is a re-normalization. Renormalization for sure for one complex dimensional analytic maps of the angles and by the angles I mean you know you know, just a nanos, right? Like take something like what imaginary part of z is less than delta and then wash and bit by the integers into internal. Right? So my maps go from here to see what's left I announced. Okay, so this renormalization So this renormalization picture is familiar to one-dimensional dynamic system the audience and it should be extremely familiar to Sevilla for instance. So this is a version of cylinder mineralization. That's essentially, but not quite That's essentially, but not quite UKOS. So the construction looks very similar. So here's what we do. Okay, so here is Danny Loose. Alright, so the map. So let's start by a real symmetrical analytic example. Real symmetrical analytic map. Okay, just for simplicity. Let's say it preserves the circle. There is no such requirement. Let's say it preserves the circle. And let's say it has an irrational rotation number. So I have my map f defined in here. The rotation number of f is irrational and And let's say that F is almost but not quite equal to the rigid rotation by the same thing, right? So this is a local statement. So F is approximately equal to the rigid rotation by this F. So then we're going to play the following game. We can take the point here. I always like to take the points. I always like to make a point zero s just because I need to start and then the subject of critical circle maps there is zero s because here it doesn't. It's just a point. And then I look at its first return. So one canonical way of picking the first return here is just taking this continued fraction, truncating it after n terms. And terms, they kind of be convergent. So Pn over Qn, which is just a finite continued fraction with n terms. And then Qn's are closest return times for any point on this order. So in particular, zero, so this would be zero. This is the closest return. There is no iteration between these two which has both. But then the math is almost irritation. Map is almost a rotation. So you can actually extend this to the complex a little bit, right? So you could take a vertical segment, and then the image of this vertical segment is nearly vertical at close sequence. Okay? And the map, so the Q am citrate identifies the left-hand side with the right-hand side. So just truncate this somehow. This somehow on the top and on the bottom, glue the sides, and you are going to get a beam source, I suppose. Post-topological type is a cylinder. So then, what we did, of course, since this cylinder is not infinite, right? So, you see what I'm doing? I'm just, well, I mean, many of you know exactly. Well, I mean, many of you know exactly what I'm doing, but for those who don't, you'll see what I'm doing. Right, I'm doing using the dynamics to just identify this segment with its image and truncate it on top and on the bottom, so I'll get a syllable, which is a fundamental domain for this first iteration. And then you get a choice of the uniformization part. You get a choice of turning this again. Turning this again into a cylinder. And we do it in such a way, so you could make your choice in different ways, and we make the choice in such a way that this uniformizing point that I have here depends analytically on the map. Okay, so I call this F phi F Qn, let's say because it depends really on the Qn center, and this dependence FKM. Fcam to phi fcam is on a lid. Okay, and then I have a new cylinder. On this cylinder, I have a new circle if I pick this thing to be real symmetric, but it was real symmetric before. And on this, I have a new map, right? It's still an olympic, it's maybe not defined on this whole cylinder, but will be defined near the under cylinder. This is near the rotation. Can you tell me again what's the Q? That's uniformizing this fundamental domain to say you've identified it in your mind. Correct, that's correct. Yes. And then in here you have a new map, G. This is a re-normalization of F and it's defined nearly on this whole cylinder on a large portion. And what is it really? I mean it really is pretty much the Qn plus star stitch. Pretty much the Qn plus first iterant. Not quite, right? It's a Qn plus first iterant, but if you do a Qn plus first iterant, then this domain will shift a little this way, and so there'll be a little piece taken out, and you have to iterate it back. So you can't siterate it back and do. This map is perfectly good, it's analytic, and since this is an analytic dependence, you get yourself an analytic operator, which adds on maps. Cooperator, the chats on maps. Okay, any questions so far, Raymond? Understand that this picture is fundamental to understanding the rest of the talk. So, if at this point you're lost, just feel free to play on your phone. Yes, you want us to raise your hand if we're lost. No, no, I only want you to raise your hand if I mention your name. Tell me again. So, this is FQN on one portion and Fn on another portion? What you see? Oh, I mean, if you want to know what this map is, this is an analytic map. This is an honest analytic map. Yeah, and by the way, it does not need to have an invariant circle, right? I just drew the circle here for meaning. Just enough for rich, just enough to know that it's closed there. Uh it's lost derivation. So, what was Rf then? Well, I mean, okay, if you do this on a circle, and this is your zero, and this is your Fn of zero, and you look at the first return of this segment. And it's essentially data at Fkm plus one. The only problem is that Fkn plus one shifts everything a little bit to the left and right way. Hits them a little bit to the left in my patient. Right? So there'll be a little piece that will stick out. So if you map this order by F to n plus 1, then 0 would go into here, which is F to n plus 1 of 0. And the image of the green interval will be this red interval, which is shifted. Now, let's okay, so everything to the left. To the left of this point has returned, and this stuff is taken out. But you need FQN citrus to bring it back. So that's your first return map on this segment. It's piecewise defined. It's FQN plus 1 on this interval, and it's FQN plus 1 plus Qn on that interval. Okay? On that entry. Okay? But once you glue the ends, it's a turnout exercise to see that this glue stinking is there will be no distinction. And in fact, Eric glues out a little bit because we do a chart with some of them. Okay? Does this answer your question? Eric? Yes. Okay, good. Alright, so now, what with Dave and Natasha? Step 4. I'm going to erase it and then I'm going to draw you a vector in a parameter space. So first of all, look, I shouldn't have really erased it, but this is kind of true. It's obvious, right, that if I started with the actual rigid rotation, I'm not going to get a rigid rotation, but it's going to be linear. It's not going to be. It's not going to be the cylinders, it's going to be straight cylinders, right? So if I start with a rigid rotation, I'm going to get a rigid rotation back. So the set of rotations with irrational rotation numbers is invariant under R. Okay, so the theorem is that you have a theorem. That you have the full on picture. So let me attempt to draw your picture in the parameter space. So now we're in the Bonach space of one-dimensional analytic maps of some AOs. Right? So in this space, these are the rotations. In here, we have The set of rotations of Brunetar, let me call it something, so let me say it. Strip B are rigid rotations where theta is intrina. This set is also invariant by minormalization. Now let me say something that is almost true and then I'll make it true for the experience. Make it to the experts in the next slide. So the almost true statement is that this invariant set is actually hyperbolic with one-dimensional unstable direction. So in particular, it has a one-dimensional one stable foliation with analytic methods. So B is hyperbolic with one dimensional. One-dimensional unstable. Or you must call it 4R, yeah, yeah, of course. 4R. Second, we are just acts on maps of the animals, right? So we are in the Banach space of maps of an intervals of some kind. So this is hyperbolic. So this is hyperbolic. It has, we know what the extended direction is because on the partition numbers themselves, the minimization axis and iterate of the Gauss number. So nth iterate by the tax, that n. Right? So on this axis, I have the nth iterative of the Gauss map. So this is. I should probably write it back. So raw. Raw of R of F is G M of raw of F. Where G is the Gauss number. So G of X is the fraction of the part of the Gaussian. So it's very expanded in the vertical. Now everything else is contracted. We have a quidimension one, stable for H. And moreover, we can characterize the leaves of this stable foliage. So F is in the stable leaf of a rigid rotation if and only if it's conformally conjugate. So F belongs to the local stable mass. Local stable manifold of R theta if and only if F is conformally quantitative or theta. In some negative say in silica alpha So So, all right, so this in particular, this gives you a very strong form of KAM for small perturbations of rotations, right? So, it tells you that if you have a generic family of perturbations of rigid rotation, say, for instance, for the book, book. I mean, the only I mean the only genericity that I want is that the derivative in this direction is not zero. So it's actually transverse to this Fourier. Then you'll see that it will have a four-dimension one intersection with each of these leaves. So this is a slightly strengthened version of a theorem of Resclaire. Rislair. So this implies the resclair state. Which is this KM statement. Okay, so where did I lie? Well, I lied when I said that this is hyperbolic. This is not uniformly hyperbolic, but not true enough. So in fact, you have uniform hyperbolicity. To have uniform hyperbolicity in the definition of the Joplos-Brona function or the Brona function itself, I need to get a convergence rate, right? So this is true on the subset of Bruno numbers of which the there's an upper bound, uniform upper bound of the Question. If in your theorem that the map user, you work in the space of mapped apps which I'm sure we have in our engineers? No, no, no. There is no invariance of the seniorists at all. They're just defined by the same apps. Yeah, yeah. They just call from the senior list, would you? Yeah, yeah, so when you're taking the delta, right, so you you know an altem. Yeah, so alright, so now those of you who like the sadia of the webinar don't really know what I'm going to say next. So the the the point of of this theorem is that this picture could be extended to Extend them to two-dimensional maps, right? Which are small perturbations of rotations. One can extend this hyperbolic torsion picture to a larger Bonach minimum. Which I should prove this okay. So So, I'm going to talk a little bit, basically, going to wave my hands through how I can extend this for another 10 minutes or so. But first, let me see if there are any other questions at this stage. Okay. Yes. So, um Yeah. So when you say that this Herman ring survives, we're going to address possible issues with being perturbed. The Herman ring fills in. Can you guys see that? Yeah, so yeah, so I'm going to wave my hands through that as well. So, but first, let me say that, as I said, it's a bit of a synthesis. So this has been done before in a different context, in the context of critical strip controls. Of critical stroke on this. So, this was done in the context of maps with a critical point. So, on the circle, for instance, if you look at the BL symmetric case, the porti is not going to be rotations. So, it's going to be analytic maps with, say, cubic critical points. And in this case, this This was done both in the real symmetric case and in the non-real symmetric case. So, for the real symmetric case, oh, Dennis Kaidashov is not here. Okay, probably, okay, so that was a joint also. And for the non-symmetric case, so this is for finding signal discs in, say, this. In, say, specific ethanol maps, and that was also a series of joint words. But Danius, who again is not here. Remos is not here. Reluca, could you wave Remus? John Book, you can wave. Good. So, right, so in a sense, the recipe is there, right? So, in a sense, but it's not quite true as It's not quite true, as the experts will see, you know. Right, so in particular, one thing that we did, for instance, with Dennis and Remos, we showed that bold mean signal disks survive in the quadrature. In the quadratic, and all family with the boundary. So the boundary itself is a nice dorn part. Okay, but before I tell you how to extend this to 2D, let me actually explain why extended this to 2D would do the trick. I mean, how being. So here I told you that we're proved, we can. That we proved, we characterized the points in the stable manifolds as elements of conjugacy classes. So, in particular, of course, if you have a one-dimensional map with a Kerman ring, then it is the corresponding stable name. But the method that we used in 1D is not going to be applicable. 1D is not going to be applicable to 2D. Instead, what I'm doing in 2D is older and goes back to work of Hermann and Yokos and so on. It's part of a brute force exercise. Let's see how construct and... So let's say we have a point in one of these stable manifolds, right? So this is a map. Let's say one dimensional. So let's see how being here allows us to construct a conformal conjugate. I can find more colleges. I guess it's sort of your closest college. And the way I have to sacrifice something, I'm going to sacrifice the statement to square the only other true. So I'm going to go to the next step. Right, so um I used green, right, to draw that cell. So let's say we have a map like that, but it's in the stable manifold. So in particular, this renormalization procedure can be performed infinitely many times, right? It's infinitely normalizable. And every time we normalize, you're going to get closer and closer to rotation. So what's going to happen is the colon Is the form that you will have online we can see black very clearly but what at least I cannot see oh you're watching my talk online and try to make sure people are watching your talk online. It's getting double the experience Anybody else's question about this? Okay, so look. So we have this, oops, it's not good. So we have this sort of fundamental strip. It will go almost to the ends, but not quite. Right? And then inside of this, there'll be another. And inside of this, there'll be another one which corresponds to the next genomalization, and then another one, and so on. So, what one can do is honor all these, right, using the dynamics of the map. So, this has a pre-image, so on, and this has pre-images, and this. So, what you get is a pilot of your Of your cylinder, and then you can use this tile to construct approximate conjugacies, right? Because at least up to some internet, this tile gives the same combinatorial tiling for this as the rigid rotation. So if you just, you know, if you just take any map that identifies these. One of these pieces with rotation, so you can just use that pi, and then unroll it, you're going to get a normal function. And then the gist of Jopla's theorem, for instance, was to show that for Bruno numbers, assuming your KL is tall enough to begin with, we're not going to run out of the role, and we're going to end up with some ALS. So this procedure. So this procedure survives obviously small two-dimensional perturbations. Except now these are not going to be one-dimensional domains. These are going to be holidays. They're going to be like little built-in bricks. But get longer and longer and thinner and thinner. Right, and this will allow you to construct this function. Drop this function. So that's why in 2D being on one of these results in having a rotation. Okay. Now, I'm really almost out of time. So let me just, you know, let me talk to the experts for like three minutes and let me tell you a little bit about how to extend this to 2D. You see, essentially nothing I told you here theoretically extends the two dimension. directly extends the two dimensions. The problem is that this renormalization procedure uses a conformal uniformization of an annualism. That's purely one-dimensional metric. So this one-dimensional metric doesn't work. So what needs a slightly different approach? So let me just briefly give you the steps of the approach. So, the first thing, just for convenience, so I can actually define the appropriate bonus basis of 2D. I'm going to lift this to the universal cover so that instead of talking about maps of the cylinder, I'm going to talk about the maps that commute to the UD transition. And so I'm going to define alpha of z, which is z equals. Of z, which is z equals one, and I'm going to look at the set of pairs alpha beta such that alpha is alpha and beta and its alpha. Of course, it's the same as saying the map of the cylinder, right? In the indicator, but that's something that you can actually record. The second thing is The second thing is that infinite commutation conditions are generally horrible to work with because it has an infinite dimension. So when one tries to look at unaccompanied structure, this is usually not your friend. So these are all these normalized and written pairs. And what I really want to work with are normalized almost commutative tips where this cognitator, so the difference between the two is not zero, but it's very small. Let's say it's very small in a neighborhood of zero. So beta. beta alpha minus alpha beta it's all small say a z square but it would be sufficient okay this is a nice condition because it's fine at four dimension it's fine at four dimension in for one dimensional map so it easily defines a finite manifold one accent manifold and it's nice to work with an infinite uh sorry in uh for for Sorry, for two-dimensional maps, because well, because it's still a finite point-dimensional equations. I'm sorry? You mean meter law of the squared? Little law of z squared. That's what I mean what I'm literally. What is the two-dimensional? I'm sure. Yeah, I haven't defined it. Okay, yeah, I haven't defined it. I'm still on Monday, so I'm redoing this in. Doing this in such a way that I can actually extend it to 2D without having to use the uniformization match. Right? So the next thing is a little theorem that R is commutation and proven. So somehow this has been missed in the literature, even though it's almost ridiculously. It's almost ridiculously easy to drop. So I'm not going to give you the proof right now for this lack of time, but the point is that near rotations at least, application of R exponentially decreases the computation. So you still, this condition is invariant, but if you have a bound here, then this bound And this bound decreases exponentially in the norm. Now there is a subtlety here because almost commutant doesn't necessarily mean nearly commuting. There are well-known counter examples from linear maps. Matrices, but almost commutant, not nearly commutative. Right? How many data is small? But here I can use a trick of POSIC informal surgery to prove that Holmes commutation is near Hambi. So expanding to this much larger space doesn't destroy this hyperbolic picture. We have added some dimensions, I mean we've added infinitely many, but all of them are contracted. All of them are contractable. Okay, so this is a cost-free extension. So the next extension is extension to the simulative mass, and this really goes in exactly the same vein as we did with the paneus-Greikershev in with the real symmetric and non-real symmetric case. And again, for that extension of renormalization, again, you add infinite domain. Again, you add infinitely many dimensions, but all of them are contract, and in fact, in that case, even better. In that case, all of them correspond to the eigenvalue is zero. Okay, so that is so these are the steps, right? I'm sorry, this is really too sketchy, but the experts in the audience annoy them, so that's always a good sign. Right, and then of course. Right, and then of course, once this can be extended to QP, then this version of the cam theory works. Okay, so now I have some remarks. So a couple of remarks. So remark number one, this is answering your question. Can this be extended? I'll reformulate the question. So can two renormalization theories be merged? So the renormalization. The merge, so the minimalization theory that we have for boundaries of single discs and nice Hermann rings, and this, which is for the interiors. So, we are going to get the Hermann ring with the boundary, again, Sequel disc with the boundary, to say for quadratic enough. The answer is yes, but I haven't, you know, the margins are too narrow. I haven't certainly delved, but right, so this is, this is written, that is not. So this is written, that is not, but that requires an additional synthesis of the two theories. So this was sort of my talk, the gist of my talk in real, even though I talked about something entirely different. It's connecting the horseshoes. So you can see the two horseshoes connected in this way. And the second thing is a remark. I would like to make this remark. Like to make this remark for Eric. So, okay, so this is a local statement. Ah, zero minutes? Okay, so you know what? So here's an idea. So I'm going to stop, you're going to clap, and then Eric is going to ask me how does this help us to find or to verify that computer images of permit ring Images of thermography are actually harmonic. Yeah? Okay, some of the time.
