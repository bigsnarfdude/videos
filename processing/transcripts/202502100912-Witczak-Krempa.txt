Okay, perfect. Yeah, so welcome everybody. Good morning. I think we just start right with my first talk by doing with my grandpa about entanglement, multi-party and so in liquids and measurement-induced transitions. So I changed the the title, I commuted to the ones that are more fun. So thanks to the organizers for making this workshop happen. It's uh it's a pleasure to be here in Van. It's a pleasure to be here in Ivano. Beautiful. Thanks for coming this early morning. And also, feel free to interrupt the talk. I don't have any donation to finish everything. So yeah. Okay, so let's get started. The outline is as follows. I'll follow mainly three big points. So I'll first introduce the basics of multi-party entanglement. The basics of multi-party entanglement. We all know bipartite entanglement, but perhaps a bit less than multipartite version. And then I'll discuss the structure of multi-party entanglement in canonical models of many body physics, namely the quantum Ising model, including the exactly solvable 1D case. But I'll also show here results on 2D and 3D, which are not solvable, but we have large-scale results. That's a work. That's a warm-up because the real meat will be more exotic systems than Ising models. I mean, these are ferromagnetic, so non-frustrated. But then we'll turn to frustrated spin models, which host quantum spin liquids. And I'll be focusing on two dimensions, where you have anions and things like that going on. And we'll see as a main punchline that entanglement in these phases is organized in a loop structure. Loop structure, which to me was a surprise when I first looked into it, but I'll show you the results. It's quite interesting and universal. This is in equilibrium, so Gibbs state, high temperature. But then we'll move very strongly out of equilibrium. I'll be looking at these measurement-induced dynamical phase transitions in hybrid circuits. I'll be focusing in one dimension. I'll be focusing in one dimension, and then we'll look at how entanglement is organized at the critical point, which is this non-unitary CFT. And we'll see that something very novel compared to equilibrium CFT happens to entanglement in these very strongly driven systems. Okay, so multi-party entanglement in less than two slides. So So here's my third example. It's a three-qubit or three-spin one-half cat state, or GHZ. A and B are not 0 or 1. And so this state is multi-party entangled. And one simple way of seeing it is that if you measure spin one to be, say, zero, then you collapse the other two spins to also be zero. So this measurement makes a violent impact on the other parties. Impact on the other parties for the wave function. So it's entangled. And in fact, the entanglement, as we say, is genuine three-party. So it genuinely involves all three spins in the entanglement. I'll mathematically define what we mean by genuine. It's very important. This is the golden form of entanglement. Any quantum algorithm that fully uses the quantum funnelness of the state has to The state has to exploit the genuine entanglement between the parties or qubits. And this cat state is also interesting in a sense that if you look at any pair of qubits, say these two, and you ask, are they entangled? The answer is no. They share no entanglement. And that's true of any pair taken separately. So the entanglement is really collectively encoded in this trio. So that's a bit counterintuitive. So that's a bit counterintuitive, but possible in quantum again. So let's define, mathematically speaking, what is genuine multi-party entanglement. And I'll do the case for three parties, A1, A2, A3. You can generalize the K parties naturally. So general entanglement means the state is not biseparable. It's defined by what it's not. And a biseparable state, or density matrix, With density matrix. In this talk, I'll be dealing with mixed states, so the most general quantum state, a system in contact with its environment. So a bicepable state is a classical mixture, so the T's are probability T's, of states that have entanglement but not among all the three parties. So this first term is a tensor product, so product state between subsystem one and subsystem. System 1 and subsystem 2, 3, which can be entangled, but not with system 1 in this product state. Then you add mix data combination, so party number 2 is not entangled with 1, 3, which has entanglement, be very strong, like with singlet, for example. And R, again, are probabilities. And finally, the last term that's allowed is product state between 3 and then the group 1, 2. And then the group went to okay. So it's a classical mixture of by of two separable things, two a dash separable. So this is entangled generically, this density matrix. If you look at it, it looks like entangled generic. So it's quite hard actually to show that this is the decomposition behind it. So we'll be using some measures of genuine entanglement to diagnose when a state is not of this simple. State is not of this simple form. But this is entangled, but not genuinely between all parties. So, quantifying GME, GME will be the acronym for genuine multi-party entanglement, is actually challenging in case some of you tried, even for three qubits. Because it requires, as far as I know, in every single proper measure, an optimization over a large parameter space. Over a large parameter space, the space dimension grows with the number of parties involved exponentially. So there's a wall of complexity. And as far as I know, someone can correct me, this can be done robustly and generically for about six qubits. But if you go much more beyond that, you can't do it generically unless your states have special structure, like symmetry. I think I could do eight on my one terabyte of RAM server, but it's getting very But it's getting very, very costly. So there's a very interesting bottleneck of trying to extract information, even for a given state that's exact. If you give me the wave function, it's hard to extract this information. Okay, so let's do the warm-up to understand multi-party entanglement in a class of systems that we all know and love, namely Ising models. And I found just this morning looking at an archive number that someone wrote a snippet in our work. A snippet of our work. This is a loop magnifying glass in English, because we're going to be looking at sub-regions of the entire system that are microscopic. So two, three, four spins in a lattice of thousands of sites. So we call that entanglement microscopy. Not new from us, but we're pushing in that direction because it's very rich and Direction because it's very rich and you can't really quantify entanglement for large sub-regions, as I said. So, quantumizing model in one, two, and three dimensions is given by this Hamiltonian nearest neighbor ferro interaction. H is the transverse field along x. When h is small, you have a ferromagnet, which continues to breaks the spin-flip symmetry. And you go into the paramagnet at large h. When h is infinite, you get a product state polarized along the x-direction. The x-direction. Now, we all know that the critical point is the best point to look. So, in one dimension, it's exactly solvable. For the unsagger solution, it's at one, the critical point. The CFT is dual to a free Majorana fermion with central charge one-half. In two dimensions, it's not solvable. The critical point has been located to be about 3.04 and is described by a very rich CFT in 2 plus 1 dimensions. Very rich CFT in two plus one dimensions, binamo and Wilson-Fisher Z2 CFT, which we know a lot about from Bootstrap, but it's all numerical because this theory is not solvable. And in 3D, the theory is also not solvable, but it's almost solvable because it's almost a free Klein-Gordon boson. So it's the limit of Gaussian, if you did it beyond three-dimensions, the theory is given by free bosons. The theory is given by free bosons, but in 3D, it's the marginal case. So you have some logarithms that are around, but you still get this space transition. And so we'll look at entanglement as you sweep H in these three dimensions, and we'll be interested in what happens near the Galaxy. You said the exact solution by Olzager. I think it should be a 2D total neutral buttons, right? The 2D classical these quantum easily. No, the this quantum easy one. Yeah, but okay, I mean I I consider the two D solution as solving the one D, but indeed one can or pretty, I mean the paper. So as far as I know, this is the reference. I mean it's historical, but let's talk about that later. So here I'm going to show results in 1D in blue. And you can forget about the Monte Carlo. And you can forget about the Monte Carlo, because the exact solution is the solid line. In 2D is the red, and in 3D is the yellow-orange. And this quantity, I'm not going to define, I2 is a measure of genuine multi-party entanglement between three adjacent spins on your lattice. It's defined on a doubled Hilbert space, and you have to optimize over product states on these three spins. The expression is not so enlightening. The expression is not so enlightening, but it's a measure that requires optimization. We have done that. And here I'm normalizing H by H C. So criticality is this solid line. And you see 1D is the winner. 1D has by far the strongest entanglement between adjacent sites. By monogamy, it's not surprising that this decreases as you increase dimensions because these three spins have many more neighbors in three D than in one D. Neighbors in 3D than in 1D. So they have to share their bandwidth. Basical entanglement is monogamous, so this is reasonable. It's nearly maximal at criticality, although it's not. When indeed this is exact, so the maximum occurs on the paramagnet. No problem there. And one simple point is that entanglement is present for all h values between these three neighboring spins. We did the same for four neighboring spins. We did the same for four neighboring spins in a square plaquette, or just four in a line, and it's also present as you see on H. It has a very similar structure. So, this one E exact? Is that a some of the field? It is, yeah. So, infinite chain, and you take an adjacent route spins. You can look at the divergence. So, if you take derivatives here, it's singular. So, this detects the phase transition. Not so surprising, and it won't be a point of interest here. Point of interest here, but if you wish, you can ask me about it. So, entanglement is present of this genuine kind, even as you look at nearest neighbors. So that's rather generic. Now you can ask a question, okay, think about your Ising model in 1D or 2D and separate one of the three spins from the other two. In 2D, this looks like this. So the three spins, for example, these two are adjacent, but this one is not. It's diagonal away. The genuine The genuine entanglement disappears in this partition. So, entanglement is so short-range that if you just move one spin away, you destroy it. And this actually can be understood much more broadly from what we call a fate of entanglement argument, which relies on the convexity of the set of separable states. Separable states are states without any entanglement. And that's where. And that's where the state of infinite separation between the qubit lives. It lives in this sep. And you can argue that as you separate the parties, eventually you'll enter sep, and there's a point at which you enter at the seven death of all from those entanglement. And this happens very fast in the IC model. So does it happen for all temperatures in magnetic fields? Yeah, so this uh this is at criticality. But if you go away, it's even faster. And temperature just kills it. Like Gibbs states just destroys entanglement very fast. Unless you're in a gapped phase at large fields. Then you have a gap to overcome a temperature, so it's more resilient temperature. But the range. Temperature, but the range is scaled by the field, right? Because the transverse field makes the state very local. The paramagnons cannot propagate, they have a large gap. So this is true at criticality in the CFT, in the CFT in 2D even, which is this non-solvable chaotic CFT. And in fact, this argument makes it clear it's true in general. Take any Gibbs state of a local Hamiltonian. Entanglement between small sub-regions compared to the systems. Sub-regions compared to the system size will vanish very fast with separation. And so we say that entanglement in equilibrium is short-ranged. This includes this genuine kind, but all kinds. So entanglement at large separations in equilibrium is very difficult. And I challenge you to give you an example where this happens. Well, I'll see how they baited out of equilibrium. Yeah, I don't think I think I fully understand what function will be the things like your previous picture. It's a measure of genuine multi-party tangling between three spoons. The expression, as I said, is a bit complicated. I can show you later. Okay. I just find it hard to visualize because I used to think about the interval between regions. Yeah, this is three regions. Three regions. One, two, and three. So three, and each region is a spin. Exactly. Exactly. It's a minimal three points. Exactly. And so when you put a cross in there, these are three specific spins beans large systems. Three adjacent spins, three neighbors. But any somehow than you average? No, it's any because the system is uniform inner translations. It's the Ising model. Yeah, but it's finite, right? It's 24 star. It's finite, but the Netaurus. Alright, so it's really. And 1D is the infinite system. Exact solution. System, exact solution 1D is exact, infinite system, but it's it's tori. In the Monte Carlo, we use square and cubic that is tori to avoid this non-uniformity. Yeah, because each trio is the same. And these are large lattices, I mean 24 by 24 in 2D. Yay! So it's like infinite systems, of course. In 3D, I mean, okay, 6x6x6, it's less spin. By six by six. It's less big, but it's at the limit of what people can do with quantum garland. Yeah, it's perfect. And you would height was. About, I forget if it's one half or one, but it's order one. Yeah, so the values are not that. So Isaac model is rather simple and interesting to some extent, equilibrium. Equilibrium, at least. So let's talk about spin liquids. And this is collaboration with Eric Sorenson in a room and other people. Yeah. Let's look into what spin liquids have to hide compared to unfrustrated models like Geising model. So a spin liquid, for those that don't work on that, is a system where frustration, usually geometrical, destroys conventional order and gives rise to fractionalized excitations. In mathematical terms, In mathematical terms, the effective description is a gauge theory of deconfined excitations. In two dimensions, you have this very nice braid algebra, so you can have anions in these 2D spin liquids. And we'll see phases with anions in the talk. And what people have realized is that entanglement is actually an order parameter for these spin liquids. Because these don't have any conventional order. Have any conventional order. So Kitav and Preskel and Mike Levin and Chaiban Wen realized that you could use bipartite von Neumann entropies, a linear combination called the tripartite mutual information, I3, the script I3. This gives minus log of the total quantum dimension of the TQFT, or the unimodular tensor category underlying the logical spin on the clip. So if it's a trivial phase, then this is zero on the right-hand side. If it's non-zero, you have anions or spectrum, and it's a non-trivial paramagnet. It's not protected by symmetry, it's just a robust feature that is very hard to remove. But that's bipartite entanglement, and okay, it gives you this quantum dimension, this total quantum dimension. That's very good. But of course, entanglement has this complexity. Entanglement has this complexity of having this, you know, two-party, three-party, four-party, and so forth. And the question is, what happens for those types of entanglement? And instead of doing just a sort of general discussion, let me start with an example, because this example has an exact solution at some point in parameter space. It's the Kitav-Hanikom model, nearest neighbor exchange. I'm going to take the antifermagnetic model, which has this isotropic form. Which has this isotropic form, so XX on blue bonds, YY on green bonds, and ZZ on red bonds. And we're going to add this transverse field, like in the Ising model, because that's where things become really interesting and open questions remain in the field, literally and the pun intended. When H is zero, though, this model, as Kitai have shown, was exactly solvable. You can map it exactly to a Gaussian system of Marana Freedom. A Gaussian system of Murana fermions, and you find that there's a gapless Murana Dirac one. So it's a gapless spin liquid. So very interesting. Very interesting. Then Kitayev said, okay, but let's turn on a finite H to gap these Murana fermions. And this induces a finite churn number in the lowest band here, lowest occupied band. And so it's topologically non-trivial. And this churn band leads to a non-abelian. Leads to a non-abelian quantum spin record. Non-abelian meaning that the fusion of these anions is non-abelian. Fuse two anions and get the vacuum or something else. So the tensor category is more interesting than what you would have in a tutorial code, for example. And this can be used for universal quantum computation. You can apply gates in a ground space. You think it's pretty good. Simple question. It's only complex. It's two-dimensional quantum. So only convectance is two-dimensional, but it's a one-one one dimension. One one just means x, y, z. People use this to denote this. It's h dot s with h equal to 111 times a number. So in in in real materials, there are a number of materials that supposedly close to this, it's perpendicular, it's the direction that's perpendicular to the honeycomb. Perpendicular to the honeycomb linear. So it's straight out of the real materials, it's layered and it's complicated and there's no spin liquid probably. But in this model, which is purely 2D, that's what it means. I asked because the 111 terminology refers to letters. People use this convention. I just borrowed that. I didn't want to. Want to up so the phase diagram, okay? So H is zero, you have this gapless spin liquid, then you have this non-abelian quantum spin liquid. It's a gap phase, so it's stable for a finite range, and we don't know when it becomes unstable. There's a middle phase that people have been debating. People propose a very exotic spin-liquid with a finite frame surface. So that's very exotic, very gapless, very entangled, but it's still open. And at large age, of course, those are paramagnetics. Use a paramagnet. It has them. We're going to do, well, Eric Sorensen and Andreas Loughley did a very large exact analysis on a 32-site cluster, which is very symmetric, has a full symmetric group of the infinite lattice. So that's very nice and very difficult. I can only do 24 of this machine, or maybe 26. So this is for the fourth. Is through the fourth to some extent, and we sweep along h. And we're going to look at this genuine multi-party entanglement as a function of h. And now I'm going to use a different quantity, not this I2, but a different measure called the genuine multi-party negativity. Again, I won't write the expression because it requires optimization of our witnesses. But this, like negativity, exploits the partial transpose of a state. The partial transpose of the state of the state of State. The partial transpose is a very powerful criterion to detect bipartite entanglement, and this can be lifted to multi-party entanglement. Sorry for the reference, it's not here. But one very important point is that evaluating this quantity, we can exploit the full power of semi-definite programming. So for those of you who know algorithmic mathematics, this type of programming is guaranteed to converge to a solution, the right parameters. So it's very robust. So, it's very robust, explaining the semi-definiteness of the underlying problem. So, it's very robust, contrary to the I2, which requires optimization that's not SDP. Okay, so let's start with the simplest sub-region, two neighboring sites in the Katav model. Okay, this is two neighboring sites adjacent. I'm going to tune H. And I was doing this on the plane from New York six months ago, and I'm like, okay, that'll be entangled. Ago, and I'm like, okay, and the entanglement surely at many small values, but I'm like, no, there's no entanglement here, not here, not here, not here, not here. And you just get it eventually at around 0.35. There's just no entanglement for a huge range of H values. So I was like, okay, I mean, the flight was an hour, I had time. I looked at the adjacent three sites. I'm like, okay, three sites. I mean, this will have something. It's more collective. Let's see. Let's see. That's okay. 0, 0, 0, 0. Turns on even later at 0.4. This is very unlike the Ising model. Ising model, for all age values, these two entanglements are present. And that's true for any model of quantum mini-body physics that's generic. You don't expect this to vanish. So something weird is going on. So then, later. So then later on we looked at bigger subrations. This is 32 site E D. All E D less than 32 sites show the same. And the point at zero is exact infinite lattice. Mathematically exact infinite lattice. So this is not an artifact of size. Not an artifact of size. This is a feature of spinal points. The fork, it's a much bigger region. Six spins, and let's look at three-party entanglement of six spins. Surely this will be entangled then. How could it not? Well, no, it's not. It's zero. Until you enter in this mysterious phase, then becomes non-zero and then sort of picks up as a jump like that. And then the paramagnet eventually bends down to zero. Magnet eventually bends down to zero at infinity. But that's still very curious. And then we can look at the same region, but let's look at six-party entanglement between all the six spins in the sub-region. And that's even zero longer. So that's when I realized that something special is going on. Just a question, um so the on the bottom is bipartite tank of it? Bottom is bipartite entanglement? For the two spins. Yeah. So each party is represented by a block of a color. So this is January tripartite, this is bipartite. Okay. I was just kind of wondering, because you said you figured that out on the plane, but was it known before that by other people? Like, for example, for the bipartite? Yeah, for two spins, I think our references, I. Certainly at zero. Yeah. Okay. But at Yeah. Okay. But that's less interesting. Like this, like, you don't even need to show. It's not multi-parted, but it's a good to the tree. And then we looked at a loop. So just run a hexagon, the most natural closed region, closed cycle on a honeycomb lattice, then it's non-zero. And it's the strongest and it's been liquid. It's very hard to beat that value, in fact, even on equilibrium. In fact, even on equilibrium. And this is, the blue one is for the six spins divided in three parties, ABC. This is an ABCDEFG in six parts. And so it's strong here, has this minimum here, and then has this, this seems like a phase transition, a continuous phase transition. Jump and then falls back again. And so then I was like, okay, I mean, that's interesting. So then I was like, okay, I mean, that's interesting. Look at other sub-regions. And then we look at other models. We look at the Kagome-Heisenberg model, one of the most important open questions in quantum many body Hamiltonians. J1, J2 model. I have data, but I'm not showing you because I don't have time. We looked at the RVB, exact wave function on a Kagomi lattice. We looked at string net wave functions built from tensor fusion categories, for example, for double semion. For example, for double semion. And the same conclusion for all these different spin liquids came is that the genuine multi-party entanglement in quantum spin liquids is loop-like. Nothing less than loops. Never. And that's distinct from conventional matter like the Ising model, which we just saw before. There you can have non-loop-like entanglement, like the three sites and the square lattice, but then also, of course, you have loop-like. But then, also, of course, you have loop-like. But in the spin liquid, this red you sort of like remove, and everything becomes this look-like. Why is that? That's another talk. But I can say briefly that in equilibrium, you know, these are gauge theories, right? And so these gauge theories, excitations are Wilson loops. And they close in themselves because there's no matter in the ground state. There are no excitations. So this loopiness is quite natural. So, this loopiness is quite natural also from this structure of excitations in these phases. So, are there 1D spin liquids? No, because there's no anion. So, in my definition, there's no 1D spin liquid. I mean, we can talk about, but yeah, yeah. So, yeah. We didn't look at, but frustration will tend to destroy the non-loopy entanglement. But it's a very good question because you can look at. Because you can look at the first edited 1D models, so like with ladders where you have loops. Because if it's only a chain, loops be defined, you can still look at entanglement. But if you have a ladder, then you have loops, and you can look at the role of frustration. And I haven't looked. It's a very good question. I'd be curious to know. Depends how you define it, but I can believe that some people call it like that, even though I don't. But probably this term is used by me. I think Anderson, the triangular lattice. Yeah, again, it's a historical question. Okay, so on equilibrium, how much time is it you're done with the loops? Uh yeah, but how much is uh it's about sort of uh ten minutes left we're gonna have ten minutes. I mean if it's written, that's the question. Means? Yes. So if I go back to the figure, this is in words explaining what's happening here. There's no, in the spin liquid, There's no, in the spin liquid here, this is the spin liquid, including h equals zero. Entanglement that we find here, the genuine multi-party entanglement, is only present for sub-regions that have cycles or loops. Cycles in a graph theoretical language. Okay, but here you chose specific loop you can have on a honeycomb lattice. Yes. But if I so that means that you could take a longer one? That means that you could take a longer quantity. You can, but you cannot measure this quantity. It's impossible because it has more than six spins. If you can evaluate that, please come tell me. Because the next loop has ten spins. I cannot evaluate this quantity for ten spins. But what you mean by this sentence is that it's non-zero for the top row, but zero for the other rows. This is an example of the statement, but we looked at. Statement, but we looked at many more states of spin liquids with different neural saltic classes. And you always find this. And these graphs have different types of loops, like a triangle. So I'm just not showing the full data, I don't have time, but it's many, many, many RDMs. I never found a counterexample. But maybe there is, but it's rare. So at best, the statement is a good effective. At best, the statement is a good, effective description of spin liquids. At worst, at best, it's true in all spin liquids. So if you look at the paramagnetic phase, why does it show such a huge signal? Of course, it has to go to zero for input. Okay, so do you want me to relance or I think there's a continuous phase transition here? Yeah, we agree on that, yeah. Because this type of S structure. This type of S structure we find in the Ising model as you go from ordered to paramagnet. So I believe there's a conformal field theory here. And these have large entanglement of all types, loop and non-loop. And paramagnets are good at microscopic entanglement. They're good to protect from the gap in the they're nearby a pure product state. Nearby, a pure product state. So, from my perspective, it's very natural that this is sort of strong here and has this upturn from the phase transition. To me, it's very natural, yes. Like it upside down. No. That's how I like it. Okay, so out of equilibrium. And now we leave behind unitary field theories, and we'll talk about non-unitary field theories. About non-unitary fields. So, I think there'll be many talks about this on Wednesday or later this week. So, measurement-induced space transitions. You have a chain of qubits, of spins, and you apply alternating layers of unitaries and measurements. Unitaries are these boxes. They're going to take two unitaries, so they act on pairs of qubits at a time, as they would an IBM machine, for example. And we're going to do measurements in single qubits with some probability. With some probability. An example that people like is take this box, not fixed gate, but just pick it with hard measure and the set of two spin unitary gates. But it doesn't have to be like that. So the putting parameter, like the Ising model here, is P, this rate of measurement. When P is 1, you measure every qubit on the measuring layer. And that's very bad. Layer. And that's very bad because measurements project into a product state. If you do no measurements, then you just do unitaries. This is very scrambling. So it's like a black hole in some sense. It's like taking a big gate of heart and just hitting your state with it. It'll be very non-local. So that's not so good either. The best in between. And you sort of balance measurements and unitaries. As everything in life, the balance is the key. Life, the balance is the key. So these people showed that there's a phase transition in this model, dynamical phase transition, between a volume law phase at low p and an area law phase at large p. This transition happens at 0.17. No one knows why. It's not 0.5 as in percolation. The volume law means that the entropy of a subregion scales as the volume of the subregion. So this is this. So, this is this largely entangled phase. This is this less entangled phase. And in between, there's this future logarithmic CFT. It's not understood what this critical theory is. There's no Lagrangian that describes this. But people have the numerics, as we have. Measurement layer. I mean, this is what's defined by what being unitary, I think. Projective measurements, yeah, yeah. So it's a very It's like something which is close to a projection operator of subspace or something like that. Anyway, non-unitarian, exactly. That's the non-unitariness as you made this exact measurement on these sites. So at criticality, people looked at the negativity between disjoint intervals in short chains. Short chains numerically. And they found that negativity decays algebraically with separation, which is nothing possible in equilibrium. In equilibrium, it's just a sudden death. Entanglement is finite, finite, then zero, then stays zero forever. There's no power law tail. There's not even an exponential tail in equilibrium. It's just zero point. But here, you have this power law scaling numerically, and the exponent they find for negativity is minus six. So decay is fast. These short chains, it's. Fast. These short chains, it's okay. I mean, is it exponential or powerful? It's hard to see. I mean, a 20-site chain is a fast power. But, anyways, I mean, that's the claim, that algebraic decay of entanglement by partite. With my students, Sébastien Vaquian and Tammy Herrick Barnier and Miguel, she's faculty, we looked at the genuine three-part entanglement in these random hard spin chains. With 24 sites, that's very big. Sites, which is that's very big. This is cluster simulations on the cluster. Ones of compute, because you have to average over disorder realizations. And we do the same analysis here, but for this I2 quantity between three spins that are separated by a distance x and x. So the first and last spin have a distance to x. We find an entanglement between these three spins, the general entanglement, the case, this is log log. This is log-log, so straight line. There's only three points because this next point is finite, but it's not enough hits. So it's a rare event polluted. I'm not showing it. It's not being called. But these three points fall in line. So it's just a three-point fit, but that we cannot do more with 24 sides. And we find that this I2 in blue and another quantity, W, they scale with the same power, which is above minus. Which is about minus 8.7, which is bigger than this, as expected. It's harder to entangle three things than two. But again, this is hard, it's challenging. It's numerically limited, but it's an indication that this log CFT has this algebraic decay of multi-party entanglement. But it's very challenging. I mean, this took my student expert to run a cluster, and it's still inconclusive because the ensemble is too small. So then, with my postdoc, James Allen, we My postdoc, James Allen, we tried to find an exact solution where we can see multi-party entanglement, the family of circuits, where you can assert there's a power lie exactly. And so there's this measurement-only family of circuits by Sang and company. Time is going upwards, so they alternate measurement layers of different kinds. This is a two-site measurement. It's entangling. Five minutes, thank you. It's entangling. So it's a measurement, but it's entangling because you're measuring two things. But it's entangling because you're measuring two things. So you project on a subspace. This is the usual sigma x measurement. It's not entangled. So if you balance the two, there's a phase transition. Turns out you can map this model exactly to classical percolation and the square lattice. In mathematics, this has been mostly solved. And the critical point is one-half. And this is also the critical point for the circuit. In the circuit, the transition is not from volume to area law. Transition is not from volume to area law, but it's from area to area. There's a duality between the two sides as interpolation. So it's less interesting than har, but it's still a measurement-induced phase transition. And there's a very simple solution to it, why it's solvable and how entanglement is organized. This is the solution. Each cluster of connected spins in a final state forms a cat state. Final state forms a cat state. The final state is here, time goes upwards. These two spins are connected by these entangling measurement gates, and so they form a cat state, 0, 0 plus 1, 1. It's a delt state, maximum gate there. This is not connected to anything else. Sorry, this one, because there's measurement just before, so this is just a product from everyone else. But these three, look, if we just start from this one and follow the connections. The connections. We can reach this trio. So spin 3, 5, and 6 are in a cat state. 3, 0 plus 3, 1, that's genuine three-party entangled. And the same idea holds for larger clusters. Using this, Sigma company found that negativity scales to the power of minus 4. Remember, har was minus 6. This is exact, minus 4. We can generalize this argument by mapping the k. By mapping the k-party GME measure to a k-point function of the stress tensor in the perturbation log CFT. The stress tensor has a dimension 2 in 2D CFT, including non-unitary CFT. So you have k copies of the stress tensor, so you get a dimension of 2 times k. So entanglement between k parties decays as minus 2k. And that's exact. And for three spins, three parties, this is two times three is six. And this six is less than the har exponent. So har decays faster than the special circuit. It's not surprising because it's special. It's like integral. It maintains the structure for longer distances. Here I'm showing a numerical simulation of percolation. There's no correlation in percolation, so it's just sampling percolation realizations. For collation realizations, I'm showing two-party, three-party, four-party, and five-party. This is a conformal cross-ratio, which at small separation goes as 1 over x squared. And the powers are as expected from the log C of T. So 2 times 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. And we conjecture, I mean, this is unpublished, most of the log is unpublished. We conjecture that these exponents are in fact. These exponents are, in fact, a lower bound for other non-unitary CFTs, like Harr or even Clifford log CFTs. But that's remained to be checked, because it's very hard to evaluate this in universal circuits. But maybe other circuits that have exact solutions from the audience, for example, would be interesting to see that. Okay, I'm done. So, multi-part entanglement is very rich, and at the same time, poorly. And at the same time, poorly understood because we haven't explored it so much as a community, so there's lots to be understood. Got questions about spin chains and frustration. I just don't know, but the answer is there are no spin chains. One very, very interesting area of applications is spin liquids, because entanglement, the genuine multi-party entanglement there has a different structure than in conventional phases. So that also, in some sense, is an order parameter for. In some sense, it is an order parameter for a skin liquid. And out of equilibrium, it's even more interesting because you can have long-range multi-party entanglement, which is not possible in equilibrium. And with exact solutions, you have these solid comparison points, which are needed because these generic quantum circuits are just so damn hard to simulate that I think exact solutions are extremely valuable in the circuit business, much more than even Hamiltonians. Than even Hamiltonians, because there you can do simulations very efficiently with Monte Carlo or the MIG. But with these circuits, the ensemble sampling is such a good funding to my collaborators, and thank you for your attention. Yeah, thank you for your talk. We already had quite a few questions, but there's still sort of five minutes or so left, so Minutes or so left, so one naive question. I mean, you had this, I think it was the HAR system or so. So, the one before you went to the exactly solvable one, and there you mentioned that what this logarithmic CFT is not clear. It's not, so it's the hard log CFT. Yeah, but so now you have this, you study this entanglement quality, but would it be possible to study something more ordinary, like some correlation functions or something? Like some correlation functions or so, or which we can maybe get the operator contents and the scaling dimensions of those operators or so. And this has been done by other people. So for example, Jed Pixley, David Hughes, Sarong, they looked at the correlation length exponent ν, which gives you the dimension of the relevant scalar in your theory. In your theory. And this, I think, numerically we found to be 1.4. So percolation is 1.33333. And this has a narrow bar, I think, of at least one. I think a lot of exponents in the hard log CFT, numerically we cannot distinguish from percolation. But for its entanglement exponents, numerically you see. Exponents numerically seem much larger and hard than in percolation. But would I bet like even a week of salary in this? Because we're fitting on three points in a 24-site chain. Yeah, I mean, even this exponent for negativity. So other papers claim it's 5.4. And in our paper, which is of SJ, it's not. With Sebastian, it's not on the archive, but we have also negativity, so we checked where we get that and we don't. We get seven. The same system. And that's much simpler because it's just two partites, so it's less of a range. So I think there's something serious to be improved, even for the simplest negativity or bipartite measure. But I think that will be nailed down within the year, at least for negativity, and hopefully for this tripartite. Hopefully, for this tripartite, I think this will show that this is not the percolation CFT, log CFT. Because, yeah, I mean, how, why would it, right? I mean, you have this universal gates, and that has to change something. And by percolation, now you mean normal class standard classical percolation, or do you mean percolation with the colours? Yeah, so I mean this percolation. mean this percolation but but is it different from the classical no it's isomorphic you can map this quantum circuit to classical 2d percolation isomorphically but the questions are different because on classical setting there's no entanglement so it's interesting because for entanglement uh k-party entanglement this classical question that's analogous and maybe it's not in mathematics i don't know the question is as follows classical perturbation with a boundary Classical pertillation with a boundary, you ask whether a cluster connects these three spins, but nothing else. It's a classical question. You can ask for the probability of having a cluster that touches only those three spins, nothing else, from the boundary. This is what gives you the solution of entanglement. But in classical percolation, I don't know if people care about this. Usually you care about clusters that touch points, but you don't care if they don't touch other points. Points, but they don't care if they don't touch other points. So, yes, you can map one to the other, but the questions in the quantum circuit seem a bit unnatural in a classical setting. But maybe this has been studied by some people in mathematical physics. If so, we can get these full correlation functions entanglement from classical percolation, but I can't parse the ratio. It's like a world in itself. But arsenation. But articulations here are the classical model, and these numbers also are new numbers for classical percolation. These clusters that join spins on the boundary, nothing else. One rock, two hits. But I'm not sure a classical field is so interesting for most people. Measure GME as largest from all the ways. Would would it be true as well that if I measured quantum pressure information with relatively large values compared to operators delta and this would be in which system in the circuits or in the oh yeah okay look at that I mean even Eric I mean did you look at the quantum Fisher look at that for what uh sub regions? For what sub-regions the well, what we looked at is just the zero field, I'm trying to recall now, and then as a function of space, so we get that from the correlation functions. But you do see a you you do see a transition. You do see a transition. But do you see, well, you know, loop or non-loop structure? I can't say. But so what I can say is that the quantum fisher information, although interesting quantity, is not a measure of genuine multi-party entanglement. No, but it is a measure of multi-party entanglement. But. It puts a lower bound on it. Yeah, but is it a proper monotone? I don't think so. Meaning that it affects entanglement. Meaning that it affects entanglement, but also classical correlations can also affect. I don't think so. Okay. Yeah, but it's a depends on which very sensitive ability to detect multipartite entanglement is very sensitive to the operator. But you can optimize over the operators, right? Sure, so I'm wondering if a loop operator is better than just an operator built on two sites. Well, the answer is probably yes. So you would probably. So, you would probably use these multi-loop operators to spread a QFI. But what I can say with certainty is that this is much more powerful than QFI. That this will detect many more RDMs with GME than the QFI. I've seen benchmarks for the QFI in much weaker quantities. And if it underperforms these weaker quantities, this is much stronger metric. This doesn't miss so much. It just misses bound multi-party intangible loop, which Party entanglement, which is an existing set, but yeah. So this is a very strong entanglement measure. In fact, when the people introduced this measure in confirmation, the title of the paper, the PRL, was Taming Multi-Party Entanglement. They thought they tamed it for good, but the problem is the smallness. You cannot go beyond big sub-regions. But for a small sub-region, it really tames it. This is probably the strongest measure to be able to make time. Yeah, urgent question. You talk about logarithmic CFTs. Why not normal CFTs? What properties will you find? Maybe there's a log safety expert in the audience, but so these circuits are non-unitary because of measurements. And so the CFT violates unitarity. So you have states with negative norms, for example. With negative norms, for example. So scaling dimensions violate basic unitarity constraints that you have in Ising CFT. And the reason it's this non-unitary CFT is because it's a critical theory of extended geometrical objects. So it's not as local as in the Ising model, where you have local excitations, and that's pretty much the Ising CFTs, spin flips that are addressed. And so people, for many years, so Ibas. For many years, so Iber Salar and company, have studied percolation log CFT and identified what's different from regular CFTs. And there are distinctions. So there are, for example, some logarithms and correlation functions that don't appear, cannot appear in regular CFTs. But yeah, scaling dimensions that violate unitarity bounds. But in these circuits, it's very natural that it's not unitarian because these measurements violate unitarity. It's projective measurement. It's not unitary evolution. So there are many ways to roam, and so it's very reasonable that the theory is non-unitary. And the entanglement shows that it's non-regular CFT, because in regular CFTs, entanglement has a sudden depth. It doesn't extend at large separations, whereas this has this algebraic decay. It's impossible in any CFT, in fact, any dimension. So these really are. So these really are a family apart, whether log or not. I mean, non-interior CFTs are very different than interior CFTs from a point of view entanglement. Okay, I think we should sort of stop here, not to forget go to copy, but
