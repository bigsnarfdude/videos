The idea really of this work, more broadly, stepping for a moment away from the old question of ice streams, is a broader question about what is the thermal structure of an ice sheet and what effect does that have on ice flow and the mechanics of the ice sheet itself. And so, if you look at this picture here on the left, this is from Pattin's work, it's modeled based on the temperature of Antarctica, and you see that there is definitely. Temperature of Antarctica, and you see that there is definitely a pattern where, yeah, the interior is warm, but then as you go to the sides and the thickness decreases, then you get this blue region that is a region of frozen, supposedly frozen ice, and then as you go further away onto the margins, ice gets warmer again. And so the reason why we care about this is the point of the thermofrictional feedback that we were talking about before. So this is broadly reflected if you look at the velocity map into velocity that increase going towards the edges. Increase going towards the edges. And so, one place that this is where this is particularly important, as Mariana said, is ice streams. And here we have cyclone coasts. And cyclone cost is particular here because we have this pattern of ice streams that form in the absence of strong topographic control. And what we know, so actually the question that arises is, what is it that drives this patterning? And if we go and look at what the bed does, we find that the bed is, ice is frozen to the bed. Ice is frozen to the bed in this under these ridges in between active ice streams, and whereas the bed is at the melting point where there are ice streams. And so, what this is telling us really is this idea of thermally activated sliding, as in you don't slide at all when the bed is frozen, so ice is stuck at the bed, and you have fast sliding and the formation of an ice stream where the bed is at the melting point. And so, really, the question that we're asking here is one of, well, how do we go from a place where the ice is frozen? From a place where the ice is frozen to a place where the bag is at the melting point, and this fast sliding is possible. And all the hydraulically mediated feedbacks that Miranda described allow ice to flow so fast. And so again, so actually another thing that I wanted to say here is that this picture also allows us to illustrate there are two types of these transitions from frozen to temperate evades. So if here you had arrows that told you what is the direction, Arrows that told you what is the direction of the flow. You would fear that there are places where ice goes from frozen to temperate perpendicularly to this transition point, and these are shear margins. And here, work that Mariana has done and others explains essentially how we can maintain this transition to work. And essentially, it's strong lateral heating within the margin that allows this transition to happen. The part that is much harder, though, is that if we go further upstream, we can imagine that there must be a point where ice starts. There must be a point where I start sliding in the direction perpendicular, in the direction of the flow. And so, this is really the idea of an upstream onset of sliding. And that case is, as funny as it seems, very different from a sheer margin and really is the place that we would like to focus on here. And so the question that really this talk tries to look at is what is the mathematical structure of this problem of onset of sliding, the upstream onset of sliding, and so how do we enable a transition fully frozen to? A transition fully frozen to fully temperate bed along the flow line. And so, okay, so we're going to, so this actually goes back to the point about Doug's work and what is the simplest possible way to think about a transition from frozen to temperate bed. And so just bear in mind that here we stick with a flow line setup. And so we have our eye sheet flow line, we go from an ice sheet that has a thickness H and velocity U, and at some point along this flow line we get from At some point along this flow line, we get to the melting point. And so we have no slip in the frozen region and fully tempered bed and this lighting blow applied in here downstream. And so now what I'm going to show you is the reason why Doug was saying earlier that this is actually a little bit of a problem. And this version of the switch here that we're looking at is actually an extreme version of the case that Dad has in his work where That Dad has in his work, where here, instead of having a high and the low friction coefficient, the high friction coefficient for us is effectively no slip. And so the first thing that we're going to do is if we look at these two regions separately in a large-scale sense, we can think of an ice flux Q that is a function of the geometry in a shallow ice sense, a thickness and a surface lobe. And so we're going to have that. And so we're going to have that the mass flux is purely by internal deformation up here, and down here is by internal deformation and sliding at the bed. And now the question is how do we combine the two pieces together? So at this transition, we have no lateral flow. The thickness must be the same, and so must be the mass flux. And so the only way that we have to splice together these two regions is actually that the surface flattens at this transition point as we have started sliding. And now the moment we Started sliding. And now, the moment we do that, though, something quite interesting happens. So, if we go and look at the heating rate in a shallow ice sense, the heating rate is nothing but the product of the mass flux and surface load. So now the mass flux is constant across this transition, and the surface flattens as we go from frozen to temperate. So, really, what we're seeing here is that the rate at which we dissipate energy decreases as we start sliding. So, now this is a little bit of a contradiction because this amount of this This amount of energy dissipation rate is the thing that got us to the melting point to start with. So, this is what this really is telling us: is that as we start sliding, the ice ship wants to freeze again. So, now, this is just a large-scale argument. In reality, things are a little more sophisticated, and so really, to understand what is it that goes wrong here, we need to look at the flow near the transition point that would be that place there. And this goes back to the point of Jeremy about the flow there being a crack tip and sliding being continuous or discontinuous there. And so what we've done has been try and look at this in a boundary layer sense. And so we have this large scale model that is shallow ice model and we zoom in near the transition point and what we get here is an ice slab where we look at the Stokes problem and where we have again. Where we have again this set of boundary conditions, on the upstream side, no sleep, and the heat flux is conserved at the bed. On the temperate side, we have a sliding law, here, simple Werdmann-type sliding law, and we ask that the bed temperature remains at the melting point. Just one thing that I forgot to say is that, since here we're interested really in this friction dissipation feedbacks, we ignore the temperature dependence of the viscosity. Temperature dependence of the discourse. So, this is simply a Newtonian model. So, quite kind of inessential to the point, but just something to keep in mind. And the third thing that we do actually, so if we just ask this set of conditions of our model, we could find infinite solution. The thing that we still need to constrain is where is the location of this transition point. And this comes from the requirement that temperature remains below the melting point as we are upstream of the transition. We are upstream of the transition, whereas we want the manifrain to be positive in order for sliding to be enabled immediately downstream of the transition point. And those constraints actually tell us where this onset region is along the flow line. So now we solve all of this numerically, and this is essentially what we get. Just before you look inside the picture, just bear in mind that this is showing ice flowing from left to right. The x-axis is actually... The x-axis is actually distance along flow, distances are scaled with the ice thickness here. And what I'm showing you up here is the velocity field within the ice. The y-axis is the vertical, so one is the surface, zero is the bed. Here we have the temperature field. This zero is the bed, the ice bed interface, and this is temperature within the bed. And so what this is showing us is that the velocity field, despite the switch in the button, The switch in the boundary condition, the velocity field is perfectly continuous across this transition point, as we expect. And these white things are streamlines, and we see that streamlines converge very steeply towards the bed as we cross the transition point. Isoterms are equally continuous, so here all good. The problems come when we look at basal temperature and the basal energy budget. So we find that basal temperature is below the melting point upstream of the transition. Melting point upstream of the transition, and we stay at the melting point immediately downstream. And similarly, the basal energy budget, we find a region immediately downstream of the transition point where the basal energy budget is positive. But as we move along further away here on the right, we see that the basal energy budget turns negative. And so this is essentially what I was describing before. As we do get to the melting point and we do start sliding locally, so these inequalities are satisfied. Locally, so these inequalities are satisfied here. But as we move away, actually the ice wants to refreeze again. And so, where does this come from physically? Well, we can look up here and go back to this point of streamlines converging rapidly towards the bed. And really, what's happening is that a switch in boundary condition forces ice to accelerate so quickly in space that streamlines have to converge towards the bed. And so we produce a very steep heat flux, and so, so, actually, streamlines, and so ice. So, actually, streamlined, and so isotherms converge towards the bed quickly, and the heat flux becomes very large. Actually, it goes as a large power of the Peclet number, we can show symptotically, and that is what causes rephrasing. So, yes, can I interrupt? I know I've asked this question before. But, okay, so you have this increase in the basal energy budget, which might produce water. Yeah. Okay, you have a little bit of water there, then it can trickle down, okay, then refreeze. Okay, that warms that part of the bed. Can you unzip? That part of the bed. Can you unzip this region using water? So, two points. The first point is that the amount of heat that, so even if the stress field is singular here, the amount of heat that you make is finite. So, this amount of water that you make here is actually small and finite. And so, yes, you may melt locally, but actually, the amount of refreezing that you have as you move downstream is expected to freeze all of that. To freeze all of that. The second thing is that we have tried to see, so the idea that you're hinting at is this idea of a patchy onset over these short scales, and we have tried, and we can find no solution to that. So you can make it essentially a success. You always reproduce this hard switch, and you always want to refreeze. And so we could not find any way to make it work. And Christian can correct me about this if he has different thoughts. I mean, write this as it was. Tried this asymptotically. I would love somebody to take this on as a piece of numerics and see if you actually resolve the... You have to... The resolution you need to see this is really quite high. See what actually happens if you try doing this. I think the setup would be significantly more complicated than we have here, 'cause you presume you have to run it as a time dependent. Yes. Just understand the end of I understand that. So you're increasing meaning that you think you have water there, and the fact that the depth is still at the point of the action, it can be nice, we can form that. Well, so the way the model is set up here, let's go back to this picture here. Here we impose that the bed is at the melting point on the temperate side, and we ask that, and so we look if these inequality constraints are statistical. Equality constraints are satisfied. So, this is essentially a reduced version of an enthalpy equation, and you can show that near the transition point, this is actually what you expect. What, Christian? I was just going to say m is the net rate. That is the net rate. So that's that is the... No, sorry. And so if you're going from frozen to tempered, essentially, you need your melt rate to remain positive for the bad. You need to make melt water, that's what you're saying. That's what you're saying. And now, if the amount of refreezing, so we can show asymptotically, and sort of in the numerics also, that the heat flux into the ice becomes asymptotically large. So the Peclet number is large over these short distances, and so the heat flux scales with the Peclet number. And so, if you make a finite amount of water and this the heat flux is large, then you're The heat flux is large, then your melt rate becomes negative very quickly and you refreeze. But no, we don't see because we don't allow the model actually to refreeze because you still have to keep the Dirichlet condition there because of how we create NLB. Yes. It's essentially the answers to be the same as what Colin was asking. So you refreeze if you add it to once dynamically. You don't have an answer to that. Yeah. The other degree of freedom in here, I think, sort of surprised, is the Sort of suppressed is what actually F is, right? Is this a power law there? Say again? Is the sliding law a temperature? Yeah. So if this were a Coulomb case, then you could have sub-temperate, I mean, cold sliding by overcoming the yield. I'll get to the cold sliding. But I mean, adjusting that model, I think you're going to describe it. Describe soap temperature by putting temperature into the sliding wall. I think I'm pointing out that you don't need temperature to be in the sliding wall in order to have cold sliding if it is plastic. Well, the question is, though, that even if it's plastic, then at some point you will still need your sliding velocity to go to zero, right? Yes. So now if you do that... That can be upstream. Yeah. That can be upstream, but you're just essentially you're moving the problem. just essentially you're moving the problem so the point that i'm trying to make here is that uh as soon as you so as soon as you have this acceleration in the sliding velocity from zero to a finite amount over a distance that is comparable with the ice thickness so that your local Peclet number becomes large, then this is the issue that you encounter. Regardless of what is the way that actually you have this acceleration, the thing that you care about is that this acceleration happens over short distances. Maybe I didn't point this out. Short distances. Maybe I didn't point this out precisely, but the reason to look at this hard switch is that this is kind of a paradigm for a change in slipperiness that happens over distances that are short. And even if you, actually, I'm not going to show you, but even if you were to assume that your friction coefficient depends on temperature, but the change in temperature happens over this. The change in temperature happens over distances that are short, you would end up with the same problem. So, really, the problem is the thermal aspect of this rather than how you describe the change in the friction coefficient of the bed, I think. And my question would be kind of different. So, if you suppose that you have coolant friction and a yield in the bed, and that that yield stress is independent of temperature, then so one of the questions I then have is: okay. So one of the questions I then have is: okay, you should have fairly large parts of what do you suppose the level of that yield stress is? May I have in some of this work shear margin where the shear stresses are much, much larger as opposed to these transitions. So then would you expect large regions of coal bed to slide at a yield stress? I think what I expect is, real life is not a flow line, and you have small patches. And you have small patches frozen going to larger or small patches melted, going larger patches melted in the. We'll catch them. I do get catches. I'm not sure that. Depends. We used up five minutes of your time talking. That's fine. If there are more questions, I'm fine. So what's killing it off is the first term on the right hand side on the Galaxy equation. Right hand side of the Golov's equation? Sorry, I say again, I didn't get to it. So, what is killing it off for you is the heat. We are talking about this. Yeah. So, this is a jump of heat flux, conductive heat flux at the bed. Actually, the part, the ice part, not the bed. So, that's the term that becomes large, yes. And that's the reason it kills off. Yes. But so if you had a finite temperate layer, Temporary layout. I mean, we go back to Colin's question, I think. Can I say that I will just revisit that one any time? I think it's not temporary. Yeah, I would like to have it. You can only, I mean, it would be very difficult to get finite temperature. No, just in icing models, usually people throw away this term because as soon as you have a tap, they get a lot more restrictive. But as soon as you have a tiny isothermal layer at the bed, then this term just drops out. Well, but that's what the bed is. So basically, you would expect first the bed becomes tempered and then the tempered. I can see there's a little bit of a problem there with creating it in the first place, but I'm just asking, just for our awful benefit, I think. It does matter how it first is created. So keywords. I successfully let him do that. I need to carry on from there. Super chair. Alright. So. So I guess you got convinced that a rapid acceleration over short distances is a problem, right? Now, the question is how do we fix it? And so the point, so the idea here is that this is what Mariana was hinting at before, is that we need to get away from this very localized onset. And one way to get away from it is remembering that actually sliding depends on temperature and that we can slide also below the melting point as a result of regulation below the melting point and pre-melting itself. Below the melting point and pre-melting itself. And so the way we deal with this mathematically is through a temperature-dependent sliding law, as you have up here. And this is just one way of describing it mathematically. The key points is that if you look at this sliding coefficient up here, you want something that goes to zero so that you recover no sleep when you're far below the melting point, and then you go to a friction coefficient gamma zero or whatever that is, as you're at the melting point, as you approach the melting point, and then remains constant. Melting point and then remains constant. What does this mean for your model? Oh, actually, one thing that is important is there is one parameter here that comes from the physics of pre-melting, this delta that essentially tells you is a ratio of temperature scale of the ice sheet. So actually the opposite way, the ratio of temperature scale over which pre-melting matters compared to the temperature scale of the ice sheet. So it's something that you expect to be small. And that essentially tells you what is the sensitivity to temperature as you're. What is the sensitivity to temperature as you approach the melting point? Now, how do we need to modify the model? Well, essentially, now we allow a sliding velocity everywhere with a sliding velocity that depends on temperature when we're below the melting point. And then we required that bet enthalpy is zero when we're below the melting point, and the temperature is zero if enthalpy enthalpy is positive. And then with an enthalpy equation here, I've omitted the drainage part of it. I've omitted the drainage part of it, but you would also need a flux here if you were to look at the full temperature region. Now, the question: this is a significantly more complicated model because it introduces the thermal frictional coupling that we were talking about before. Now, we have temperature explicitly in the friction law. And so the question is, what is the, if we were to couple this to a nice flow model, what would be the leading order behavior that we expect? And can we simplify this treatment of the boundary conditions of the bed? Turns out that. Of the bed. Turns out that one thing that is obvious to try if we following this idea that delta is small is to take this limit of delta that goes to zero. And this right away allows us to identify three distinct regions. A cold region where we have no sleep and heat fluxes that balance at the bed. A sub-temperate region where two leading order bed temperature is at the melting point and at the same time we have that the melt rate is zero. Have that the men rate is zero, and then a fully temperate region that works as you would expect. Now, the question is: well, does this fix anything? Does this fix the fact that we cannot find a solution? So what we've done is coupling this to an ice flow model, actually specifically a shallow ice model, following this idea that yes, temperature dependence gives you a way to get away from a localized onset, but still it needs to be a long onset to avoid refreezing. And so if we do Avoid refreezing. And so, if we do that, then we can compute steady states of an isola. This is a flow line, velocity up here, temperature down here. And the interesting thing is that as we get to the melting point, then the bed stays at the melting point all the way to the grounding line. Melt rate is positive. So, apparently, this fixes the issue of refreezing, except for the fact that there is a little complication to this. That is, that, yeah, we have a steady state, but then you have to ask. State, but then you have to ask: well, is this stable and does it ever want to exist? And the answer is no. So I don't know how much care about how we got to the answer, but long story short, you can look, you can do a numerical stability analysis on the model that we have looked at to have cooked up. And what we find is essentially that if friction, so what the sub-temperature friction does and how we describe this requirement, then the mental rate is equal to. Requirement that the melt rate is equal to zero in the subtemperate region leads to a velocity weakening friction. And so, what numerically we observe grid point-to-grid point oscillations in the subtemperate region and eigenvalues that increase as we refine the grid. And we can show analytically that actually this is the reason for that. So, taking delta equals zero is not a good idea at all, even if it seems to solve some of our problems. And now, so the question is: what is it that we can do to describe these transitions in a way that is self-consistent? These transitions in a way that is self-consistent. And the answer is that to relax, to solve this issue of the impositeness, we have to relax two limits that are actually singular limits that we have taken. The one is that delta is small, but it's finite. And so if we do that, we end up with a much more complicated structure in the thermal problem. And I'm going to describe what this is. But let me say first, what is the second limit is this long wave. This long wavelength limit, and so actually, it turns out that we need to look at the ice thickness scale to get things right. And so, if we do that, now we focus only on the subtemperate region, we look at the slab of subtemperate ice, the structure of the thermal problem is now one where we have a thin advection diffusion boundary layer near the bed and an outer problem that is advection dominated. And what this buys us is that by restoring diffusion here down at the bed, Restoring diffusion here down at the bed, we are able to satisfy at the same time the requirement that the basal energy budget is zero, and this actually tells us how little below the melting point temperature is, and the explicit temperature-dependent friction law, which in the delta equals zero approximation was something that was purely diagnostic and did not feed back in the leading order model. Now, this seems sensible, constructing a This seems sensible. Constructing a steady state to this lab is relatively easy. The question is one of stability again. And so, here, what I'm showing you is results from a linear stability analysis that looks at that sub-tempered slab over two different landscapes. So, let's start from here to the right. This is the S-thickness scale problem. On the x-axis, we have the wave number, the scale with the ace thickness. On the y-axis, we have the growth. On the y-axis, we have the growth rate of small perturbation that we have imposed to this temperate region. And the y-axis is a logarithmic scale, so unstable modes are plotted with solid lines, stable modes with dashed lines. So what we see is that there is an instability in this subtempered region with some sort of weak wavelength selection at the astickness scale. The nice thing is that we got rid of the imposedness in the sense that the growth rate wants to go to zero as we go to very... Go to zero as we go to very short length scales. It doesn't turn negative, and it doesn't turn negative even for long length scales in the ice thickness scale limit. So there is a broad band of perturbations that are unstable. The other thing that is interesting is that that slab model that I described earlier carries on at length scales much longer than the X thickness. And here we're looking at a length scale intermediate between the edge thickness and the ice sheet scale. And here there is another interesting. And here, there is another interesting thing: that is that this branch here is that backward diffusion mode that I was talking about earlier, the velocity weakening friction. But in addition to that, this temperature-dependent sliding gives us this flat branch where there is essentially a thermal runaway feedback. What happens is that as we make the bed warmer, we make more heat by frictional heating, and that makes the bed even warmer. And this branch continues all the way to the ice-sheak scale. So, basically, what this is telling us. So basically, what this is telling us is that this ice sheet, this sub-temperate region, never wants to settle in a steady state. And essentially, the question is, what is it that an ice sheet that has frozen temperate wants to evolve into? One other thing that is kind of interesting is that here you could ask yourself, well, can I parametrize ever what happens at the ice-thickness scale? Because really, what I want is the large. Thickness scale because really, what I want is the large-scale evolution of this eye sheet model. And here you could think that maybe there is some sort of scale separation from the astigna scale to longer length scales. And so what we did was look at the non-linear problem in the sub-temperate region, try and figure out if that would evolve to something tractable and that we could parameterize. The answer is no. So what I'm going to show you here is on the x-axis, so the flow is from left to right. So the flow is from left to right, still subtemperate slide. I'm going to show you different lines in this plot are the basal temperature field at different time steps and time goes from up to down. And what happens is that starting from infinitesimal perturbations, these perturbations grow unboundedly till actually the battery freezes. And if we look at the final time step, this is the sliding velocity, we have formation of this small scale. Formation of these small-scale patches where we have regions where the bed is frozen, and frozen meaning that temperature is so low that sliding is insignificant, and places where the bed still there is a finite sliding velocity. So, this goes back to Connie's point. So, coming to the conclusions, lots of problems. What we have shown is that, wait, first of all, if we look at a flow line in a brown If we look at a flow line, an abrupt onset gives us no solution. So, and the switch, any hard switch that localizes the transition from no sliding to sliding over short distances leads to the same problem, and that is a result of thermal complications. We can construct a steady state if we allow sliding to depend explicitly on temperature, but this steady state doesn't want to be stable. And so, really, this field. And so, really, this flow line with frozen sub-temperate temperature doesn't want to stay such. What it evolves to is unclear, and it requires to resolve all landscapes, from the ice thickness to the ice sheet scale, at the same time. And then the last thing that I wanted to say that goes back to Christian's point earlier is: well, this is again if we restrict ourselves to a flow line or similarly to an ice sheet that is laterally uniform, so where we don't allow Uniform, so where we don't allow lateral structure to emerge. If we do that, that things are, so many of the complications that you see here actually go away. I apologize not to have numerical results to show you today.
