So, yes, I'm Melody Monor. I'm part of the Imperial College London COVID-19 response team and I'm also a PhD candidate there. And I would like to thank first the organizing committee for giving me the opportunity to speak at this workshop. And I'm going to present our project entitled Estimating the Age Group. Entitled Estimating the Age Groups that Sustain Resulting COVID-19 Epidemics in the United States. Okay, so all the details of the analysis can be found in our preprint either on the Imperial website or on MedArchive. Also, our data and code are publicly available on GitHub. So, I'm starting by showing you on the top left a plot of the daily cases of A plot of the daily cases of COVID-19 in the US, and as you know, the COVID-19 epidemics in the US has been resurging dramatically. So that led us to the following study aims. So first, which age groups sustain resurging COVID-19 transmission in the US? Second, what is the contribution of different age groups to on-hard transmission? Third, what are likely epidemic scenarios as schools reopen? Schools reopen, and lastly, how variable is age-specific spread geographically. So, we started the study by collecting age-specific COVID-19 mortality counts in New York City, the District of Columbia, and 40 US states. We did that by extracting daily the death by age reporting by the Department of Health website. Here, as an example, I just show the cumulative COVID-19 deaths by age group in 19 deaths by age group in one state, Florida. However, in order to make sense of those data, it was essential to reconstruct the time-changing contact patterns. So pre-pandemic contact matrices for every US state, New York City and the District of Columbia, were estimated as follow. First, we use the polymat contact survey conducted in eight European countries with varying population demographic, and we use this to Demographic. And we used this survey because no survey, including the entire population, were available for the US. Second, we estimated for this eight European country high-resolution contact intensities by one-year H-band using the method proposed by Van de Castelle. And third, we formulated a regression model using edge composition and population densities as predictors. We trained this model on the European contact and On the European contact intensities. And then we use this model to predict the contact intensities in every US state, New York City, and the District of Columbia. So those are the contact intensities that I show on the top left panel for two US states and New York City. And we see that those contact intensities recover expected contact patterns. And it may not be obvious from this plot, but there are differences across locations. Across locations, which I try to highlight in the bottom panel. I show the average number of contacts by age groups for every location in color compared to the national average in black. And you may see that for Maine, where the population is older than the national average, young people tend to have less contact, whereas in New York City, where the population is Is younger and the population density is higher, all age groups have more contacts, and the difference with the national average is even higher for a younger individual. To adjust for different mobility patterns over time, we use cell phone data collected by FOSQA using more than 10 million respondents in the United States from February to September. To September, and unlike the Google mobility data, those data are available by HBN from age 18. Here, I present the national average of the mobility trends, and we may see that the time series can be decomposed in three periods. The first period where the mobility trends oscillate around the baseline, a second period that begins when the mobility trends start to dip, and a third and last period where when the mobility Period when the mobility trends start to rebound. Another interesting feature of this plot is that young individuals, so age 18 to 24, have the largest dip and then they consistently have the lowest mobility trends until approximately June. So to confirm that, we can have a look at this plot in a different way. Here I shown the x-axis. Here I shown the x-axis vulnerability trends on the y-axis every state, every location. And we see that in June, so this is the mobility trends for the week from June 1 to June 5. And we see that across states, young people tend always to have the lowest mobility trends. However, this is not quite as evident now. This is the same thing. This is the same figure, but for the week from September 20 to September 25. And we see that the differences between age groups have kind of tightened up, and it's not as evident as that young have less mobility. And this must be partly because universities and other non-essential shops have reopened. So we incorporated this trend into our COVID-19 Trained into a COVID-19 infection model for individuals age 20 plus. So the contact intensities for location M at time T is equal to the prepandemic contact intensities multiplied by the mobility multiplier of the person contacting and the mobility multiplier of the person contacted. And the mobility multiplier is a regression on the three mobility trends periods and time Trends periods and time, space, and age random effects. But we did not have mobility trends data for individuals younger than 18. Those data, those individuals correspond to children and to teens who are enrolled in childcare, kindergarten and school. So to estimate the time-varying contact intensities to and from those children and teens, we divided the period into three phases. We divided the period into three phases. The first phase, where kindergarten and school are closed, we set the contact intensities to the pre-pandemic level. A second period, so during school closure, we set the contact intensities to those estimated by Zhang NR in a contact survey that they conducted in Wuhan and Shanghai. And a third period after school closure, we set the contact. We set the contact intensities to the pre-pandemic level, decrease by a factor, but capture the reduction in transmission due to mask wearing and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. And we estimate this factor in our analysis. On top of time-changing contact intensities, we model the disease spread for a discrete time-reneural equation. So we use a standard discrete time-renewal equation with the time renewal equation with the key difference that our contacts are changing over time. We also introduced a new parameter that captures the difference in susceptibility to infectiousness, to be infectious by age. And S tracks the number of people who are still susceptible. And lastly, we take an extra step to find the expected daily death. The expected daily death by defining H, which is just the probability that an infected individuals in location M in age group A and S unit of time after infection disease. And we fit our model to the age-specific mortality data that I showed you at the beginning of this presentation. And we fitted it for 35 US states. For 35 US states, the District of Columbia and New York City. And we obtained the following results. So, those results are an update using data through September. So, it's going to be different results than the preprint. So, here you may see the contact intensities for New York City that varies over time. So, in February, they are equal to the pre-pandemic level, and then they decrease with the deep of March. Then they decrease with a deep of mobility, then rebound again for some of the age groups. We may also see the school reopening in the contacts from and to children and teens. Here I show on the left our feet to age-specific mortality counts with our median in a line, the ribbons show our 95% confidence interval, and dots are the observed. And are the observed mortality counts. And we can see that we do a pretty good job under various epidemic scenarios. In the middle, I show the number of infectious individuals, and on the left, I show the reproduction number by age groups. So interesting features include the fact that individuals aged 20 to 49 consistently have the lowest Consistently have the lowest reproduction number, and this is consistent across all states. Another thing is that we see that locations were under various epidemic scenarios. So, for example, in New York City, New York City suffered from an epidemic of high magnitude, then their production number were lower than one for a certain period, then the 2049 kind of oscillates around one, but it Of oscillates around one, but it led overall to a steady decline in infectious individuals. Whereas in Florida, the reproduction number never went below one for 20 to 49 and actually increased a lot in June, which led to another increase in the infectious individuals. So this plot shows the estimated posterior probability that the daily effective reproduction number is below one, where light blue is one, sorry. Is zero is one, sorry, and uh black is zero. On the x-axis, I show the time, and on the y-axis, I show the different age groups. So, we may see that age 0 to 19 and 65 plus consistently had the lowest reproduction number when school work closed. And in August, actually, the only estimated reproduction number across all locations was above one. All location was above one only for individuals aged 30 to 45, and this changed in September when a school reopened. Here I show the accumulated contribution to SORS-CoV-2 infections in the first row and the proportion of individuals in the same age group in the population. So I can only give a snapshot. So I chose two dates. The first one is August 23 before One is August 23 before school reopening. So we may see that 2249 accounts for the most source-CoV-2 transmission with 63%, which is more than the double of their proportion in the population, whereas 0 to 9 children account for only 1.2%, which is 10 times less than their proportion in the population. One month later, in September, One month later, in September 20, so after school reopening, the observation that 20 to 49 are the main drivers still holds. They account now for 72% of SORS-COVID-2 infection, but 0 to 9 children now account for a bit more infection, 6.3, which is only half of their proportion in the population. So we explored exactly how the epidemic situation has changed since. situation have changed since core reopening, since children and teens began to have contact with their peers and older individuals. And here we assumed, as I said earlier, that they had contacts at the pre-pandemic level, but the number of the transmissions still decreased by a certain factor to account for the wearing of The wearing of FESMAC and non-pharmaceutical interventions. And this factor we estimated it to be around 30%. So we found that there are 70% fewer infections that will have been expected from contacts alone. And here I show our forecast. So we did one forecast where all school reopen even first. Where all schools reopen, even for state that have school closed, and another forecast in which we do not reopen school in yellow. And we predict little to no difference between school closure and school reopening scenarios. So there are four take-home messages. The first one is despite some variation in time and across states, adults age 20 to 49 consistently have been the predominant driver of the reserve. The predominant driver of the resulting U.S. COVID-19 epidemics. Second, the adults account for about two-thirds of the infection in the United States, as compared to only about 1% through August and 6% through September amongst children aged 0 to 9. Of critical policy importance, our findings indicate that resulting COVID-19 epidemic can be brought under control if interventions are targeted towards adults in the US and generalizing to Europe. And lastly, we have. Europe. And lastly, reopening kindergartens and school up to K-12 is predicted to have resulted in no significant increase in additional COVID-19 attributal deaths when compared to counterfactual scenarios in which school remained closed. So I would like to thank the entire team, Oliver Radman, Alexandra Benkinschaft, John Yogi, as well as Juliet, Samir Saf and Swapnir for their help throughout the project. We would also like to thank our collaborators. Like to thank our collaborators, Foursquare, all the Department of Health, the STEM Development Team, Computing and Funding, and of course, all the studio authors and the Imperial College London COVID-19 response team. And I would like to thank you for listening, and I can take any questions now. Thanks, Melody. That was great. All right. Any questions? I guess it's probably easiest to just put them in the chat since that seems to be what's happening. Put them in the chat since that seems to be what's happening so far. So, if you have any questions for Melody, please put them there. So, I'll start with one maybe. And it's, I think, maybe something I missed. So, you have data that you used on contact patterns as a function of different ages, and then on mobility. And was the idea that you used the reduction in mobility? Idea that you use the reduction in mobility to sort of weight those contacts as the mobility level went down? Yeah, so for individuals age 20 plus, because those are the only individuals for which we have mobility data, we weight the contact through the mobility of the person contacting and the person contacted. Okay. Is there any data on how patterns of contact might have changed as a result of reductions in mobility though too? So that the nature of the contact distributions might have changed too? There is actually a big contact survey in the US called the BICS that we used, we compared our contact or estimated contact intensities to the one they found. And we are pretty close to the one they found. So yes, they were, and in Europe and also in China. So the one in China that we use from ZongNR. Yeah. Okay. Oh, that's nice. Okay, there's a question in the chat here. Do you think that the Here. Do you think that the lack of U.S. mobility data on the under-18s may have contributed to the conclusion that reopening schools and kindergartens would not substantially increase mortality? Well, I'm not sure because like we did other new forecasts, but we used to do To do, um, I mean, I have to say that if this is an update on our forecast using new mobility, we're using dev data through September and October. Before, we, of course, didn't have this data, so it was not possible. And our forecast in August showed that a significant difference in the projected death. So, I don't think it's the data, it's the fact that we use the This contact matrices from Zhang and R, it's really the new dev data that are informing us that there are no differences. Okay. Any other questions for Melanie? Can I say my question out loud? Sure, absolutely. Kind of following the question about the under 18 years old less data. So it's strange because in Quebec, after Strange because in Quebec, after we've opened school, there have been like a gigantic surge in the number of cases. So, I still think it's a little bit weird that the school might not be contributing and there's little differences between reopening school and not reopening schools, or maybe a difference in the way the schools are reopening. Maybe that would make a difference. Nellie? Yeah, well, first, thank you for your question. And well, I Well, I guess this is what the data are telling us right now, and this is what we have been f forecasting. But we are still working on it, it's still open. So I guess we don't have all the answers right now. We are still working on it, but those are the new results we've just got through using our model. Using our model until September. And yeah, we found no differences. But yeah, this is what the data, the new data, just basically told us. But we were so surprised because this is not the same conclusion that we've got in August when we ran the first forecast. Okay, thanks very much, Melody.
