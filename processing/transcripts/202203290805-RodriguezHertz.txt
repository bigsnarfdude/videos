Okay, so let me go back to the coursework, the next course, and explanation of it. So the additional picture is something like that. Oh, now I have to explain what is that and what is actually. And what is actually the dynamics, but let me do it as in some places is done, which is first take this guy very long and very thin, and then you just not say anything, very high. And then you just take this long strip and put it here. Okay? Now I will do it in a less cartoon way, a more explicit way, because I want to make sure a lot of properties happen. And then we will see how this picture I'm going to do there actually is very similar and is essentially true as well here, if you give the right assumption. The right assumption. So the map I was defining was from the pair of rectangles. So this pair of rectangles, so these two rectangles would be one here and the other there, which are this one is the one that comes somewhere here. is the one that comes somewhere here and then this one that comes this and then this other will go somewhere here and this one will go I didn't understand that you said that are zero sorry this this color is mapped first into here by an expansion so the color rectangle is mapped here linearly so this piece of rectangle is mapped somewhere here and Somewhere here, and this piece of rectangle is mapped somewhere here. And then this guy, when you go back, comes here, and this other, as you pointed out, goes orientation reversing down here. So upside down into here. That's how these two rectangles are working. The rest of the graph. Are working. The rest of the guys are really not important because they essentially get out eventually after some finite amount of iterate out of the rectangles and they don't map. I later, if you want, I will complete this picture to map from the disk to the disk and then even from the sphere to the sphere. So now I'm going to grab the substance. Now I'm going to grab the substance of this picture, which is these two rectangles, and where these two rectangles are mapped. So these two rectangles are mapped one here, so this is F of R now and the other here is F of R. Okay, so the map is linear, diagonally linear, plus translation here. So it's fully linear here. So X restricted to R0 is just said that it is going to be horizontal that is obstructive. That is contracted. 3x2. So the 0 will be somewhere here, essentially. And here will be 1, 1. And the F restricted to R1. Okay, now it comes slight problem. Let's really do the course rule. So it's minus 1 squared plus 1. Minus one square plus one minus BS2 plus some translation, which essentially this will be a fixed point, so you just solve the equation so that this is the fixed point, and you get this map. I just switch in here to reflect this change of orientation here, and for the matter of the future that really doesn't make any any difference. Really doesn't make any difference. And the fact that this is one shirt or whatever, she just with lambda one lambda could some adjustment of the rectangles of its fit and this will do this. So the rectangles are naught is pretty much minus epsilon plus epsilon times minus epsilon one third. Uh one third plus the same one and the other one is the same guy by translating the non-plus zero size I guess. So this is exactly so this is an affine locally affine uh maps and when you build this dynamics here you can pretend if you want that this is exactly what happens. So this is So this is duly linear. So this faster has to make a reverse modification lines. Here horizontal lines horizontal lines and we have vertical lines. So these horizontal lines form a foreation and this vertical line forms a foreation. Size lines, parallel lines. Now each horizontal line Horizontal line is mapped into an horizontal line and contracted by one-third, and each vertical line is not sent into a vertical line because it's broken. So this piece of the vertical line is sent into a full horizontal line, this piece of vertical line is sent into a full vertical line and multiply by three. So if you go to the past so you take the inverse of f, then each one of these guys for the inverse will be shrinked. For the inverse will be shrinked by one-third and perhaps antibodies. Okay? So once we have this, the next observation is we could think of dynamics on horizontal lines. Okay, so I have the space of horizontal lines in this union of two rectangles and this space of horizontal lines is just the union of two integrals. Oh, the space. The space of horizontal lines is parameterized by the Horizontal lines is parametrized by the union of two trials. Now, the dynamics then on the horizontal lines is that this interval is mapped into everything, and this interval is mapped here in reverse orientation into everything somewhere here, here. Okay? But this is the space of horizontal line, so this is the same as the whole equation. This is the same as the whole equals one. So, if I do this identification, what I get here is this guy a little bit larger than before. So, here is minus epsilon, here is zero, here is Here is zero, here is one circle, there is one cell, plus epsilon, and this is two important, right? One is here, here is again the other zero, one serve, but the one that's This little square inside the square. Now, let me repeat what I said. So this interval here is over here and it's mapped, multiplying by 3 go into something zero. Yeah, the scale is not good. This point is not the minus epsilon epsilon. Anyway, just as here and so this is a line, even though you don't see a line, it is a line. And the same thing here, so this interval here, a little bit, the large version of it, is this interval here and this time it is mapped. And this time it is now a line of reverse orientation. Could you just say again what line goes into those badges? So this segment is this segment segment here by I not I noticed here longer than this time I1 which is identifying this identifying this interval here, this vertical line interval. Vertical line interval with well actually there is an empty space here which doesn't matter, which corresponds to the empty space here and doesn't matter. And even though these are intervals, I want to think this not as interval, but as space of horizontal lines. So the vertical lines here correspond to horizontal lines there. No, no, no, guess. just the point business so the way the space of so the dynamics on the space of horizontal lines is just this the space of vertical lines and not analyzing I'm just worried about the correspondence between the two pictures over there you have I0 being the vertical yeah but these are the understanding you are right so I would have I could have twisted, but I'm just trying to do the graph of the map as a map from the interval to the interval, from the real to the real. Just, yeah, you have to do it. It is not even a rotation. I'm putting it horizontally. Exactly. Exactly. So if I take any horizontal. If I take any horizontal line now here, like this. Yeah, let's take this horizontal line here. So this horizontal line would map somewhere. I don't know. In this picture, I'm just trying to prove that. Exactly, and that corresponds to a vertical line. Good point. The point with y coordinate zero, which y coordinates? And zero, which might be zero. Just a point. This is the space of horizontal lines. Just a second. So each one of these lines corresponds to a point there. So if I want to know where this guy is mapped, then I look here, the image, the guy, so And then I go and look at my identification. This interval here is identified with this interval here. So this mapped guy is mapped somewhere here. I don't know whether it goes here or there, that much I will not know from here. So, but let's say it's continuous. What are the diagonal lines on that graph? Diagonal is because I have a. Oh, this diagonal? This is the graph of the transformation. So this is called a horizontal. So this is the graph of the function. Both a horizontal. This is a transformation. This is a franchisation. Every point in that square is a pair of vertical lines. Corresponds to a pair of vertical lines in the other case. So every point, okay, yeah, every point in the square here, yes, it corresponds to a pair here. Pair of horizontal lines. Pair of horizontal lines, yes. Yes, but then you confuse me, and that makes it better. This is the real inside the real times the real. So this is just plain calculus. So if you have a function from the real to the real, you draw it this way. But you're saying that point with polynets minus epsilon a quarter or something. No, put the quarter. Yeah, but that is representing some line. This point, yeah. This point is permitted to one line. Yes. One line. Yes. And so that the unit square for enterprise is pairs of lines. Pairs of horizontal, yes. Pairs of horizontal. That's just. But these pairs of horizontal lines where one is the domain and the other is the colomain. Horizontal lines. So if you want to see this picture, I should take the product of R2 times. I should take the product of R2 times R2 and then do the graph of this guy in R2 times R2 at this point. But yeah, that's let me then summarize a little bit all the discussion and all the picture. So we have this map F here. This map sends horizontal to horizontals. The inverse of this map sends verticals to verticals. And the dynamics on horizontal maps, on horizontal lines, is exactly the same dynamics we saw yesterday. Was coded by the shift, the forward shift onto signals. Now I can do the same picture for the inverse of F and how the inverse of F maps vertical to vertical and it will get exactly the same picture. The inverse of F takes now this rectangle and mapping here and takes now this rectangle and mapping here. That's essentially the same picture base. Oh, I'm going to go to the next stage. To make sure for the XIM it's kind of the thing that Rob on the I could have attempted here to do a perfect picture where something more like this and then this guy, this guy. Exactly with the boundaries matching, but then it's But then it's then I get only the L C Also some room for these things. Okay, now the point of its horse in particular is, yeah, on one hand you can do the same with it with the coding there. I can take the two symbols here that are not. I can take the two symbols here, R0 and R1, and make the code this past time. But I want to do something more, which is I want really to see in this picture this space, like really a color space. Where this guy is the space of horizontal lines and this guy is the space of vertical lines. Okay, so let me explain what I thought there. So I look at the space of horizontal line, I look at the dynamics of the space of horizontal line, and I get these dynamics here. This dynamic here has a deviant set, which is Pantor set, which is defining as the horizontal. Horizontal and is the set 0, 1 the set of points that remain in the picture for all the positives. Now, this set, when I just do my IP, Do my identification with these two guys, it will tell me that when I take any guy in CH times the interval every piece is contained and not only that, I can iterate it infinitely many times. I derived it infinitely many times. Maybe I take one second here, we're going through a point in a point in C of H and I take horizontal lines to this point. I iterate it, it goes to an horizontal line inside a horizontal line that goes to C. That line that goes through C of H, and I can keep on going as many times as I want. And if I want to chase it, well, I go to my coding and I chase it through my code. Then I have the vertical counter set, which comes from doing this same game for the inverse. doing this same thing for the inverse and for F. Now I can apply d times i, which every point there, vertical line there, for example. A vertical line going to a point in the counters. And here it is backward in variant. And it's mapped with the same idea. Whenever I take a vertical line here, I start iterating it for the inverse. It will just go over lines going over the countercept. And if I want to know where these lines belong, then I just go to the coding and the coding is telling me how this is. How you're associating an element of the counterceptor? This is really the plane identification. So this CH there, I identify with CH times, let's say zero times that's the edges. That CH is exactly 0. Or equivalently, and even more important, this is interval times CH quotient by the horizontal relation, which is xy related with x bar y bar, if and only if y was y bar. So they are in the same Yes. But it's an interval. But it's an interval. And that's why I identified in the most natural way possible with an interval. The first one. CH is the canter set of which is inside the interval. So, which is inside the interval. So, is the dynamical system the set of all pairs x, y were the x's in C P and the Y isn't C H? So, is the dynamical system set up the set of all pairs X Y where the X's and C P and the Y isn't CH? Exactly, exactly. That's the next step. So, okay, let me do the next step and then we go on again. Is a counterside inside an intrava. Intercept parametrizing those horizontal lines that continue these two sets. And this will correspond to the points that you can iterate for the future infinite many times and for the past infinite times and in the picture. Okay, let's go once again through it. So we have this F which is not defined on the whole plane. On the whole plane, so it leaves people outside after one iteration, but it maps this rectangle onto this rectangle, this rectangle. I'm sorry, just before you somehow C V cross C H then is subset of R2. You have R2 representing two different things. One is parametrizing lines. Lines. Other is the Cross CH is a subset of. In this picture is the parameterization. Very good point. So it is, in this picture, especially is a set of R2. Because in this case, you make two identifications. So the space of line is an interval, but it is also this interval. Is also this interval or that interval. May choose where you put it. Okay? So here I put this, it is an interval, but then I'm putting it into I times CH, so in the second coordinate. But you are right that here this is maybe 100% sphere. Let me call C hat H here, which is the corresponding. Which is the corresponding in this vertical of this space of horizontal lines. CH here. So if I hand you an element of CH. Yeah, you are handing me a point here. That's a point there. Exactly. If you have a point in R2, like XY, like X is thought of as the vertical line through the X, and the Y is thought of as X. Exactly, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. So that's a good thing. So you define the point X1 as intersection of As intersection of x times r intersected times one. So we think so now the CB across CH is identified both as the line to a pair of lines and also the intersection of a pair of lines. And and that is still very fair and it it's good actually to not really use the hundred percent same letter here. Same letter here from this interval to this. Which is the head? This is the hat. So this, this, all this is written here is inside R2. So all the hats. So this is the first coordinate of the second coordinate of R2. This is the first coordinate of R2. This is the CH here. This is the interval. This is the space of lines. Without the hands is the right. This is the space of lines, basically. This direct. Yeah, in this very special situation which this formula I wrote that applies. That are lines. This identification is essentially the identity identification. When I say that these two intervals, which is supposed to be the space of horizontal lines, and then I'm identifying them with intervals, truly, then these intervals are exactly one-to-one correspondent with this interval. Most obvious way, which is point x there goes to the point zero x theta. To the point 0x here, and with the points in the second coordinate of this R2. Now, when I go and move a little bit further, epsilon further, and I just draw this picture without giving you the formula, but just telling you that there is some volume here, which is, and it has the contraction and expansion property we discussed. Then, the space of lines, when I identify with the interval, Of lines when identify with the interval is just an identification, it's not coordinate to coordinate one to one. But there is a homeomorphism, also the diffimorphism, identification from here to there. And that's why the hats are more in order when I do these identifications. Because when I declare that this is an interval, then I'm doing some parametrization of space of horizontal volume. Dynamical system is just nothing but two to the Z with a shift. And this with the shift, which is understood as the forward shift here and the backward, forward, I don't know, output. So you always move to the left, but in this space you would move to the back and you are actually moving to the left. That's why I put the n minus here. And that's why there is an n minus. And that's why there is an F-management. I really don't see where this why there is a counter set. I mean, the way I understand it is you don't really have a counter. I mean, you don't know, maybe you have a counter set, but the important point is that you have this bernoulli shift which is going to factor on the this this. This set here, which is that intersection, you can see it in motion. So instead of going all the way to the cantoset, you can look at the first iteries, second iterates. And then you can look at these four squares here, which is the intersection of the rectangles. And these are the guys that stay one time for the future, one time for the past. And then you can go, second iterate, this will give two vertical lines. Give two vertical lines here, two vertical lines here, and then two horizontal lines here, two horizontal lines here, and then you get four here from here. You're keeping track of the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate, the point separately. Then you take the politics action, then you take the intersection of the two guys, and then you get the future difference. That's the core of most hyperbolic dynamics. With the point that this action doesn't is independent on both code. Yes, it's fully independent, exactly. What does the first is completely independent of what does the second is? So you get basically two. Yes, exactly. First. Nothing to turn to that. You've come up with some symbolic representation of the invariant set of this. That's anti-bolic, but it's more than that symbolic. So it's to try to understand this math, I only need to understand two one-dimensional maps. one-dimensional apps, non-invertogles. Happen to be essentially the same, but that's not so relevant. Important relevance is that I only need to know what happened with one direction for the future and what happened with the other directions for the past. That's important thing and why I am allowed to do that is because the horizontal lines are stable Are stable, which means they contract to the future, so they will do all the same thing for the future. And the vertical lines they contract for the past, so they will all do the same when you go for the past. Was it important that it's F and F inverse? On F on horizontal line is another one. SN wants it to be a shift, though. You want it to be the shift though, so it's gotta be one's gotta be the inverse. So essentially the point is that if you so you could do that, but then you need the recombinatorics to match. So you need some set that will remain forever and ever in this page. So you could still do like times two times minus two. times two. So on a circle times a circle. And yeah, you have exactly the same thing. You have now the multiplication of two forward shifts and that's a coding for this guy. But the phenomenon there is slightly different because you have expansion on one and expansion also on the other. And the reason why this is well behaved, because what you get on the circle and then the communicatorics, there is that the The points can be iterated infinitely many times and we don't have much problem. But even though this is some sort of robust phenomenon of this symbolic coding there, it's not robust in the sense that you have space of verticals and space of horizontal. You take times two times two and you say, okay, I just have something that looks like times two times two, but it's not quite that, then you will not have any more horizontals and verticals. You still will have squares doing Have squares doing what they have to do, but not this product of two one-dimensional dynamics. So, here, this is what produces the robustness of this behavior, that one is contracting and the other is expanding. And this tells me that actually it was not so important, it was times three and one-third. Anything that contracts verticals and anything that contracts horizontals and expands verticals would be issued. Essentially, what I need for this to be doing is too much. No, no, no, just me. So, what I need of this is just write down the two coordinates of this. I mean that the first derivatives of f1 be smaller than lambda smaller than one, the second derivative of f2. Second derivative of F2B larger than a sigma larger than one, and then I need the cross guys. So not to distort this contraction, so just a calculation of this. Valle epsilon, and that d1 of f is more than some epsilon. Okay? So this derivative of f and derivative of f and d1 s1 d I want this to be smaller than one, this to be larger than one and this to be small. So it's a perturbation of the diagram. That's all I mean. Why is it only natural numbers? No, it goes so this inclusion is a strict inclusion. Because the space of horizontals I get this, that's what I get. The second chord. I think I have the same question. I'm going to try to ask it in a different way. Suppose I hand you CH and C V sigma. Tell me how you read it. Tell me how you reconstruct. Okay. So if this. Okay, let's do that. Let's do that. Maybe that helps. Enter. Let's do it a little bit more. Half as the spatial map, unfortunately. Negative here. Let's have two positive here. So I have three symbols in one and two symbols in the other. What do you give two symbols here? Yeah, and now I make it harder, so I'm giving three symbols instead of two. Why are you doing that? Simba is the shimma is a shift. Yeah. So it's only a positive question. Okay, okay. You said I have to do that. I didn't think so. So you want point mass or you want the form mass? I want, so let's view F, your little F, your original little F, that's the down part of the version. Yes. Yeah. Reconstruct that from sigma. So you are giving me a point here and you want me to tell you what does this not do? No. I want you a point in R cross R and the principle space. So tell me what. Maybe you better take a point in R2, X, Y, and then say what the map is, map it into the 0, 1, and the Z. That might be more clear. Identification with the shift. Yeah, right. And map map. Yeah, right. So take that shift. Okay. I take an xy. Okay, now I understand. What can I understand? I take a point here and I have to tell you which is a point here which is the same. Okay, so I take this over Hats there, so this is the point E. There, so this is the point in R2. So I take this guy, this coordinate x, and it's in this very specific f, in the general this model. So I take this first coordinate x, and I bring it here very same x there, I drink it here. Same parameter. So if this is the very dry The radio line has to be between 0 and 1 side. It's actually vertical, right? Not horizontal. So this is CHSA. This is the Y times Pi over 9 over here. So I take this guy, Pi over 9, the very same Pi over 9 here. Exactly the same guy. Exactly the same guy. And here I have the coding which was given yesterday: which is this is the zero symbol, this is the one symbol. So the first entry here will be a zero, and then the next one will come from where I'm iterating here. Now, where I'm iterating here, if you don't want to look at this, you can also come here and do it right here. And do the point has some coordinate here? So the point could be anywhere there, it could have been here if you want. xy here, but the y coordinate was down here. So then I iterate here and only look at the second coordinate of what I need to fit. Always forget the first coordinate. And this again has this zero, one. This again has this 0, 1 coding. This 01 coding, let me, that's an important remark, here is between this R0 and R1, which is. And that's how I get one part of the coding, which is this part of the coding. I didn't get the other part of the coding yet. I have to do it. I have to do. To the other part of the coding, I take x, but then when I get x, which is an horizontal guy, I look at the coding for the inverse. xy, so this is the x coordinate of the point xy. So this lies in this segment, which is the point of the point. In this segment, horizontal segment. And when I look at F inverse on these two horizontal segments and the space of vertical lines, I get the same picture, but I'm looking at F inverse now, not at F. F inverse restricted to which is Now when I do this, I have a coding here, which will start with the one because the point is in the second place here. And then, since I'm doing inverse, I will write it to the direction. So I take the inverse in. So I take the inverse image of this point xy or xy of the whole vertical, because we would do the same, and it will be mapped into some other place. And this other place will be either here or here. And this is zero here. One depends on the other one. I'm still confused by signing shifts. Okay, let's because I didn't explain yet. I mean, one coordinate is going forward the time. So if I hand you a point, let's restrict F for the original magnet. Let's go to the point. We're using little F for two different things. So one is on this space. So even from F sub H and F sub I, it's not always how to do it. Yeah, so that's important, yes. Because here is why it is complicated. And this has to do with the complicated of writing this map here as a product. It's not so easy to write the shift map as a product of this direction and this direction. This direction and this direction. I want one detail idea to exactly but then you fix it. That's crucial. I didn't explain that yet. But that's just the standard way you constructed it. Yeah, because you can't remember. It's just the itinerary of the point and the system, I guess. So you have a way to remember what was the signal position. But you not remember. Forward now, then you're not impaired on your own vertical sets. Well, that way, because of the protocol is to assess your statement. Okay, let's do the shift first. Let's do the shift first. Because the point of the shift is not important. And in this direction, I'm using the shift. In this direction I'm using the shift. In this direction I'm using the inverse of the shift, but the shift is not inverted, so how could I use the inverse of the shift? Let's solve this. This is where I use the shift. So I do x1, x2, so x1, x2, x2. Now here I want to use the inverse of the shift. Now the problem is I don't know where I come from. If I only I don't know where I come from if I only look to this side. But I have the full information now. So I know who is whether I came from a zero or I came from a one. Okay, so these coordinates were after all not in defense. After all, when figuring out the white. You need to know how to shark from one to the other. Yes. Yes, alright. So, so, but let me now rewrite this in the slightly shortened version. So I take Take, I write the point x, a double sequence as a negative sequence times a forward sequence, and then I actually let me just put as a coordinate pair, then the shift of C, I will think of this as the shift of X plus, but now in this coordinate, I have two. Coordinate, I have two branches of inverses for the sigma. And here t equals q's. I use the zero coordinate of this x dot. And then I apply it to x bar magnus where t zero of x is zero minus is zero x minus. is 0 x minus and t one of x minus is x minus 1 is the two branches of inverse of this and then this dynamics is not 100% product so it's the cosycle dynamics are the base coordinate the base and then the second coordinate we do depending on what We do depending on what the first call is. Seems very similar to this, what do they call this, the natural extension of the menu? It is a natural extension, actually. And it is. It is exactly a natural extension. So this is the natural extension. But I don't know about that. Could you read the third line from the bottom? Just tell me what I said. So this one? The third line from the bottom. One, two, three. Yes, sigma x bar. Symbol swar is Tx naught plus x bar minus. X bar minus. X bar minus that's the past okay comma sigma X bar plus what is T T X naught so T 0 so X naught is either 0 or 1 so T 0 of X minus is X minus 0 and T 1 of X minus is X minus is X minus 1. So it's the two branches of inverses that are the right inverses of the system. Composed height is and will be about two variables. So x minus 0. So it's the concatenation of the sequence. So you started with 0 and then you so it's a bit in this way because the x minus is the opposite t 1 of x minus 1 and is x minus and a 1. That's what it was a 1 I'm starting to property yeah. Because the cylinder goes into everything and the branches of inverse goes from everything. Which is from the picture, this branch of inverse inverse map from here to the first map. This is how a way to understand the data. A way to understand the shift on this product space. It's not actually a shift instead. It is a shift. See, because if I take this, okay, I can write it this way, but I can write it also the same way, where this is x plus, this is x minus, and it is exactly the product space. It is exactly the product space, and I get exactly this. So, this is x plus, this is x minus, and this is mapped into this sigma x plus and this dx map of x minus, but this is the complete sequence, and it is the shift map. On the full shift space. On the full shift map, yes. So, this is So this is this writing is essentially the inverse limit type of writing of the shift map, but it's a complete writing when you do this, which I do not even know whether it's an identification, it's an equality of this product or this product. So it is it is important to understand the shift of the bilateral shift as this guy where the positive guys know what to do, the negative guys don't know exactly what to do, they only need to know where the zero position of the positive guys were. Of the positive guys where they have to be because you are doing the inverse of the negative shift and not on the inverse of the negative shift. Are you shifting like this? Yeah, so it's not. I'm doing sigma inverse sigma inverse here. Are you adding one more point? No, down the lower one, you have the x, the x. One you have X, so we have a coordinate. Anyway, you're not maybe that's pointing to the degree is not always based on the X, it's actually just simple ship market shift. Yes, yes, yes, this is the most standard shift in the standard ship mark. So then I don't understand two by one. Okay, that's that's so just call this positive guy X man, X plus, and this X plus and this that is price X. And now I want to know what happens with this shift. And we know what happens. So this is the zero position, this is the diagram, and the shift is the shift, so you know what it does. So you might have x0 here, x1, and the zero position now is here. Now, this Now, this guy now is this sigma of x plus, so it's the plus part, which is the projection into this coordinate, and this guy is the sigma of x matrix. Now, what is sigma of x plus? If this was x plus, this is exactly the same to sigma of x plus plus plus plus plus to sigma of x plus inside because now what is sigma of x minus now it is the same I have here but with x z I have x minus but then I'm adding x 0 which is the branch of fingers of the guy so it is Common for I mean, um so you have this baker's map um on the on the square, you know? I think what we are doing is pretty much, you know, simply we just removed one half and make this for packets matching. One of the inverses is the papers. One of the universities is the paper's up, and which one you take is like dictated by the first word. Because you need to know whether you are here or you are here. No, this is important because this is the basis. So, all the others just add some combinatorial sum. So, once you understand this model in the similar situation of hyperbolic maps, or maps which has one contracting direction and one expanding direction, just put some combinatorics on it. Put some combinatorics on it, and you do the same as here. And you always have a nice symbolic model, maybe with a Markov symbol. Yeah, that's what it is, exactly. The axiom A are the guys where it looks like this, that we have an horizontal contracting direction and a vertical, which is not even horizontal because in any dimensions you have a direction of construction of contraction and Construction of contraction and the direction of expansion. This is for C. This is for C actions. Yeah, all what I said is for C actions, yes. When you have a flow, you can do something very similar. But you need a way of going to the future and a way of going to the past. So you need that. I don't know exactly what actually means, but I've heard that. Isn't that related to the specification properties? It is actually. That comes out something when you apply this to other enumeration systems. Yes, this is the specification actually is right here in the specification part is what you need to get the set of generic points in the system, is Python with the same thing. Yes, exactly. So the the point is that you so that's the maximum of the shift. So that's the massive of the shift onto symbols. So if you want an orbit now that for the future it stays two times here, three times here, then you don't care for a while, then you want as well to be three times here, eight times there, and so on. And then for the past you want to specify what it wants to do for that iterative. In the shift you can do explicitly. Because it's the full shift. That's a really nice connection. Yeah, that's the full shift. Now, when you The full shift. Now, when it is a Markov shift, so if you want to specify your orbit up to the following accuracy, which is I want the orbit to stay the first three traits in this rectangle, then I want to shunk here once, come back here to do it five here, then 85 times there, then two more times here, and continue. And also for the past. Here and continue. And also for the past, upon specifying what you want to do, you find the point is here, which cannot be there because I said it started five times here. So it's here, which will stay five times here, and it will jump over there, stay five times there, and do what that's that's in a sense is is uh is even more which is This even more, which is that's a one-specification, but in this case, it's because you have the shift on two symbols, the full shift on two symbols. So there are some situations where you don't have the full shift. So this will be something like the following. Take out filter counters, for example. The first one goes into here. Goes into here, second one goes into here, but the third one, and other than that it's pretty much linear or almost linear as before. Then I can do pretty much the same as before, but then I will not have this nice quotient by horizontal sign and verticals because it's not a full product. Still, I can look at what happened with horizontal and what happened with verticals. And I have these rectangles. Angles, these three symbols, and I can now look at the orbits that I can iterate for the future and for the past. And what I can identify is the dynamics here, which is subshift, which I put any for no reason yet. F of R0, this is F of R1, and this R of R1. And then I cannot specify everything here, that I can only actually iterate points in some subshapes, because I can never go from the symbol three Go from the symbol 3 back to the symbol 3. On the symbol 3, I can only go to the symbol 0. Well, 2 is the symbol 2, so I can only go to the symbol 1. But other than that, I'm allowed everything that this guy here is allowed. That's the Markov shift, where the Markov matrix here is going from. I'm going from this macros matrix. So, this is telling me from which symbol to which symbol I can shine. So, I can go from symbol 1 to symbol 1, from symbol 1 to 2. I cannot go from symbol to go from 1 to 3. I cannot go from 3. I can go here and there, and these sigma A are the space of sequences which are allowed by this matrix. It's like a beta shift, but that's only one step. Well, i i i i i i it is it is a beta shift for the Pissot situation. When it is not a Pissot number, then it's not Markovian, and then you don't have such nice matrix, actually. Yeah, so it's not like a one step. A beta shift doesn't just touch one step. Exactly. Well, the beta shift, yeah. The point is that in general, unless the beta is very special, you never stop to remove guys. In this case, it's called finite type because you only have to do it finitely. Because you only have to do it finitely many times, and that's why it's much better coding in this respect. So, and in this case, now specification is a little bit very strong, but it's a little bit less strong than this. It's stronger than in the beta shifts. So in this case, you ask, okay, I want now an orbit which again stays three times here, then go and do four times here, and eight times. Times here, eight times there, and then so on and so forth. Then I have some sort of a problem because I can never go from zero, from the second place back to the second place. So if what I was asking was to take two times here, then I cannot. So I have to leave at least one step in between. Tell me that I can go back here. So Go back here. So I want the word that does this for some time, and then a word that does all pieces of words that are allowed by this, and then yet later it does 3, 2, 0, 0, and 1. So then I can find a word that does this, then wait one iterate and does this. And does this, then no need to wait, that's the specification. Well, you can specify strings of words which are allowed, and then you find the orbit which, after waiting some finite amount of time, waiting periods you have to wait depends on how many zeros appears here. And in the case of beta shifts, you don't have exactly a finite matrix there. You may need to wait even more. You may need to wait even longer pieces, but then it's a discussion of the false presentation. Exactly. It doesn't satisfy the weak points. Exactly. That's an application that we don't have to say. Exactly, exactly. Yes. What is it simple? It is this guy, which you cannot go from the R2 back to the R2 position. This. Okay, that's what I was saying. From the two to the And again, in general, in most action-based systems, so in the hyperbolic systems, you always can find this rectangle which is called the Markov partition, and which does this Markov property. It allows you essentially to look at the space of horizontals and the space of verticals. And you have, for example, And you have a matrix, a finite matrix essentially, the amount of rectangles that tell you from which place you can go. And your dynamics is coded by this. Not fully homeomorphic, but in a finite-to-one way and almost one-to-one. So this is very explicit where it is top name. I can keep on going. How long? Uh do you think you're scheduled at the end of the hour? Oh, I have more time. Okay, then I go and I go to the next. But okay, so that's the thing. Okay, and we set up Can I ask a general question? Yes, yes. Can you say something about what kind of systems would satisfy this axiom A? Yes. What kind of physical systems might satisfy it? Okay, I was going to examples that there are very explicit examples coming from uh and real testimonials of that change. Yeah, I was supposed to write that down. Okay, that's why it's not take F times manifold, compact manifold, here from N to N, we see one interface on. And if is called action A V field error Okay, so it's this colour there was an X on V that was coming to not use but so if you have If you have a tangent space, it splits in two spaces. So for every x, oh, sorry. If you take the periodic point of f, you take the closure of it, I didn't make one definition. One definition, I let me define it later so this is non-wandering points points that have some non-winding property at our distribution and the second is that for m dx is non-winding set The Pxm split as a direct sum of an contracting direction and an expanding direction. This is an invariant set, so I allow it to treat it. And then you put a sigma here, and then this is just for sigma variables s and u. So both guys are invariant by iteration and there exist an n positive. positive lambda less than one positive cost independent of X actually I can from this end just lambda and a smooth Riemannian metric on n such that the mutual arithmetic is because I want to measure the lengths of vectors. So if I take a vector in Ps, which gets contracted by lambda, this P is A S. And if I take a vector And if I place a vector in the EU, then it's get expanded by the individual. For x or this norm, this x is an object vector. Every vector is contracted or expanded, which is this you can show that under these conditions this vector. Under these conditions this will be true. Not so trivial from here, because I need to specify explicitly which is this influential set. And that's why for the very specific example I gave, the d3 were 2 were 0, and so you have funders and that's more complicated from this definition, but still it's true. But this is the definition of action base. So you have complementary directions, one is Elementary directions, one is uniformly contracted, the other is uniformly expanded at every point. Now, just brief definition of wondering set. So, x is wondering if there exists u neighborhood of x such that fk of u intersect of q is ending for every k. Ending forever. I use it. Never comes back unless it's auto. And it's non-wondering if it is out wondering. Wondering is by definition an open condition, so non-wondering if it's close. And again, as whether it's an invariant condition, the wandering, so this is. Yeah, essentially that, yes. And I'm telling you, these case units. So the length was uniformity of the experimental experiment. Yes, it's very important uniformities to break out this full tube. So if you don't have the uniformities, you still can do quite a bit, but we have to start to fight against a lot of stuff. And there are then infinite Markov shifts, that's somewhat new results by Ompisario and Omni. new results by Ompisario and Omi Omkis Padiana, that you could do quite a bit of the same things like that at Mongols. XMAs, as I understand it, gives you some form of specification, right? Yes, actually. Yeah, so It says that if f reach action A, then this non-wandering set of F can be written as one K. So these are compact unbelievable sets. Compact. Compact and for any omega i there is for this part I have to add some other names Owen, Agir and Weiss, Sky. But for every omega i there is a matrix A I n by n matrix N by N I by N R matrix I don't even need to do this decomposition. Okay, let me not do this decomposition. Let me not do this decomposition. Do it the shortest version of it. Sorry. I think it's correct what I'm going to do. So, times faster, there exists an entrix n 0, 1 matrix A, so the entries are 0 and 1. And shift of So sigma A is the space of sequences X such that A X i X i plus 1 is 1 here Here one pi from sigma k into fine one. Almost one to one. It's almost one to one, meaning that the place where it is not one to one has some reasonable description. And the shift space then satisfies specification because it's a it's a nice mind. Well, it does, okay. It does not satisfy specification due to the following, or it does, okay, yeah, it does because the definition of specification for CMI is the words you are given are. Is the words you are given aloud. But let me be more specific in that. Because what I wrote is not historically accurate, so the proof were in several steps actually, but the proof for the matrix is even simpler than the proof for the for the F. So essentially you can decompose You can decompose the way you would decompose the matrix into irreducible parts and also into further totally reducible parts. So I will do it here for the non-mandelum of f, but it's the same you do the composition you do for the sigma space. This is the union of omega i's, which f of omega i is omega i, and f. And F restricted to only is topologically transitive. So this here is written as being union of some subscripts BI, and each of these guys now has BI irreducible, meaning that every entry That every entry every A B will exist an N such that B pi N K B less than zero and further you can further decompose each of these ombula i as un of lambda j i j where A well k of lambda j i s j equals to 1 minus j equals to i is lambda j plus 1 i, so it's a cyclic ordering. And this we are further decomposed here into this permutation test for the matrix. Some combinatorial fact. So So and then f i restricted is lambda j times j what is called topological indexing which corresponds to asking the matrix P A to be totally reducible. Same power that requires entirely for A Physological mixing translates from general diases for every open set there exists at n, open sets q and v, there exists under n such that f minus n of u interface. So iterate and Iterate and then you don't stop don't don't stop intersecting stop yeah I can evolve that yes yes okay are there any questions? Any questions? I'll save ourselves the question and answer session. Anyone online, any questions? I have a question. So you had perhaps mentioned this before, but when you were looking at the maps on the Horspru map, you had mentioned that you can extend it to a different office of system. And I'm guessing that that would be at the actual ectomorphism. But then you had these three bars and you had this map which looked like a golden meme but somewhat different. So if I draw any such sequence of bars which lets us essentially you know you have an encoding of a shift of finite type, does it always extend to a shift of finite type? Uh To a strict finite type? Is there always some extension of such a map to a strict finite type? To an extreme of the scripts? So, yes, on the well, this holds through yes, it does. So, for the non-1 there is a, so it extends to an action A map. So, you have this property. Now, if you give any shift of finite type, I think there is, I'm not 100% sure, I think there may be some orientability problem and some. Some combinatorics. If you want to do it as here, I think on surface you can do it all the way. People mention three. Okay. Alright, if there's any other questions, maybe you could ask the speaker later. Let's thank Federico again for 30 seconds. And let's start the next talk in about five minutes. So we're about 9:35.
