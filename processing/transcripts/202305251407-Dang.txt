Where we were last time. So let me recall the setup. So we have a given rational map, F from PD to E D. It encodes and we're actually interested in some families of polynomials, chi n defined by Defined by inductively given by a recursive relation. So p0 at some power. Let's leave here. Sorry. P0 at some power d to the power n of mu lambda times carry n of mu lambda r composed with f of mu lambda. So those So, those are, if you want, the inductive relation for the characteristic polynomial of the Markov operators on each triangle of level L. Okay, and so far, what we have seen is that the volume of F minus F. F minus n of the pullback of the height of plane, H, the height of plane in P D P K sorry, is exactly the degree of F n okay and the degree of F n was you write F n in coordinates. You write f n in coordinates and in homogeneous coordinates, you have to write them as x0, xk gives p0, an input like this, p k and some polynomials, homogeneous polynomials of degree. And I call that degree the degree of f. Okay? And now the good. Now, the goal is okay. So, basically, what this relation says that the volume of f to the n of h is roughly speaking like exponential, and the speed of growth is lambda one of f is the limit of the volume. Of the volume of f n star of h at the power one over n. Okay, roughly speaking, and that governs, this is going to be true for any for a hyperplane, but actually for any hypersurface, this formula, you just have to multiply by the degree of your hypersurface. Okay, so. Okay, so the important guiding the business is not this one, the degree of the initial hypersurface, but the growth of the components of FN. Okay, and so the goal today is to give some analysis, to give some analytic tool to analyze this formula and And I hope to convince you that the tools that I'm going to introduce are going to be relevant in the study of joint spectrum. So contrary to Katena's talker, we will not be able to show that, for example, go as far as saying that the spectrum will be pointed. Uh, will be will be point fixed on or singular continuous, but we might get atomicity at least at the end of the uh of this talk, okay, in certain situations. Okay, so my plan is to introduce what's called currents, okay, complex, complex currents. And uh, so I will first give some formal definition. Some formal definition. Then I will give some examples. Then I'm going to talk about, okay, it's nice to define abstract objects, but then we will have some topology on it. This is This is why we are interested in them. And B, so this is geometric. There is no F in the story. Then we inject the story of what we call dynamical currents. Okay, so how can you cook up some generalization of measures and routes? Measures on Julia set, but here they are going to be currents supported by big Julia sets. Okay, so those dynamical currents are called ring current when they exist. Okay, and so this is in the style of organized Sibony Sibony and Diller Duja Avant Gage. Do the account gauge. And then I'm going to talk about local potentials. Potentials. And the main aspect of local potentials is equidistribution. So, what I want to convince you is that, in fact, understanding joint spectrum, so the limit of the zeros of this polynomial is a hard problem. But it turns out that this hard problem is very closely related to a hard problem in dynamics, and which is equity taking a curve, taking its pullback, and saying whether this. Pullback and saying whether this pullback converges to the dynamical current, which is the twin current. And of course, if you want to continue with the story, maybe you have a limiting object. It might be satisfactory to some, but then you want to analyze the structure of this current. And if you know enough information, you might be able to say R, which is a has this property, like it would give me. It would give me pure point or something else. So let's start with the formal definition. So formal definition. So carrots were invented by Durham to solve a geometric problem. And so he defined it as follows. T is a KK current PQ current if T is a linear form So it's in the dual and snooze. Pick your thoughts. Okay. With compact support, but we are in projective space. I don't need to specify this. So what is the smooth spectrum form? Can I ask you, do you want to add that? Is that can I ask you? Do you want to add the adjective continuous? Yes, yes, yes. Got it. Yeah, but I wanted to. Okay. Continuous. Yes. Are we displaying? Sorry. Are we projecting k space? Yes. Okay. Okay. Continuous. But maybe I want to avoid the semi-norms or to define all the semi-norms. But basically, Durham invented it just after. Durham invented it just after Schwartz defined distributions. Distributions, first you need to put some seminar on topology on smooth functions and then define distributions as a continuous dual of those. Okay? And now what we do is like the same. You're going to put the same type of topology except that your objects are going to be forms. So function times forms, basically. Okay? So Basically. Okay, so a PQ form is a sum like this of alpha I write in multi-indices. So the cardinal of I equals P, the cardinal of J equals Q, and then I get some Tzi wedge DZJ bar. So this is again in multi-indices. So this is TZI1 wedge I one with DZ I T wedge D Z J one bar with DZ J Q bar. Okay? So this is what I denote by dzi which DZ J bar. Okay, and the coefficients here are most functions. Okay, and so T is a guy like this and gives us a real number. So we denote by we denote the pairing T against alpha, and so this is the number. So the same as the pairing, real number, yeah, fit number. Real number? Yeah, field number. It's like okay. And I will need also some boundary operators. Okay, this is so it's like if I have the d bar derivation, it against alpha, well, it is e against the bar of alpha times minus one p pass q. Okay. Okay, so and same d bar of t, I define, we define it by duality is t against d bar of alpha times minus one equals two. Okay, in upsetting, p will be equal q, so there is no why are the values real and we can object numbers? Those are sinfinite functions real with the functions real with real values and then we don't have a pressure because then this is yeah so it eats some complex numbers but it it has values in r it's very important because that's why um if you only work with real curvans everything with kinesis but here that that is a risk yes okay so now um So now, examples. Very important examples. And those curves were invented to interpolate between smooth things and singular things. And what we are interested in our case is singular things. But let's talk about the good guys. So if I have a smooth function on dk then we associate T5 which takes alpha 3k pound Okay, and you mark it to keep phi against alpha is the integral of phi times alpha. Phi times alpha on paper. Okay, it is legit because alpha is a KK form. I can multiply it by a function and I get still a KK form and we can integrate on. And we can integrate on PK. So every function is a KK current. Okay? We learn about functions, now measures. So Dirac at the point A. So if I have pair A in PK, Dirac at A takes what? That A takes what? Well, it takes P, a smooth function. And this rack of A against P is P of A. Okay, so you get measures. Cool. Now, I want something more geometric because we Something more geometric because we want to have curved hyper surface. So let's say the smooth guys, geometric guys. So if I have beta smooth D minus K and K minus P K minus B form. We associate T beta. So can you guess it? So I take alpha. So I take alpha and I do alpha wedge beta and the integral on P at the power of K. So this now alpha has to be a P P form, smooth form, okay, and it matches because P plus K minus P is KK, so we get something like this. So, this guy is called the smooth current. In fact, it's the equivalent of this guy. This phi was a smooth function and it ate some KK forms. And here you have some beta, some linear combinations of smooth things, functions, times, forms, so you just complete them. So you just complete one. Now, the singular elements are the interesting ones. So let's take V, an algebraic subvariety of dimension. Dimension P inside inside P inside PKP. Then it's like evaluating here. Instead of evaluating, we are going to integrate. So Pb, what I denote by D, is going to eat alpha, and we are going to Alpha, and we are going to integrate alpha from V. Well, let me put V ready. So, this is the smooth part of V. Okay, your equations might have, you might define V by some intersections of equations. Nothing told you it was smooth, so you have to refix the smooth part and then integrate on it. Well, conserve this. It well conserved this. This is a current, and so now alpha has to be also a pre-p form. Smooth form. Okay, so that's the smooth version of this guy, and that's the singular one. Okay, so we have to understand these elements as regularizations of these guys. Okay? And it And it has a specific situation that this is D closed. So D bar of V equal V bar of V equals zero. Okay. This analogy subvariety is closed in our K. Okay. Okay. And now, funny thing, we can add a small We can add the smooth functions, we can add measures in between them. So we can do this game. So let's see if I have V and W two sub-varieties of dimension P. Then we can look at this, we can look at linear combination, let's say 10 times V minus minus two sevenths w okay because we can sum linear force and so this this new current here is going to be supported where it's going to be supported on v union w this is supported on v union w but you put some multiplicities like like like with measures okay and Okay? And so, like with measures, we're going to define the mass. So, what's the mass of this current? Well, you just the positive part, you keep it, and the negative, you reverse it. So, let's say the mass of this, this is a current of mass. Well, Well ten times volume of V plus two sevenths times volume of W okay and imagine you did this with dirac masses that's how you would define them okay and except that here you have to add the volume of those elements okay all right All right. Any questions? Okay, so now we have now we can go to the now that we have very abstract objects, some examples of them. Now we want convergence of the support of those characteristic polynomials. So to get convergence, we need a topology. The topology. And so you decrete that Tn converges to T if and only if for every alpha P P form T n against alpha converges to T alpha. Okay, so that's what you what we used to do in You, what we used to do when we define distribution, and so this is called the weak topology, and it has this very convenient property. Okay, so let us see how this convergence. I gave some examples. Examples. So it is geometric. Let's say you have 50. 50 some polynomials, sum of Ai of T Xi. And you want to look at P T of X equals zero. And this is an algebraic subvariety. You can look at the current of integration along and AI are continuous functions on T. Okay, then as T tends to zero, zero then this is going to convert to p zero of x equals zero okay it uh so it is geometric it can be geometric you can make the coefficient converge to zero there is even a better some some uh some uh weak compactness some weak compactness uh properties and this is why it's And this is why we define this topology. The real reason why you PPP called Q I'm sorry, can you read? So you find for help would be PP form. Is there a reason why don't do that for PQ form? Oh, because you can do this for PQ forms, but I'm only interested in sub-varieties. Complex varieties. So the tangent space is 112233KK. So this is why I yes, in practice you have to do everything. Yes. So those coefficients is zero? Yes, they can vanish. There's an issue about that. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. I need to make also the dominant term. A dominant term, I mean, you don't want maybe all the dominant terms to you want the degree to be the same, yes. Yeah, you make sure that okay, of the same degree. The degree of PT equals the degree of zero. Yes, I'm sorry. You're actually, if I put everything equals zero, then there is no, no, you're actually to the right. Okay. But uh if you want uh uh x equal x equal t to converge to x equals zero as students need zero. That's what I was meaning. So it's really geometric in this sense. So are you so I guess you're taking this to be homogeneous for all those okay. But also you I don't want any vanishing any decree lowering phenomenon when T equals 0. Phenomenon when T Cozo. I was careless on this. Okay, with compactness now. So if there is a sequence and Pn is of mass bounded of mass bounded then Then let's say the mass we denote it by smaller than one, then it's like measures, then there exists a sub-sequence converging, and that's what interests me because now we can make sense of convergence of those. Of convergence of those zeros of characteristic polynomials, provided we normalize accordingly. But the normalization is the volume. So when you take tie n equal, so if you look, so this the application I have in mind is if you look at tie n equals zero, so this is an algebraic sub variety, you can look at the capital. Variety, you can look at the current of integration on it divided at this volume, okay n for zero. Then, if we extract such sequences, this has a tendency to convert. Okay, and so let us see a first phenomenon. A first phenomenon of convergence in a dynamical context. So how long do I have? So let's see an example, a dynamical example. So if you have f from C2 to C two given by X Y gives X Y square x square y. Okay, and let's say you want to understand the growth of cremages of the varieties or points by f. So let's start with the point. So let's start with phi naught equals x naught y naught. Okay? And we are interested in the distribution of three images from u n. Of three images, mu n equals one over two to the power n, the sum over f n of p equal p naught. And then I put dirt at p. Then where does it converge to? Well, this is a sequence of measures, so we know how this behaves. So this is a Lebesgue measure on S. On S1 times Y0. Okay? And we have to say that X0 did not come 0. Okay, so that's the situation. We are well known. So basically, this is the, I'll say, this is the Julia set of X square. So points under three images are going to converge to the base measure on the circle. And this is And this is an equidistribution statement. Okay? And what is what if you start now with the x0? That is x equal x0. Well, it exactly mimics what happens to p, except that we're looking at all the fibers over x naught. But x naught starts equidistributing on the circle. So basically, So basically, one over two to the power n f minus n of v x0, the current of integration is going to converge to the following integral, one over two pi, the integral between zero and two pi, theta, and the integral on beta. So how do you do you have to think of this? So, how do you have to think of this? It's like this formula here. We were allowed to sum currents. So, if we are allowed to sum currents, we can integrate currents. Yeah, it's like summing. Okay? Excuse me, what is the limit of the measures there? It's the Lebesgue measure of what? The Lebesgue measure on S1 times on the circle in the X coordinate times Y dot. Yes, yes, yes. Important, I need to do the picture. So, you have the okay. I'm going to do a fake picture. So, this is the x coordinates, so the c coordinates in x, and the fiber coordinates, the y coordinates, which is also c, I put a line, I put a in dimension one. So, basically, what happens is you have this, you have the circle here, and you have the circle on y now. You have the circle on why not. Okay, so that's the measure where this guy lives. Okay, and the parameter, the parameter is something that contains this thing. So it's the cylinder, but with some geometry. It's a sum of verticals over S1. Okay. So it's a foliation by complex curves, vertical curves like this. And this is like in the spirit of the triggershoot map, where it was a foliation by hyperbolas. Okay? And yeah, but this is the toy model in this business. And so those are the leaves of the current. This big teta is the leaves. Are the leaves of the pyramid? And this data is the transverse measure. Okay, and in this situation, what this data is absolutely continuous with respect to the Laudenhaf measure, but the general model thing is you want to have this, you want to apply it to this situation. Arrive to this situation. Okay, and now here is the bone. Once we have done all this work, now we have a bonus for you. Is that now we can decide whether the joint spectrum has an actual VCP property or not. Application to the joint spectrum is the joint spectrum. So we have this controversy formula k n plus 1 mu lambda equals v zero. zero at the power d to the power n times chi n of f new lambda now assume assume that lambda one of L is strictly smaller than D where D where E to the power Where e to the power of n was the size of our Scheiger gas. Okay, so you have two numbers that come into the game. What f does, so f roughly speaking, multiplies by lambda to the power n, the degree of our pullbacks. Okay, and what it interests you from your physical problem, if I may, is like your candidate. Is like your characteristic polynomials or the grade B to the power of n. If there is a non-matching like this, then T, which is the limit of chi n plus chi n equals zero divided by the volume of chi n equals zero is a current. Is a command any limit, so any limit, so any limit, regardless whether it is unique or not, is the current supported canyons. And so you're in this situation. So this kerality is basically smaller than something like this: sum of AK DK. Well, the sum of AK volume of EK is sum of sorry. Who's lambda one F? Sorry? Who's lambda one F? Ah, lambda one F was the limit of N tends to press infinity of the volume of n of H of the power. At the power one over L. Okay, it was the Asab Tuti Kenkov pullbacks. Why is this program occurring? Sorry? I think only in I'm sorry, I just want the example. I know some have been, but it's my fault. Quote many hyper surfaces. You're right. And if you compare to the situation, now let's say you want to slice by mu equals some parameters. What you want to do is slice this part. I mean, it's not so easy to do, but if you could, then you would get like some atomic measures. So they don't accumulate like this previous example in a long time. That's very interesting. So in this case, what it shows is that you get some sequence hypersurface of VK, because it's summable. You can isolate the first part and then you can look at the rest. And if you want to see where the rest accumulates, then it's gonna. Then it's gonna, in principle, it should accumulate to some green, to some green, to some occurrence of this form. But that's only if you show that every, starting from a random hyper surface, you take its pullback and divide by lambda one to the power n, it converges to something. And so here is the here is why this is automatic once you know why it follows from this. Why it follows from this formula basically. In fact, why do you have a less than or equal to the limit actually be on the right? No, on the right, on the right side. So here it's going to be d to the power n. I'm sorry. It's going to be d to the power n. It's going to be important, yes. So can you. But on the next panel of the board, you have t is less than or equal to this sum of corrective integration. No, yeah, just that right there. Just that right there. Yeah, I mean, you actually have equality. No, yeah, yes, you will have equality, but I don't want to care about the denominators. So there is, if you work a little bit, you can have an equality. But the book I'm going to show today is going to give us an inequality. So basically, the Basically, what you do is you do the following. You write where are the zeros content with multiplicity of this function. But the zeros contained with multiplicity of these functions are inside the zeros of this guy and plus the zeros of this guy. So saying this is saying that chi n plus one, that's why I get an inequality, equals zero, is smaller. is smaller than uh d to the power n d zero plus chi n composed with n just to make sure what do you mean with the currents like the real arm is smaller uh okay there are things that you you might um i would want i what i want to say is that if i have uh uh other numbers uh positive numbers yeah i get positive numbers on on uh on a pt on uh here k minus one k minus one positive forms and positive uh forms are of the form uh sum of dz i which dz i bar but in in principle you have to think of this i didn't want that's why i i didn't want to write them you have to think that okay you have a currency Okay, you have a terrance that is supported on one, two, three, four curves. And then this side is supported on four curves, while this side is only supported on those three curves on curved with multiplicity. Okay, coffee, coffee. It's because it's a little bit positive current. Yeah. Yeah. I was just a mute comment to clarify six. So the currents are just about beginning. The currents are just the polylinear functionals of the forces. And it's positive polylinear functionals. So on the set of the polylinear functionals, we have the so-called mixed car topology. So every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence. This is why we have this convergence. But also this convergent integration of a variety and variant that's always positive. That's correct. Yeah, they are the equivalent of direct mass at the point. Mass at a point, okay. Yeah, you have to think of them if everything was a point, this makes sense. So, okay, and we integrate on positive functions. So, yeah. But let me let me now we divide by d to the power n. So, then what happens is we divide by d to the power n plus one. So, chi n plus one equals zero divided by d at the power of n plus one is going to be smaller than what? Going to be smaller than what? T0 over D. That's where you pick up some countably, some countable stuff. Okay. Plus, chi n composed with f equals zero divided by d to the power n. And now you do a telescopic sum. So what f does? It says that it wants to pull back and the volume is going to grow like lambda to the power. Light lambda to the power n. So you get some geometrics, some geometric behavior here. So I see that so the factors in front give you the sort of decreasing sequence. Exactly. And then at the end, so broadly speaking, those AK are lambda to the power k over dk. Okay? And actually, in the basilica case, for example, in all the cases, if you show that there's a limiting object, There's a limiting object, it's going to satisfy some functional equation of the form L star minus D identity applied to T equals L naught, some currents A naught. That's in certain examples in Basilica case. So that's that joints your question. It's going to be sum over lambda k over d k and it's going to be an inequality because you can invert this sum like a resolvant type formula. Okay? Okay, so for free you get and this and when you expand you continue your expansion this is going to give you Is going to give you that is smaller than a sum like this. And so, in terms of what the spectrum is, it's going to tell you, if you slice it correctly, that measure is atomic. Okay, the spectral measures is atomic. But the density of state is atomic. Okay, so I have the only. Again, what's the condition? What's the density of the density of just this one? Just this one. Well, I mean, when I say just, you have to cap in all the examples we know, you just have to compute it and you are lucky. And it's smaller than at least. And we don't need any conditions on F. If you have a general statement that says lambda one is this number, always smaller than d, automatically. Okay? But you have to slice too. Okay, so now what if you are in this very fortunate condition? So you know you have some curves that are going to accumulate, that are going to be, you have some comfortable sums of curves. Now we want to analyze the situation more precisely. So when you More precisely, so when you have a power series like this, you want to understand where is the rest of the power series. And so you are still forced to study the green current and the dynamical current. So I run out of time. So, let me give a positive statement at least about the green current. So, I take X, a blower of P two. So, let me say that this existence of green currents has been established in. So, this version that I am going to state is similar to Japan Gauge. And assume you have some blow-up of P2. Some blow-up of P2, and here I am in dimension two, and assume that F so a technical statement F is called algebraically stable, algebraically stable. So, this condition is that no curves. Is that no curves under iteration hits indeterminacy points? So basically, every contracted curves are going to contract elsewhere from to the indeterminacy set. And assume that lambda one square, lambda one square of f is bigger. Is bigger, strictly bigger than the topological degree of F. Then there exists a unique class theta in cohomology. So this is like a generalization of H2 such as Such an part of H yes, yes, but it's a double, it's a yes, it's a splitting of H2. What is important is the next thing, is that so those for x equal p2, this is just the class of a line. So we are not saying anything because everything is generated by the class of the line. The second part says something. The second part says something is that there exists a unique current T theta which satisfies the good condition that F star of T theta equals lambda one of F T theta. So that's the candidate, the candidate current and in it is in the And it is in the same class as in H11. Okay, so this is on some blow-up of B2. Yes, on some blow-up of P2. So there will be the line plus acceptable. Yes, exactly. Maybe you have. So in Basilica, you have to blow up four times. In the Grigorshu group, you blow up two points. Two points in the oats, no, yeah, four points in the regression group, and in Hanoi, also like two points. But you get the equivalent of this current here in this 80 example here, okay? And but the story is not finished here. Once you have this current, nothing told you that it was related to your problem. It was related in your problem here, okay. And the next, the last thing you have to do, well, not the last thing, before the last thing, is you have to say that now I take chi zero equals zero, its pullback is going to converge when I divide by lambda one to the power n, it's going to converge to t theta. So that is an equidistribution theorem. And then if you want to study further more the Furthermore, the joint spectrum, you have to say that this kerometic theta has this type of geometry, but it is foliated, like in this situation. So it's like in a Roland stroke. There is a magical foliation, and you can follow the spectrum when you move the parameter of new. And so let me say also that this condition of existence of green theorem. Existence of green parent with this algebraic stability condition is not so it is known here, but you cannot assume that you can always have an algebraically stable model. But it was done. There is an one situation where the current has been constructed without this algebraic stable condition. And this was done by very recent work by D. Diler and Roder in one map will know algebraic stable model and a very bad very big counter example to this type of stabilization problems and stuff. I think I am running out of time. Yeah, I have an inquisitive question. Suppose I don't want to talk about cats and I want to talk about. And I want to talk about measures instead. Can one do that? Yes, yes. Okay, so you've seen this formula to get a measure. You need to specialize this number. You want u equal 11111 or 14 or 1 over 2d. Okay? And so there is a technique. And I hid in the report, but But you can slice the current by the equation equal one, mu1, mu k equal one. And this is this light sing method, we know it's due to Bedford Teller. And so you can, and if you are in good conversity conditions. So sliding means passing to conditional networks. Exactly, exactly, exactly. Exactly. And the method to do this is. And the method to do this is beautiful. It's a Ved for Tenor, basically. They say, okay, let's say you want to, you have n mu lambda equals zero. Well, what you want to do is you say, okay, let us specify at mu equal one. So you do chi n of one long law, you restrict, and now restrict and now you have your you want your measure so you take log module of this and you take ddc and this is n then you divide by t to the power n okay now now comes the fact that you have to justify that uh there is an intervection of limit nothing told you that okay you can do that for each n but now you want to take n convert to infinity and then reverse Convert to infinity, and then reverse the collections, take the potential, evaluate that mu equals one, and then take the DGC, that it's the same thing. I mean, I mean, this is similar to the way that we structure currents, I think functioning. Exactly. So you're just specializing in delta. Yeah, exactly. But it's a technical argument, and it was done actually in the paper. I know in a few situations. So, all on order. So Holon Roder, Chu in one of the models. And Tujard d'Anfar, I mean, and we did it in our specific situations, but you have to deal with it a little bit carefully. Yes. Are there any dynamical conditions that would ensure this that the dynamical degree is? This the dynamical debris is strictly larger than the topological debris. I mean, I understand that in certain examples you get that from a concrete situation, but I guess I'm sufficient conditions. It's always bigger or equal. So this is always true. So lambda one squared is always bigger or equal than the topological degree of F. So that's a general statement. This is a Komonsky Tesi. And it's a consequence of hodge hodge inequalities. Okay, so you always have this and and and the then you need to be lucky and then yes example by example you know. Yes, example by example, you know. And then I also want to say, can you just explain a little bit how you prove atomicity in the end? Because I mean, so presumably you get again Julia said plus some points. And how do you know that the integrated measure will be concentrated on the points? Ah, then it's because of this formula. So let's say you can slice with mu equals one. So just and you're allowed. You're allowed. Nu equal n. So this is this means that you're slicing those guys with mu equal n and when you slice accordingly here to get some dirac. So then you're saying that t is smaller than a sum of dirac masses where the sum of masses converges. Okay, because okay, this will give you a measure of mass. You have a measure of mass volume of VK basically. So the condition, the summability condition, sum of AK volume of VK smaller than zero, tells you that now you get some atoms. You put some atoms and with some weights, everything is converted. The degree of that class is not a bit. Exactly. But you But you have to justify that you're allowed to do this in this situation. Yes. I have a couple of questions, maybe comments. I think these currents, if you consider, these are called local currents, right? It's like it's the incarnation. Because some distributions don't have to develop. And your kind of answer are there. No, it's like o all kinds which you can see there are local kinds. The algorithm characters to carry two test functions which joint supports, then like evaluations will be independent. Logo in the sense of the distribution. Yeah, in the sense of usual. And I think And I think then, as a corollary, you can get that these measures. Because differential forms you can realize as multi-vector value functions. And then these currents could be realized as multi-value dimensions. Yeah. Do we think it's correct? It's a good question because answer is either yes or no, and in both cases it's very important. If it's reactable, it means it gives you a lot of accepted motion. And if it's not, it also gives you a self. Well, perhaps we can discuss about it if the answer. That's why we really have to consider those. Can I make a comment on that? So these are always closed positive 1,1 currents or closed that you study. So they have their differential forms of measure coefficients, like you're saying, right? And so they're very, very gentle. But let me make another comment. Back is to. Comment back is to Humboldt to mention it was a very nice paper by him and Gibrochuk and Michel Lubic outlining a large part of this for the three famous groups, Gibrochuk, Paris Panel, and Lamplighter. And all of this is explained very carefully, including Ms. Leising with that nice paper. Let us think on that. Well, Yeah, I can say that maybe that was not looking at all the things. Yeah, but I mean, I think this is really. The analysis is very similar, but the groups are quite different. So I don't think that this should be the same. I don't think there's a main dependence, but we've got the difference between each kind of. But we'd like to ask you like it's not ideas. I think it's good. See that? Yes, okay. I've forgotten that's what that's kind of for God. Yeah, exactly. So for all the interior density, yes. So then it's going to be. Yes. So then it's going to be the right as a sum. Then you take the right. You renormalize what you write as a sum and what the rest of what is the outs. So if you look at the density of states at estimation, omega, so this is the limit, and you do minus omega n, and then you do a good renormalization. So you multiply You multiply by t to the power n, then you divide by lambda to the power n. The right lambda. Yes, yes, exactly. Yes, exactly. Lambda one. And then this is going to convert to measure. And is the slice of the green current, so this is which new equivalent. So, in a sense, this green current. Since this green card measures how well the distributions of the an estimators converge to the error. But this is interesting. So this is something extra, right? If you can even move new equal, you can do new equal one that you want to. equal one but you you want a yeah and see how if you have the how this that this varies uh continuously then it's even better because you know i started mentioning that i didn't think about it but uh we have these papers with lens where we compute uh well not compute but describe the spectral type uh for non-homogeneous uh non-isentropic random books yes so when you put arbitrary probability So, when you put arbitrary probabilities, and we show through this reduction to random Schrodingberg radio that the measure will be singular continuous, almost surely. Yes. And the spectrum will be counterset of the web measure zero. And so it seems that it would just mean that you do all this and then you slice differently. Slides differently. And do you get this result that we have? That's what I was doing with Sufun. And I think we can get it, but not better than you. But we could recover this type of visual. So we construct this type of random recurrence. Depends on the choice of alphabet that we get to do. And then the goal was to say that for a To say that for a generic parameter, the new it was always a counterset of but you probably wouldn't know that the measure is that that we didn't check because we constructed formation, but we didn't control the holonomy of the formation. So we didn't we couldn't say how it's applied. We didn't we couldn't say how it would buy. So we were stuck at this level. Yeah. So far we didn't get the we could not already construct current was because then we got the config. But what you mean constructing current, this is what you've done anyway in the space of mission slower, right? So that's yeah, that part was, yeah. But in your part, you did the random one, right? You have those, or maybe I. you have those or maybe i am confusing with another so the last thing that i mentioned was a different paper that was almost not mentioned today where it was worked with daniel lens and we considered only share graphs of reversion groups so only one share graph is aligned it doesn't work for more complicated share graphs and there And there, we stand in the spectrum of the market operator, but with arbitrary capabilities. Yes, and there we applied back a black box. It was at first a black box, and then to serve all pre-worship groups, and not only the first one, we had to actually to reprove the black box. It says that if you have a random sharing operator on a subshift and the subshift is of low complexity. Is of low complexity, then the typical special measure will be singular, singular continuous. And it was known for like linear repetitive shifts, posterior family subshifts, but reports like in this account of family, not all of them satisfy extinctions. So we had also to put simple chocolate subshifts. This was the last paper. This was the last paper. Let me understand. Yes, so we consider we could recover. We could recover a part of what you said, but the advantage of this is now you can make things vary and you can see you can degenerate to something that doesn't become continuous. And when it does, I mean, that's the power of this type of, I thought, I mean, it's still not easy. And basically, it's a matter. And basically, it amounts to controlling, show that this has a lamination structure, a little bit like this. And then controlling holonomy. And then controlling the holonomy along the new coordinates. But in the case of Basilica, do you have this lamination? Yes, yes. So we have a lamination. But what is something is more complicated than Basilica, something is not intriguable or something, no? Yeah, it's not an integral. Yeah, it's not an integral matter, but we have a real lamination. So that it's not a yeah. But it's then you have to restrict this current to the real to the real locus and say that this current is still has a laminar structure. Okay, and So, there is an example, I think, in the original Partovi-Bikot paper where the spectrum is a counterset without quads that accumulate on it. So, there, I suspect they don't speak about spectral measure at all, but I think if the spectrum is just a countercept, most probably the measure will be singular.
