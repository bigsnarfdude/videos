Thank you. And I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to speak at Bill's birthday talk. It's a great honor. I know that several people have mentioned some research papers of Bill's. I don't know if anyone has yet spoken about the notes that Bill does. Has anyone done that? I've been telling you at least five times. Oh, okay. Well, then I don't have to do it anymore. Okay. Well, they don't have to do it anymore. Okay. No, no, do you mean, Paul? Do you mean the vignettes on his website? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nobody has mentioned those. Okay, well, if you go to Bill's, Bill's webpage, you can click on essays and you'll see a lot of interesting stuff. Some of these things are actually quite difficult to find in the literature. And it's fun to read through these things. He often picks topics and goes through some elementary examples very cleanly. Very, very cleanly, and that helps a lot. So, it's helped me. I'd like to highlight one of his notes. I suppose it's a book. Let me screen share for a moment. Can you see that? Yes, baby. Okay, so for me, this was the most influential of his notes. It helped me a great deal when I started out as a graduate student way back. And I think it's safe to say that it was very influential for a whole generation of. Whole generation of mathematicians starting out in representations of piadic groups and automorphic representations. So, thank you, Bill, for that, and happy birthday. Okay, let's see if I can get back to the talk. All right, let me know if you have difficulty seeing anything. So, I'd like to discuss today two. Today, two definitions of Arthur packets for real quasi-split unitary groups and argue why they should be the same. So, this is joint work in progress with Nicolasa and Sibia. First, let's talk about the unitary groups. So, the complexification of a unitary group is just an ordinary general linear group. So, let's let G be one of these GLNs. I won't put the C in here. I won't put the C in here. That'll come maybe a bit later. So you should think of this as a complex group. And it's real forms, the ones that we're interested in, are these quasi-split unitary groups. They're indefinite unitary groups, so U11, U12, and so on. Now, they're quasi-split, but not split. And so if we go to the formalism of the L group for this unitary group, then we'll have sort of Then we'll have sort of, well, I'm looking at the Galwa form of that. We'll have some non-trivial GAWA action on the dual group. I realize that the dual group of GLN is again GLN, but I'll keep the check-in here just to keep us straight, whether we're looking at the dual side or not. So the non-trivial action of GAWA, if we want to fix the usual splitting on GLN with the Borel being the upper triangular one, looks like this. Uh, looks like this, and um, this is the inverse transpose, and the J is in there to make sure that the upper triangular Borel stays upper triangular under the automorphism. You can imagine it away if you wish. Try and remember this. It's important for something that will come up in a few slides. A packets, I will say for short, instead of Arthur packets and A packets. Instead of arthur packets and a parameters, for short for arthur parameters, well, they're parameters which parametrize a packets. And you've seen this in a few talks before. I think Clifton Cunningham has been shoes, so I won't spend much time on it. In this real context, it's a homomorphism from the real V group cross SL2. The restriction to the real V group is a tempered L parameter, so relatively compact image. And in this case, the And in this case, the restriction to SL2 is just a finite dimensional representation, really an n-dimensional representation. So we'll fix this once and for all in the talk. So what I'd like to say in this slide is that if we have an A parameter, really the meaningful object, at least the way this talk is set up, is not so much an A packet. Not so much an A packet, but a stable virtual character. So I'd like to discuss a little bit about two types of stable virtual characters. These are linear combinations with integral coefficients of irreducible representations. And the support, so the irreducible representations that occur in these linear combinations are by definition for the purpose. Are by definition, for the purposes of this talk, the A packets. Okay, so this is just a weak shadow of the actual stable virtual character. So if we can show that the two stable virtual characters that are defined from the A parameter are the same, then the bottom equality is immediate. So on the left-hand side, I've chosen to reference Mock. Now, I realize many other authors Now, I realize many other authors, some of whom are in the audience, worked in this direction, and I don't want to slight them, but this is the only published work I can find on this, and so I'm following Mock. And Mock follows Arthur's work, the book on looking at these objects for classical groups, so symplectic groups and special orthogonal groups. And the approach that they both take is to use a twist. They both take is to use twisted endoscopy and the trace formula. So, in using twisted endoscopy, there's some reference to some larger group that the underlying group G is attached to. By contrast, on the right-hand side, we're following the work of Adams Barbash-Vogan, and this gives an intrinsic definition using sheaf theory, and it works for any real group. And it works for any real group. I should have said for the objects on the left-hand side, there are p-adic versions of these as well, but they are restricted in the types of groups that are accessible using these methods. Whereas on the right-hand side, it's not piadic, at least not in ABV. It's all real, but there's not much of a restriction on the type of real reductive group. So when the two When the two versions are defined, it's natural to ask whether the objects coincide. And I would like to argue in this talk that they are and outline the proof for you. The equality of the virtual characters and the packets, as I said, is ongoing work with Ayn Sibia, and we follow this preprint, which is available on the archive with Jeff Adams. Archive with Jeff Adams, which treats the case of classical groups following Arthur's book and ABB. So let's say a few generalities about the strategy from twist to endoscopy. So the idea here is to take the group you're interested in, in our case, unitary groups, and express them as twisted endoscopic groups of some nice. Groups of some nice larger group. I'll say what that is in a moment. You can probably make it out in the transparency down below. Once you've done this and the endoscopic relationship is established between these two groups, then you can convert the given A parameter for the group you're interested in into an A parameter for the NICE group. Now, part of the reason the group is NICE is because you know what the A packets for this group are and the stable virtual characters are. Bar and the stable virtual characters are. And then you can use what's called endoscopic transfer, which is a map between stable characters of your interested group and the characters of the virtual characters of the big group to define the A packet that you want as the pre-image. So you have some kind of nice map between virtual characters, and you can take the pre-image. And you can take the pre-image of the known packet for the large group to get the packet that you're after. So the nice group in this case for the this, I'll just say unitary groups, but really I mean quasi-split unitary groups whenever I say that. So the nice group for the unitary group is this one. It's a group whose real points is GLNC. And well, I know many of you are familiar with this, so I won't. Familiar with this, so I won't dwell on it too long. It's a little bit messy to write things up nicely, and clearly I've come to some sort of compromise here. Hold on, let me just get a pointer going. Okay. So GLNC of the previous slide, this is the real form of really two copies of GLN, but rather than write two copies of GLN, I think it's better for me to write something like this on the left: RCR. On the left, R C R G L N. This is the restriction of scalars from C to R of G L N. And as I said before, the real points of this restricted, I'll just call it restricted GLN. The real points of restricted GLN is GLNC. So there's a little bit more here than just two copies of GLN. There's an underlying real structure. Now, we all know that the total. The tori in GLNC are not split. So that means again, if we go to the L group, we must have some sort of non-trivial Galois action on the two copies of GLN. And in this case, the Galois action is simply the swap of the two first copies of GLN. Now, if we want to express a unitary group as an endoscopic group, then this on its own Group, then this on its own is not enough. The endoscopic groups don't contain the unitary groups. We have to add something that refers to this twistedness, and that's an involution, in this case, an automorphism of the big group, the restricted GLN. And here it is. Why is it this way? Well, this is the one that works. So that's why the J's are there. It works, it gives us the Works. It gives us the unitary groups as endoscopic groups. I'll describe that on the next slide. All right, so try and remember that for a moment. Actually, I'll bring it back in a second. In the meantime, here's some notation. So we've got this automorphism just on the GLN side, not on the dual side. And this gives rise to a disconnected algebraic group with the pointy brackets around the. The pointy brackets around the involution and its non-identity component looks like this without the pointy brackets. We'll come back to that too. So, how do we get the unitary groups as an endoscopic group? Well, we can identify this automorphism of the restricted GLN with its dual automorphism that looks precisely the same, but now we've got the check there to indicate that we're on the dual side. The identity component. identity component of the, or rather just sorry, the fixed point set. Fixed point subgroup of this automorphism looks like this, where G1, the little G1, runs through the elements of GLN. And so this fixed point subgroup is really just GLN, which, as you may recall, is the Language dual of the unitary group that we started with. Group that we started with. And so if we identify the Langlands dual of the unitary group with this fixed point subgroup, and then also take into account the two Galois actions, one on the L group of the unitary group and the other one on this restricted GLN, then we get an embedding of L groups. And this is the The crux of the matter, this is a way that we can get G as an endoscopic group for this pair, a restricted GLN and the theta. So now that we have this endoscopic relationship, which is on the, well, expressed here in the dual side, we can take our given A parameter, phi sub g, and we compose it with epsilon in the obvious way. And we get an A parameter now for We get an A parameter now for the restricted GLN. And as I said, everything's nice for restricted GLN. It's real points of GLNC. We have a very good understanding of what the representations of GLNC are like. And so we can say that the A packet attached to this parameter, C, is the L packet of the associated L parameter. I think this came up in. L parameter, I think this came up in both Clifton and Ben's talk. So I won't say it again. There's an associated L parameter to the A parameter, and this L packet is singleton, which is a stable character. And so everything is good. We have the A packet and the virtual character, which in this case is just an irreducible character for GLNC. What's more, What's more, because this A parameter C is stable under theta, you can show that the packet 2 must therefore be stable. And this gives us an intertwining operator between the theta conjugate of this representation and the representation itself. And that's a natural segue to talk generally about such irreducible representations, the ones. Irreducible representations, the ones that are theta stable. So here, pi is any irreducible representation of GLNC that's stable under theta. And if you have this circumstance, then there are two inequivalent extensions to the disconnected group. So you can use the intertwining operator that exhibits this equivalent. This equivalence and define pi at theta to be that intertwining operator. That's only unique up to non-zero scalar multiple by Schur's lemma. If you want the operator to have order two to match the involution theta, then you have the possibility of choosing one or minus one. So this causes all sorts of things. Causes all sorts of problems later on. The fact that we have more than one way to extend pi to this disconnected group. Now, in both Arthur's book and in Mark's work, they fix a Whitaker datum for the big group. In this case, it's GLNC. And once you fix the Whitaker datum, then you can Fix the Whitaker datum, then you can take this intertwining operator I was discussing and ask whether it fixes the Whitaker model or not. And you choose the intertwining operator that fixes the Whitaker model, and that gives you a preferred extension. So let's fix a Whitaker datum for GLNC, the usual one, and then we get a preferred extension. Sorry. Yes. Is pi supposed to be generic? Pi, yes. Otherwise, no way to. Uh, pi, yes, otherwise, no Whitaker model, yes, it's generic, yeah, or rather, let's say it this way: um, uh, you look at the fully induced uh representation of which it's a Langlands quotient, and um that has a generic sorry, let's get it right. Um, if it's tempered, yes, if it's tempered, then it's generic and we can do this, and it's fine. And then if you're looking. And then, if you're looking at an arbitrary standard representation, it's induced from a tempered one, which has a preferred extension, and you just induce on the level of the extended group to get your preferred extension. So, I think I got that right. Okay, so once you have this preferred extension, then Extension, then you can look at a twisted character. So this is just like the usual character of an irreducible representation, except that instead of looking at GLNC, the identity component, we're restricting to the non-identity component of this disconnected group. So it has precisely the same form and the And it converges, and we can move on. So, this twisted character again depends on the type of extension you might choose here. If you choose the other extension, then you'll get a minus sign coming out here. And we have to keep that in mind. So, back to characters of just regular GLNC. So, this Kπ is the Gothenbiek group of admissible. Is the Gothenbieck group of admissible finite length representations of GLNC? And that's a fancy way of saying that it's the Z linear span of the set of irreducible representations, which I'm denoting with pi, of GLNC. It's less well known that the set of standard representations, I won't define that, the set of standard representations, which I'm loosely defining. Representations, which I'm loosely defining by M here, also forms a Z basis for the growth and deep group. And both of these types of representations, the irreducible ones and the standard ones, have preferred extensions to the disconnected group. So using these kinds of ideas and extending them to the disconnected group here, one can show without too much difficulty One can show without too much difficulty that if we look at a twisted character of this irreducible representation attached to the A parameter I mentioned earlier, then it decomposes as a Z-linear combination of twisted characters of these standard representations. Now, here these standard representations are indexed by L parameters. L parameters, and I should say a little bit about that now. If you look at the formalism for how to define an L packet, well, part of it is you define an L packet of a levy, which is tempered or essentially tempered, and then you induce to the full group and you take the Langlands quotient there to get your L packets. Now, if you omit the step of Now, if you omit the step of taking the Languanes quotient, then you would get a fully induced, parabolically induced representation, which is this M over here. So if you just look at L packets and ignore the taking of L quotients, then you get these standard representations. Okay, so here's this decomposition again. And And this is a statement about endoscopic transfer due to several authors. So AMR is Arnsebia, Neglin, and Renard, and that's me. The contribution here is that the transfer, the endoscopic transfer, this map of virtual characters from the small group to the big group, it sends pseudo-packets. Pseudo-packets to, I suppose, these are also pseudopackets, but in this case, they're just single standard representations. That's the contribution of those authors. And Mock, following Arthur, shows that each one of these L parameters in this set with a non-zero contribution, in fact, comes from an L parameter of the end. An L parameter of the endoscopic group. So here, trans denotes the endoscopic transfer map of stable virtual characters of the unitary group to virtual characters of GLNC. Well, in fact, it should be virtual twisted characters of GLNC. And so now we can define this stable virtual character of Mox. It's this thing in the brackets here. Brackets here. And this packet is the support of this stable virtual character. So we've made it this far. That's sort of an overview of how to define the objects on the left. And now it's time to move to the right. I'm afraid I won't be able to do everything, but I will try to. I will try to. All right. Paul, could you go back two slides? You said the support. Yes. The packet is the support. What's support? Oh, I just mean you write this sum out in terms of irreducible representations. And then you choose the ones that occur with non-zero multiplicity. Okay. Right way of saying it. That's all. Just the ones that occur in the stable virtual character. In this stable virtual character. That's what I mean by support. Yeah, no analysis, just simply the things that are there. Okay, yeah, so I'd like to highlight two themes in the book. In this section, bear with me, G is not the unitary group anymore associated necessarily. Group anymore associated necessarily with the unitary group anymore. It's just any connected reductive algebraic group defined over R. So it's quite general in the way I indicated earlier on. And there are two themes I'd like to highlight. One is that in ABV, there's a pairing between representations of the group with sheaves on some topological space X. And once that pairing is established, And once that pairing is established, you can do interesting work on the sheaves and then transport that work back to the representations using pairing. So by interesting work here, I have two things in mind in particular. One of them is endoscopy, and the other is the definition of the A packets. I won't be able to get to the definition of the A packets, but I will be able to say. Packets, but I will be able to say, I have to say something about endoscopy. So, what is this space X? Well, I'll sort of outline it in broad terms. It's a disjoint union of irreducible components, which are parametrized by these lambdas. Here, lambdas you should think of as being representatives of infinitesimal characters of representations of Representations of G or real forms of G. Really, everything that follows goes on one of these irreducible components. So each component is a smooth, complex variety, and there's a G-check action on this smooth complex variety with finitely many orbits. So this stratifies. This stratifies this variety, and that's important for the sheaf theory, which I will discuss in, I think, two slides. And the g orbits of this variety are a natural bijection with the g orbits of quasi-split L parameters, particular infinitesimal characters. So, whenever you see a georbit, you can just as You can just as well think of an L parameter. The advantage to this point of view is that topologically, the g orbits are much more interesting than the space of L parameters as they were originally written. So let's pick one of these g orbits. It's called S and then there's an additional There's an additional parameter that we're going to attach to S, and that's an irreducible representation of this component group. So G checks X here is the isotropy group, the stabilizer of X, and modulo, its connected component, its identity component. If you think of S as being an L parameter and X two as being an L parameter, 2 as being an L parameter, then you may recognize this as Langlands component group, at least a variant of it without the center being knocked out. So you can think of tau as being a representation of the Langlands component group. That's what it's meant to do. So now, if we take pairs of such things, basically an L parameter in the first component, and then a representation of the component group, then we get. Representation of the component group, then we get what they call a complete geometric parameter. And let's just let this capital X be the set of all such complete geometric parameters. So one of the big achievements of the book is to rework the local Langlands correspondence as a bijection between these complete parameters on the left and the irreducible representation. And the irreducible representations on the right. Now, I haven't defined this. The way I have things set up over here with just GCHuck earlier on will allow us to capture the irreducible representations of not only one real form, not necessarily say the quasi-split real form, but all pure inner forms which are inner to a particular quasi-split real form. Quasi-split real form. So you're getting representations of different real groups over here generally. But we can pluck out the ones from a quasi-split form as necessary. This is just notation, but I guess it's important. It'll show up a lot. Instead of writing s, tau everywhere, let's just write xi, xi in capital xi. And this is the local Langman's correspondence that takes you from. That takes you from a parameter on the left to an irreducible representation on the right. The irreducible representation is the Language quotient of a standard representation, and we need some notation for that too. So let's denote it by M C. Okay, so that's something about the representations. Now let's try and talk about the sheaves. If we If we fix a parameter, well, you can think of tau now as being the monodromy representation of the fundamental group of S, the algebraic fundamental group of S. And in that way, you're defining a local system of complex vector spaces on this orbit and its G equivariant. You can extend that to. You can extend that to X in two different ways. The easiest way is to just take this local system and extend it by zero to the closure and then take the direct image. And in this way, we obtain these irreducible G-check equivariant constructible sheaves, mu C. So all of the irreducible constructible sheaves on X. Constructible sheaves on X are obtained in this manner. The other alternative is much more sophisticated, makes us go to the derived category. So instead of taking the extension by zero, you can shift it to some degree of complex and then take its intermediate extension to the closure and then the direct image. And that way you obtain an irreducible G-Check equivariant. G-Check equivariant perverse sheaf. So now we have two types of sheaves: constructible ones and perverse ones, and we have irreducible objects for these categories. Luckily, their growth and deep groups are actually isomorphic. So let's identify the two via this isomorphism. The two via this isomorphism and call it something. So identify the two Grothendieck groups from the constructible ones and the perverse ones and just call their Grothendieck group by Kx. And the two bases for this Grothendieck group are the irreducible constructibles and the irreducible perverse sheaves. And this is Perverse sheaves. And this is reminiscent of what we've already seen earlier with the Gothenbiek group for the representations. It has two bases, the irreducible ones and the standard ones. So it's natural to expect, well, I don't know how natural it is. I suppose if you read enough of Kashdan listing, then it's natural to expect that there should be some sort of relationship between the objects in the two growth indeed groups. And this is. Growth indeed groups, and this is epitomized by this theorem of ABV: that there's a perfect pairing between the two growth indeed groups, which pairs the standard representations with the constructible ones. This is the Kronecker delta over here. And in so doing, it pairs the irreducible representations with the perverse ones, albeit with a sign. This is again the chronico delta. This is the dimension. This is the dimension of the g-check orbit that appears in the complete parameter c. So this looks like a fairly innocent statement, but it's saying something quite deep. If you take the thing on the left-hand side as the definition of the pairing, and you try to derive this equation on the right, then you might go about And you might go about it by decomposing pi into standard representations, as we can, because it's a basis. And then the same thing with the perverse sheaf, you can decompose that into a bunch of constructible ones, again, because it's a basis. And that amounts to choosing some kind of change of basis matrix, putting in some change of basis matrices into this pairing. And what this result says is that those two change of basis matrices are basically inverse transposed to one another. There's some signs in there, but that's the idea. Anyways, another nicer way of saying that maybe is that it's quite surprising that the way a representation decomposes into another type of representation is mirrored in this world. Mirrored in this world of sheaves, where we have very different objects and different tools. So, this is sort of a difficult, not sort of, it's a difficult theorem to prove. And it's completed in the book for singular infinitesimal character. I think the earlier version is work of David Vogan in the early 80s. So, that's what we. So that's what we have going on in the ordinary case, I would say. How are we doing for time? Okay, still all right. In the twisted case, we'd like to say something similar as well. So this is somewhat abusive. Okay, G is going to be this restricted GLN whose real points are GLNC. And there is an action of theta on the representation. Of theta on the representations, which we discussed before, and there's also an action of theta on the space X, the topological space X, and on the orbits and the sheaves that we've discussed so far. So we can define two Z modules, one for the twisted characters, which is the thing on the left by definition. And I'm skipping over some. I'm skipping over some things here, but you can also talk about a twisted sheaf, sort of an irreducible sheaf that's fixed under the action of theta. And then you can look at some sort of extension, some canonical extension of that, and then go about defining an analogous object for sheaves. So, with these two kinds of With these two kinds of Z modules, then the idea is to show that there's a natural, this should be, I think, perfect is a better word here, a perfect pairing of the kind that happened before. So now we're pairing some sort of extended or twisted object, twisted standard module on the left with a twisted construction. A twisted constructible sheaf and doing it in the simple-minded way, and it turns out that you get pretty much the well, the exact same formula in this twisted context as well. Now, you might think it's okay to just imitate what goes on in the proof for the ordinary case earlier on. And yes, that's a good idea, and there's Good idea. And there's deep and important work of Lustigen Vogen and Adams and Vogen that describe how to go about that. But there's this delicate matter of choosing extensions. And at least for GLNC, it turns out that there's a nice preferred extension that you can use that's compatible with the work of the authors I just mentioned. The authors I just mentioned. The only problem is those extensions are not analytic. In particular, they're not related to the Whitaker extension. So the preferred extension that I mentioned earlier coming from Whitaker datum is not in any obvious way related to the extensions that are amenable to the tools of Listig, Vogan, and Atoms. And so you get a hot mess of minus signs that appears. And really, that's the principal obstacle to proving this theorem is working out how those signs disappear on the right. So now we can talk about endoscopy in the context of ABV and ABV and just making it a bit snazzier with the twisted the automorphism theta. So recall that we have this endoscopic relationship and let's let G, sorry, G be a unitary group again. All right, so we have this endoscopic relationship from way back when. And what you can do now with sheaves is use the tools. There's this inverse image functor. It's quite Image functor. It's quite straightforward in sheaf theory, and that gives you a homomorphism from this twisted Gothenbieck group to the Gothenbieck group over here for GLN. And if you look at the transpose of that, now you need the pairings, right? So we use the pairings to make us get a map of virtual characters going in the other direction. Characters going in the other direction. And I didn't identify that the pairings are different here. Maybe I should have. The pairing on the left is the twisted pairing that I discussed in the previous slide. The pairing on the right, however, is just the ordinary pairing that occurs in ABV for the unitary group. And if you define the transpose in this way, you get. In this way, you get a map that's going in the right direction, and you restrict it to the stable virtual characters. And that's the definition of the endoscopic transfer map in this context. It turns out that it agrees with the endoscopic transfer map that is defined using harmonic analysis in that theorem back when I was discussing. Back when I was discussing Marx construction. So we can say maybe something about that on the last slide, which is coming up. I said I won't be able to discuss much of anything about how the packets, the A packets are defined in ABV. I will just leave a hint to say that they come about in terms of characteristic cycles of something or other. Because of something or other. So there's a nice geometric description. Well, for me, a rather complicated, or for me, complicated description of the packets in terms of geometry. But for the group GLNC, it's really not very hard to show that the A packet, also in the ABV context, really is just the singleton. It's the same one that we saw before. We saw before. So, with all these things in place, we can make some sort of comparison. And here's how it goes. So, here's this packet of mock. Remember, it comes from this stable virtual character, which is a linear combination of pseudo-packets. So, on the ABV side, we also have an A packet, which is defined in terms of this stable virtual character. Stable virtual character, and it's a deep theorem in ABV, which has been sort of ramped up a little bit to the twisted case that it sends the stable virtual character from the A parameter on G to the stable virtual character for G L N C. And then the next line is just notation. So it's converting what this says from the previous slide into. From the previous slide, into what we had in Mark's definition, and there's the decomposition that we had from Mach. And the final line is really not a very difficult computation. It's saying that the endoscopic transfer map of ABV, when you look at pseudo-packets, is taking you to pseudo-packets again in the same way as that theorem that I mentioned. Way as that theorem that I mentioned earlier for transfer in the harmonic analytic world. So once you follow through these steps, then it's just a matter of showing that epsilon lower star is injective on the stable virtual characters. And once one has that, the rest is immediate. The stable virtual characters are identical, and so too are the A packets. The eight packets. And that concludes my talk. Thank you very much for listening.
