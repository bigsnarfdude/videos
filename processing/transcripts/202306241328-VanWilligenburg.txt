That's the start of the talk, so thank you for the lovely introduction. Thank you to all of you for coming this afternoon, considering that you're in Bath, the weather is glorious, and we're going to be sitting inside. You may be a little sleepy because we've all had that large, delicious lunch. And so, hopefully, over the next not quite an hour, I'll be at least able. I'll be at least able to keep you awake. And so, for this, it's going to be a very nice, gentle talk. We're going to have an afternoon of colouring. So, now, if you don't understand what any of those words mean, do not worry. We're actually going to talk about all of them and we're going to define symmetric functions, chromatic symmetric functions, then we'll talk about the 3 plus 1, 3. 3 plus 1 free conjecture, and 3 plus 1 has a definite meaning. It's not equal to 4. So, unlike the games we saw where games can be equal, that 3 plus 1 is not 4. And then, what we're going to do is talk about some recent results and also some useful tools. Because the other neat thing about this problem is that it's fantastic for able to be diving into it. You can give it to undergrads, master students. To undergrads, master's students, PhD students, postdocs, professors. It's got some very nice tools that we can use that you'll be able to take with you later. And if you discover your dinner mates are not so entertaining, you can actually take those nice napkins they give us at the bounce centre and maybe work out a few more cases. If the whole table does it, you might even get a paper out of it. So, without further ado, let's get cracking. So, well, if the remote control works, If the remote control works, there we go. So, we're going to start off with graphs. So, you heard some of them mentioned earlier today, and so again, we're going to be continuing on with our graph theory. And now, what we're going to do is we are going to colour our vertices. And so, what we're going to do is we're going to have a paint box of k colours, and we're going to colour our vertices such that if two vertices are joined by an edge, Vertices are joined by an edge, then they've got to be different colours. And so, this thing right here is not a proper colouring because you've got two vertices joined by an edge, and they're the same colour. But here, this is a proper colouring because you've got two vertices joined by an edge, and they're different colours. And so now, what we're going to do is we're going to head back in history to 1912 and to Birkhoff, who developed the chromatic polynomial. Chromatic polynomial. And so he did this because he hoped that this was going to be a way to solve the full colour theorem. And although he did not succeed in that, it actually went on to be its own research area. So the chromatic polynomial is simply going to be the number of proper colors with k colours. So if we have a look at this graph right here, then if I've got my paint box with k colours, My paint box with k colors, then say I want to start painting this first vertex here. How many choices do I have? I have k. Then for this one, I've got and then for this one I've got k minus 2. Perfect. So my chromatic polynomial is going to be k times k minus 1 times k minus 2. Now this heuristic might seem like a really nice way to solve this, but it doesn't work for all graphs. However, the thing that will never let you do However, the thing that will never let you down is deletion contraction, and this was also developed by Birkhoff back in 1912. So, for this, we need to know how do you delete an edge and how do you contract an edge. So, well, if you delete an edge, all you do is you pick on an edge and then you remove it to get G delete. So, here I've picked on the magenta edge, removed it to get G delete. Similarly, if you want to contract an edge, well what you're going to do is you're going to pick on an edge. Well, what you're going to do is you're going to pick on an edge, and then you're going to shrink it, shrink it, shrink it, shrink it. And then what you're going to do is glue those vertices at either end. You're going to glue them together to get G contract E. So if we do this right here, pick this edge right here, shrink it, shrink it, shrink it, then this one lands on top of this vertex here. I'm going to glue them together to get G contracted. And then with this in mind, what Berkhoff was able to show was that the chromatic polar. able to show was that the chromatic polynomial of your graph minus the chromatic polynomial of your graph delete an edge plus the chromatic polynomial of g contract an edge is zero. Okay, so now what we're going to do is we're going to ramp it up from the chromatic polynomial to the chromatic symmetric function. And this is a lot more modern. It dates from 1995 from the work of Richard Stanley who was a professor at Stanley, who was a professor at the time at MIT. And the first thing we're going to do is we're going to expand our paint box, and instead of just having k colours, we're now going to have infinitely many. And again, our proper colourings are going to come into play. So if two vertices are joined by an edge, they've got to be different colours. And then what we're going to do additionally is to every single colouring, we're going to associate We're going to associate a monomial in commuting variables x1, x2, x3, and so on. And how we're going to do that is we're going to associate the monomial in the following way. You're going to have x the colour on vertex 1, x the colour on vertex 2, x the colour on vertex 3, and so on. And so if we have that cyan is colour 1, magenta is colour 2, and lime is colour 3, then this colouring right here is going to give me This colouring right here is going to give me x1, x2. This colouring right here is going to give me x2x1. But since our variables commute, that's just going to give us back x1, x2. And this colouring right here is going to give me x1, x3. And so with this in mind, we can now define the chromatic symmetric function. What you're going to do is you're going to take all proper colourings of your graph, you're going to make the monomial corresponding to it, and then Meal corresponding to it, and then you're going to add them all up. So, let's do a quick example. So, since we've all had lunch, we're going to keep that graph pretty simple, and we're just going to have two nodes right here. And again, well, at UBC, they're not very generous. They only gave me three colours. Cyan is colour one, magenta is colour two, and Lyme is going to be colour three. So, when I do this colouring right here, then that's going to give me x1 squared. That's going to give me x1 squared. This colouring right here is going to give me x2 squared. And then this colouring right here is going to give me x3 squared. This colouring right here is going to give me x1x2. This colouring right here is going to give me x2x1. But remember from the last slide, that's exactly the same as x1x2, thusly giving us a total of 2x1x2. These two colourings right here similarly are going to give me 2x2. Are going to give me 2x2x3, and these two colourings right here are going to give me 2x1x3. So, everyone good, happy, still awake with the chromatic symmetric function. Okay, I see some people smiling. Or grimacing, one of the two. Okay, now it turns out that unlike the chromatic polynomial, you unfortunately do not have deletion contraction. Instead, what you have is what's known as Instead, what you have is what's known as triple deletion. And so, this was proven by Rosa Oreana and her student, Jeff Scott, and she's at Dartmouth. And they proved the following thing. So, take your favourite graph, and inside it, you're going to see edges E1, E2, E3 that are going to form a triangle. And so, what you're going to do is you're going to discover that if you take the chromatic symmetric function of g minus that of G. minus that of g delete e1 minus that of g delete e2 plus that of g delete e1 and e2, you get zero. Now, out of interest, since we're combinatorialists here, what does this sort of thing remind you of? Exclusion. Perfect! That is absolutely correct. This looks like inclusion, exclusion. Yes, abs. So. So presumably this also applies to the normal chromatic function? So, yes, because this is a generalization and specializes. And what happens if there's no triangle on your graph? I guess you're right. So if it's a triangle-free graph. If it's a triangle-free graph, so are we talking about a tree or just you've got stuff, but you've got like a cycle? Just like a triangle. Cycle. The girth is bigger than two. So you don't have your triangle to do this. That's an excellent question. It is such a good question that actually it's the next result. So give him a round of applause because he was not planted in the audience. She planted me. So that is a great question. What happens if you have a cycle? Well, you have the same thing. So now what you're going to do is you're going to have a cycle where you're going to have K edges. And this is true for any cycle. This is true for any cycle. And so you've got your k edges forming a cycle, and then what you're going to do is you're going to fix your attention on one of them, say ek. And you're just going to forget about it. And then what you're going to do is you're going to take your graph G, you're going to delete all subsets of edges E1 up to the Ek minus 1. So once you've done that, make the chromatic symmetric function along with an appropriate Function along with an appropriate sign, add them all up, and you get zero. So indeed, you have a generalized version for k cycles that is indeed inclusion-exclusion. Awesome. So it turns out though that if you actually weight your vertices, then you actually can get back a version of deletion contraction that was shown by Crewe and Sparkle in 2020. Okay, so I keep mentioning that this chromatic symmetric function That this chromatic symmetric function is a chromatic symmetric function, so I should really justify what does it mean to be a symmetric function. And so, well, let me tell you what one is. A symmetric function is one such that if you take it and you permute the variables, then what you get back is your original function. And so, indeed, our chromatic symmetric function is indeed a symmetric function because if you take some proper colouring and then you commute the colour, And then you commute the colours, you get back another proper colouring. And so, therefore, this means that the chromatic symmetric function lies in the algebra of symmetric functions. Now, what on earth is that? Well, I'm going to tell you it next. So, the algebra of symmetric functions is, well, its basis elements are indexed by partitions. So, what's a partition? Well, it's just a list of positive integers, lambda 1 greater than or equal to lambda 2, greater than or equal to 1. Greater than or equal to lambda 2, greater than or equal to lambda 3, and so on. And if it's a partition of n, then those numbers sum up to give us n. So 3, 2, 2, 1 is a perfectly nice partition of 8, because notice these numbers are weakly decreasing, and if you do 3 plus 2, plus 2, plus 1, you get 8. And so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to introduce you to one of the bases, and this basis is called the basis of power sum symmetric functions. And so for this. Functions. And so for this, we first need to define the power sum symmetric function pi, which is just going to be x1 to the i plus x2 to the i plus x3 to the i, and so on. And then for any partition lambda, p lambda is then going to be p lambda1 times p lambda2 times p lambda 3, and so on. So if we wanted to compute p21, then by this definition right here, this is going to be p2 times p1, and then by this definition right here, And then by this definition right here, p2 is simply x1 squared plus x2 squared plus x3 squared, and so on. And p1 is just going to be x1 to the 1, x2 to the 1, x3 to the 1, which is just x1 plus x2 plus x3, and so on. And so what Stanley was able to prove back in 1995 was a really nice expression for our chromatic symmetric function in terms of the power sum basis. And this basis Basis. And this basis is really important because, inevitably, if you're going to prove anything about these functions, this formula right here is going to be the one you're actually going to be able to do something with. So let me tell you what this thing means. Well, first of all, what you've got to do is you're going to take a subset of your edges. And then, isn't it? Lambda S is then going to be the partition determined by, well, what you're going to do is you're going to look at the connected. is you're going to look at the connected components of your graph restricted to that subset of edges. So let's do an example right here. We've got our old friend the path on three vertices and if we restrict this graph to the edge E2 we get this thing right here and when we look at the size of the connected components we get 2,1 and so therefore that's going to be your partition 21. And so with this in mind the chromatic symmetric function is Symmetric function is, well, the first thing you're going to do is you're going to pick up a subset of edges, then you're going to create the partition determined by it. That's going to give you a power sum, along with an appropriate sign, and then you add them all up. So this is best seen using an example. So let's go back to our path on three vertices. So then our graph restricted to the edges E1 and E2 gives us this thing right here. We look at the size of the connected components, we get size of the connected components, we get a 3, giving us a P3. Then when we restrict ourselves to the edge E1, we get this graph right here. Look at the connected components, we get 2,1, giving me a P21. If I restrict myself to the edge E2, then I get this graph right here. When I look at the connected components, I get 2 and then 1, giving me a P21. So in total, now I have 2P21 along with an appropriate sign. With an appropriate sign. And then, if I restrict myself to no edges whatsoever, I get this thing right here. And then looking at the connected components, I get, well, 111 giving me a P111. Okay, so that's one of the very useful bases. The next basis is going to be one that's going to be central to the conjectures we're going to look at. And so this is the basis of elementary symmetric functions. And the ith elementary symmetric function. And the ith elementary symmetric function is just going to be a sum of monomials with i variables, where when you look at the indices, they increase as you read them from left to right. And then again, for any partition lambda, e lambda is simply going to be e lambda1 times e lambda2, and so on. So let's do an example. So e21, by this definition right here, is going to be e2 times e1, and then e2 by this definition right here. E2 by this definition right here is going to be a sum of all monomials consisting of two variables where the indices are increasing. So we're going to get things like x1, x2, x1, x3, x2, x3, and so on. And then similarly, e1 is just going to be, well, it's going to be a sum of single variables. So again, we're going to get x1 plus x2 plus x3, and so on. And it turns out that Stanley And it turns out that Stanley also had a very nice expression for the chromatic symmetric function in terms of elementary symmetric functions. But it's not quite as nice as the one for power signs. Because it turns out that if you write your chromatic symmetric functions as a sum of elementary symmetric functions, then what you're going to do is you're going to get a bunch of coefficients. And, well, when you add up all of the coefficients, Of the coefficients indexed by lambda, where lambda has k parts, what you're going to get out is a number of acyclic orientations with k sinks. Where remember what an acyclic orientation is, is you take your graph and you start putting directions on all of the edges, and you say you have an acyclic orientation if, when following those directions, you cannot go round in a cycle. And then remember, a sink is. And then remember, a sink is just a vertex where all of the arrows are coming inwards. So let's do an example right here. So if we look at this chromatic symmetric function for our path on three vertices, then say we wanted to compute the coefficient of E3. Well, so what we're looking for then is, since it's got one part, we're looking for the number of acyclic orientations. For the number of acyclic orientations with one sink, of which there's one, two, three. So the coefficient here is three. Now say that I want to do the same thing for 2,1. And so therefore, since 2,1 has two parts, then I'm looking for the number of acyclic orientations with two sinks, of which there's exactly one, so my coefficient here is one. And now, what we're going to do is we're going to look at our third and final basis, and this one again is going to be really central to our coefficients and our conjectures. And so, now what we're going to need to do is we're going to need to create a diagram. So, given a partition lambda, we say its diagram is going to be the array of boxes with lambda i boxes and row i top. I boxes and row i from the top, and we're going to just keep things neat and tidy by left justifying them. So here I'm going to have 3, 2, 2, 1, and here is its diagram, because it's got three boxes in the top row, then two in the next, two in the next, one in the bottom, and they're all left justified. And so with this in mind, we're now going to make a semi-standard Young tableau. And so we say a semi-standard Young Tableau of shape lambda is just going to be a third Is just going to be a filling of the boxes with the integers 1, 2, 3, and so on, so that when we read the rows from left to right, they weakly increase, and when we read the columns from top to bottom, they strictly increase. So notice here we've got a semi-standard Yum Tableau, because we've got 111, that's weakly increasing, we've got 24, that's increasing, 4-5 is also increasing, and 6 is increasing. And look at the columns, they also increase. And look at the columns, they also increase 1, 2, 4, 6, 1, 4, 5, and 1. And then given a semi-standard Young tableau, we're going to associate a monomial to it. And so this is just going to be x1 to the number of 1s you can see, x2 to the number of 2s you can see, x3 to the number of 3s you can see, and so on. So with our running example right here, we're going to get x1 cubed, x2, x4 squared, x5, and x6. x5 and x6. And then with this in mind, we're going to be able to make the final basis, which is going to be that of sure functions. So if we want to make our sure function indexed by lambda, what you're going to do is you're going to make all semi-standard Young Tableau of shape lambda, make the monomial corresponding to it, and then add them all up. So say I wanted to make the sure function indexed by 2, 1. index by 2, 1. The first thing I would do is I would make all semi-standard young tableau of shape 2,1. And these are all the ones you can get if you fill them with the numbers 1, 2, and 3. And so if we then look at this one right here on the far left, I'm going to get x1 squared, x2. This next one is going to give me x1, x2 squared. And then moving all the way over to the right-hand side, notice this one will give me x1, x2, x3. This one will also give me. x3, this one will also give me x1, x2, x3, thusly giving me a total of 2x1, x2, x3. And unfortunately, there isn't really a nice formula for having your chromatic symmetric function in terms of SURE functions. So Wang and Wang in 2020 did come up with an intricate formula, and basically what it comes from is from transition matrices in the algebra of symmetric functions. So we're not going to go for that. Going to go for that. Instead, what we're going to do is we are going to start moving towards those conjectures that I told you about. And so, for this, you need to know what e-positivity is and what sure positivity is. And they're exactly what you think they might be. So, we say that a graph is e-positive if its chromatic symmetric function turns out to be a positive linear combination of elementary symmetric functions. And it's sure positive if the chromatic symmetric If the chromatic symmetric function is a positive linear combination of sure functions. So, quick quiz: can anyone tell me something that they've seen so far in the talk that is e-positive? Just name any graph that you've seen so far in the talk? Yes, Alps. The one you had? So the one I had. That's a very clever non-answer. Yes. The path on three vertices. The path on three vertices. Because remember, that was the one where we were counting acyclic orientations, and it turns out to also be sure positive. However, this thing right here, does anyone know what this thing is called? The claw, absolutely, our friend the claw, is not E positive because it has that negative sign right there. It's also not sure positive. And in fact, it is actually the smallest graph that exists that is not e-positive. Graph that exists that is not E positive and the smallest graph that is not sure positive. And so, in particular, this thing turned out to be, well, because it's like the smallest graph that's not E positive and the smallest graph that's not sure positive, ever since Stanley introduced his paper in 1995, this has been considered to be basically our arch nemesis. So, the existence of the claw is the thing that's going to have e-positivity. That's going to have e-positivity and show positivity fails. So, this was really considered to be the crux of the matter. This little thing right here, look hole. It's the bears getting at you again. Oh, nicely said. It's a bear coming at me again. Love it. Thank you. Now, yes, Alice. Could you go back to the slide scanning scan? Yes. Yes. Is there a sign that's supposed to be there? Because that's suggesting that everything. No, because in this particular example, we only had one thing with two parts. But if you had more, so for like a larger n, if you had more indices with two parts, what you could have is you could have a list of positive and negative coefficients over all of the e's that have two parts, that when they add up, you That when they add up, you get the number of acyclic orientations with K6. Oh, yeah, okay, right, right. Yeah, so x. Okay, right, it's the number of orientations. So, yeah, so there's a definite subtlety there, which is what makes things so hard. So, yeah, basically, these numbers right here, Amster was asking, what can they be? Are they always positive? And I said, no, they can be positive and negative. It's just when you sum them up, what pops out is miraculously a positive number. Okay. Okay, so it turns out at least fortuitously that E positivity and SURE positivity are connected, and they're connected in this way right here. So if you want to write your elementary symmetric function in terms of SURE functions, well, you can do that, and there's a very nice way to describe the coefficients. The coefficients right here are just going to be the number of semi-standard Young Tableau of shape mu. Tableau of shape mu, if you're trying to make k mu lambda, and it's going to be filled with lambda 1 1s, lambda 2 2s, and so on. And then that's going to be the coefficient in front of this sure function right here, which is not indexed by mu, but mu transpose. So what on earth is that? Well, all you do is you take your mu and you grab it along its main diagonal, and then you flip it. So you take your mu. You take your mu, grab it, flip it, that thing there is mu transpose. So, with that in mind, let's just do a quick example. So, say I wanted to compute E21. So, what I would have to do is try and make all of the semi-standard Young Tableau that have two ones and one, two. Here they are, right here. Then, the next thing I do is I grab this one along the main diagonal and flip it. I'll get two one again, giving me an S21. And then, when I grab this row. And then, when I grab this row here and I flip it, that row becomes a column. So I'm going to go and get myself a 111, giving me a S111. And so therefore, because you've got your elementary symmetric functions written as a sum of sure functions, and this time you really do have positive coefficients, you've got that e positivity implies sure positivity. implies sure positivity. So when you have something e-positive, you get sure positive for free, but it doesn't go in the other direction, sadly. Okay, so why on earth would we care about e-positivity and sure positivity? Well it turns out you end up impacting other areas of mathematics. So things like representation theory, things like algebraic geometry, statistical mechanics. So here are a few of them right here. Right here. So we know that if something is e-positive, then it's related to permutation representations. We also know that e-positivity implies sure positivity. And as I'd mentioned, if something is sure-positive, then it's related to representation theory. So either as the Fabenius image of some representation of a symmetric group, or as a character polynomial representation of a general linear group. So if you know what this means, great. If not, just know that I'm not just doing this for fun. Know that I'm not just doing this for fun or because it pays me, but it's also useful. Okay, so then the last thing right here is the Stanley-Stenbridge conjecture. So this is a 3 plus 1 free conjecture we heard mentioned in the title. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to read this statement and then we're going to unpack it. So if g is an incomparability graph of a 3 plus 1 free poset, then its chromatic symmetric function is e positive. Okay, what does that mean? Is e positive. Okay, what does that mean? Well, we know what it means to be e positive, means it's a positive linear combination of those elementary symmetric functions. What does it mean to be a 3 plus 1 free poset? Well, it means that if some poset, your partially ordered set, contains 3 plus 1, it's got three things in a chain, and then something that's incomparable somewhere else. And so if something's 3 plus 1 free, Something's 3 plus 1 free, it means it does not have this configuration in your partially ordered set. Okay, and now all we need to do is understand what the incomparability graph is. And all this is, is, well, if you've got the elements of your poset right here, then, well, each of these elements is going to become a vertex of your graph. And if two elements are incomparable in your poset, they become adjacent in your graph. Can I ask? This is really stupid, but I just want to use. I thought the definition of XG was in 1995. Is this just what it was in for publication or is it different? Oh, that is a brilliant question. Yes, because this was the version that was in Stanley's paper from 1995, which was equivalent to one that Stanley and Stembridge put in in 1995. That Stanley and Stenbridge put in in a 1993 paper that was in terms of matrices. So that's a fantastic question. So, yes, there are definitely two versions of the conjecture knocking around. I think most people these days work on this version, but yes, for those of you who are good with matrices, definitely check out this one. So yes, thank you, Dave. Fantastic observation. And so it turns out that while this is still well and truly open, wild, and free, it takes a little bit of time. Open, wild, and free, it turns out that the weaker version, which is that if g is an incomparability graph for 3 plus 1 free poset, then its chromatic symmetric function is sure positive, was actually proved by Gasharov in 1996. And his proof used like a special version of those semi-standard Young Tableau, those boxes with numbers in, that I showed you earlier. Okay, so it turns out that one of the reductions that was That was able to be made was by Mathieu Guy Paquet at Waterloo. And so he showed that it was enough to prove it for unit interval graphs. So what's a unit interval graph? Well, there's a technical definition, but I'm going to give you the more Saturday afternoon kind of definition. So what you're going to do is you're going to take your favourite complete graphs. So remember, those are the ones where every single pair of vertices is adjacent, and then you're going to line them up. And then you're going to line them up, and then you're going to smoot them together. And so, this is probably best exemplified in an example right here. So, notice I've got a K3 right here, which is going to be smooshed together at this vertex with a K5 right here, which is going to be smushed together along this edge with a K4 right there. And so, if we rewrite the conjecture from the last slide in this language, we have that if G is a connected intersection of complete. If G is a connected intersection of complete graphs, then G is E positive. Now, there are some known cases, and so in Stanley and Stembridge's original paper in terms of matrices, they were able to show the result was true for two complete graphs intercepted. And then in 1995, in Stanley's original paper, he showed that it was true for, well, little K2s joined together at K2s joined together at vertices, which, as you can see from that picture right there, gives us a path that's also true for the path. Then Gevard and Sagan showed that it was true for complete graphs intersecting only at a vertex. Sorry, Steph? Yes. First result, is that intersecting at vertices or edges? So, yes, so this can be vertices and edges. Absolutely. Yes, excellent question. Thank you. And so here we've got a K4 and it's joined by a vertex to a K5, which is joined by a vertex to a K3. And then Samantha Dahlberg showed very recently that it's actually also true for little triangles, little K3s, that are intersecting only at edges. And so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to tell you about a few new families that we've discovered. Families that we've discovered. And so this was work done by. Well, if you look at the date right there, you can understand why this is our group photo. So Farid is my postdoc. Victor, incidentally, this Victor Wang is neither of the Wangs that were on the earlier slide. He is now a PhD student at Harvard, and that's me. And what I'm going to do is before I go on, just get you to think about our complete graphs. You need to think about our complete graphs looking as follows. So, now what we're going to do is we're going to stick all of our vertices in a row at the bottom, and then notice that this indeed is the complete graph because if you check any pair of vertices, they are indeed adjacent. So, here's the complete graph. And so, we have e-positivity for ice cream scoops. So, what we're going to do is we're going to take our scoop of ice cream, much like the Okay, who here had the pistachio ice cream at lunch? Oh, about 50%. Who here liked the pistachio ice cream? Oh, one person. Okay, two, three. So, okay, so imagine you've got your scoop of pistachio ice cream right here. And what you're going to do is you're going to melt edges away from the right or the left, in this case from the right. So I'm going to take some of my edges and melt. Take some of my edges and melt them away. So, this thing here is E-positive. And notice that this is in fact an intersection of two complete graphs. Just look at all of the vertices and edges underneath the blue arc and all of the ones underneath the cyan arc. Sorry, magenta arc. We also have E-positivity for snowy peaks. So, this time what we're going to do is we're going to melt one edge away, that one at the top, and then we're going to add One at the top, and then we're going to add dribbles from the right or the left. In this case, we're going to add dribbles from the left. Dribble, dribble. And notice that this is an intersection of complete graphs. What you can do now is look at every vertex underneath the cyan edge, every vertex underneath the purple edge, and every vertex underneath the magenta edge. We also have e-positivity for peaky snows. Positivity for peaky snows. So now we're going to take the complete graph and melt edges away and then add one dribble from the right or the left, in this case the right. And notice this is an intersection of complete graphs. So again look at all the vertices underneath the magenta arc, the purple arc, and the cyan arc. And so it now turns out that actually we can make massive families to satisfy the Families that satisfy the conjecture. So, if we have ourselves a connected intersection at the rightmost and leftmost vertex of any combination of ice cream scoops, snowy peaks, peak snows, complete graphs, or triangular ladders, then we're guaranteed our graph is going to be E-positive. And so this massive thing right here is guaranteed to be E-positive because notice that here we have a peaky snow whose rightmost vertex is joined to the leftmost vertex. Vertex is joined to the leftmost vertex of an ice cream scoop, whose rightmost vertex is joined to the leftmost vertex of a snowy peak. Okay, well sometimes it turns out that, you know, in order to be able to prove a conjecture, what you need to do is actually widen it and generalize the conjecture. And so we thought that, well, maybe one thing that we could do is maybe have a look at a much bigger family, something with fewer edges. So we thought about trees. And so this was. Trees and so this was done by Dahlberg. So you can see her right there, Adrian Shee. So he was also an undergrad research student. He is now a PhD student at U of T. And this picture was most certainly not taken in 2020. It was actually taken in 2018. And so if you notice that as the number of vertices increases, well the number of trees increases quite a bit as well, but the number that are epositive really don't. Really don't. And so notice that we're always going to have a number of at least one because we saw earlier that the path is always e positive. So it's always going to be at least one. And then very occasionally you get another one. So we thought, well, okay, in that case, then why don't we actually instead look for showing that something is not e positive? And so it turns out that if we have a tree with a vertex of degree at least the At least the number of vertices taken to the log base 2 plus 1, then you're guaranteed it's not e positive. So this thing right here is not e positive because notice that we've got six vertices. Taken to the log base 2 is 2 in a bit, plus 1 is 3 and a bit, and we have a vertex of degree 4. In fact, we actually believe something much stronger is true. We actually think that if you've got a vertex of degree 4, then that's actually. 4, then that's actually going to be not e positive. And so, actually, Kai Zheng, while he was an undergrad at Princeton, actually showed the conjecture was true that he had a vertex of degree 6 or more. Rather awesome. And so what I'm going to do, and this is something you can use your napkins for, is tell you the test that we proved all of these results with. And so what you're going to do is you're going to look for connected partitions. Connected partitions. And how do you do this? Well, we say we have a connected partition of a type lambda if we can find disjoint subsets of our vertices. So when you take the union of all of those subsets, you get all of your vertices. And then if you restrict the edges to each subset, then you get connected components whose sizes are the parts of lambda. So again, let's do an example. Let's take our friend the claw. So notice. Friend, the claw. So notice it has a connected partition of type 4. Just plonk all of your vertices into one subset. One of type 3, 1, plonk these 3 into one subset, that one in another. 2, 1, 1, plonk these two into one subset, then this into another, this into another. And 1, 1, 1, 1, just put each vertex in its own subset. But notice it's missing a connected partition of type 2, 2, because if we try and split our vertices into a subset of size 2, and Into a subset of size 2 and size 2, we can never get it so that they're connected. And so now we have one of the theorems of Wolfgang III. And so he proved the following thing. He proved that if a graph is E positive, then it's got a connected partition of every type. So by taking the contrapositive, we get our test. If G does not have a connected partition of some type, we're guaranteed it's not E positive. Type, we're guaranteed it's not e positive. So our claw here is most certainly, well, since it does not have a connected partition of type 2, 2, it's not e positive. Now we also had some results on sure positivity. We were able to show that if you had a graph, so you've got your tree, and it's got a vertex of degree greater than the ceiling of the number of vertices of 2, then you're guaranteed it's not sure positive. So this is not sure positive because we have. This is not sure positive because we have six vertices divided by two is three, and we have a vertex of degree four. But this isn't the end of the story. So we've actually got a few more conjectures as well, and most of them are to do with spiders. So what's a spider? Well, what you're going to do is you're going to have a bunch of paths, and then what you're going to do is you're going to join them to a central vertex. So for example, right here, here's my spider 621, because I've got a path. Because I've got a path with six vertices, a path with two vertices, and a path with one vertex, and I've joined them all together at the central vertex. So, a summary of our conjecture so far is, going back to a few slides ago, any tree with a vertex of degree 4 or 5 is not E positive. The family of spiders where what you're going to do is connect up three parts, one of which has 2 times 2m plus 1 vertices, one has 2m vertices. One has two m vertices, one has one vertex, is e positive. And we think it's more generally true for n times n factorial, m plus one vertices, n factorial times n vertices, and one vertex. And we also believe that if a spider is e positive, then so is its line graph. So remember, the line graph is, well, if you take your original graph, then for every edge, you get a corresponding vertex, and then if two edges, And then, if two edges are touching in your original graph, then the corresponding vertices are connected, they're adjacent. Okay, so maybe winding up to trees was a little bit too much. And so, myself, Dahlberg, and Angelle Foley, who is at World of Laurier, decided that we would actually try a slightly less ambitious wider. And we found the following problem in Stanley's. Found the following problem in Stanley's paper. He said, We do not know of a graph which is not contractible to k13, that's our claw, even regarding multiple edges of a contraction as a single edge, which is not e-positive. Well, the good news is, is we do. So, who's we? Well, it's us three up there. And, well, before we go any further, let's unpack Stanley's statement. So, it's all about the claw, aka K13. K13. And so we say something contracts to the claw if shrinking the edges and identifying vertices and removing multiple edges gives us the claw. So say we take this thing right here, we choose this edge, and we're going to shrink, shrink, shrink, shrink, trick it down, identify the vertices, then what you're going to be left with is the chloride there. Okay, so this is what Stanley's statement was saying, is we don't know of a great Saying is we don't know of a graph which is not contractible to K13, which is not E positive. So, Stanley's statement was saying that we don't know of anything that lies outside this Venn diagram. Okay, well, we found ourselves asking: well, how on earth do we spot that a graph is claw contractible free? And for this, we went back to a result of Brouwer and Weldman from 1987. 1987. And so they showed that a graph is claw-contractible free if and only if deleting all sets of three non-adjacent vertices gives you a disconnected graph. And so if you look at these four graphs right here and you look at the three non-adjacent magenta edges in each, then notice that when you delete them, then what you end up with is disconnected. Disconnected graphs. And actually, for this first one and this third one, if you similarly delete the set of three non-adjacent black vertices, you also get disconnections. So all of these things are claw-contractible free. And if we look at their chromatic symmetric function, then notice that they are not E-positive. And so lo and behold, these are the smallest counterexamples to Stanley's statement. For example, to Stanley's statement, and they lie outside of Stanley's Venn diagram. Now, at this point, you might say, look, Steph, you know, quite often in graph theory, weird stuff happens with a small number of vertices. When you have more vertices, everything works out okay. But at this point, I'd come back and say, no, no, no, no, because let me give you the saltire graphs. What is a saltire graph? Well, you're going to take a path with n vertices and plunk it on the left, a path with n vertices and plunk it on the right. With n vertices and plunk them on the right, and then you're going to have this little configuration in the middle. And so it turns out that the saltire graphs are claw contractible free because if you delete any three non-adjacent vertices, then you get disconnection. And it turns out that if you look at the coefficient of ENN in its chromatic symmetric function, you get minus n times n minus 1 times n minus 2. times n minus 2, and so therefore this infinite family of gross lies outside of Stanley's Venn diagram. Okay, but you might say, but Steph, look, look, look. You've got an even number of vertices here. Could be, conjecture is still true for an odd number of vertices. But I would come back to you and I'd say, oh, no, no, no, but have a look at the augmented salt diagrams. So now what you're going to have is a path with n vertices on the left. Path with n vertices on the left, a path with n or n plus 1 vertices on the right, and then this configuration in the middle, which is like the one you just saw, it's just been augmented by an edge right here. Then it turns out these graphs again are claw-contractible free, and if you look at the coefficient of ENN or En plus 1n in the chromatic symmetric function as appropriate, you see the coefficient minus n times n minus 1 times n minus 2. So again, n minus 2. So again, this lies outside a Stanley's Benn diagram. But at this point you might come back and say, yes, but Steph, remember right at the start of the talk, you told us that the claw and having the claw as a subgraph was the all and end all of things not being positive. So maybe things work out if things are claw-free. And so remember what it means to be claw-free if you don't have means to be claw-free is you don't have the claw as a subgraph. So notice that this saltire graph right here, it is not chlor-free because here's my claw right there. But this thing right here looks like it could well be claw-free because say I try and find a claw. Then, well, I managed to get my central vertex and my three bits coming off, but then when I look at what happens. Look at what happens right here. I don't have that these two are disconnected, they are connected. And so that is not a claw, instead, it is a who knows what that one's called. Baw! It's a paw! It could be that as well, but I was thinking, I was thinking it's a paw, got the claw and the paw. Anyway, it's not on the exam, don't worry. Okay, so it turns Okay, so it turns out that again, in general, if you want to spot that something is claw-free, there's a nice result dating from 1970 and Beineke, which is that we know a graph is claw-free if we can partition the edges such that every partition gives us a complete graph and every vertex is in at most two of those. So here we've got ourselves a k3 at the top, a k3 at the bottom, and then every single edge thereafter gives us a k3. Thereafter gives us a K2. And so then this is going to give us the family of triangular tower graphs. So again, now we're going to have a path with n vertices on the left, n in the middle, n in the right, and then triangle at the top, triangle at the bottom. And so it turns out that these graphs are claw contractible free because whenever you delete three independent vertices, you get disconnection. And as we've just discussed, it's claw. And as we've just discussed, it's claw-free. And if you look at the coefficient of ENNN in its chromatic symmetric function, you find yourself with the coefficient minus n minus 1 squared times n minus 2. So these things again sit outside of Stanley's Venn diagram. So it seems like Stanley's conjecture is well and truly dead in the water, but there are still some open problems. It turns out that if you take K33, which is That if you take K33, which is that hexagon you saw earlier, choose your favorite edge, and start throwing multiples of three vertices onto it, then it turns out that we believe that there is a negative coefficient, and we believe we know where it is and what it is. And we also believe, and so this is one for you computer scientists in the audience, is that we believe there exists no graph that's connected, claw contractible free, claw free and not E positive with ten or eleven vertices. With 10 or 11 vertices. But we have not had the computing power to get to that yet. But what we believe is the case is that the triangular tower 333 is the one you're going to find with nine vertices, and then the next thing you're going to find is going to be the triangular tower 444 with 12 vertices. Now you might be asking, well, why was this not found back in 1995? And well, the answer to this. And well, the answer to this is simply there is not the computing power. And additionally, these counterexamples are unbelievably rare. So if you look at the graphs on six vertices, then you have that four out of 112 connected graphs are claw-contractible-free and not E-positive. These are the ones that you saw right at the start of the talk. When you go to seven vertices, you only get seven out of 853, and then when you go to eight vertices, 3, and then when you go to 8 vertices, it's only 27 out of over 11,000 connected graphs of claw contractible 3 and not E positive. And even when you do find them, these actual negatives are unbelievably hard to locate. There are very few of them. So of the 293 terms in the chromatic symmetric function of the triangular tower 777, the only negative is where we said it would be in our theorem. If you go to the 533, If you go to the 564 terms of the triangular tower 888, the only negatives are where we said they would be at the theorem and one other place. And when you have over a thousand terms in the triangular tower 999, the only negatives are where we said they would be and one other place. So in summary, Stanley said that, well, he believed that nothing lay outside of this Venn diagram. Outside of this Venn diagram. However, it turns out that we have infinite families, both that contain a claw and do not contain a claw. And therefore, the take-home message from this talk is that, therefore, in general, contrary to the belief of 25 years, e-positivity has nothing to do with the core. Thank you very much. Any questions? So, can you go back to the slide with the photo from 2018? Tell me when to do the like reports. Do the like E positive number of E positive trees like do they peak up at branch always? We don't know. That's an excellent observation and we've conjectured it. We don't have much more evidence than that, but we can't even prove that. But that's a really great observation and we believe they're super quality to think about. Could you go to. I have two questions. So if you go down. Wherever the spiders are. The spiders are. Spiders are. There we go. Spiders. So there are cases outside of the ones you mentioned here. Families of spiders, blank is E-positive. More generally, those are E-positive. One thing like those are a positive. Any tree with a brackets between four five is not a positive. So can you say anything about the spiders outside of that class, those classes? So yeah, absolutely. So one thing about this conjecture is it could well be that the techniques that I showed you about the connected partitions will work again. It just seems to be an awful lot of cases. And so Of cases, and so if you have the fortitude, that might actually be the way to prove that. This, so it's actually one of the other positive numbers that shows up occasionally. The spider n minus 1, 1 is also e positive. But beyond that, people really don't want. So, yeah, there are a lot of spiders. There are a lot of spiders, but yeah, that one's e-positive. So, what that looks like is you've got n minus one vertices here, and you've got central vertex, okay, n there, and then one here. So it's like almost like a path, and that seems to somehow be the secret to e-positivity. But there are some that also have like forks that I know of. It's really weird. So, if people want to see. It's really weird. So, if people want to see data, I'll pull it with me too. Yes, Joy. It seems like, and this is very, this is going to be a bit vague and broad of a question, but it seems like certainly trees, but also most of the constructions you came up with, are relatively sparse in terms of edges. Do you have anything about, you know, whereas your ice cream scoops have relatively a lot of edges, so do you have any? So, do you have any thoughts around that? Yeah, it definitely seems to be that the closer something is to the complete graph, then the more likely it is to be E-positive. And yeah, the more tree-like it is, the less. But even knowing the breaking point, even knowing other than the sort of removal of edges that I showed you, just removing things from a complete graph, like when does it switch? Complete graph, like when does it switch from being e-positive to not e-positive? You know, can we take any random amount of edges? We don't even know that. So, I guess my slightly related question to what you just said, and definitely to what I said before, is, is there any connection that you know of between, for equausitivity, between a graph and its complement? Ooh, um, so that? That's a good question. Not in general. So the Stanley-Stenbridge one was originally stated in terms of complement being bipartite, but that was like a deeper statement rather than actually knowing things. So that's a great question. Yeah. That would make sense. I like that. Thank you very much. Ant, you said you had a second question. Yeah, I had a second question. Could you go back to your slide with his name to end with the towers? Yes, absolutely. Yes, absolutely. Great questions. Thank you so much. Shall we? Around there? Laura, it was, I think, one of your last slides when you were talking about that. Do you maybe have a conjecture about towers and the number of negative? Like, do you have examples where there's two negative things? Or is there always one negative thing? Or is there always one negative? So, I mean, here we've got two negatives. What we do believe is, we haven't found a counter example, is that it's always going to be at a rectangle. So, a rectangle is just, you know, when you've got one number, you replace it over and over again. So, that partition is called a rectangle. We haven't found any counterexamples to that. So, that seems like a really special place, but we have no idea why. None whatsoever. So, I'm guessing that, yeah, as you get bigger, where you can get more. Get bigger where you can get more rectangles, there might be like three or more. They're really rare. Great question. Thank you. All right, well, let's thank our speaker again. Thank you very much.
