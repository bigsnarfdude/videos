Duan from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and he will speak about uniform shear flow governed by the Falcon equation. Yeah, so Tani. Thank you. So can you hear me? Yes, yes. Okay, thank you. So first of all, I'd like to thank all organizers for kind invitation. It's a pity actually we cannot be in Alkawa. Actually, I was in Dell. Actually, I was in Dell first time, maybe a few years ago. So let me start. And so the problem we like to consider is the following. We like to look at the following Cauchy problem on the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation, given like this. And here we have so-called linear deformation force in the form lactive alpha. Uh, lactative alpha is and then A multipled with vector V, and then right hand is the Boltzmann bilinear collision term here. So actually, in general case, we can treat a general deformation matrix, but here let us consider only the case the trace of A is zero. So you can regard this force actually cannot produce relaxation. Cannot produce relaxation. And then the problem is we consider initial data for finite mass and finite energy. And then we look at a time evolution of the gas governed by this equation and whether there should be a global in-time solution in certain sense, and also what will be large-time behavior of the solution. And then physically, this kind of deforestation. This kind of deformation force will add heat to the system due to the viscosity. If you look at the chapter ice cocoa expansion, we have viscosity and also heat conductivity. And so the energy of the system will increase to infinity at infinity time. So somehow, actually, we are in this situation. If you look at a second moment, If you look at a second moment of the solution, in case the solution exists for all time, and then this actually goes to infinity as time goes to infinity. And then this kind of Boltzmann operator, we like to consider. And here, the kernel, we have a gamma power here. We have a kind of angular part. And the range of gamma is between zero and one. And B0 actually none. E zero actually non-negative has this kind of upper bound. So we know that if there is no deformation, means alpha equals zero, we know that this Q has this collision invariant, we have produced conservation loss. If you look at the long-term behavior, we have to look at entropy. And then the entropy we know is F log F time change rate less than. Time change rate less than or equal to zero, the product is zero even only if this f is Gaussian. So, because it's a spatial homogeneous, if we assume a solution exists in all time, then time goes to infinity is a solution where it goes to the global mesh villain, which is determined by initial data, which actually gives the mass. gives the mass and the same mass and the same momentum, the same temperature for the solution. So it means the long-time behavior will be uniquely determined in case there is no deformation force. So on the other hand, if we have a deformation force, for instance, alpha is strictly positive, so this is related to uniform shear. This is related to uniform shear flow. At the macroscopic level, you can think about this kind of velocity of particles moving in the space. Actually, alpha AX. For instance, A, it looks like this. And then this is velocity actually happen only along the X direction. But this velocity. But this velocity depends on the normal direction linearly. It looks like this. So, this is typical linear queer flow, shear flow. And we want to understand this kind of thing at the kinetic level. So, in kinetic level, this uniform shear flow defined to be spatially homogeneous distribution we are looking for. But particle move forward with a But particle move with the Lagrangian velocity given by V minus this kind of macroscopic shear velocity here. So it means that if you want to look at those this kind of graphite gas governed by this Boltzmann equation, especially in homogeneous setting, you look for like long-term actually transport, I mean this kind of form. This actually This actually does not depend on space variable, but dependence on space variable only occurs to the velocity, but it's kind of like long-term velocity. We plug in here, we can get this spatial homogeneous Boltzmann equation with the deformation force given here. Now, we want to consider long-term behavior. So, as in the previous talk given by Professor Takata, then we have to look at And then we have to look at conservation law. So it can be easy to get a conservation of mass, conservation of momentum in case initial momentum is zero. But what about the energy? So because we try to assume actually macroscopic velocity are identical to zero, you can regard theta, the temperature of the system defined in such a way. The system defined in such a way. Just a second moment. And time derivative determined by actually is kind of VIVJF is do the integration and then times A and then do the choice and then multiply alpha. So this term determined by the change rate of the temperature. Mathematically, let's just Uh, mathematically, let's just recall the early result recently. If you consider gamma equals zero, if we would like to use a Hipley expansion or Chapman's Kok expansion, you see the viscosity of heat conductor depends on the temperature in terms of this gamma. So formally, this is theta prime will be given by theta to the power in terms of gamma. So, if gamma equals zero, and this is theta power is one. And this theta power is one. So in that time, this theta will be its potential function. And then we have the enzymes, actually, which called homoenergetic solution, actually initially developed by Gakin, Chustel, and Kaiko Santos, Chichinani, Populif, and so are many people here. And so are many people here. And it's not hard to prove actually existence of a global in-time solution in certain sense, like Mary solution or even smooth solution in certain space. But the problem is how to determine the long time behavior to capture the increase of the temperature. Actually, this F behaves. Actually, this f behaves actually self-seeming in terms of the unknown function theta. Looks like this. So, the point is how to determine this beta, this parameter here, and also this profile, self-similar profile, capital G. So, indeed, this capital G is not actually Gaussian max winning, it's actually long equilibrium state. So, that's the interesting point. That's the interesting point of this model. So, indeed, it means that this shear force Boltzmann equation can be used to give actually non-equilibrium states in self-similar way in non-time. In case gamma equals zero, this mathematically was proved by James Lota and the blackest, and also later on by Bopilev Lota and Black S. Black Hess and Bobby Lev recently make an improvement of the quantification of the matrix A: how small is the deformation matrix. And with Shang Chen Yu, actually, we also did some work. There is a conjecture, this problem proposed in the paper here. What happens if gamma is strictly positive? Gamma is strictly positive. So it's half a potential case. For instance, let us still consider the trace A is zero, so there is no relaxation. Only there is a shear force. And we know that this is theta prime formally in large time behaves like a zeta to this power due to chat panel is quick expansion. And then you can determine theta actually in large time is no longer actually exponential increase in time. Polential increase in time, but just a polynomial increase in time depends on gamma here. So they said that actually the solution, if globally in time exists, then as time goes to infinity, we again self-similarly goes to a state which is no longer equilibrium, which is no longer long equilibrium. There should be global mesh winner. Be global max winner mu here. So this mu determined by initial data, which has the same mass, momentum, and energy here. Actually, this conjecture was explicitly justified using the Hibernate expansion in case the shear force strength is very small by the JEMS note and And plus cats. So, in the Journal of Long Linear Science, actually three years ago. So, let's see how to give a regress proof in case gamma is strictly positive. So, the idea is to look for Lormossion. It means that, so let us introduce beta is a square root of zeta, and then do this gay, V over this thermal speed. Thermal speed. So if you do this kind of scaling and then this G, you know, we have a conservation mass and momentum and then energy. So this is actually quite a useful formulation to consider G now. But disadvantages for doing this kind of change of variable is make the original equation more complicated because you will involve this beta. Will involve this beta derivative here and also in front of the Q here. And also, keep in mind that this beta is an determined by solution itself under this ordinary differential equation here. So we have to solve this profile G and also the temperature is a theta or equivalently this beta. So we can do the following informal expansion. Because alpha goes to zero, it will be, you see originally, will be Q equals zero. So that means it's max villain. So this will be exactly the global max villain determined by initial data. And then we do the high order correction. It's up to the first order, second order. To the first order, second order, and remain there. Later on, we give a remark. We can do much higher, but for the moment, let's only do up to the second order here. Because those correction only happens to the microscopic level. So you can assume G1, G2 there, and also remain the GR actually are microscopic. They don't have. They are microscopic, they don't have any contribution to the macroscopic part of G. So the microscopic part of G own actually only actually occurs to be here. So now formally you plug these anzas to the equation of G and then do the collection of the coefficients of alpha and then you get an equation of G1 and the equation of G2. So you can explicitly in case So you can explicitly, in case you know the beta, you can explicitly determine G1 because G1 is purely microscopic. And also you can determine G2 in terms of G1. And then you can determine evolution equation of the remainder GR in some complicated way. Anyway, we can get this. So keep in mind the remainder coefficient is required. The m is required to be power mm greater than 2. Indeed, we can explicitly determine G1, G2 in such a way. So you see, we relate to the inverse of this kind of second moment, relate to A. And this should be microscopic because A, the trace A is zero. And then we can determine G2 and also determine the OTE for beta. For beta, if you plug expansion to g, and then you see that this is a high-order correction. This is the second order. Actually, the first order will be valision. And then we have a third order here. And here, keep in mind the load zero, row one, they are constants. And particularly, rho zero actually is strictly positive, is given by this one. So you see that actually if you use. So, you see that actually, if you use the chapman iscokie expansion, this is typical actually quantity determined by actually viscosity. So, if you really can prove actually this beta actually decay in time, and also GR is second moments, or maybe even higher moments, is uniform volume in time. And then this indeed becomes a correction in high-order term, and then this low-order term. And then this low order term indeed gives the long time behavior of beta, looks like t to the power one over gamma. So now we can state the theorem. So we try to consider the previous homogeneous actually Boltzmann equation with the shear force. We assume gamma is strictly positive. We let m We let m is between is strictly greater than two and less than three. This is without loss of generality. And we consider positive integer capital M and we try to fix actually a large constant L infinity at least greater than four and we assume trace A this is a shear deformation matrix is zero then we can find the constant Then we can find the constants alpha 0 positive, m0 positive, c positive, such that for any shear strength alpha between 0 and alpha 0, and for any kind of initial data physically non-negative and has a unit mass, zero momentum, and unit temperature. And also, this is zero close to mu in this sense. So this is the So, this is the initial restriction around this mu in this sense. Then, we can show the Cauchy problem admits global in-time solution and satisfy conservation mass momentum. The temperature beta of t actually temperature actually is beta prime of t. So, this beta in large time actually is Actually, it behaves like this t to the power one over gamma. And also, in self-similar way, this f behaves like mu up to zeros order of alpha. First of all, order of alpha is just a square of mu times g1. And the second order behaves like the square root of mu times g2. And the remainder actually decay in time much faster. It's t to the minus square. And in alpha, square and in alpha actually is high order is more than two because alpha because m is more than two so the proof actually here we like to ignore due to the time but basically we have actually to do the caplish decomposition because the solution usually actually has a polynomial tail we use the capital's technical to It's technical to treat the polynomial tail estimates. And we have to do Yngo's L infinity L2 intersection in the play approach. So from the theorem, actually the solution has this kind of structure. So it means in self-a similar way, actually the solution behaves like this. So this is temperature C. So this is temperature θ behaves t to the 2 over gamma. And the g1, z2 actually decay in time in different order. Actually, much higher order decay in time, much higher in the corresponding order, much, which is higher. So then actually in much time, indeed, actually, instead of a similar way, the solution will go to the equilibrium states, because those correction becomes actually decayed to zero. decay to zero. We have remarked that in case you can do the gamma goes to zero, in that case we will have to do the high order expansion. For instance, the corresponding decay rate can be improved to t to the minus n if you consider expansion beyond n. And then in case this n beyond the one over gamma, you can one can One can obtain the uniform massive base in this n. Then you see that the decay rate is t to the minus one over gamma, but the coefficient here, we have a gamma here. So this gamma goes to zero, we goes to somehow exponential minus positive lambda alpha square t. This actually exactly is the exponential rate in case. Is the exponential rate in case of the Maxwell molecule model? So, this actually considered in our previous work, which is something new. So, now in the remaining few minutes, so let me give you two remarks. The first remark: actually, during the preparation of the current work, we have been a well independent work given by Kepka. Actually, he uploaded a paper. Actually, he uploaded a paper to the archive for treating similar issues, which include both hard cutoff and non-cut off cases, this problem. So the approach he used actually based on construction polynomial solution with the help, very robust approach developed by actually Gwatani, Michine, Flemo, actually they and also for Lankarov case, actually linear case, actually tanny, and many, many others. And many, many others. Actually, in spatial homogeneous is somehow quite straightforward to do this kind of approach. And he can prove the self-assimilar convergence. But what we do is somehow high-order expansion. We didn't realize actually he also worked on this problem. But anyway, we did it somehow independent work. So the second remark is actually there are two related problems. Is actually, there are two related work here. If we don't consider this uniform shear flow, but if we add an additional relaxation force, in that case, we have a balanced relaxation and the shear, and then long-time behavior will be actually the steady problem. Or if you consider a boundary value problem, if you add a boundary here, and then consider diffusive boundary, and then the boundary will. Boundary, and then the boundary will absorb their energy. In that case, the long-term behavior also the static problem. So, these are two works, published works related to this kind of issue. If you are interested, you can refer to those works. I think I ran out of my time, and thank you very much for your attention. We can't hear you. Oh, okay. Thank you. We can't hear the room. Oh, sorry. Can you hear me? Hear me? Can you?

I have to Let's see. I have to find you cannot hear the room. Yeah, no questions? Oh, yeah, so see the Yeah, maybe Dr. Duan, maybe you can, you have to have some minutes, and so maybe you can explain more about your future work, like the remarks you are trying to give. Oh, yeah, this is really, I mean. Oh, yeah, this is really. I mean, this is the question maybe is quite interesting to see here because the theorem that we like to give actually only we only did actually second order expansion. Actually, we can do much higher like here for the expansion. And also to consider uniform estimates, even include the parameter gamma. And then that will be more interesting to get a unified Unified analytical proof framework for gamma greater than equal to zero, less than or equal to one. So, somehow, so this is the question that maybe somehow we are quite interested to see. So, here, yeah. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, thank you. So maybe the
