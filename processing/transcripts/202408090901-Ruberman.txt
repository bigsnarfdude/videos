Was so I'll come to that in a minute, and it's uh but I want to just start from before my time. Um, so this is what I might call almost quite literally the oldest trick in the book. Um, and actually, I spent a little while trying to chase this down because down the history, and I was not successful. Um, so maybe someone who knows this stuff better than me can can get. Than we can give a proper history. But starting with the work of Pontraagan in the 40s about Pontraagan class's relation to cobordism, Tome in the 50s. And I think maybe this idea was stated somewhere in paper of Novikov in the 60s in connection with the problem that he eventually solved of the topological invariance of the Pondragon class. Uh, the Pondragon class is thought of as an rational cohomology, um, is the following idea. So, suppose you have a manifold of, let's say, dimension 4n plus 1, and suppose it's oriented, and suppose I take a, well, probably you should think of it to avoid trivialities, a primitive element in the first cohomology. So that corresponds, of course, to a map to the circle, and then which induces an infinite cyclic covering, but also induces. Covering, but also induces, gives you a submanifold, co-dimension one sub-manifold. So, this is, of course, a familiar construction. And what do you get? You get, if you take the inverse image of a regular value, you get a manifold of dimension 4n. And that 4n manifold has a signature, and the signature only depends. Well, so there were some choices. I had to choose an actual map. I had to choose an actual map and I had to choose a regular value, but the point is that that signature only depends on the cohomology class. So, really, what the argument, which I think everybody's familiar with, I'll show it on the next slide, is that the cobordism class of V depends only on the covering space. There is a point which I'm going to sort of slide over, which is a point out just for the entire talk, this point shows up, which is that. Talk, this point shows up, which is that choice of alpha or that choice of covering space. It's more than just the covering space, it actually comes equipped with a generator of the covering translation, or maybe in this case, it gives you a transverse orientation for V and therefore an orientation for V. So that's true for everything I'm going to say from now on, but I don't feel like saying it every time. So just remember that there's orientations and transverse orientations abounding. Okay, as I say, so well Novikov used, this is easy. I'll show you the argument in a second. Novikov actually did a much better thing, which is a version of this in higher code dimensions. And he used that for the top. That was a key point in the topological invariance of Pointragon classes. So here's the proof that it's independent of V. That it's independent of V, which is you pass to the induced infinite cyclic cover. So Z cover for me means infinite cyclic cover. And the choice of the alpha gives us the covering translation. So that's, so it tells us, distinguishes, say, T from T inverse. And the point is, say, if you had two different V's, maybe corresponding, if you'd made different choices of maps, well, they're separated in the by. So, for instance, in this picture, V and T V would be separated. Sorry, V and T V prime would be separated. So you would see a cobordism between them. And the way it's set up, it's an oriented cobordism. So their cobordants, so all their Pontragon numbers are the same, which I think is what Panchraagan observed. And then, well, then once you think of having the signature, then you would have the same. Having the signature, then you would have the signature as would be equal as well. Okay, so that's that's as I say, that's that's a really an old. That's that's not my trick, that's the oldest trick in the book and really an important one. Okay, so here's the here's the here's the my favorite theorem that's alluded to in the in the title. So I don't know who, I can't actually see who's very well who's in the audience, but I think more than one person has heard me say. More than one person has heard me say, This is the greatest paper ever. You need to read this. So, this is Milner's duality theorem for infinite cyclic coverings. And it's in his paper called Infinite Cyclic Coverings, which many people would know from knot theory. So, this is a minor variation of Milner's. He stated it for manifolds that look like knot complements. So, in other words, the homology circle, but it's Circle, but we're going to talk mostly about closed manifolds. So it's easy and the same proof would show you that works for a closed manifold. In other words, something like zero surgery. So something that looks like it has the homology of S1 cross Sn. So suppose you have an oriented manifold and a that has the homology of S1 cross Sn. So again, think of zero surgery on a knot or, you know, in. Or you know, in higher dimensions, that's no worry about framing. So, just frame surgery, just any old surgery on a knot in the whatever we're up to, the n minus one sphere. Okay, so choose a generator, the first homology, that's like orienting the knot, and take the infinite, the associated infinite cyclic covering. And then, what Milner showed was, so in words, if you take coefficients in a field, it doesn't matter what field. It doesn't matter what field, any field, popular choices of field would be the rational numbers, would be the kind of the most important version. Then, this infinite cyclic covering satisfies Poincaré duality. Well, of course, every manifold satisfies some version of Poincaré duality. But if you work over a field, then it satisfies duality as if it were an n-dimensional manifold. So, x tilde, let me just emphasize, is an. Let me just emphasize, is an n plus one dimensional manifold because it's a cover of a manifold of that dimension. But somehow, when you unwrap it, you lower the dimension. So maybe, let me just say it more carefully so that it looks a little more like n-dimensional Poincaré duality. First off, there's an integral fundamental class that works. So it's not just with field coefficients, but this element x tilde. That's really this manifold. X tilde, that's really this manifold submanifold V that I was drawing before, lifted upstairs. And then cap product with that, the fundamental class, gives you an isomorphism between cohomology and homology, as in the standard thing we teach to our first-year student. So as I say, this x tilde, this fundamental class, is represented by f inverse of x. Or as you already must have noticed, I get a pass back and forth with. I get a pass back and forth without comment between the manifold downstairs and the manifold upstairs. So, again, what should you think of for classical knots? This is really a statement about the, if you look at the infinite cyclic cover of an, when I say, of a knot complement or zero surgery on a knot, it looks, you should think of it as being like a surface. Okay, so I just love that theorem. And as you'll see, it leads to It leads to my trick, which I'm going to hide for just a second there. So, one of the examples, well, yeah, again, as I say, take a knot and then would apply there. There's a circumstance when this is sort of obviously true, which is if you had a fiber knot and the fiber is M, I guess I could instead of V, but anyway, M is the fiber, then of course the infinite cyclic cover is just the product. And then And then so then this is just ordinary Poincaré duality about M. So maybe the slogan is, which I guess I learned a long time ago, is that with any field, if you work over a field, then any knot appears as if it's fibered. Of course, this is not true for the integers. Poincaré duality just doesn't hold. Doesn't hold. In fact, there's no. Oh, by the way, one of the other parts, and in fact, the most important part of Milner's proof is that, in fact, the homology is finitely generated with field coefficients. So it's finite dimensional. So maybe I should even put that up here. Oops. This is finite dimensional. Yeah. vector spaces and um that a conclusion or a hypothesis that no no that's the conclusion so so so you you so actually that's not only the conclusion but that's a key step in the proof i mean the key lemma in the proof is that you first prove that these homology groups are finitely uh finite dimensional and then um and then in fact um miller constructs he he actually doesn't state He actually doesn't state the theorem in the way that I've stated it, but he constructs a pairing that's like the cup product pairing that's sort of dual to this. And in fact, that cup product pairing is sort of coupled with the covering transformation in the case of a NUT is essentially equivalent to the information in the ciphered form. So it's kind of, if you like, it's a way of getting the ciphered form without actually having a ciphert surface. You don't actually, I don't know, I'm not sure I know how to read off the ciphered form, but you certainly know how to, you certainly know how to get all the like the algebraic concordance information. Okay, so here's my trick. And this is something I thought of as a graduate student. And I don't remember it coming to me suddenly, although the application that I'll, the first, one of the first applications of this, I do remember. Yeah, I did did. I do remember very distinctly that coming to me in a kind of in a very specific moment. Anyway, so here's my trick. Just to go along with the so and I was thinking about this for knots in the four sphere, although you can think of it in high dimensions as well. So what I thought way back when was, so if you take a knot in the force here, you should, it's like a three minute. you should it's like a three manifold in the sense that it's satisfied infinite cyclic so by passing this z cover you get something that satisfies three-dimensional point array duality so instead of just using homology let's look at other three dimensions three manifold invariants and use them to study knots in the force here so so as i say you can do that in in other dimensions and um the plan for the plan for the talk is basically The plan for the talk is basically just to go through. So, this was as my title, the title on the slide said, you know, a few of my favorite things, which are a bunch of old papers, mostly, or, you know, papers through the years where I use this principle. Okay, so maybe you could phrase the whole thing a different way. Which three-manifold invariance three manifold invariants can be promoted to be by this by this sort of ideology to be invariants of so my apologies for the the I guess everybody likes ZHS so this ZHSS means integral homology S1 cross S3 and again in principle with a choice of generator both oriented and homology oriented in other words a joint generator In other words, a generator of H upper one. And so, you know, and then the other part of which I'll try to explain a teeny bit of is what, you know, sure, you can do that, but then why would you want to? In other words, what can you do with them? Okay, so that's the plan. Any questions so far? Okay, well, let me proceed. So, so basically, as I said, the remainder of the talk is The remainder of the talk is just a few instances of this idea. So here's the simplest one. And again, this one, I don't think anybody ever wrote it down in quite the same way. But I think this is, in some sense, kind of a classic idea. Anyway, so here's the, well, so the structure of all the rest of the slides and the rest of the discussion is largely: all right, here's a three-manifold. All right, here's a three-manifold invariant. Here's what you kind of tend to use it for. And here's the corresponding four-dimensional invariant for homology S1 cross S3s. Okay, so the first one is really connected to the very first thing I said about signatures, which is the Rockland invariant. And so we all know that. This is for, of course, a three-manifold with a spin structure. Spin structure. And so, what do you do? Well, it's known that a spin three manifold is the boundary of a spin four manifold. And oh, I didn't write down. Oh, yes. And then, so what do you do? You take the signature of that four manifold. And the way I've defined it, it lives in, it's a rational number a priori that lives in the rationals mod 2z. 2z. So if m is an integral homology sphere, this is z mod 2 valued invariant. But in general, it's some rational number. So what do you use? Well, it's used for lots of things. So what's it used for? Well, it's used for its great invariant of integral homology. Cobordism, it used to be the only one. It's used to study embeddings. It's, well, whatever else, you know, it's related. Whatever else, you know, it's highly related to the triangulation conjecture. It's highly related to the Kirby-Siebman invariant. Certainly in dimension four, you see a very direct relation. And in some sense, the work of Kirby and Siebman teases out that relation in higher dimensions. Okay, so what's the corresponding homology, you know, homology S1 cross S3 invariant? Well, you can. Invariant. Well, you can say it two different ways. And again, this is a theme throughout the talk. The simplest way to do it would be to take a, so I'll use this terminology of a section. So if I have a homology S1 cross S3, a section means an embedded submanifold that generates, or actually, since we're really given a generator. We're really given a generator of h3 of x. Anyway, that represents the given generator. So the picture, which I'm actually a little shocked I didn't draw it because I drawn this a million times. Here is supposed to be X, then here's supposed to be Y. And then of course the infinite cyclic cover, which will show up, has lots of copies of Y. Okay, so it's easy to check by the argument I showed before that that that's independent of the choice of section. And there doesn't there's only well there's two spin structures on X, but it doesn't matter which one you choose. The other way of thinking about it, which is a little more in keeping with the Milner's theorem, is in fact that you can fill in. Is in fact that you can fill in this picture. Let me sort of try to fill it in. In other words, x is the boundary of some five manifold. So this is just an argument you have to make with the spin five manifold with the homology of S1 cross B4. And in fact, that homology. So if you take the infinite cyclic cover of that five manifold, well, Milner tells us that that looks like a five. Milner tells us that that looks like a four-manifold, so it has a signature. And then the muin, the Rockland invariant, is the signature of that, well, I should say one-eighth of the signature of that, again, in this cube on 2c. Okay, so that's so that's that's a kind of a cool invariant. So, what's that good for? Well, it's not so good for homology cobordism because there isn't. Homology cobortism because there isn't, but it is good for questions about doubly sliced knots. So, for instance, you can prove using that that the whatever the five twist spin of the trefoil is not doubly, it's not a doubly sliced knot in the four sphere. So that again, those observations go back to my PhD thesis. Okay, so that's the first one, and that's the easiest, and that's maybe a prototype. Maybe a prototype, and let me again say that it's this. One of the to me, the interesting facets of this is that you can kind of do it either of two ways. You can sort of do it intrinsically. In other words, you can do this without reference to any, well, just sort of look at some manifolds and look at their homological properties of their infinite cyclic cover. Or another way is to take something encoded. is to take something in codimension one. And so almost all the invariants I'll describe here have, well, at least some of them have that dual aspect. And sometimes it's more useful to think of it one way and sometimes more useful to think of it the other way. Okay, so that's the Rockland invariant. The next one, and this again was from my PhD thesis, this would need a different collection of three-manifold invariants. So I was at the time studying, learning about Cassandra. Studying learning about Cass and Gordon invariants. So I so actually misnamed this, or at the time we all misnamed these Cass and Gordon invariants, but actually these are really Atias-Singer invariants, which have more notations than almost any mathematical concept I know, or at least in topology. I'm going to use the following one. So suppose I have, here's the hypothesis, suppose I have a three-manifold. Manifold and a homomorphism to Z mod n. So you should really, I mean, and so it's known by Bordism theory that if you take n copies of that, so I sort of imagine a picture like this, here's M with its representation, and that extends over some four-manifold, W. So that's the meaning of this phrase. And then that four-manifold, well, And then that four-manifold, well, not only has a signature, but it has sort of twisted signatures, meaning you think of the homology with local coefficients, or you think of the equivariant signature. And if you take the difference between those, and then you divide by n to sort of normalize the whole thing, to get rid of the fact that you multiply by n in the first place, you get a rational number, and that's the, let's just call that the Tiersinger invariant. Just call that the Atia Singer invariant. The notation, of course, those of you who are more familiar with this is the same as the rho invariants from Atia Patoti Singer, which is a more analytical thing. Anyway, what's that good? Well, those are good for tons of things. We can't even go through that. They're great for homology cobordisms, for rational homology spheres. They're great for things about embeddings. They're fundamental for arguments about slice knots. Arguments about slice knots. In other words, if you took your three manifold to be the double branch cover of a knot in the three sphere, then that is actually the Cassandra Gordon invariant. Okay, so what's the corresponding thing for homology S1 cross S3? Well, it's a similar idea. So you have the same idea, only that the representation, well, it's supposed to be on a three-manifold. So that's really a homomorphism from H1 of the infinite cyclic cover to a sign. One of the infinite cyclic cover to some cyclic group, and for this to be well defined, it turns out that n has to be a prime power. And then, well, anyway, you can define it intrinsically the way I've defined the Rothland invariant by extending everything over some five manifold, or you can do it kind of the shortcut is to just say, well, take this T. Singer invariant for any section. So just take a section, lift it up. So just take a section, lift it upstairs, and carry that out. And you'll see that you get the same value. It's independent of all choices. So what's that good for? Well, in my, as I said, you see, there's two papers here. My original idea was to apply this to doubly sliced knots. Oh, I should have said that, which is connected to the problem of embedding a three-manifold in the four-sphere. And in fact, what I And in fact, what I did was this idea works in higher dimensions, or the definition works just fine in higher dimensions. But as it turns out, the application to doubly slice problems about knots being doubly slice actually turned out not to work. But I don't know, as far as I know, it still could work in Dimension 4. So that's a little leftover mystery from my older days. Anyway, but it's still good for lots of stuff, you know, not saying. But it's still good for lots of stuff, you know, knot symmetries. You can say a few things, not as strong as I had hoped about doubly sliced knots. But anyway, so that's that's the so that was sort of my first real idea on the subject, which is that, well, three manifolds have these invariants. So they're infinite, if you have a four-manifold, the infinite cyclic, by passing the infinite cyclic cover, it has this three-dimensional invariant. And again, the same, this idea works at high. The same this idea works in high dimensions as well. So, that was that was really the first instance of that trick in my world. Okay, so moving on, there's another one which I really like. Haven't done, not that much has not happened with it, although it does remind me as I was writing up the notes of a nice problem. So, this is a completely different direction. You know, in dimension three, there's an So in dimension three, there's the notion of hyperbolic volume, so literally the volume of a hyperbolic manifold, which has a topological interpretation in terms of Gromov's norm, the simplicial norm of a, well, a homology class, but in particular, the fundamental class of a manifold. And so that's a really great, I mean, that's a great invariant. Everybody loves it. It's good for what, well, it obstructs existence of matter. Existence of maps of a given degree, maybe degree one maps. It's very good for distinguishing manifolds. If you had, you know, you chunk it into your favorite three manifold into SNAPT, and it will compute the volume very quickly. And I just think it's a very cool invariant and lots of interesting stuff about it. There's a sort of cheap way to get an invariant for, I use, again, I just said. An invariant for I use again I just said this in the context of knots in the four sphere but it really is about in fact it doesn't really mean need the homology three sphere it doesn't need you know just anything any four manifold with an infinite cyclic cover you can look at all the different so it's not independent of which section you take as opposed to the other things like the Rachman invariant or the Patiya-Singer type invariants but you can just take the But you can just take the infimum over all sections, and that's a perfectly good invariant. So, for instance, if that's not zero, in other words, for instance, if you had a fiber knot where the fiber or yes, the fiber knot where the fiber was hyperbolic, which you certainly can have, then you can't have, then that, then that. then that then that um then that's equal to the then that's equal to the volume of the fiber so like so if the fiber were hyperbolic you can't have a ciphered um ciphered surface ciphered fibered ciphered surface anyway so i always like ciphered ciphered surface um what else you can do with it you it's a by the same argument it's it's a good obstruction for not being ribbon um it does remind me though um you know you can the same this is very similar um it you know this You know, this definition with, well, you could just take the minimum instead of the infimum. In dimension two, the Gromov norm is just proportional to the genus. So this is a lot like taking the genus of a knot, or it's a three-dimensional version of taking the one three-dimensional version of taking the genus of a knot. Great theorem of kind of combining work of Gabai and Thurston says that. And Thurston says that the, this is just a gem that's hidden in Gabai's first paper, one of our foliations and three manifolds, is that the mapped in, you know, you can sort of imagine the actual Gromoff norm of that two-dimensional homology class, in other words, essentially the infimum of the Gromov norms over mapped in surfaces, that's the same. That's the same as the genus proportional to, anyway. So, the question you might ask, and I have no idea how to answer this: is this version of Gromov's norm, is that the same thing as Gromov's norm of the three-dimensional class? So, in other words, that's using sort of mapped-in cycles rather than embedded cycles. So, I have no idea how to even think about that. I think it's an interesting question. I would assume the answer is. I would assume the answer is no, but I've never tried. Anyway, there's a little something for someone to think about. Okay, so that's about as truly three-dimensional. By the way, any knot in the four-sphere has a hyperbolic Seifert surface. Surface. So, um, so, but not everyone has a cipher, fibered one. So, that's what I was trying to say. Okay, so then let me uh turn to sort of a more gauge theory-oriented sort of thing. I mean, so one idea is, and this extension is not mine, although I spent a lot of time thinking about it. Of course, you know, another three-manifold invariant, this, say, for homology spheres, although you can do this for the Cassin. Spheres, although you can do this for the Casson-Walker-Walker invariant as well, is the Casson's invariant, which is, of course, as we know, well, with a factor a half. You take the, you look at the irreducible representations in SU2 of the fundamental group, you count them with signs. We're pretending that they're all sort of isolated smooth points in the character variety, and you count them with certain signs, which are not so, which require some ingenuity. That's Cassim's invariant. That's Casson's invariant. And what does that obstruct? Well, among other things, it obstructs a manifold being simply connected because then you wouldn't have any irreducibles. And it also gives you the Rockland invariant mod too. So it obstructs the Rockland invariant being zero. And so that's used to the original proof, or maybe even still the only proof, I forgot, that there. I forgot that there exists non-triangulable four manifolds. So, like the E8 manifold is not, which is a topological manifold, is not triangulable. So, this predates Chiprian's work. It's related. It's just it's a different feel. So, in the 90s, for sort of different reasons, Fruda and Oda decided to do the same thing. They needed a slightly they needed to do they needed a slightly stronger hypothesis which is um not just that the you have a homology s1 cross s3 but that the infinite cyclic cover has trivial h1 they said actually h lower one but as it turns out h upper one equals zero would suffice and so they counted they actually wrote a half but they should have written a quarter so nikolai and i sevalyvani with whom i worked on this for you know Worked on this for 20 years, decided we would put, give them the benefit of the doubt, and decided to change their definition by dividing by four, which is really the right definition. And then, so again, you count irreducible SU2 representations of pi1 of the fundamental group. So, well, what's that good for? Well, in principle, that's a really nice invariant that would show you that a given manifold. That would show you that a given manifold is not homotopy equivalent to S1 cross S3, because if pi1 was z, then there wouldn't be any irreducible representations. An example is that this Faruda-Oda invariant is equal to Casson's invariant. And that's where you see that you actually need to divide by four just to prove that. They conjectured that it has the same property as Casson's invariant. In other words, that it reduces mod 2 to the Rockland invariant that I did. Mod2 to the Rafflin invariant that I defined earlier. And this is true in many, many cases. And Nikolai and I worked this out for lots of mapping to our eye, and then we did more with Jim Feng Lin. Okay, so that's another promotion. That's another three manifold that, at least conjecturally, well, it's not actually equal. I should point out in here in this, it's not. In here, in this, it's not always equal to Casson's invariant of any of any section. In fact, Casson's invariant is not, well, no, it's not a homology cobordism invariant, so it's not well defined, but it's certainly related to this Rockland invariant. So the hope would be that it's an integral lift of the Rockland invariant, the four-dimensional Rockland invariant. Okay, so moving on, well, there's an equivalent idea, or sorry, in the end. Idea, or sorry, in the end, conjecturally equivalent idea for this Cyberg-Witten Cassin invariant. So that was defined independently in 97 by Yuhan Lim and Wei Min Chen. That's supposed to be a W. So they will just call it lambda SW, so like a Cassin invariant for it. And what does that do? Well, that counts irreducible solutions to the Sagur-Gwitten equations. To the Seger-Witten equations, in the same way that Casson's invariant counts Yang-Mills equation solutions. But the problem is it's not topologically invariant. So they threw in an index theoretic correction term, which is quite interesting. I won't go into it. And then got a topological invariant. And so they each proved different things about it, both interesting. About it. Both interesting. Chen's original work actually proved directly that it was the Rothman invariant mod 2. So that means that made it look useful and similar to Casson's invariant. And then Lim later proved that, in fact, it's equal to the Casson invariant. Maybe there's a sign somewhere in there. And that's a fairly, you know, just a sort of surgery argument. Surgery argument. So, what's the analog? So, the question is: can you promote that one in the way that Frouda and Oda did? Well, same idea. We should count irreducible solutions to the cyber-Witten equations for the same reason as in the work of Lim and Chen. It's not a topological invariant. And so, we cooked up a rather complicated, much more complicated than what they did, but inspired by what they did. Index correction term and then got a well-defined smooth invariant. And we proved following Chen's idea that in fact it's the same as the Rocklin invariant. Well, I should have said this about the Fruda in Oda thing. It's not necessarily the same as this because this one's not well defined as an invariant of X. In other words, you couldn't just take. X. In other words, you couldn't just take any old section. On the other hand, we conjectured after lots and lots of calculations, Nikolai and I can, well, maybe Tom conjectured that this is the same as the Fruda-Oda invariant. Well, up to a sine. And why do we care about this? Well, first off, that would show this Furuda-Oda conjecture about that from the previous page, this one. From the previous page, this one. But from my point of view, this is more important thing is that that would show that there's no exotic S1 cross homotopy S1 cross S3 with a non-trivial Rockland invariant. And the logic is, well, if there was such a thing, if it was a homotopy S1 cross S3, this would vanish. So this would vanish. So the Rockland and So, the Rockland invariant would vanish. So, that's a classical kind of exoticity that we've not yet detected. It should be there, according to high-dimensional surgery theory. But if you're sort of in the general mood to think, well, gauge theory obstructs all that stuff, you're not going to believe it's there. So, anyway, so that was that's so we've checked that conjecture again with. Check that conjecture again with Jan Feng in tons of cases, and you know, I really believe it's true, but I don't know. Well, I don't want to overstay my welcome, so let me give a couple of shorter versions. An outgrowth of this work with Tom and Nikolai was, in fact, there's this analytical invariant. Again, this is. invariant again this is a an invariant of Riemannian a Riemannian three manifold which is called the eta invariant so I won't go through the definition of that fairly complicated analytic object and it has a twisted invariant which is a which is a topological invariant for if and this is for a unitary representation this is the same rep this is the topological invariant I referred to earlier if you're Referred to earlier, if your unitary representation happens to lie in a finite subgroup of UN. And what Tom and Nikolai and I did subsequent to the work on cyber-gritten theory was to cook up a version of that when you had a four-month fold with an infinite cyclic covering. And so that's really that, well, the Toddisinger invariants are. Invariants are really great and good for all sorts of stuff, topological applications. One application we made of the higher-dimensional one was to show that the moduli space of metrics of positive curvature on a more manifold could be disconnected. So, that was maybe our application. And okay, so that's one. There's a similar one using, well, this is much. Using, well, this is much more topological. This is something I did a couple of years ago. Another invariant, so this is a little bit outside of the, well, this is actually the same ideology, just taken a little further. I was mainly talking about invariants of three manifolds, but you could talk about invariance of knots in three manifolds. So, particularly, you have the Levine-Tristram invariant. If you sort of think of what does that look like, sort of cross S1, then you're led to the idea of you're led to the idea of studying a torus inside a homology S1 cross S3. And in order to sort of replicate the idea that it's really S1 times something, I want H1 of this torus to be surjective. So then you get Levine Tristram invariants for that. Okay, so I, you know, didn't have any great applications, but I thought it was a fun thing to do. Okay, so again, let me just come to the last. Again, let me just come to the last bit, and which was an idea that Adam Levine and I carried out a few years ago, which is so another invariant that you can get, another sort of three-manifold invariant you have are D invariants. So, you know, so of course, those are most familiar in the case when M is a rational homology sphere and it's, of course, a function of a spin. Sphere and of course a function of a spin C structure. When M is not a homology sphere, you sometimes have to pass to certain twisted coefficients. And Adam and I wrote up, I mean, the original idea was, of course, well, Baron's and Gola. And then Adam and I wrote up a more general version of this. And that's generally, I mean, those are, of course, we know billions of applications. You know, that really has to do with what three manifolds, what things a three-manifold can bound, therefore things about homology. Therefore, things about homology cobordisms or embedding, say, in the four sphere or elsewhere. And so, what Adam and I did was we worked out, we used these ideas about d-invariance for manifolds that are not rational homology spheres to cook up an invariant of a homology S1 cross S3. S1 cross S3. So, again, what do you do? You take a section Y and associate it to the embedding of. So, it's not, again, it's not just going to be an invariant of Y. It's an invariant of Y and the way it sits inside of X. And the point of that is that determines a coefficient system for the Higgard-Fleur theory, a complicated way, which I have no intention of explaining in my In my three minutes. In any case, using that, you get a couple of invariants. The most useful one are sort of D top and D bottom, which we put a little up and down. And so those are good for, well, I mean, you can tell various things about symmetries of knots. You can do other kinds of properties. In the last couple of days, Adam and I were kicking around an idea that to kind of go back to my original application. Of course go back to my original application to doubly slice knots. So I think maybe you should be able to use those D invariants to obstruct knots being doubly slice. And so let me offer just in that vein a conjecture, which I think if we could pull that, if we could pull that off, this business is about the connection between these D top and bottom for For the obstruct knots being doubly sliced, we might be able to prove a conjecture, which again goes back to my thesis, which I thought I had proved at least when p is prime, which is that if you take a two-bridged knot and take its twist spin, double two-twist spin, which is a lens base, a fiber knot with fiber lens space, take two of them, then the sum of one minus the other is doubly sliced. Well, if and only if the knots are the same, or if you like. Are the same, or if you like, the lens spaces are the same. So I think that's an interesting conjecture. And I don't know, maybe Adam and I might be able to say something about it. And let me just say, because this crossed my mind at the last minute, which is actually, this is not unlike what Adam and Ty and Lisa did in the last year or so, where they were looking at We're looking at manifolds with H1 equals Z and or pi1 equals Z and could cook up some interesting. So this is not quite the same ideology, but the same flavor of looking at Hagar-Fleur invariants in this sort of co-dimension one thing. Anyway, well, that's what I got to say. So thank you for listening, and I hope everybody who's here has a good trip home. Thanks. Okay, questions for Danny. I have one.
