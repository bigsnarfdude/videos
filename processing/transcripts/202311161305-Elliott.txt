So before I begin, I'll tell you a bit about myself. I did a PhD in machine learning at the GASPI unit. My PhD was on machine learning methods for genetics. And then after that, I did a postdoc in statistical genetics at Oxford. And then I started at SFU in 2018. So when the pandemic came, I had a variety of populations. Came, I had a variety of tools that I could use to provide statistical support to epidemiologists. And I set out to do that. And in this talk, so this conference is progress and next steps. So I'm going to talk about four projects where I have essentially completed the Essentially, I completed the work or completed checkpoints towards that. And in addition to that, I have some next steps that I'll mention briefly, including further work on some of these projects as well as entirely new directions. And the projects I'm going to talk about today, on one hand, epidemiology. So this is modeling case counts, prevalence, and serology. And serology. The first two projects were done early in the pandemic in collaboration with Carolyn Collin and the Magpie Group. So that's Mathematics, Genetics, and Prediction in Infection and Evolution, a group founded by Carolyn within Simon Fraser University. And my work on true prevalence is in collaboration with the University of Victoria. And my My main dedication in COVID is my participation in the HostSeq project. So, this is host genetics in Canada. And in 20 minutes, I will not get through all four. So, I'm going to go just really briefly over two and then skip three entirely, although in the unlikely event that I have time left over, three are on the remainder of the slide. The remainder of the slides after the closing remarks. And I'd like to begin with acknowledging the excellent researchers, trainees, and institutions that I've worked with. My group, my lab, as it relates to COVID, is the statistical support team. So my trainees, Sonny Min, former trainee Elka Gar, and current trainee. And current trainee Olya Vishnikova have contributed to these work, and also Reni Doig has collaborated immensely with my COVID efforts. And so much of my work based in SFU is in collaboration with Magpies, and the prevalence work is in collaboration with University of Victoria. University of Victoria. So many of these researchers are here today. So I'm so glad to see you all. And if anyone has questions, you can also direct them to my colleagues. With HostSeq, here I've listed the trainees of mine that are working on HostSeq, the chair of the data sharing and storage subcommittee. Chairman and Storage Subcommittee, the chair of the Genetic Epidemiology Subcommittee of HostSeq, and the members of the Genetic Epidemiology Subcommittee. HostSeq is a large consortium with many parts to it, and HOSEEK gathers data from contributing studies. So, I'm also thanking the studies that contributed to HOSSEEK. Into HOSEEK. And I am funded by Michael Smith Health Research BC Scholar Award. And all of this work is funded through that, through NCERC, Genome BC, and Genome Canada. In addition, as David Price mentioned in the first talk, I am part of the Canmod network. I'm organizing work. Workshop technique and biostatistics for spring 2024. That's funded by CANMOB. And I've recently co-organized a hackathon on various COVID topics in collaboration with United Way BC. And I was so glad to receive CanMod support for that. I'd also like to thank CanMod for organizing such a great workshop. I've learned so much at this workshop, and I'm just so glad to meet you all. I'm just so glad to meet you all. So, also, in an effort to present these four projects succinctly, in many times I'm starting with the conclusion. So, this is my first piece of work towards COVID-19 support. And when COVID first came, I approached Caroline and asked what Caroline and asked what statistical problems she had. So, this was the first problem she asked me for advice on. So, MPI modulation, what happens after we change physical distancing recommendations? In particular, how long before we see the effect of those changes? And this work was eventually published in Eurosurveillance, so this work. So, this work was led by Jessica Stockto and Rennie Doi and Jusung Min provided statistical support and many members of NIGPI also contributed. So, the title is Long Timeframes to Detect Impact of Changing COVID-19 Measures in Eurosurveillance when they accept COVID-19. When they accept COVID-19 work, they demand the title be changed to indicate the location and time period over which the data is covered. I thought this is excellent. And so later in this talk, when I present papers, I've put in square parentheses, how I edit the title to reflect the data considered. And I even added BC here in brackets. And at one point we can take from this is that the data is early in the Is that the data is early in the pandemic? So this conclusion has several caveats. One of them being the extent to which the virus has changed since then may modulate the results and also our access to data and literature is limited due to the period of the study. So the conclusion is: after health authorities recommend or require changes to non-pharmaceutical interventions, can sometimes Interventions can sometimes take a long time, or it can take some time for the changes to be reflected in case counts, sometimes up to two and a half months. So at the time, two weeks seemed to be the period of choice for many durations. But in this work, we found that after relaxing NPR, Relaxing NPIs, it can be a long time before a surge in case counts comes. And the method we used for this was differential compartmental SIR type models along with foreseen parameters. So we want to know how long until we see a statistically significant change. Until we see a statistically significant change in case counts in two models: one model with a certain level of relaxation, and another model with either maybe no relaxation of physical distancing. So, we developed this forcing function ft. Ft is divided into three periods. So, when we evaluate ft, where t is the time before distance unit is enacted, we get one measure of. One measure of physical distancing and so on for the different change points. And so we fix this function f and then we simulate case counts using an SEIR type model. So this is a model developed by Anderson et al. also in Magpies. So Carolyn is also a supervisor of this work. And we simulate from this model the two different forcing. Simulate from this model with two different forcing parameters and then compare the simulated case counts and find out what time they differ significantly. That is, they differ more than we'd expect from random fluctuations in case counts. So how do you define differing significantly? So this is my contribution to this project coming up with this metric for differing significantly, as well as developing a code base to explore this. To explore this question, so we have two scenarios: M1 and M2. M1 is with relaxation after a time point, M2 is with no relaxation. So we simulate 100 case count trajectories from each scenario, and then find the first date for which 95% of the time one scenario's case count is higher than the other scenario's case count. So we have many curves. We look forward in time until 95% of them are. 95% of them are divergent by 10. So, this threshold of 10 is certainly arbitrary. Part of our choice for that is we imagine that 10 excess cases may be enough to seed new exponential growth in COVID-19, which appeared to be reasonable around that time of the pandemic. But nonetheless, we vary the threshold. Also, one of Jessica Stockdale's main contributions to this work was coming up with estimates for F1 and F2. So these forcing functions, the parameters, F equals 1 is no distancing. F equals 0 is maximum distancing. So no contact at all. So what are the true parameters? So Jessica Slottiel did work to Bogtail did work to find MLE estimates from our data. And our conclusion was that the relaxation that was being seen in BC was 0.65. And so here we go, this x-axis goes from no distancing to maximum distancing. So 6.5 is a Maximum distance. So 6.5 is around here, and then we go across with these observed days until our simulated alarm level was reached and see this number of around 2.5 months from observing the y-axis. So this work was. This work was interesting because it did provide more context to the durations that were being discussed around that time. So my next piece of work, also in response to questions by Carolyn, was about improving serological surveys. So around Around May 2020, a group in BC performed a serological survey, and there were criticisms about the sensitivity and specificity of serology surveys. So we wanted to improve the estimates of seroprevalence. And so we thought of doing that by creating a joint model of both case counts and serological survey. Survey. So essentially, we're trying to find the seroprevalence, but instead of just looking at the number of seropositive cases in the survey, we also look at case counts. And we sort of make a joint model of both of these things and then do posterior estimation as case counts and seropositivity are related. Hopefully, we can do some sort of movement of information from case counts to seropitos. The CERO survey. And here is the model that we formed. This is a Bayesian statistical model. So each circle is a random variable. The gray circles are observations. CCT is the confirmed case counts at time t. IT is the number of infected, the size of the infected population at time t. So this we don't know, so it's not in gray. N is the population of the total population that could be captured by the zerological survey. N is the number of N is the number of serological survey tests administered, and MP is the number of positives. And so we have all these arrows between latent parameters, including sensitivity and specificity and the true positive rate of the serological survey, and tout not the prevalence at the time that the That the infection, that the pandemic first takes hold. And interestingly, you might think that, like, we a basing network like this is only useful if CC and MP are not independent. And there's sort of a chance for independence to be found because there's Found because there's only kind of one pathway of edges here. But examining this network, you actually find that CCC and MP are in fact not conditionally independent using sort of rules of collider effects. So this is showing that there is indeed information gain. Information gain in inference through this model. So we developed inference for this and we took case counts from BCCDC and we took the serological survey that had been published. So this was quite a small survey, 85 examined, of which four were positive. So the result of that after age standardization is 0.55%. And 0.55% as 0.55%, as well as a range between 0.15% and 1.37%. So, through our model, we predict a seroprevalence of 0.57%, but we have a tight area confidence ban. So, here we see a benefit of using a Bayesian analysis in which we can improve our estimate, reduce the amount of uncertainty by using additional data sources. Data sources. Next, I'll go on to HOSIQ. So, here, instead of just starting with the conclusion, I'll start with the question. How does human genetic variation modulate COVID-19 susceptibility and severity? The HostSEEK project is Canada's contribution to the global effort to answer this question. Host-Seq's mandate is to sequence the human genome of 10,000 COVID-19 positive canadians. Of 10,000 COVID-19 positive Canadians and make these genomes and case reports available to researchers. Importantly, we're looking at human DNA. We're saying, is there a human genetic variation that modulates susceptibility or severity? We're not looking at viral RNA as the main focus of HOSIQ. An initial resource paper on HOS-SIEQ was published earlier this year. It contains case information about case. Contains case information about case reports and genomes collected between March 2020 and October 2022. And Samantha Yu and Elika Garg are joint co-first authors of this work. And in my acknowledgement pages, we see the many contributions of the other authors on this paper. Here's a plot of case reports received. Of case reports received. So here we have 2020, 2021, 2022. By March 2023, we had 10,059 samples received from 15 study sites. So we achieved our goal of DNA sequencing 10,000 COVID-19 positive CNIMs. And so with these 10,059, we have whole genome sequencing. We have whole genome sequencing available and a joint call. So, this joint call is sort of a single file that you can put into Plink for another piece of genetic software. The joint call has 153 million variants. So, this comes from whole genome sequencing. There's no reference panel or assay, which leads us to having many rare variants among these 153. You can write in for access to these data, and proposals are accepted under. Accepted under a broad range of criteria that does not necessarily include COVID-19 work. So there are many other questions that can be answered by this rich genetic resource. So in recent work, in addition to providing statistical support on collecting these data, I've done, I've co-supervised analysis of these data and And this is our most recent result on a genome-wide association study. So, at a so-called genome-wide significance threshold, so when we do a GWAS, here we have the p-value for each variant. Each color is a different chromosome, and then on each chromosome, there are many genetic variants, and we record the p-value for a linear association test with. Association test with our contrast. So, in this case, our contrast is COVID-19 severity. So, we do find a significant result. FOXP4 is already known to be involved in COVID-19 severity through the Host Genetics Initiative. So, this Host Genetics Initiative is a global consortium to answer this question about host genetics. And in In fall 2021, HostSeq contributed their summary statistics to HGI. So HGI certainly has stronger results, including, for example, the hit that we've found here. And I'm so glad that Jose could contribute to the broader, more rich results that were. That were provided by HGI. And also, we imagine that further analysis in this line may answer some Canadian-specific questions. So I'll end the talk here. Thank you.
