Yes and no, in the following sense. Uh it is well known that ADS3 gravity can be rewritten in terms of a transience theory. And in the transience theory, you can construct all these Booshal lines. And the categorical symmetry I'm talking about are these Blushen lines. And so they're still there. So what is categorical similarities? Is categorical symmetry. Traditionally, we understand symmetry through symmetry transformations of the system. And a system is considered symmetric if the action is left invariant by the symmetry transformation. So it's, for example, rotation, translation, and so on, or reflection. And it is well known that these transformations that you act on the system, they would form a group. It's a group action. They would form a group. It's a group action. So we usually characterize symmetries by groups. And an important implication of symmetry is, of course, conservation laws. So for example, through the Noether theorem, the Noether theorem tells us that there will be conserved currents related to each continuous symmetry. And quantum mechanically, we get what identities that constrain the dynamics of the system. Of the system. So, in a way, conservation law is very important. And now, what about conservation laws? If you look into continuous symmetry and look at the conserved currents, so this is just if the current is a one-form, so I can write the conservation law as d star j equals zero, and I can construct a conserved charge operator, conserved charge, by integrating star. By integrating star J over a D minus 1 surface, the usual way of defining a charge operator. And Q, how is Q related to a symmetry transformation? So basically, if you exponentiate Q, that gives you a unitary operator. So for example, if this is a U1 symmetry, then alpha tells you how much U1 transfers. Then, alpha tells you how much gluon transmission you are doing. And this U operators is expected to satisfy the multiplication. Their multiplication is expected to satisfy the group protocol, their representations of the group involved. So, this is one aspect of usual group symmetries. But if you look at this carefully, then you realize that Q is a topological symmetry. That Q is a topological operator. Why is that? Because if you insert this operator into the path integral, then clearly you can freely deform the shape of this d minus one dimensional surface arbitrarily. And you do not expect that the expectation value of this charge operator to change unless it crosses some. Process some actual charges that is in the system. And therefore, this Q operator is really a topological defect, a topological operator in this symmetric system. Therefore, another way of, this currently fairly hot way of looking at symmetry is rather than to look at group actions of the system, look for topological operators in the theory. In the theory. And each and look at the topological operators tells you what symmetries there are. You directly study the properties of the topological operators. And this is where categorical symmetry comes into play. So how do we understand where does the word category come from? Basically, Basically, now that you've shifted your focus from group action to topological operators, then it is also quite natural that rather than looking only at co-dimension one topological operators, which is the case for defining when we define the charge operator, it is integrated over a co-dimensional one surface. But once you shift your attention to You shift your attention to topological operators, then there's no reason that you have to look at co-dimensional one surface. You can look at co-dimension one surface, co-dimension two surfaces where operators are defined over these surfaces and they're topological. So to characterize, so in other words, to characterize the symmetry of a system, we try to collect all the topological operators of codimension one, codimension two, and so on. Connection to and so on, and look at this collection of things and look at what are the relationships between these things. And this is an alternative way of characterizing symmetries of a system. When you start looking into topological operators of higher co-dimensions, this is what people usually call higher symmetries as a generalization. But the full generalization is that just look at all the co-op Is that just look at the collection of all the topological operators in your feeling and ask what are the relationships between these things. And the thing is, the word category comes in when you think of if I multiply these operators together and they are of different co-dimensions, they can, so there is some kind of fusion rules between these things, and there will be some consistency conditions that we're going to. Some consistency conditions that we're going to talk about further, particularly in 2 plus 1 dimensions. So, and the point is, when you look into fusion of these topological operators, they have to satisfy some consistent conditions. And these consistency conditions tell us that these topological operators have a mathematical structure characterized by a category, by a fusion category. And this is why. Category. And this is why these symmetries are often called categorical symmetries. Because rather than understanding it as a group, the most natural and general way of understanding these symmetries is to look at the fusion rules of all these topological operators of different co-dimensions, and they would form a huge mathematical structure that is a tensor category. And group symmetry is only a sub. A subset of all these possible things. In fact, these symmetry operators may not even be unitary, may not even have an inverse, unlike usual group symmetry transformations, but yet they are still conserved. They still lead to conservation laws and they have lots of implications. So when I talk about categorical symmetry, I'm just talking about the mathematical structure formed by this collection of topological operators. So how do we So how do we, so what is the basic ingredient in a topological, in a categorical symmetry? As we were discussing, we need to look into all the topological operators of different co-dimensions. And so let's say we first look at co-dimension one operators, just like the usual charge operators, and they would correspond to objects of a tensor category. As a category. And then you can also look at co-dimension two operators. So, for example, in a one plus one-dimensional theory, a co-dimension one operator is a line. And I can also have co-dimension two defects, which would be point particles, point operators that I could insert into would insert into the path integral. And this point operator could be separating two. Could be separating two different line operators, right? And therefore, you can understand codimension two operators as the kind of maps, as a kind of linear maps or morphisms between objects. And this story goes on. If I'm living in a high-dimensional space, then I can start talking about co-dimensional three operators, which can be understood as morphisms between one morphism. And they're called two morphisms. And so if you start talking. And so, if you start talking about things with objects and one morphism, that gives you a fusion category, a one category. If you start talking about codimension, three operators, which are two morphisms, which are morphisms between one morphism, they are called two categories. And this thing could go on forever. Of course, higher categories are not so well understood. One are fusion categories, one categories that include only objects and morphisms, they are way better understood. But nonetheless, Better understood. But nonetheless, you can see why this mathematical structure comes about when discussing topological defects. Okay, so then what kind of mathematical structure or consistency conditions do we expect out of having this collection of objects and one morph and so forth. So, for example, the most basic The most basic consistency conditions would be something along the lines of associativity constraints. In fact, most of these constraints have something to do with associativity. Namely, that if I start, if I have multiple line operators, and let's say I put them alongside each other, then I can consider fusing them, multiplying them. And I can consider multiplying. So if I have, let's say, a 1, 2, 3. Let's say one, two, three different operators. I can first fuse the two, first fuse the first two and then fuse with the third one, or I can fuse with the two and three and then fuse with one. And are they equal? In general, they're not equal, but they're linearly dependent. And so this leads to consistency conditions. So if I have four things fusing together, I can first use one, two, and then two. First fuse one, two, and then fused with three and then four, and then I can. But then they are linearly related to first fusing one, two, and fusing three, four. And then you find that you have two different ways of fusing to the same final fusion diagram. And if you require that, this line of transformation is the same as this line of transformation. You get a non-trivial constraint on the associated. On the associativity relation between fusion channels, and that is the famous Pentagon equation that constraints the fusion route of this fusion category. So this is the Pentagon equation is, I'll say some more things about the Pentagon equation shortly, but the idea is that when you have lots of topological operators, you can fuse them in different orders. You can fuse them in different orders, and that would automatically lead to constraints. The Pentagon equation is good for one fusion category, but if you start looking into two fusion categories, you need not have, you have to modify the Pentagon equation, so to speak. But then at the end of the day, it is still about looking for all the consistency conditions that relate these operators together in one. Together in one mathematical object, and that is the basic rule of the game of tensor categories. Okay, and so this is the Pentagon equation comes from fusion constraints over order of fusion. And sometimes your category has more structures. If you have co-dimension to operators in the theory, you can start talking about brain. Theory, you can start talking about braiding them. And so, then, on top of this structure of fusion, you might also include rules of braiding these operators. And this extra structure gives you a braided fusion tensor category. And they would have extra consistency constraints by changing the order of braiding and fusion. And so, for example, this is the hexagon identity. And so, basically, depending on what you do. Depending on what you do with your topological defects, you can collect them in different mathematical structures. Either they have a fusion category, or they are braided fusion category, or they are braided fusion, two category, three category, and so on. But this is the category story just helps you to organize these topological defects and the consistency between them. And you're able to classify these objects based on these. Based on these consistency conditions. So, is there any question about categories? Not, then let's move on to how do you use them. And so, to use them, I'll talk about this holographic relation between constructing a QFD with a certain categorical symmetry and a topological field theory in one high dimension. So, this kind of relation is actually okay familiar. So, for example, the famous example that you must have heard of is the relation between CFT Western Middle Wood model and trans-Islamic theory. But it is somewhat more general than that. So, in particular, it is observed in 2020 that any theory That any theory with some discrete group symmetries, I can construct the partition function of such a QFD with this symmetry by first looking into a topological theory in one high dimensions, which is a topological, this topological theory, if you're considering group symmetries, then this topological theory within one high dimension should be one of those diagram proton theory, basically a lattice of Basically, a lettuce, not necessarily lattice, but the point is, this is a gauge theory, a topological gauge theory with gauge for G in D plus 1 dimensions. And so the point is, if you want to construct a QFT, not necessarily a topological theory, but any QFT in D dimensions with a certain symmetry, you can always think of it as giving appropriate boundary conditions to a TQF. Conditions to a TQFT in one higher dimensions with appropriate boundary conditions. So in this case, if the bulk theory is D plus one dimensional lattice gauge theory with gauge group G, then he shows that it is possible to look for appropriate boundary conditions. You need two boundaries. And so he says that this is some Dirigier boundary condition, and here is some more non-trivial boundary conditions. And it is always possible to choose some approach. Always possible to choose some appropriate boundary condition so that this object has non-trivial dynamics on this side, and because the other side is the Richard boundary condition is sort of topological, you can squeeze this sandwich to be arbitrarily thin. The topological theory is gaps, there's nothing in between. So you can make it arbitrarily thin, and you would recover the path integral of the QFT. But then what is the virtue of thinking of the QFT? Of thinking of the QFT as the boundary, some appropriate boundary conditions of a D plus 1 TQFD, it is to make the categoricals of the group symmetry completely explicit. Because all these charge operators corresponds to line defects of the topological theory, and it can be made completely explicit that these line defects can move freely in the TQOFD, and so it would. In the TQFT, and so it will automatically be a symmetry that is preserved by the QFT. So, so it is proposed. So, the bottom line is QFT, any QFT with symmetries can be thought of as the boundary, as giving appropriate boundary conditions to a TQFT in one higher dimension. And this TQFT has appropriate, it's characterized by the appropriate category. So, initially, gas. So initially, Gauto and France made this observation or they made this explicit construction for group symmetries. But this is a way more general picture. Basically, any categorical symmetry, so to speak, any QFT with a specific categorical symmetry, I can still think of it as being the appropriate boundary conditions of topological theory in one high dimension. Theory in one high dimension. And this topological theory is constructed based on the topological data that characterize the category that characterize these topological defects. Okay, so and transmission theory is actually one example of that. But so I will skip this part because some symmetry-protected topological order can be thought of that way. Topological order can be thought of that way. It's not important for our story. The important story is CFTs can be thought of as some appropriate boundary conditions. Transammers theory is an example. But and the topological defects of the boundary CFT would be corresponding to the risen lines in the transient image. So, this is a story that we knew before. But this holographic relation. But this holographic relation is not helpful if there is not a systematic way for me to construct the CFT. We know that if I have a transience theory, there is some non-trivial, there could be a CFT boundary, but how do I construct any CFT systematically if I know that topological defects form a certain tensor category? This is the question. So I want to systematically construct the CFT. Systematically construct the CFT using the data that defines the categorical symmetry. How do I do that? So, knowing that there's such a relation is not enough. I need the systematic method. Okay, so let's look into explicit examples of this systematic method. And to use this systematic method involves this so-called TuriF Bureau formulation of TQFT, and let's focus our attention. And let's focus our attention in two plus one dimension, in which we need to write down a TQFT in this so-called Giraffe-Bureau formulation. I'm going to need the data that defines a given fusion category. So what are the ingredients that go into a fusion category that is enough to define this TQFD? I need every category, again, the objects of the topological VMAX, right? The objects of the topological VAX, right? So it is a collection of stuff. So a simple object is a collection of stuff. They're simple, as in every object can be written as a mini combination of the simple objects. Can be decomposed into sums of simple objects. And then I also, in the fusion category, I also need data about one morphisms. What are the basically defects between simple objects? Simple objects. And in the case of this kind of class of fusion categories that I'm going to talk about, it is that the one morphisms are fairly trivial. As in, if you have a simple object, the only map within this simple object, A to A, is identity. And so there's only trivial morphisms within a simple object. And then I also have. And then I also have to define the fusion rules between the objects. So if I have a simple object A and simple object B, I can define fusion or tensor product. And this tensor product can be decomposed in terms of simple objects. Again, and NABC is the fusion coefficients. They are non-negative integers telling me how many different channels, different fusion channels I have to go from ABC. Have to go from AB to C, to fuse AB into C. And I also have to define something as in the quantum dimension. And one way of understanding it is it is if I think of NABC as a matrix, then the largest quantum dimension, so if I take NA, so NA as a matrix with index B and C, then the maximum eigenvalue of N A is Eigenvalue of nA is so the quantum dimension of this object A. Roughly speaking, it means that if I have lots and lots of A fused together, what is the total number of different ways of fusing to a given product? It would be scale exponentially with this largest eigenvalue. And so the point is: this, okay. This, okay, I'll put it this way. If I'm talking about group representations, if the objects are representations of a group, then DA would simply be the representation, would simply be the dimensions of this representation. It is basically more or less characterizing what is the dimension of this object. So, but it is just data. From the point of view of a fusion category, it is just a data that goes into defining this category. Okay, and then I am going because I have these fusion rules, so I also have to address this question of associativity of the fusion of these objects. So if I fuse A, B and then fuse with C, how is that related to fusing B, C with A? In general, they're not directly equal. They're just linearly dependent. And the linear map between doing this fusion and doing that fusion, the linear. Fusion and doing that fusion, the linear map between them is so-called F symbols. So if I have, if I'm fusing AB first and then C so that the final product is D, it is compared to fusing B C first and then A so that the final product is D. These two kinds of fusion is they're not independent and the linear depend or the linear relationship between them is characterized Relationship between them is characterized by these numbers. They're numbers and they're so-called 6j symbols in the sense that they have exactly six indices. And that's a geometrical meaning of this number that I'm going to go into shortly. So having the collection of objects, the fusion rules, SXJ symbol of the basic ingredients characterizing one fusion category. This is topological data that I'm going to need. Is the topological data that I'm going to need to obtain a TQFT in Turi-Bureau formulation? So, then what is the topological theory look like in this formulation? It is a two plus one-dimensional theory, and how do I see that? So, in this theory, what happens is that consider any oriented 3D manifold, and consider triangulating this manifold. So, triangulating a 3D manifold. So, triangulating a 3D manifold means cutting it into tetrahedrons. And after I cut it into tetrahedrons, in general, I have to give some order of the vertices, but this is some detail that is not very important. What is important is that on every tetrahedron, every tetrahedron has six legs. So you can see that a 6J symbol has six legs. A tetrahedron has six legs. So I'm going to ultimately assign a value. To ultimately assign a value to every tetrahedral, and that value is going to be the 6J symbol. So, every 6J symbol is going to be associated to a tetrahedron. And so, in order to do that, I have to assign these objects to put a label on each of the legs of the tetrahedron. And so, first of all, I label every edges of the tetrahedron by an object. And then I'm going to put this F symbol. To put this F symbol, so I'm going to formulate the path integral in 2 plus 1 dimensions. And so, what I'm going to do is that I need to assign some value to every tetrahedral. So, that is kind of like the path integral over this small tetrahedral object. And I'm going to, so after I've labeled every edge by an object, I'm going to assign the value that I is evaluated on this touchhedron is going to be given by. Touchedron is going to be given by the F symbol, such that the indices of the F symbol is basically controlled by the six labels that I put on the six edges of a single tetrahedron. So if I cut space-time into many such tetrahedrons, I'm going to label every edge by some of these objects, and then each tetrahedron would be associated with a very specific 6J symbol. That is a number. 6J symbol. That is a number that is assigned to each tetrahedron. If two tetrahedrons share an edge, then that edge would be, that label would be shared between these two F symbols sharing this edge. Then what is the partition function over this three-dimensional manifold? The partition function over this three-dimensional manifold is basically that every tetrahedron, after I triangulate it into tetrahedron, I associate some F to Some f to each of these tetrahedrons, weighted by the quantum dimension on each of this edge. And then I'm going to sum over all the edges on the edges. And this would define for me the partition function of the TQFT. It is a topological TQFT because using basically using this Pentagon relation that relates, that is a constraint of the F. That is a constraint of the F, you can show that this is a topological number independent of how I cut the three-dimensional manifold into tetrahedral. And so the Pentagon relation is what protects this number to be a topological invariant characterizing this 3D manifold. Okay, so this is the, so I define a TQFT into three dimensions using the data. Using the data characterizing one fusion category. Now what? Now I'm going to use this to construct lattice models in two dimensions, one plus one dimensions, using the data that defines a three-dimensional TQFT. So that gives, and I'm going to, and it is going to be that using this TQFT as a starting point, I give you the data of a fusion category. So it means that I already control. It means that I already fixed the data about the topological defects. And then I'm going to use this data to find the corresponding CFD that has this tensor category characterizing its topological symmetries. This is where we're going. And I have to say that this kind of construction is not invented by me, and it has been around for quite some time. Time. It was first observed by these people that tensor categories is very much related to the Hamiltonian of a large class of RSOS. Sorry. So I understand that with this construction you will produce some theory in one plus one. Right. I mean just by construction. But how how the category knows that the theory for example is relativistic in one plus one? It is relativistic. Very good. You will see that first shot. That very shortly. A priori, it's not true. I only give you the TQFT part. I haven't given you where conformal symmetry comes. So, conformal symmetry has to come in in a certain point. So, I'm going to show, and that has to do with the ADS-theory stuff that it is going to emerge from this picture. But I have to say that knowing that well-known minimal models, lattice integral models can come from this tensor category is not something new. People know. It's not something new. People noticed that for a while. And I'm just making use of that to push it a little bit further and to see how continuous field theory and this lattice stuff connect smoothly together along the way of an ADS3 space has to be there. So, how does it work? How does the CFT or the integrable model, lattice model partition function, how is that related to this? How is that related to this Turai FTQFT that I just talked about? The relation is the following. What I'm going to read is that, first of all, I have to construct the ground state of... This Levin Web model is just a different way of talking about the Turiah-Bureau TQFT. I want to construct the ground state wave function of this TQFT defined on a two-dimensional surface, or in particular let's say the surface of a ball. Let's say the surface of the ball. I want to construct the ground state of this TQFT. How do you, and what I'm the CFT, where does the two-dimensional lattice model come from? The thing is, first of all, construct this ground state wave function. Then, pick some very mysterious state on this same surface. This mysterious state is picked by some very arbitrary means. By some very arbitrary means. And then the observation is that if you pick this omega very carefully and take the overlap of this topological wave function with this mysterious state, this overlap is equal to the partition function of these families of lattice models. So, how do people pick these things? So, first of all, you need to know that these ground state wave functions have These ground state wave functions have a tensor network representation. Actually, this tensor network representation is very, very intuitive. How do you construct a ground state wave function of a TQFD? The simplest way is that I just do a path integral on the three ball, and the surface is the surface on which I want to define the wave function. And so if I do the path integral on the three-ball, then I get a wave function of the two-dimensional circuit. On the two-dimensional surface of this hole. And so, how do I do a pattern to brawl on the three-pole? The easiest way is that I just cut it into a tetrahedron such that the surface is triangles and the legs orthogonal to the triangles in this tetrahedron is connected to the center of this ball. This is the simplest way of characterizing a path of cutting this three-ball into tetrahedrals. So, in order to construct the So, in order to construct the ground state wave function of this TQFD, what I do is that I cut the surface into this tetrahedron, such as the orthogonal legs, which is, so this diagram is a projection of this three-dimensional ball. These red dots here at the corner of the triangle are the legs orthogonal to the two-dimensional surface of the ball. And so, and each of these red dots, they're the legs orthogonal. These red dots, they're the legs orthogonal, they're connected to the center of the ball. And so, if I want to construct the wave function on this ball, sorry, on this S2, all I need to do is just sum over all this red, all the labels on these red dots, with each of this triangle with three dots being a tetrahedral, and I've assigned to it the 6j symbols. And so, once I sum over all the red dots, this would become a function of the labels. function of the labels on the surface of the edges on the S2. And this would be a wave function of this TQFT on an S2. So on the surface of the S2 I would have some arbitrary number of triangles depending on how I triangulate it and the wave function on this particular triangulation would be a bunch of these 6J symbols multiplied together with those red dots, the labels of the red dots. Dots, the labels on the red dots, some don't work. So, this is a systematic way of constructing the ground-state wave function. Of course, I have chosen a very specific triangulation on the surface as well. And it is well known that if I have a boundary, if this manifold that I'm considering is not a closed manifold, then this object is no longer independent of triangulation. It is at least dependent on the triangulation of the surface. This is going to be an important point. Oh dear. Okay, so I'm just describing for you how I construct systematically this side LW by doing a path integral of the boom. And what was observed in the literature is that they compared this object and they just find, they just observe that if I pick some very arbitrary projection of the surface, so if here this is a function of the surface edge. A function of the surface edges on the triangles. But if I make some projection, which is equivalent to defining a state and taking overlap, if I make some very specific projection on the labels on the surface of this hole, I will be able, they notice that they can recognize bits by bits, this is exactly the same as the partition function of all these well-known. Of all these well-known lattice integrable models. So, let me give you a very quick example. I think I'm running out of time, but let's say in the case I choose the tensor category to be the Ising Fusion category. And so every edge can be either one sigma or psi, which is represented, one sigma psi, one and psi is represented by zero and one. This one half is corresponding to the label sigma. So and this triangle. So, and these triangles are basically the 6J symbols characterizing the Ising fusion category. So, if you open the big yellow book on CFD, they would give you all these numbers there. And so, what happens, they notice that if they make a projection where all these, so this triangle is the triangulation on the surface, this other graph is the dual graph. It's just an alternative way of representing the triangles. The triangles, you draw a new graph. So they noticed that if you put this lines, these green lines projected to sigma and project all the red lines to a linear combination of one and psi, you find that these red dots here that I have to sum over would play the role of Ising spins. And this R here would play exactly the same role of controlling the temperature of the Ising model. So this model is exactly, they know. This model is exactly, they notice that if I make this choice, locally I can identify bit by bit with the Ising spin model, partition function. Partition function, you have to sum over all the spins. So they just noticed that summing over these red dots is equivalent to summing over the Ising spins in the Ising lattice model. And so they just noticed that there are suitable records for this projection on the surface such that the ground state wave function of the TQFT. wave function of the TQFT can be, after I project the surface spins to a particular direction, I would recover the well-known partition function of lattice models. And so in particular, if I chose R to be the critical temperature of the Ising model, I would recover the Ising CFT in the thermodynamic limit. So in the literature, the way they identify Or In the literature, the way they identify this omega n is by inspection, by comparing with well-known models, and notice that it is possible to identify something so that it recovers well-known integrable models. But this is not systematic at all. So I haven't Systematic at all. So I haven't addressed the question that you posed. How do I actually find this omega? And this is where the interesting things come into play. I have to introduce something called an RG operator. And so from this point onwards, there's a lot of something that is built upon what is already on the literature. So these sex G's, as I mentioned, if you choose a particular Mention, if you choose a particular triangulation on the surface, you can then I would have a particular wave function. But by making use of the Pentagon equation of this X-G symbol, it is actually possible to relate the wave function on a particular triangulation on the surface with another wave function on the same surface with different triangulations. Different triangulations. So basically, as I mentioned, there are these Pentagon relations that are satisfied by the 6J symbol. And therefore, by playing with these, using these 6J symbols, the properties of this 6J symbol, for example, this lattice here with four triangles can be related, is equivalent to the wave function with only two triangles multiplied by two a set of two tetrahedrons with some intermediate state summed over. Intermediate state summed over. So the bottom line is because this is a topological model, the wave function on a surface with a given triangulation is related to each other using the properties of this distances. So I can consider doing the following. Suppose I start with one particular triangulation with a lattice constant A. Then I can construct another triangulation with a regular lattice constant. I can do that by a C. I can do that by a series of these relations. I can make it more explicit, but let me not do it now because I'm running out of time. And this wave function is related to this wave function by summing with a bunch of these extra 6J symbols. So now I can think, and I can repeat this process. I can go on to relate this wave function with another wave function with still bigger lattice constant. And so that would be related to another wave function. So that would be related to another wave function with regular lightest constant by another bunch of these f's. And so if I look at this overlap, I can think of, oh, if I group this f's with this omega n, then it is as if this omega n is flowing under the action of some matrix, some huge matrix. This f is basically a matrix that maps a lot. A matrix that maps a lattice with a smaller lattice constant to another lattice with a bigger lattice constant. Because this, you see, if you consider this lattice and this lattice, this lattice has fewer edges, this has more edges. And this is the matrix that connects this lattice with that lattice. So these things that I put here have the look. If I repeatedly take relate to wave functions with small, larger and larger letter scales, these f This F, if you look at it carefully, it has exactly the same structure like a mirror tensor network. And what is a CFT? What is the appropriate boundary condition such that you would get a CFT? It is equivalent to finding the fixed point or the eigenstate of this matrix. If there exists an omega n such that if you contract it with one layer of this f that maps you to a lattice with a smaller with a bigger lattice and if it if With omega letter, and if this omega n after this contract remains invariant, this would give you a CFT. So I am turning this problem of if I want to look for a CFT with a specific tensor category symmetry, I first construct the TQFT using the data of the category. Then I construct an RG operator using this data, and I look for eigenstates of this. And I look for eigenstates of this RG operator. Every single eigenstate corresponds to a CFT or one TQFT with this. I have to say that eigenstates of this operator, it can either be CFT, but it can also be a TQFT in one lower dimension with the wanted symmetry. So the thing is, there are two things. So first of all, I give a method of looking for VCFT. Secondly, an ADS. Secondly, an ADS3 space just emerges in the spectrum. If you want to look for something with conformal symmetry, then it is necessary that you have to build something that looks like an ADS-3 geometry would emerge from this picture if you're looking for CFTs. So they're basically RG fixed points or eigenstates of these RG algorithms. Of these RGR features. And they are very explicit. Now, these maps are not some mysterious things that you cannot define. It is a very well-defined matrix. Just look for the eigenstates. Yeah, I see that you constructed some CFD. You have misconstruction, but I don't see the other way around. So, in the last sentence, you say every CFD is given by an active state of this map. That's a little too much, but it may be. Okay, this is a Maybe, okay, this is a conjecture. Okay, but if you have a particular, if this CFT has the symmetry, then I think it would emerge out of it because this is just making the symmetry. And okay, towards the end, I would give you... So initially, I don't know how to find these eigenstates exactly. Later, I figured out how to do that. And once I figure out how to do that, then I can pretty, I can fairly safely say that. I can fairly safely say that this is a true question. I know because this is a discrete structure and it is not clear why every CFT has structured. It is coming. It is coming. And unfortunately, I only have four minutes. But this is something that it is coming. And let me show you how. So the point is, I did not, initially, I did not know how to look for exact eigenstates of this F. So what I did, So, what I did was that I did some numerics. So, basically, I know how to look for topological fixed points of this stuff. As in, there are different eigenstates. And there are some eigenstates that are easier to find than the CFT ports. And to look for simple eigenstates, you can look, construct these things using something called the Frobenius algebra in the tensor category. So, this is some very well-defined, well-known methods. Well-defined, well-known mathematical objects in the tensor category, and using them, I can construct one set of fixed points. And then, what we notice is that suppose I start with a boundary conditions that is a linear combination of one topological eigenstate and another topological eigenstate. And then I repeatedly use this RG operator to flow it. And if you flow it many times, it will reach a fixed point, right? So if you're not So, if you're not at a critical point, then it would either flow to one of the topological solutions that I started with. But when you tune this interpolating parameter, that would be a point when the theory doesn't know which of the topological fixed points to go to, and that would give you the critical points. And we basically numerically reproduce all the well-known critical temperatures in these RSOS models using this method. But that was at a point when I did not know how. That was at a point when I did not know how to systematically look for eigenstates of this topology operating. So later, I figured out that the question actually has an analytic answer. And the thing is, it is known in the literature that these 6G symbols are actually related to the fusion coefficients, structure constants. Coefficients, structure constants of open string of boundary operator in the rational CFT. In a diagonal rational CFT. In the non-diagonal case, we have also figured out how to deal with it, but I'll not talk about here. I only have a couple minutes. So first of all, 6G symbols related to the structured coefficients of open string boundary operators. In particular, how do I relate it? Basically, these core. Basically, these corner degrees of freedom will be related to the boundary condition, conformal boundary cardistic labels. And these edges on the triangle, they will be related to the conformal families, the primary families of the rational CFT. And then, so this is one hint. And then hint number two is how do conformal blocks transform under change of order of mutation? They transform precisely again by the same set of. Precisely, again, by the same set of 6J symbols. So, using these two conditions, then you realize how do I construct this boundary conditions that is a fixed point of the RG operator. You realize that if I have a conformal block, so this is basically the three-point function of primaries, open CFT primaries, and these I labels are. And these I labels are basically the descendants label. If I stick this three-point function to, this is the tetrahedral, which is defining the TQFD path integral. If I stick this conformal block onto this RG onto the TQFD wave function, these two things together is precisely the three-point open three-point function. Point open three-point function of a CFT. So in this case, in order to construct omega, I have to introduce this auxiliary index i, which is going to play the role of descendants of the CFT. And so it means that in order to construct omega, it is a PEP tensor network with infinite one dimensions, so to speak. It is expected, if you want to, it is well known in the condensed matter theory, among condensed matter theory people, if you want to construct a CF. Construct a CFT things, then the bond dimensions have to go very large. And now the bond dimension is played by the role of descendants, open descendants. So the bottom line is, if you stick conformal blocks onto this TQFT wave function, you would get an open, you would basically get a path integral of the CFT on essentially a pair of pens, except it is shaped as a triangle. It is shaped as a triangle with these red dots playing the role of these boundaries. And it is, and this kind, if I construct Oveger based on these conformal blocks, you can show that because it transforms under different order of fusion, also by the 6J symbols, you can basically show that this is the eigenstate of the TQFT RG operator, subjected to this condition, that if I have a strip with a boundary condition. A strip with a boundary condition Cardi state J, and if I sum over all these boundaries with a weight that is equal to the quantum dimension of this J, this has to be equal to this strip. So where did I see this boundary? So this relation, it came out of the TQFT. In order that this is an eigenstate, I want this to be true. But it just happens. So this is a prescription that came out of the TQFT. Prescription that came out of the TQFT because this thing is basically the sum of the corner degree of freedom. But I have seen these boundary conditions previously elsewhere when I looked at entanglement entropy of CFD. So when we compute entanglement entropy, we have to introduce some fake entanglement boundary. So you have to have some requirements of this entanglement boundary so that it does not change that reduced density matrix. It doesn't change the expectation value of all the operators. Expectation value of all the operators when you insert operators into the sub-region. So you have to have special requirements on the boundaries of these fake entanglement boundaries. This is the entanglement boundary conditions that we found, some work that we done back in 2020, but it is something that it is not only us, other people also figured something very similar, that the entanglement boundary looks something like this. So, what I'm trying to say is. So, what I'm trying to say is the TQFT tells me what is an entanglement boundary condition, and it tells me that if you want to construct the CFT, these are kinematic data, they're conformal blocks, they have nothing to do, it's not dynamic. But if you stick this conformal block onto the TQFT wave function, then it gives you some open patches. And putting these patches together, the TQFT also tells you how to close. CFD also tells you how to close these holes and recover a smooth two-dimensional CFD potential function. Does it have anything to do with the renormalizer technology? I don't know. I don't know. Because when we constructed it, we were only, I don't know, so okay. I just don't know. Okay, so I am basically out of time, but let me just say, what have we? What have we? But let me just say, what have the TQFT done when you're at the curriculum thing, at the fixed point? What the TQFT has done for you is that it arbitrarily discretized the CFT partition function into patches of triangles with all these holes, conformal boundary conditions. But then the TQFD also teaches you how to sum over these conformal boundary conditions so that these holes would close. And therefore, I start with some lattice theory. That is theory, and how does it connect with the conformal theory? This is how it is connected, and it is exact. So, in fact, at some point in time, we tested whether this hole actually closed investing in the Ising CFT numerically. And then we find that, yes, this is equal to that with pretty high risk. Even though we did not include all the numerically, you can. In numerically, you can't possibly include all the open descendants. We only include three, four descendants, and it already has at least four significant configurations of accuracy that this whole just close if you give exactly this resolution. If you do not sum over, it doesn't close. Okay, so is that this kind of RG operator and stuff related to the AES? Initially, when we did not know about this other story, then I just Story. Then I just did some very stupid numerical tests. I constructed this ADS discretized look of ADS geometry. I insert some operator at the top level. I insert some operator in the interior. And I just want to check bulk boundary propagators. Does it look anything like the usual ADS CFT prescription result? And the answer is yes, it does. Numerically, it just looks like that. So it gives me confidence that maybe I'm along the right track. That maybe I'm along the right track. This is a way to reconstruct something about the ADSF team. But now, once I know this story about the connection with cutting the open CFD, cutting the CFT into open patches and then sew them together again. Then we realized that any large C CFT, the boundary operator or structure coefficients in the large C limit, is actually there. It is closely related. It is closely related to the view theory, and they are basically given by the 6G symbols of the quantum group UQLSOT. And this quantum group is closely related to the technology QFT. And the technology QFT is a subsector of ADS3 gravity, basically the non-degenerate sector of the real mind. And so our framework, I would be, if I follow my framework, I would reconstruct. Framework, I would reconstruct an RG operator that has the look of ADS3 space, and that TQFT is up to some, there are some sample tests. So I have to say there's some sample tests with divergence, but it is basically the technology TQFT that is filling the ADS report. And so using this framework, not only can you reconstruct exact tensor networks that recover an integrated family of CFDs, it's simple. It seems that the usual ADS3 CF2 story is part of this story. So, as I said, there's still subtlety because we have to control when you sum over these indices. So, when you sum over these corner variables, in the rational CFT, this is a finite sum, sum over the object labels. But in the technology QFT, this would be an integral. And that integral, you This would be an integral, and that integral you have to control divergence. So, that is some subtleties, and we are still working on it. But we have numerical evidence and some and basically a framework how to deal with it, how to subsume this, how to show that this is equivalent to the usual ADS3 or CFT2 story. So, let me so basically you can do this thing for high dimensions. You use the topological data of high dimensions. Detect the topological data of high intensive categories. And to show that you should cover Ising CFT, look at the, try to search for fixed point of this RG operator in three plus one dimension and look for critical temperature of Ising CFT. You can do that. We used some very crude numerics and got something of this sort. This is the state-of-the-art result in the literature. But whether it is related to ADS3 CFT. Is this related to ADIS3 CFT in this higher dimensional case? I don't know. What I do know is that you can generalize the story to arbitrary dimensions. And it's of ADS3 CFT2. I have good reasons for that. It is part of the ADIS3CF2 story. And so I think I've completely run out of time, so let me just start teaching quickly.   I just wanted to change it to what I very much do.  Yeah, stick that's I mean it's unnatural because to do it for us we need uh Because to do it for ourselves we need negative potential and the first row condition to be satisfied. You have negative potential because you need contraction. And the first row condition is state and the contraction is very very construction. So so you can if you give me an algorithm with Einstein gravity, modified Einstein gravity and and I scale up. And I scale up those, even if it's brand state compression. So I can go to the ISTEM frame and see the conditions and stuff like that. I used to give time once.  And if you speed function W is and capital W is the area. Um Um slide that. For the problem for A and B. But when this QW is a constant. Okay, but okay. But I suppose it is marked is the alpha is. Ah, this office. Okay, it's a powerful for the power of the one that's. Thank you. Did you hear for the session? Yes. Okay, see you there. Actually, really help me. Yeah, uh because you also need a contract. So you need to show that uh they dot is active. Or the age of character because the second has to be slow contraption. So a parasite is the slow contraction. This is not what you're getting, but it's very interesting because for instance of this you work In case nobody else, I don't have to. I'm curious about it. So yesterday I was like the first option I was going to engage in. Because I think if this current is not time independent, these equations of motion are not correct ones. When you derive this equation of motion, each of phi respect to phi presents this phi, right? And then you do some partial integrations. So in the equation of motion for phi, you should have some omega derivatives. I mean, I didn't sit down to check. I mean I I didn't sit down to check, but in my mind it makes sense, right? I mean so I think these equations of motion they are only valid for this constant. Right? So what you are showing here is that the only possible value for alpha is alpha equals to one. This is what is a requirement. Yeah, because if if it opposed tomorrow then this cancels and there's no time independence. Yeah. And nothing diverges. So but if you want to also the time dependence then double check. I'm familiar with myself and I don't know how to compare time sleepers or so you are studying judiciary in Brussels.  I mean, I think this is the opposite for the actual. So, what I'm saying is that in the way it's written, so we need to be curved. So we need to be careful. This metric G must be the metric that I was saying. Right? Because if I vert this atom spec to phi, I don't have this.
