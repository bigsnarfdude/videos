Thanks for the introduction and for the opportunity of being here. As uh I has been told in the introduction, I will present a recent work that I've done together with my supervisor, Littleberto. Basically, we study this non-linear Laplacian system. Especially, we focus our attention on the consensus dynamics under some perturbations, and we try to exploit as much as possible the C. We try to exploit as much as possible the symmetry of the system. So, let me start by introducing the linear model, so something well known. So, basically, the Laplacian flow or Laplacian dynamics is defined by this equation where we have the Laplacian matrix and a state vector on Rn. This equation, if you write it component-wise, basically. Write it component-wise, basically, we have that the Laplacian evaluates the differences between connected nodes. I'm saying connected nodes because you can think that there is a network to which node you associate a state, a scalar state, and then you can construct this system where basically the Laplacian matrix, or here A, which is the adjunct C matrix, encodes the network structure. So this kind of system. So this kind of system has been widely studied and widely used for consensus problems when the linear system is enough to describe it. One can also ask what kind of process give rise to consensus and actually we can think about diffusion, diffusion in a discrete setting. In fact, if we look at equation one and then we look at the heat equation, we see that there is Equation, we see that there is an analogy. Basically, the discrete Laplacian is replaced by the differential Laplacian. So, in some sense, we can say that this Laplacian flow, the linear one, is the discrete analog of the continuous diffusion, the diffusion for extended systems. So, today we will look at one of the possible non-linear extensions of the Laplacian dynamics. In the literature, as In the literature, it has been referred to as absolute Laplacian flow, and since I will look at it under some generic some perturbation, I will call this absolute Laplacian flow. So what's the difference here? Basically, we see that we change the state vector on the vector field by a non-linear vector field, which I call response vector field, and it has a particular structure. I call it response vector field because now the nodes do not respond linearly in some sense. Does not respond linearly in some sense, but each node responds in a non-linear fashion. The perturbation at the moment is just generic. Later, we will see some assumptions that we can make. And we have epsilon, which is a small parameter, as usual. So we see that we preserve some of this kind of extension preserves some of the algebraic structure of the linear Laplacian dynamics, particularly this multiplication between the Laplacian and a vector field. Since I made already an I made already an analogy between continuous process and discrete process, which helps to understand what's going on in some sense. In this case, we can think as this equation a sort of discrete analog of Fokke Planck because we have a non-linear diffusion and then the perturbation acts as a drift. At the moment, it might be not very clear that the perturbation acts as a drift, but later on we will see. But later on, we will see more clearly why that's happening. So, let me just briefly highlight the strategy of how we study this system. We start by studying the amperturbed system, and for the ampertu system, we try to characterize equilibria and symmetries. Later, we introduce the perturbation, and we will see how the system is affected. In particular, I mean, we look at what's happening near the consensus point. What's happening near the consensus space, so the consensus dynamics. So now let me start to build up more formally, a bit more formally, the system that we are looking. So we consider simple graphs with positive weights. So we have a graph that is undirected without set-loop and nor multiple edges. Then we have, in general, positive weights on the edges, and this is a sort of And this is a sort of a kind of assumption that is nice both from application because we can think about strength of interaction, but also because then we have this important proposition which tells us that Laplacian matrix now is symmetric, non-degenerate, sorry, symmetric, degenerate, and semi-positive definite. In particular, we are interested to the fact that it has always a zirigam value with eigenvector, the O1 eigenvector. And I can already tell you here. And I can already tell you here that this eigenvector tells us something about consensus because we see that the span of this vector is actually the consensus space. So we can already think that consensus is given in this case also by the algebraic structure of the system. Indeed, if we make an assumption on the response functions, so we assume a homogeneous response. Response, so each node responds in the same way, then the consensus manifold is always a subset of the equilibria of the system. So we are sure that the consensus space exists as a set of equilibria for the unperturbed system. And now we are ready to prove the first proposition, which then we fix some response function, and then we look what's happening in the neighborhood of the consensus space. Then we have that the The system with positive weights is topologically equivalent with the system with all weights equal to one. So, with a simple graph structure, so we have just a graph structure without any set of weights. This is important because now, from now on, I will think about a system with all the weights one, so I can just use the unweighted structures to analyze my system. Structures to analyze my system because it's topologically equivalent. Okay, then we have the consensus space as a set of equilibria. What kind of other equilibria we can have? Well, let's consider a response function which is invariant under some group. For example, here we see a response function which is reflection invariant. Then we can construct a group that maps consensus. That maps consensus to other equilibrium. Since the consensus space is a linear space, the other spaces constructed by this group will be also linear. In fact, we can look at an example. Here we have a three-dimensional system, three-dimensional, so three-nodes network. Under this, we have this response function. One of these straight lines is the consensus space. The other straight line are obtained by the group constructed via the reflection symmetry of the response function. Symmetry of the response function. But we also notice another thing. There are also some circles of equilibria here. See, this is the critical manifold, basically. So these circles of equilibria are given by the particular kind of nonlinearity of the function. So in some sense, just to recap, I can say that the set of equilibria for these ALFs is given by the consensus space, which is given also by the algebraic structure. Then we have other linear sets which are given. Other linear sets which are given by symmetries, in particular, sets that are given by the specific nonlinearity of the response vectors. Now I said I consider an invariant response function, and we can think of that as a symmetry in some sense, because we are using some group to characterize it. But that's not the standard definition of symmetry in dynamical system. The standard one Dynamical system. The standard one is equivariant. So we have a group action, group representation that commutes with the vector field. This is called symmetry because if a system is equivariant under some group, then the group maps solutions to solutions. Well, there is a fundamental proposition in equivariant dynamical system theory, which is that the fixed point space of the group is a flow invariant set for the vector field. For the vector field. So, equivariance allows us to characterize not only equilibria, but in general, invariant spaces. Well, then, suppose that we have a complete graph, which is the kind of standard graph that I will use in this talk and this work. Then, which is a graph with all to all nodes. Then, a Kn absolute laplacian flow is symmetric, it's equivariant. Symmetric, it's equivariant under the symmetric group over n elements. The interesting thing is that what is the fixed point space of Sn is the consensus space. So the consensus space is characterized not only by algebraic structures, but also by the symmetry of the graph that we are considering. We can extend this idea to other graphs. In fact, if we have a group, a subgroup of, so a permutation A subgroup of so a permutation group, a subgroup of Sm such that it has at least an element, then consensus space is the fixed point space of the group. So we know that consensus is an invariant space for a class of groups of permutations. This will be useful later for other purposes. So I So, I started by writing the system as in equation six. But this, since we now saw that the set of equilibria are one-dimensional in general, we know that we have the perturbation in general are singular. But this then is a non-standard form for a singular perturbation, for a slow-fast system. So, it would be nice to have a standard form because we have a lot of results and also can give other information about the system. Also, we can give other information about the system information indeed. So, it turns out that we can do a coordinate transformation where we pick up a random one node that we would like and we change it by this transformation. And then we obtain the standard form, where we have now n minus 1 fast variables and one slow variable. The interesting thing is that this low variable, which is a constant of motion, Which is a constant of motion for the AMPER2 system is related to the arithmetic mean of the initial condition of the states. So, in some sense, we can think that basically the perturbation is lowering or horizing, so varying the concentration of the system. And for this reason, can make sense the analogy with the Fokker plan. So, the drift term now is kind of explicit. We have this low drift in the concentration, in some sense. Well, uh now the since the s the system in the non-standard form has some symmetries, those symmetries are as part of those symmetries are inherited by the standard form. And in particular, we can consider the layer problem, so epsilon equal to zero, and we have a fixed point space which reduces our equation just to a Reduce our equation just to one scalar equation. We can use this equation to characterize the stability of the consensus space. In particular, it turns out that the stability is just determined by the derivative of the response function. And we can split the consensus space in hyperbolic parts, which are stable or unstable, and in singular non-hyperbolic parts. Now we know that by Fenischel theorem, the hyperbolic part The hyperbolic part when hypertubed will be diffeomorphic to the unpertubed case, so in some sense I will not study the attracting and repelling sections, but I will focus my attention on the singular points on the consensus phase. So, by making some assumption on the perturbation now, we can like keep a Like, keep a two-dimensional invariant space for the system in the standard form. This allows us to reduce the system in a two-dimensional slow-fast system with one fast variables and one slow variable that, in some sense, characterize the system, it is characteristic for the system behavior. And I call this like the phase space where this system lives, the X-K plane. So now we can consider this two-dimensional system and apply some sort of standard techniques of slow-fast theory. In particular, the first thing that I do is to characterize this singular point as non-degenerate transcritical points. And if I look what are the conditions, it turns out that these three conditions are the ones that give non-degenerate transcritical points. And we see that are quite generic, these conditions. And we see that are quite generic, these conditions. In fact, if then we look just at the geometry of the critical manifold in the X-case plane, we can find the explicit local form of the intersection, which for n different from two are actually transcritical. So the singularities on the consensus space. So if we have singularities on the consensus space, in general, transcritical. They generate or not, it depends on. Or not, it depends on this condition value. For the first result, so the one by using standard techniques, I will use actually the non-degenerate transcriptical singularities. In fact, we can prove before this proposition. So, what I'm actually interested in, sorry, let me say that, is the canard solution because at this point Solution because at these singular points we can have so we can have different behaviors, but the one that separates these sort of genetic behaviors are these kind of solutions, which are the interesting one that we want to study. So if the perturbation is proportional to the all one vector, so we see that this vector comes back again, then the system admits a canard solution. Solution. So we see that this condition is geometrical in nature. We are not tuning parameters with other things. So this in some sense due to the fact that we have a network structure. So this property came down from the network. How to prove this proposition? Well, it is possible to prove it by using some result for transcritical singularities by using the blow-up. By using the blow-up. And here I show what is the sort of characteristic blow-up picture for the transcritical singularities on the consensus base. So we have the canard, and under the same condition, we also have the Fauxanard. So if we have this cascade of transcritical singularities between repelling, attracting, and so on, with the same condition, we can cross all of those along the consensus space. And this is a rapid. And this is a representative picture of one of the possible critical manifold in the XK plane, where blue is the consensus space and right we have other sets of equilibria. Well, yeah, in this case we saw how to prove canards by using blow up. And so we have this property, local property as a condition for canards. But actually we can prove the existence. But actually, we can prove the existence of canard just by using symmetry. In fact, let's assume to have a graph that has an automorphism group which has at least n elements. Then we pick up a perturbation which is equivariant under those groups. And then we consider a further condition is that on the fixed point space of the group the perturbation is never zero. Then the consensus space basically became the maximal canard. The maximal canard. And the proof is quite simple because, as we saw now, by the property of the group, we have the fixed point space is consensus space. Then we can now use the standard, the non-standard form, and we project it on the consensus space. And by the property assumed for the perturbation, this is never zero. And so this is a trajectory. So this is another way to prove the existence of a canard. And one interesting. Of a canard. And one interesting thing is that when you use symmetry, the non-standard form turns out to be more natural. While in the other case, the symmetries help, but still there is something hidden inside. So we saw two different approaches to canard. The blow-up, for example, is a standard technique in Zellofast theory. And what are the nice things is that it gives a detailed picture of what's happening at a transmission. Of what's happening at a transcritical point. This detailed picture, however, needs detailed assumptions. I need to assume the non-degenerative transcritical singularity and other assumptions that allow me to study in detail that singularities. In fact, the bluehappies are to extend to more complex singularities, higher dimensional systems, and so on. So in this case, we apply the standard method of Slovak theory to a network. Solofast theory to a network system. But what we have done in the other case is to the reversal. We used some technique of network system. In fact, this symmetry is a common technique for networks, dynamical networks. For example, this is a theme of design network formalism by Wulubiskin Stewart. And one nice thing of this technique is that we didn't need the tail assumption of the singularities, we just need assumptions. Singularities. We just need assumption on the group properties of the perturbation. However, we don't get a detailed picture of the phase portrait of what's going on. We know that there exists a Maximal Canara. That's it. So let me show some pictures, like to end up in some sense. So this is a sort of simulation that corroborates some of the result that I showed. So the Okay. So the colored line are some trajectory, generic trajectory of the system, sorry, trajectory of the system under some generic perturbation. So we have a loss of stability near a transcriptical point, then the consensus is reached again. When the black dot is actually the canard obtained via Canard obtain a proper perturbation, a critical perturbation. So then we saw there are the pictures here that are very similar to the one below, and this shows the topological equivalence, basically, because these ones are obtained with a weighted graph, positive weighted graph, this one is just for a simple graph. So we see that what we prove is actually also reproducible by Also recognucible by numerical simulations. Then finally, I want to show this is a more theoretical example in some sense. So let me pick up two response functions that now depends on a parameter. And the response functions that I choose are what usually are sort of the generated transcritical functions. And then I plot the I plot the critical manifold in the XK plane against lambda basically. So we see the phenomenon known as spontaneous symmetry breaking because the set of equilibria fixed by the group is the consensus, which is the orange plane. And when I rise lambda, when I bury lambda, I break the symmetry. This set is not fixed by the group. But one other interesting thing is that the other response function, which is also some sensible. The other response function, which is also in some sense transcritical, has a higher degeneracy, and this degeneracy is shown by another set of equilibria, which actually is given by the symmetry, because this Heiger degeneracy makes the function symmetric. And so this symmetry breaks the symmetry. Sorry for these words, but breaks the symmetry right from the start. So we see that in So we see that in some sense this kind of system, this network structure also shows the degeneracy via the critical manifold itself. So I conclude by saying that what we studied is this absolute Laplacian flow under some perturbation, characterizing the consensus dynamics and especially the canard solution. We use a lot of the symmetries to characterize singularities. Symmetries to characterize singularities and the behavior of the system. And also, we use the geometric properties to see that the symboltics are transcritical in general. So, what are the idea for the future is to, for example, extend this absolute la flash and flow to even more general kinds of systems and find potential applications. Then we can study other network systems, also using this immediate and geometrical problem. You're seeing these symmetry and geometrical properties, and I am thinking in particular to the Hamiltonian system, which encodes even further conserved quantities and properties that might allow us to find analytical results for such complex system. Finally, I would also like to mention it will be interesting to explore synchronization or consensus model in spaces that are not just Rn, so not Euclidean spaces, but for example only manifolds or just simple in the complex plane. Just simple in the complex plane. And that was everything want to say. And thanks for your attention. Thank you for an interesting talk. We have time for questions. So I think I missed something. So you have the system where the network is like everything is coupled to everything, and then your dynamics on it. And then your dynamics on it that you're perturbing is a perturbation of just the state, right? So you're still requiring the symmetry in the network that is quite restricted. If you want the canard, you require, I mean, if you want to prove the existence of a canard via symmetry, in some yes, you require the same symmetry of the network in the perturbation. In the other case, instead, the assumption is local. You just needed that at the point, the vector. The vector field is basically the perturbation is tangent to the all one vector. And so, this also is indeed a difference between the symmetry perspective, which gives this global assumption, I requiring a lot, sorry, a global assumption, instead the blow-up, which just requires me to know what's happening at the in that neighborhood of that point. Yes. Okay, so yeah, so the actual question would be if I break some or I just you know, like draw off an edge or something. You know, like drop an edge or something like that, would you still expect to see these canars? And what I'm getting from you is that the answer is perhaps. From symmetry, you can drop edges. So you drop edges, so the graph will have a different symmetry group, right? Yeah, I don't want to. I'm taking that. Yes, yes, but if you pick an edge, still the the graph will have some symmetry group in general. Maybe yeah, it always have a symmetry group. Maybe the trivial one, but Group, maybe the trivial one, but maybe suppose if you have a complete network and you take out all the nodes inside, you have a cyclic network, for example. I am thinking to this thing. So, in that case, you still have the thing because the fixed point space of the cyclic group is still consensus space. So, it depends which edges you take out in some sense. Then it can work or not from the sensory perspective, yeah. Do I understand it correctly that then Well I understand it correctly that then it's because of this requirement you have in the direction that you determine, uh this basically amounts to the requirement that the slow manifold is precisely the critical manifold, so the structure stays the same. Yes, yes, because the maximal canard, since this is the linear space, the maximal canard is exactly this l uh linear uh trajectory and so indeed yes. That's uh yeah, okay. And then um I also wanted to ask about uh in this I also wanted to ask about in this step where, so you made this transformation to standard form because then you had some additional books that you could use for classical theory, I guess. But can you say, probably said this and I missed it, but which results did you need from, so for which specific purpose did you transform to standard form? Well, to use the the result basically by Krupa and Smollian of uh the blow up and Of the blow-up near transcriptical. So, I wanted to use that result because there we have, we know basically the standard form, so I can compute the parameters, I can find the parameter that that gives, like the canard. So, in that case, I find the parameter lambda, the critical parameter, and it turns out that that critical parameter is given by the perturbation satisfying this rule of proportional to all one vector. Okay, it's mainly easy. So, description here, Yes, yes, I need it for yes. I missed this parameter. I didn't see the parameter breaks the canal. You didn't emphasize. Can you show it once again? Does it have a meaning or is it sort of like there must be some basically here? It's not a specific case, it's the general case. It's a general case. If you have a perturbation that is not proportional to this vector, basically the lambda parameter. So in the normal form for the transcription, we have this lambda. For lambda equal to 1, we have canards. Basically, if you set lambda equal to 1, you get this proportionality for the perturbation. It's not frozen. It's not a problem. Okay, it's fixed. So that's new. Okay, it's fixed. It's the same. Let's thank Carlto and Poster. Time for coffee and football. I just couldn't make it.
