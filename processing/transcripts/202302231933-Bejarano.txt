It might be more in progress than I thought. So go with me on that. It might rather be, I'm not sure. Uh and I don't trust myself to do a lot of math while grading way too many exams. Anyways, so I hope you aren't tired of hearing about degrees of non-minimality because we're going to talk about it again. So in a paper, James and Rahim defined this idea of degree of non-minimality. So if I have a state, so So, this is, I guess, working in super simple theory. So, if I have a stationary type of U rank 1, so non-algebraic and non-minimal, the degree of non-minimality is the least k for which basically we have a witness of non-minimality using k realizations, or I guess k plus 1 realizations of p. So, basically, we can find k plus 1 things such that one over the other k is. That one over the other k is a non-algebraic Fokin extension. So basically, we can have a witness that the U rank is at least 2. And we write that the degree of non-minimality is k. So this connects to a paper by again Rahiman, this time Annan, about this idea of having no proper vibrations. So let me first do the definition and then the theorem. So we say that a stationary time We say that a stationary type in a stable theory admits no proper vibrations. If, whenever you have a guide that is definable from the element and the parameters, but it's not algebraic from the parameters, then we have sort of an exchange. I think I was talking to someone the other day and we were talking about how this kind of looks like some kind of failure. So, not having proper vibrations is some kind of failure of exchange, although we have DCL and ACL. You know, we have DCL and ACL, so it's not quite that, but hinted towards it. So, one of the lemmas in Rahim and Jim's paper is that if you have a stationary type that has a proper vibration, then the degree of non-minimality is one. So, and furthermore, this is kind of the main result I want to talk about today: this dichotomy. Talk about today is this dichotomy about admitting no proper vibrations. So, suppose that I'm in a stable theory of finite U rank and I have a type P that admits no proper vibrations. Then I have some kind of dichotomy. So, either I am almost internal to a non-locally modular minimal type. So, again, U rank one, non-locally modular, or my realization here is internal gebraic over A with a final tuple. Over A with a final tuple of independent realizations. So, this sort of dichotomy that you get when you admit no proper vibrations. And then, just for posterity, I do want to finish up by mentioning again one of the big results in Jim's paper. Suppose I'm in a totally transcendental theory, such that every, oh god, this is the part where every time I read this, I need to go like, okay, what are the words again? Every non-modular minimal type is non-orthogonal to a minimal type over the empty set. I don't know if I have that right. Tim? Yeah. Okay. And Borvic kerneling holds, then the degree of non-minimality is bounded by the urine. And just to remind you, why do we care about this? Well, sometimes we want to know if certain sets or types are minimal, and this gives us a good way to know how far we have to go. Good way to know how far we have to go to check whether the type is minimal. So, if you know the U rank, then you know how far you have to, like, you have some bound on how far you want to go. So, if you've probably talked to me over the last few years, you know, I spent way too much time thinking about stable forking and simple theories. So, the obvious question, whenever you ask me something, is like, okay, it all works fine and good in stable theories. So, how broad? Theories, so how broken does it get when we go to simple theories? That's a sort of obvious question. What are sort of the main things that should break? The first thing is we lose stationary types, we lose. I guess I'll define internality in a bit, but we lose sort of a lot of the niceness in internality. We lose sort of a lot of the niceness in internality. However, if you look at the proof of this statement about having no proper vibrations, a lot of it is about internality and local modularity, a lot of statements that Frank has kind of brought to the simple world, not quite as nicely, but that still makes sense. So, my question was: okay, let's start by working over, trying to sort of generate. Trying to sort of generalize this fact to simple theories. There is a big sort of abyss in trying to get this Borovic-Cherling stuff and it's that if you look at him's paper, this relies a lot on binding groups. And well, simple theories, binding groups aren't nice in the sense that they just don't exist unless you count hyperdefinable polygroups or something like that as a suitable requirement. Like that, as a suitable replacement, which I don't. However, I do believe that in certain theories like ACFA, there is some work there, I think, by Zoe and Anand that, or Zori and Nuri, that, you know, do give some hope that at least in that case, these ideas could be transferred. And that's sort of the big going. Yeah. You just remind me what Margaret Jones says. Okay, let's see. Okay, let's see. If I remember, which I might not, and I might need Jim's help for this. Let's if I have so if I have a group action, so g acting on x call the rank of x. Yeah, it probably, okay, so let's say the rank of x, and I guess I'm going to say Morley rank for now, of x is. For now, of x is n, and I have some kind of group action of x that is generically, and I might mean the number here is n plus 2 or something? It's at most. Yeah. Generically at n plus 2. That is at the most n plus 2 transitive, generally transitive. Transitive, they're only transitive. Then just erase the that and the that. Then you're good. Keep the is. Then can go. Then you're done. Okay. I guess I was gonna say, I was starting to think about wait, I need a I was starting to think about wait, I need a large orbit. So, if you remember, this means that there is some orbit such that the rank of X to the N without that orbit is smaller than the rank of X. N plus 2. I wrote N plus 2. I don't know if you can see it. Yeah. But then you should put it in N plus 2. Yeah, but but then you should put it in all the answers. And I guess if you have equality, this is some kind of algebraic group. I want to say PGL and something, something. Something like that. I suppose you mean that the more you decrease the more in the real way. Okay. Okay. The j the ch I think the general case would follow from Okay, so I guess let me just quickly state sort of what's the general idea behind this this result here. Um so suppose we have my type Suppose we have my type P. So the main thing that I want to say is the U rank of P is finite. And so the way you start this proof is you say, okay, this is a well-known result, or I want to say false result, that P is non-orthogonal to a minimal type. And therefore, some C, and I guess, okay, I'll say this and then I'll define it. Some C that is definable over A and A, but not algebraic over A is internal to R, to this minimal type R. To this minimal type R. And then you break into cases, right? If R is not locally modular, hey, you're done, great, good times. The hard part happens if R is locally modular. And I'll talk about that in a second. So let me just define some of the words here. So in stable theories, we have In stable theories, we have stationary types, so that makes defining internality a little bit easier. In simple theories, well, that doesn't happen. Thank you, random graph. So, we're going to say that a family of possibly partial types is invariant if whenever you take an a a automorphism, you're still in the family. And internality, basically, the idea is. Basically, the idea is you're internal to the family if perhaps by adding some new parameters which are independent and getting some realizations on the family based on those independent parameters, then you are definable by that family. So the typical example is DCF0. If you have some kind of equation, the set of solutions is going to be internal. Be internal. And it's almost internal if we replace the definable closure by algebraic closure. And if you're in simple theories, okay, bounded closure. I don't know if I want to talk about... Okay, I do need to talk about foreignness in a pen. So these are kind of two very related notions by this lemma. So if you're not foreign, then something related to you is internal, but you're foreign. Is internal, but you're foreign if basically you know you're foreign to the family if whenever you know if my family is here, my tap is here, if whenever I take a non-forking extension and a perhaps forking extension, these two are independent from each other. So the non-forking extensions of my type are always, I have nothing. Are always have nothing to do with even the four kin extensions of the family. So there's this very strong difference between the two. And this actually gets us sort of the main tool that I've been trying to use to get this result to simple theories. And it's the idea of co-foreignness. And I'm probably gonna have to leave borrowing Charlie now and Channeling now and just use the sport again. Tom, how am I doing on time? Okay. So do you remember your category theory code just means flip the arrow? So you have the type here that is foreign to a family. I guess I want to start pulling my type Q. I guess I wanna start only my type Q so I don't have a funnily P and a type P. Right? Pipe. Sorry? Pi. Pi? Okay, sure. Because it could be partial. Well, for Fortnite, we always... Oh, did I use Pi? Well, such is life. So to say that Pi is co-foreign to P. Pi is co-foreign to p, we basically reverse the error. So this is foreignness, this is co-foreigness. And what do I mean by this? I mean that every type in the family is foreign to this type over here. You need to sort of work out what the family is, the family is of all extensions, and make sure that the sets align. But basically, the idea is this family wants nothing to do with this guy. Make whatever joke you want. Whatever joke you want. Has come for the jokes. He's the one that's doing the non-politically correct ones. So, anyways. We've left the answer. Anyways, returning to this. Anyways, I turned to this. It turns out... I haven't said anything, so your imaginations. Anyways, it turns out that this notion of co-forness gives rise to a nice notion of closure. So the closure, the p-closure, where p is a family of some set A, is the set of all types. Is the set of all type A over A where this guy is a countable hyperimaginary. If you don't know what that is, but you know what imaginaries are? They're like that, but hyper. That totally helps. Such that the type of A over A is coforent to B. And it turns out that this is a nice closure in the Closure in the in well, the specific closure, I guess. It's monotonic, it's identical. However, the big difference is that its size might be really big. But if you want to think about it some cells, if you take the p-closure of all types of A, then you're going to get just the good or bounded closure, or you know, if you eliminate hyperimaginaries. Then you get the outbreak culture. And so this is kind of the tool that I sort of wanted to use to think about the result on having no proper fibrillation. So if we return here and we're now in a super simple theory, let's say, okay, I thought I had gotten rid of. I thought I had gotten rid of this finite rank thing. Frank has pointed out that maybe I didn't. So stay tuned for whether or not that got deleted. So let's go back to this thing. We say P is non-orthogonal to a minimal type. That still works out fine in a simple theory. We still get this idea that, okay, if you're non-orthogonal, then you're clearly not foreign. Foreign is stronger. All your non-forking extensions are orthogonal. Non-forking extensions are orthogonal to all the 14 extensions of R, and you still get this definable type that is internal, and you still get the easy case. If the family is not locally modular, we did everything we wanted. If the family happens to be locally modular, the key or the thing we want to do is to sort of play with canonical bases and sort of show that the type of the canonical base. Of the canonical base of C over A over A, I believe. I need a minute to think about what I want to say here. Sorry? A typing function, Brian. Broadly, we need oversee. What do I mean? Oh, right. No, no, no, no, no. You're right. Oh right, no no never mind, you're right. I'm doing something, I'm getting ahead of myself. The idea is you look for you define E to be such that the U rank of C over A E is equal to the U rank of C over A minus one. And then you look at the rank or the U rank of E over A. Of your brain, and you want to show that basically. Oh no, I'm blanking. I'm not sure that this type is algebraic over, I don't know how much. I'm gonna, I don't know how much time I have. I have like eight minutes. So let me just kind of give an overview because I am a little bit blanking out. The idea is to show that through U-rank computations that this E and this C are intelligent. I think that's what. No. I'm getting a little bit. Okay, let me see if my poster says something. Sorry? The poster says the result. Sorry? The poster says the result isn't telling you. Yeah, it doesn't tell me what I was supposed to do. Okay, let me just say what the big important thing is, or the big important thing that I wanted to try to get. And it's this, that if you are in a locally modular family, then this locally modular family is actually one-based. In Frank's book, you actually get that the canonical base. Actually, get that the canonical base lives inside the p-closure, and I was trying to sort of get it down to the bounded closure. The key idea for that, I guess I'll put it here, is that if A is free over B from itself, then it is actually bounded. So that's kind of what you want to get. Frank's result gives you sort of one, gives you the idea that the canonical base lives inside these weirp peak closures. Lives inside this weird p-closure, and the remaining part is to show that the canonical base actually is orthogonal to this p-closure, which is where there might be a little bit of an issue, especially in infinite rank types. I think I have to go back when I'm not so overstressed and make sure, but that's kind of the idea. And you know, if we get this, then we're sort of starting to walk the process on. Process on simple theories. At the same time, I have sort of a couple of questions, I guess, given that there's a problem session coming forward. So here are some of mine. The first thing is, I guess number two is the one that's more interesting to me, I guess. These environment families of types give rise to these very nice closures. One of the reasons why these closures are nice is they all Why disclosures are nice if they also satisfy this property. If A is free from B over C, then A is free from the p-closure of B over the p-closure of C. So they kind of respect some amount of freedom. Not quite how the boundary closure does it, but something close. My question is: can you see? My question is: Can you sort of get some relation between these sort of nice closures and these invariant families from types, right? So, is there some kind of correspondence between them that you can get? Is there some idea of, you know, if you give me a closure, can you come up with a suitable family of types that sort of completes the picture? Is it stable case? Sorry? Is it drilling stable case? Not sure. I haven't thought about it too much. I haven't thought about it too much. What's your question? It's only stable case. Oh, sorry, do you mean this? This? This or my question? Your question also. Well, this is just true in simple theories. So yes, my question, I don't know. This one is one that's sort of very up in the era. I haven't really brought it down. And then, you know, looking towards general. You know, looking towards generalizing this whole idea of Borovic Churlin, you know, this is a sort of upshot that's very up in the air and I don't have any way of going, but like, you know, if you really want to extend these ideas, you need some kind of suitable notion of binding groups. I guess my test case here is ACVA. See how far you can get that working there, and more generally, what can you do? But this is sort of a very hard problem. This is sort of a very hard problem that doesn't seem to go much of anywhere. And the last one, just you know, an homage to my last two years of sadness inside stable forking. Okay, let's just say that you're internal to a locally modular family or begin trying to throw some amount of hypothesis. Can you get civil forking? We know that if the theory is one-based and eliminates hyperimaginaries, And eliminates hyperimaginaries. So, if basically this situation happens globally, then you have stable forking. If you just have it locally, okay, are you good still or does something break? I'm sort of in different places on this one, but they're mostly sort of scribbled notes that I kind of want to get somewhere. I don't know. I have three minutes left. Let's just claud it there. Thank you, everybody. Any more questions before we might not? It's not yes, Frank. I guess when you say generalizing borrowing trolling, you mean in finite rank? Or? Yeah, I think in that case, so you know. I think so, like. So, like, you know, I was a little bit more hopeful when I thought that here you didn't need the finite rank so much. Now that we're spoken and I really feel like I need the finite rank, I kind of want to say finite rank for now and not touch that. Yeah. So I think for now, you should add finite rank, P hat finite rank here for me to be okay with what I've written so far. All right, well uh let's uh thank you Jacob for great focus. I'll uh pause for a minute before we get everything ready and then we uh whiskey breaks. Anybody should do it two more times the egg? No! The poster self in the sun is only 30 minutes.
