Our talk is going to be by Melissa Zhang of the University of Georgia, and she'll tell us about, as you can read there, written out very nicely, the Upsilon-like invariants from Havana Vermilage. All right, thank you so much, Ben. Also, thanks to all the organizers. I'm very honored to be speaking among this set of speakers. So, thanks for having me. I also want to say that this being a speaker. Um, being a speaker on like the first day of a conference, I'm never really sure what the audience will be like, so I'm trying to take it what I think is the middle of the road, but definitely stop me if you have any questions. I'm not planning to go over time or anything like that. I think we all prefer that. And I'm not looking at the chat. So, you know, if you have a question, feel free to just stop me. Okay. So in a very different flavor. So, in a very different flavor from the previous talk, I work in low-dimensional topology. So, my goal for this talk is to give a survey of what I'm going to call Îµ-like invariants coming from covatohomology. And I'll tell you what upsilon is, but long story short, it's a one-parameter family of numerical invariants coming from a more geometric homology-type invariant from low-dimensional topology. And the goal is to look at the quantum. And the goal is to look at the quantum invariant side and see if we can come up with similar invariants that have like similar algebraic properties, but possibly different topological information. Okay, this is joint work with Lynn Trong, part of it, and then also very much related to work in progress with Ross Akbajet, which is not posted yet, but well, you'll see at the end. Okay. Yet. Okay. So let's start off with just what we'll focus on today. So I'm thinking about homology type invariance. And so I'm thinking about a knot inside S3. And I'll just stick with that for now. You could generalize this to think about knots inside three manifolds. But a good reason to use homology type invariants is because they come from TQFTs. And so you want to think about not So, you want to think about knots not just by themselves, but also as boundaries of combordisms. So, typically, what I would normally want to think about is not just like a knot embedded in three space, but the information that it might have if you think about it as the boundary of something inside B4. Okay, but there's also another side. There's also information that you can glean from these homology type invariants purely from Type invariance purely from the three-dimensional point of view. So, whereas this is sort of four-dimensional, we can think also about contact geometry or contact topology. So, in this talk again, we're talking about S3 with the standard contact structure. And instead of having just a knot inside S3, you might have a Legendre knot. So the knot is tangent to your contact planes. And if you want to extend this to the, you know, what information can the TQFT tell you? know what information can the tqft tell you maybe you'd want to think about lagrangians inside a symplectic formal or you can think about the knot piercing the contact planes and you can think about transverse knots possibly bounding symplectic manifolds so um okay i'll talk about this later but basically i'm not going to really look at this because if i'm looking at homonophomology i haven't really figured out I haven't really figured out a way to really say much about Legendre and links, but transverse ones are very much related to braids. So this is going to be more relevant today. So let's start off with a general idea of what we're going to do with the homology type invariants. So as you all know, you can come up with these homology type invariants, but they're very big objects, right? Complexes are Are very useful and you can build them to make really nice invariants. But if you want to compare with a topological quantity or maybe a certain property, maybe like a yes-no property, it's often useful to try to distill a numerical invariant from there. I don't know. I don't think I wrote this down, but you can imagine, like, on one hand, I can say I want to know bounds on the four-ball genus of the knot. So what is the smallest genus? So what is the smallest genus surface inside the four ball that has a boundary that is R0 in the boundary of the four ball? But you could also have questions like, does a not have a certain property? And perhaps a numerical invariant would be like, if this number is equal to two, then something is true. If it's not, then something's not true. So for today, I'm going to start with a pattern. And I think one of the ways that helps me understand talk. Of the ways that helps me understand talks is to almost make it look like a children's book, right? So, you like build up a pattern and then you repeat on that pattern, and it gets a little bit more complicated each time. So, here's the pattern that I'm looking at today. We're going to look at a complex, which consists of the underlying vector field, or sorry, vector space, graded vector space, and then a differential. And since I'm going to be talking about filtered complexes, we'll say that there's Filtered complexes, we'll say that there's a filtration grading called GR. And since there's a filtration grading, this is going to be the total differential. Because in the background, you can think about there being a spectral sequence. So this is like the total differential there. As an example, we can think of the most basic Kavanaugh homology as your chains, your underlying vectors space. Underlying vectors space is going to be generated by complete resolutions labeled with one of two things. So this is going to be what I'm calling Kc. These are the Kavanaugh chains. This is not to be confused with Kg, which is the Kavanaugh generators, which are very important to this construction that we're doing. Okay, so let's just go here for a second. There is a Here for a second, there is a distinguished basis that is GR homogeneous, and this is important in the numerical invariance we're going to make. In our case, the filtration grading is probably simplest. One is quantum grading. So, for example, if you look at the Khobanov-Lee complex, what you have is the Khobanov differential plus an extra bit. Plus, an extra bit called Lee's perturbation, and the total differential is not quantum graded anymore because this doesn't preserve the quantum grading, but this is quantum filtered, and that's how you get Resmundson's S-invariant. Okay. There are kind of three points of view that I know about for extracting numerical invariants, and they're all capturing somehow the same. And they're all capturing somehow the same information. And if you look at a certain example, you could perhaps try to reconstruct it to follow any of these three points of view. So it's really the same construction set in three different ways. So depending on what you prefer to work with, you can choose any of these. For example, just thinking about the S invariant, I can think about it as I have some distinguished homology class that I can just put my finger on. Class that I can just put my finger on, and I know it's going to survive to homology, then the filtration grading of the homology class can give me a numerical grading. Alternatively, you could also say, I don't want to work with a filtered theory, I want to work with a graded theory. So then you can say, okay, let's just add a second, let's add another variable, and then let powers of that keep track of the part that's not. Keep track of the part that's not graded. And so you end up with a tower of things with some of your differentials going sort of in a second, another dimension. And now you have a graded theory and you have some tower. So there is a tower of things and their T powers. And then you just say, well, if I have, like up here, something that survives the homology, then I know there's going to be. Then I know there's going to be all the T copies of it as well. So I can take the grading of the bottom or the top of the tower, depending on your perspective, if your head is upside down or right side up. So you're just looking at a generator. Another way to think about this is you can, instead of thinking about existing homology classes or towers of homology classes, you can think of the filtrations levels. The filtrations levels, having, for instance, like inclusion maps or something like that, right? So, some sort of map that comes with your complex and all of the filtration levels of it. And you just take some extremal level where the induced map is not like continues to be non-zero. So, there's a there's like a threshold behavior there. Okay, so this is just to keep in mind if you're thinking about construction. If you're thinking about constructing such a thing, okay, so the title of this talk was Upsilon-Lichinvariants. So I want to start off with, I guess, Hagar fluorhomology is the motivation for the questions that I'm going to ask. So Oshwad and Sabo developed this package of invariants called Hagard fluorhomology, which a ton of people have worked on since. And notably, there is something And notably, there is something similar to S called tau. This is from not floor homology. So, if we want to follow the pattern, there's a complex, there's a differential, and this is sort of more geometric than Havano homology. And there's a special grading that the not tells you for the complex. It's called the Alexander grading. And then you do something similar to the definition of the S invariant to get tau. Of the S invariant to get tau, which is a number that is a not concordance invariant. Now they have a generalization of tau called epsilon. So if you have a not k and then you let t be a number between zero and two, then you can it spits out a number. So that means it's a one parameter family of numerical invariants. Numerical invariance. And the way that you get this one parameter family is that you look at the same complex, but now for each t, you're going to change your gr to something that depends on t. So this complex has a Maslov grading and an Alexander filtration grading. And what they do is they just mix the Maslov grading and the Alexander grading. So really what I should write here is GR sub T. Okay. And if you are interested in this, right, these are homomorphisms from the not concordance group, which is very interesting. So why do I say that this is a generalization of tau while the slope from the right at time zero is actually negative tau? So when I say that an invariant is epsilon-like, what I mean is that it's a one-parameter family of invariants, which you get by Which you get by varying GR according to a linear combination of other more inherited ratings. Okay, so sorry. Go ahead. Did you tell us how to define this invariant? I did not. I'm happy to do a small example if that helps. A small example, if that helps, okay. Yeah, so um, I'm not going to get the actual numbers right, but roughly speaking, let's try to see what tau looks like and what Upsalam looks like. So, on the right here, oops, so in not floor homology, you might have a complex that looks like the following. So, you have a bunch looks like the following. So you have a bunch of generators and okay, so I said that these are Maslov and Alexander, but I'm actually going to use a different linear combination of them to draw my picture because that's what it looks like in my head. But this will give you the rough algebraic picture. So you can imagine there's like there's a variable u and a variable There's a variable u and a variable v. And this kind of comes from like when you're doing Lagrangian, well, when you're doing this sort of like intersection homology, you're taking two Lagrangians and looking at their intersections. The differentials are going to be from counting holomorphic disks. And what you get from knot fluoro homology is on a surface, the knot is going to sort of thread. The knot is going to sort of thread through your surface, and the points where the knot passes through the surface are called a base point. There are obviously other curves on here that I haven't drawn. But the point is that the differential counts how many times you go over these base points. And these variables are sort of keeping track of how many times you go over that base point on a differential disk. Okay, so that means that differentials are. Okay, so that means that differentials are going to have some power of u and v in it, maybe zero, but probably like possibly positive. And then the typical picture of the knot floor complex of a torus knot might look something like this. Okay. So if you see something like this, first of all, Like this, first of all, um, it's a property that this is going to be symmetric with respect to flipping u and v, and then tau would just say, okay, let's just, since it's symmetric, let's just look at one of them. I can ignore the arrows that go, let's say, vertically. And that means that everything is going to cancel out. So, like this is an acyclic complex, this is an acyclic complex, leaving me with just this. Leaving me with just this guy. And then I take the grading. G-R-U is, well, you know, you take the grading. So like the of this element, and then that will give you a single number, which is tau. But what oopsilon does is it says, well, you have all this information. Why are you only looking at it from a rectilinear point of view? So by a So, by a reformulation by Chuck Livingston, instead of saying sort of my like the boundaries of my filtration levels are looking like this, I can tilt them at some angle. So if I tilt them at an angle that depends on T, you might have something like this. And I drew it sort of funny, but suppose this point were actually way like sticking out more, and these. More and these horizontal arrows and vertical arrows were shorter, then somehow the filtration level is going to be hitting like this element first. And sort of from this tilting, you get another numerical invariant. And based on like the concavity of this staircase, you can get something non-trivial. So that is roughly. Is roughly what it's like to define Upsilon as opposed to just how. Okay, great. Yeah, sorry, I'm not going into very much detail for this talk because I don't know. I feel like the experts who know this problem might already know all these things and then those who don't like won't really get anything from it. So it's really going to be a high level overview. But feel free to ask these questions because I can give these short descriptions of like roughly what. Short descriptions of like roughly what the difference is. Okay. Here are some notable properties. So when we're looking for an invariant like epsilon, we might want to look for something like this. And this is purely because like you can look at the original paper by Oshvat Sipsavo and think about, well, how do they prove this thing? These will immediately translate to my new invariant. So these are just things that you should be looking for. First of all, just by construction, First of all, just by construction, it's pretty clear that these are going to be piecewise linear. So, the information that you can glean from a piecewise linear function are probably where does it change its slope? So what are the sets of points where they change? And also, what are those slopes? In addition to like the value of the function, of course. Another thing is that if you think about instead of Is that if you think about, instead of thinking about this as a function of t, think about it instead as a function of the not k. So then you can get a homomorphism from the not concordance group to PL functions. So all that's really saying is that we have a really nice connected sum formula. So the group operation here is connected sum. Here it's addition. Addition. Another thing is that, again, we're talking about this TQFT, so it's going to give us four-ball genus bounds. And this is my notation, G4. So this is interesting because if, let's say, tau, we know, gives you a forward-balled genus bound, if epsilon actually has like a change in slope, or it's like something that doesn't immediately depend on tau, well, that gives you potentially more information. Well, that gives you potentially more information about what the four-ball genus of your knot is going to be. And then, furthermore, at time t equals one, there's actually a non-orientable four-ball genus found, which is given by this formula. And my notation for that is little gamma to match the literature. Okay, so here's the big question for the day. We know that We know that tau is very much related to S. They're defined similarly. They both give formal genus bounds. But of course, tau is coming from the geometric side, so counting holomorphic disk. Here we're doing Havana homology. Tau has this Upsilon, and the big question is, can we find something analogous to Upsilon on the Havanov side? One big motivation for this, which I think Motivation for this, which I think is related to Chifrian's talk coming up next, is that there is this big idea that geometric invariants are very powerful and they tell us a lot of information, but they also have a lot of structure sometimes. Like I can give you maybe like a crossing change formula or something. If I give you that structure, that's great because now you can compute it for a lot of other things. But that also But that also means that I have less information coming from things that are related by crossing change. So the quantum side is perhaps harder to compute sometimes because there are fewer of these structured tools, but it could give us extra information. So potentially, since these are fairly combinatorial, you can compute them with a powerful enough computer. So there's a trade-off there. So I want you to recall. So I want you to recall 20 minutes ago you saw this slide. I'm going to now replace the GR with GRT because I'm talking about epsilon-like invariance. Okay, before I go on to the survey portion, I want to stop and see if there are any questions. Okay. So the first one I'm going to mention is sort of related to the floor side. This is Stockard Steed Sabo's SU. I realize that this is more general, which is why the U is here, but below here is like the portion of it that follows our pattern. So what they do is they look at the Khaman of Is they look at the Kavanaugh chains, and then they're looking at a differential that has a lot of extra perturbations. So you might know that in addition to Khavan of Lee homology, there's also Khavan of Barnett homology. The difference being like one main difference is that you can do Barnetton homology over F2 and you can't really do Lee homology over F2 and get your Over F2 and get your you have to like divide by two and Reid-Meister two or something. So you need two to be invertible in order for Reidemeister invariance to work out there. So here, I'm sorry, there's a lot of things on the page, so don't look at the figures yet. Here we're going to have two big portions of our differential. This is from Savo's geometric spectral sequence. Geometric spectral sequence. And this is what these pictures represent. So, Sabo's geometric spectral sequence says that in addition to Chvanov differentials, you can add longer differentials, longer in the homological degree. So for each homological degree, you're going to have a di, and then that is also going to have some quantum degree depending on I. So these di's have this bi degree, which means that the complex is now Which means that the complex is now homologically and quantumly filtered. Yeah. But in addition to that, we're going to add a generalization of Barnetton's perturbation, which is like Lie perturbation. And similarly, there's just going to be longer differentials, longer in the homological direction as well. And these have this bi degree. So for me, H is homological, Q is quantum. H is homological, Q is quantum, in case you see that again. This gives you a spectral sequence that goes from Havana homology to something. And that something is known to be two to the number of link components dimensional. So, you know, you think it's Rhinoton homology. This is coming from, this is based on Sabo's geometric spectral sequence, which is just these differentials. Is just these differentials. This is sort of cheating in that it's not entirely quantum because this spectral sequence, even though it's very combinatorial and looks a lot like Havana homology, it's conjectured to be isomorphic to the spectral sequence from Havana homology, probably you want to write reduced and like the mirror of the knot, to Hagar-Fleur homology. Hagard floor homology of double branch cover of the knot. So the fact that this is a floor homology should kind of show you that these are based on what you would get from thinking about floor differentials. So like holomorphic triangles and stuff or polygons. Okay, but aside from that, you still get a nice complex. So you can do the same kind of thing. So, you can do the same kind of thing. You have a homological and quantum filtration degree. So, you can mix them and you can get some invariant. What they do is they actually look at upright sets. So instead of like filtration levels that have boundaries that are diagonal lines, they look at like rectilinear boundaries. But you can effectively just think of it as a one-dimensional, one-parameter family in the limited case. Now, there's another point of view that you can take, and that's taking the annular refinements, in particular because quantum invariants are very well suited for annular things, right? So many constructions come from starting with a braid and then doing a closure. On this slide, I also wanted to just give you a motivation, perhaps from a different point of view, why you would want to study annular refinements from a low-dimensional topology. Refinements from a low-dimensional topology point of view. So, I should say first that the reason why I'm mentioning this is because, well, if you can't get a second homology, a second filtration grading to mix with your quantum grading, one way to think about computing, to construct an Euphalum-like invariant is to add a bit of structure so that you can get another grading. So, we're going to go towards a quantum. Quantum mixed with annular rating. Okay, but first, let's say we're thinking about a knot inside an annulus cross I, so the solid torus, or just, you know, R2 with a point removed. There are three big reasons why I would think of you should study annular refinements. First one, let's just say that you have Let's just say that you have a braid and you just close it up. If you think about it, this is braid conjugacy classes because the top and bottom can just, you know, you move it to the other side, do some radomeister twos, and they go away. So it turns out that if you do braid closure and think about annular isotopy, you can study braid conjugacy classes. And this has some applications in 3D contact topology, effectively because you can think of Um, you can think about a braid as an element of the mapping class group of a disk with a bunch of points, right? So, D2, and then a whole bunch of points. And then in contact topology, in 3D contact topology, there's a theorem by Giroux, which is that you can describe all of these contact manifolds by taking just a surface and then doing some sort of automorphism to it. So here we basically see the properties of the bridge conjugacy class actually tell you stuff about the contact 3 map. You stuff about the contact three manifold. Now, let's say that you want to look at a little bit less restrictive, right? You don't want to be strictly annular. Let's look at transverse knots then. So recall that if you have a break closure and then you mod out not only by annular isotopy, but also by the positive Markov 2 or positive stabilization. This is just transverse knots. This is just transverse knots in the rotationally symmetric contact structure. So, this is the same as a standard one. And obviously, a lot of people are like who study transverse knots are interested in this. The third thing is that if you think about the knot concordance group a lot, there's this operation that you can do, which is to say, take some knot that lives within the solid torus and then tie that torus. And then tie that torus into another knot. So the thing that's living inside the torus is called a pattern. And sort of this nested version, like cabling, basically, is going to be a different knot. And this is going to put you into a different, possibly different equivalence class in the knot concordance group. So one way to study the knot concordance group is to look at Concordance group is to look at satellite operations. And there's sort of a relationship between if you have an annular concordance between two patterns, it turns out like the pattern applied to their operators are going to be the same. But we don't know if you have two operators that are, if they're both. If they're both like P1 and P2 are giving you the same operator on the smooth concordance group, if they're actually going to be annularly concordant, that might not make sense to those who haven't thought about it, but the point is that there's this operation and there's a very inherent sort of annular knot present there. Okay, so this brings me to some parallel work that my advisor. That my advisor Ellie, who I think I saw here, did. I sat in her class when she told us about this, which led me and my collaborator Lynn to write this other paper. So on the left here, Grigsby-Lakata-Verily defined an invariant called DT, which they call the annular Rasmussen invariance. And the idea here is that you take the Kabanov Lie complex and you think about the fact that And you think about the fact that the knot is inside the annulus. This gives you a second grading, or a third grading, if you think about it, a second filtration grading almost. That's called the winding number grading. It's just basically how many times are you wrapping around the grade axis with sign. It turns out that this complex is filtered not quite by GRA, but by any of these. A, but by any of these. So, if you put in enough copies of the quantum grading, it does become a filtration. So, this gives you a one-parameter family of annular invariance. Yeah. Okay, so I'll talk about the properties on the next slide. So, the point here is that this is coming from the Kavanaugh-Lee complex, which From the Kavanaugh Lee complex, which perhaps a lot of you are comfortable with. On the right side, so Lynn and I looked at Sharkard Seed Sabos complex, which is the one with all of those differentials, the very big pictures. The interesting thing is that those are also annularly filtered if you do a little bit of like adding the correct amount of quantum grading. So very similar expressions here. But remember that you also have this homological filtration. Also, we have this homological filtration. So, we figured we should lump that in as well because this was already Upsilon-like. So, basically, you can do the same construction, but now you have like a one simplex worth of invariants, and they're all annular concordance invariants. So, this is they're like very similar in construction, which is why you get very similar properties. Okay, so just in case you wanted to look at this, here are some of the properties of these invariants. As I said, they're annular concordance invariants. Also, because of the idea that you can look at like what happens to Plomenevska as invariant inside these complexes, you can get S.Bennek inequalities. So I didn't quite mention it, but this is over C and this is over F2. is over c and this is over f2 so you can get s bennican inequalities for s over c and s over f2 which are actually different okay there's also information that you can get from these about braid quasi positivity and about right bearingness for braid if you think of it as a mapping class group element and these are of interest to contact topologists because again you could think about it as um this like automorphism Automorphism of a surface. I also want to point out that my academic sibling, Gage Martin, uses these dt invariants and then thinks about what are the restrictions on the shape of the function, the PL function. And she's able to compute the S invariant for any three-braid closure, which is very interesting because that's a lot of braids, but just this is just. But just this is just because of thinking about DT. Before I go on, are there any questions about these annular refinements? Maybe this is a very simple question. Can you give us an example of SR, T or what's the simplest not for which it's not a constant function? Yeah, that's a good question. So S R. That's a good question. So, SRT, I actually don't know of any, which is, it's very, it's very big, right? The, the, even for Chakradzit Sabo's original, like without the annular part, it's very hard to compute. And I don't think they had any examples where it's like non-trivial. I think in the paper, there's like a toy model. With some computer computation, Ellie and her collaborators were able to find a non-trivial example for DT. I think it looks something like this many slope changes or something like that. So that's as far as I know. Okay, are there any other questions? Questions Okay, so I'm going to continue on with the survey. Let's look in a different direction. So, so far I've been talking about SL2 homology, but what about SLN homology? Well, Leibrack and Lobb a couple years back defined A couple years back to find another Upsalon-like invariant called gimbal. So, this is not a lambda, this is the symbol on the dreidel that gives you more chocolate, which should make you happy. For any n, like in n as in SLN, you're going to specifically look at this algebra. So the point here is that there's a copy of s minus one, and then there's a whole bunch of x's left. And then there's a whole bunch of x's left. Maybe I'll put that in here. Maybe factoring on the spot was not a good idea, but we'll do it anyways. Okay, again, you're going to need two gradings at least to come up with a range of values. So there's always going to be quantum grading. But then where does this other grading come from? Well, you're going to look at this, right? There's going to be Look at this, right? There's going to be an X action, and the higher you end, the more you can go. But there's an X filtration, which I think of as the X power filtration. And if I call this GRX, then GRT, this is not the way that they wrote it down, but this should be the equivalent way of thinking about this, is T times the quantum grading plus X grading, and then subtracting that. You can multiply that out. Subtracting that. You can multiply that out and realize that it's very similar to the previous mixing formulas. They actually use a non-vanishing condition for an inclusion map. Okay, but this gimbal has a very interesting, they've done computations and they have found examples where gimbal is actually interesting for quasi-alternating knots. So quasi-alternating is basically this like recursive is basically this like recursive definition of a family of knots where like if you can get from like two quasi alternating if you can get from a quasi alternating knot to your knot then it's also quasi alternating and because of this recursive relation and the structure that you have on knot fluoro homology it turns out that epsilon can't be interesting for quasi-alternating knots so somehow the idea here is that knot fluoro homology Knot fluoro homology should be simple, not in any technical sense there, just should be like not too complicated for quasi-alternating knots. But gimbal, on the other hand, does have an like there are interesting gimbals for quasi-alternating knots. So this kind of supports the idea that quantum invariance might contain different information just because it has less of that structure that we've been used to looking at. Okay. Okay. All right. So this brings us to 2020. Ballinger, who I haven't met yet, but I think he's a grad student at Princeton, I think answered my question. So I'm going to put the question mark has gone to a check mark here. So here's Ballinger's construction. You take the Kavanov Lie complex and also the E minus one differential, which I'll call D minus one. Which I'll call D minus one. And the idea here is that this is quantum filtered, but homologically graded, right? You just go up in homological degree for the complex. But here you add a different differential that actually has negative one homological degree. So the effect of this is that you have quantum filtration coming from here, and then also homological filtration not grading. Grading. So GRT effectively is going to mix H and Q. And I think the way that he constructs it, it might come from like matrix factorizations. He would be more of an expert on this, of course. So there are probably going to be analogs for SLN homology. So this is very cool. It can be possibly extended. And if we look at its properties, it gives lower bounds on G4. It gives lower bounds on G4, which is good. It's kind of what we expect from an invariant that comes from, you know, like you have bounds on cohortism maps. It also gives a non-orientable bound at time equals one. He uses alpha for t. But the interesting thing is epsilon has this symmetry between t and two minus t. And that sort of came from like when I was doing that example earlier. Example earlier. Previously, I had something like u and v here. It comes from the fact that when you encode a knot on your Hagar diagram, it's okay to switch the names of those two base points. But from here, we don't have a symmetry, which is very interesting. So he conjectures that, well, he says, I'm not going to put words in his mouth, that there might be more information, right? Because if you don't have symmetry, then what's going on? Because if you don't have symmetry, then what's going on from like time one to two? We don't know. I think it's very interesting because we still have this non-orientable bound. So where's the asymmetry coming from? I don't know. Okay, so this brings us to the last thing I wanted to talk about, which is work in progress with Ross Akhmachit. We were looking at an alternate approach to this question. So let's stay in the context of Let's just look at SL2 homology, right? But Kovanov and Robert had been studying this alpha version of Kovanov homology. And what I mean by that is they're looking at this Frobenius system. So the only difference here with this and the usual With this and the usual Kavanaugh homology, which would look like, well, in the most general case, you might look at something like this. You have indeterminates h and t, and maybe you mod out by this quadratic or something. It's that we have zero divisors. Zero divisors. So this is only a moderate change from this system. But what this allows us to do is basically create something that looks a lot like the U and V complex that comes from not floor homology. I should say that as a caveat, it doesn't look that much like it because a knot floor complex is probably much smaller, say for like the trefoil or something, but the point is that. Or something. But the point is that we have this, we have a way to come up with two different gradings. And the gratings are the U power grading and the V power grading. And if you draw the U and V in a two-dimensional plane and you tilt the border of your filtration gratings, you can sort of weight them differently. So we're basically saying you have two roots of this polynomial and we'll give them different quantum gradings. Different quantum gradings, which is different from like the graded version of this. Okay, so the interesting things that I can say about this confidently before posting this is that there seems to be multiple ways of looking at this complex, and there's a lot of algebraic things that one could do. If you look at it from the same sort of definition as for the original epsilon invariant, you will get You will get a smooth invariant with a lot of the same properties. But there's also this sense that without even looking at like this somehow detects framing, kind of surprisingly, like if you look at the maps for the like for the Frobenius system, you kind of get a sense that there's this asymmetry somewhere. A sense that there's this asymmetry somewhere. So, my guess is that there's going to be applications to transverse knots if you look at this from a different point of view. So, if you look at a distinguished homology class, you'll probably end up with more geometric information in the sense that you're going to get some transverse knot invariant rather than a smooth knot invariant. So, that's what we're working on right now. Okay, and that concludes my big. Okay, and that concludes my big overview. I'm happy to answer any questions. I know that I probably started this talk at some level of understanding of Kibanophthomology, but I wasn't sure if any students are out there and want to ask me any questions in the gathering tone later. I'm happy to answer them. But yeah, thanks for your time. All right, great. So, anybody have any more questions? Jake, yeah, go ahead. So, I guess should there be an analog of Grigsby Licata-Wharley's construction for some sort of annular not-floor homology? Yeah, actually, I think Mike Wong and I were talking about that at Park City one time. I think what we had mentioned about that, it's probably like you have to think about adding the braid axis as another not a link component and then take the Alexander filtration coming from that. That's as much as I thought about it in the last couple of years, but you can probably ask him if he's thought about it more. I actually think I may be misremembering, but I actually think a student of Olga Klomenovskaya and I'm forgetting his name at the moment. I feel bad, but I think he has some results along those lines. I'll try to remember his name and send it to you, Jake. Okay. Operative, I think, is his name. I just remember it. Yeah. Maybe type that? Did you say operative? I'm afraid to type people's names in case I get it wrong, but I could look it up. Oh, okay. Okay, there we go. Yeah, I'll put in Chakra 40. And what's the sort of boring condition for what happens for your invariant with Lin? I mean, there must be some class of annular knots that it's easy to compute and boring on, but I don't know what that class is and what the. Is and what the invariant on the square looks like. I think it's the same as ZT. Like quasi-positive means that you just have one slope. So it's, I guess you only get, you know, that one slope of information. And then just from maybe the ride or something, something computable, you get like how high up that one mountain peak is. I don't know if the Know if the boring class is bigger than that. Nina? Yeah, so just a comment. So on Wednesday, I'll describe a new formulation of covenant homology, which is done very much parallel to not floor homology. So I think it should help you out a lot because there's two. Because the two theories are now formulated just essentially entirely analogous with each other. Oh, that would be awesome because another thing I'm interested in is I didn't mention it in the talk, but Dai, Hong, Staffregan, and Lynn Trong have this. Trung have this set like natural numbers set of invariants phi j, which is another generalization of tau, but sort of looks at the complex from a different point of view. So it's related to tau, like where you, if you add up j times phi j, you actually get tau, which is crazy. And one of my goals for doing this project with Ross is to see. This project with Ross is to see: like, can we get an algebraic object where we can actually get invariants like this? So, it would be really cool to see your work and see if this is compatible. I should say also, the theory actually gives the invariance of nothing in R2 times S1. So, it actually gives annular extension to covenant homology for free. Oh, that's awesome. Cool. Cool. I look forward to the talk. Ellie? So you mentioned this in passing, Melissa, but I wanted to see if you could say anything more about this, about concordance and patterns, satellite patterns. Are there any explicit, can you see? Can you say anything more explicit about what you had in mind there in terms of using these annular refinements of, for example, the S invariant or what you're doing with Lin. I can probably write down what I was trying to say out loud, but that's as explicit as I can go. Would that help? Help? Yeah, definitely. Any collaboration would be cool. Just to make it concrete, like if you have, let's say, pattern one and pattern two, and they both live in the annulus. So it's known, if you just think about it really hard topologically, that if P1 is annularly concordant to P2, Concordant to P2, then the operators P1 and P2 are the same. But the opposite is unknown. So it's open whether, like, if P1 and P2 as operators are the same, is P1 annularly concorded to P2? So, like, So, like, how much does annular concordance control operators? And this is difficult because this is so big, right? You can have so many operators, but it would be really interesting because if we had this, then somehow operators are much easier to understand. They're just annular concordance group or annular concordance classes. Oh, yeah. So, in terms of using invariance, right, I guess it depends on what you believe is true, whether you think this is true or not. So, in one direction, you could probably try to use the invariant to say, okay, if these two operators are the same somehow, could they possibly have different annular invariants? Which would mean that they're not concordant and OT concordant. Yeah, I was going to ask. OT Concordant. Yeah, I was going to ask if you had any candidates in mind. I don't know. Just because I don't think about the concordance group that much, like, yeah, this is more of a problem sort of posed for people who study the concordance group because like you have to first start off with two different patterns, right, that give the same operator, which I'm not sure how to get my hands on. I think it's an interesting question. Yeah, I should say that I think Matt had asked us this. Are not so hard to, yeah. I mean, the annular invariants are fairly straightforward to calculate. All right. So if that wraps up our question period, we can thank Melissa again. Thank Melissa again. Thank you so much. And people can retire to Gather Town or go get a snack or whatever people want. And our next talk will be at 1 p.m. Banff time. This is confusing because, of course, I look at my clock and that's 3 p.m. Eastern time with Chipri and Manalescu. So I hope to see you all there.
