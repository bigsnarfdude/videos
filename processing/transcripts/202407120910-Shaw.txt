We'll disappear into the summer, but we will continue as a community working on networks and loops in our international web seminar, which happened very early in the morning for me in Arkansas, but my seminar in the afternoon for everybody in Europe. Okay, so we're going to talk about experiments, some very new experiments that test a loop stability and closure. On loop stability and coastage channel networks. So, the agenda: I'm going to talk to you a little bit about how river deltas work or how we think they work. Then, just because it's been so inspirational this week, we're going to talk about different physical loop models. There's one that I'm pretty sure applies here, but it's not the only one, as we've all learned. And then we're going to test the fluctuation-based model of loop stability. Of loop stability that Mashek presented to us on Tuesday with Experiments and then FAFO. Raise your hand if you know what that means. Fuck around and find out. This is what happens when you run experiments. Okay, so what is a loop? Okay, so what is a loop in our context? A loop is an island surrounded by alluvial channels. Alluvial is this word which means self-formed by the movement of water and sediment. These natural islands flood regularly with tides, so not only is water flowing around them, but water is flowing onto them and off of them, especially in rainforest areas like here in Bangladesh. It's about 20 kilometers. Bangladesh. It's about 20 kilometers per scale. Well, you can also make the stipulation that these loops are much larger than a channel width because all sorts of instabilities form within channels, and that's not what we're talking about. We're not talking about little things like this. We're talking about large loops like this one or this one. One thing that's particular for deltaic loops is we have. Loops is we have a wide range in scales of channel widths and also a wide range in scale of loop sizes that appear to be scale-free in this system. A large range of scales. The surrounding channels are relatively stable. With some exceptions I'm going to tell you about, these channels are basically where they were when they were mapped in the 1700s. So we've all seen images of rivers. We've all seen images of rivers that move really rapidly. This is not the case. These networks are kind of locked in place. And river deltas vary from very dendritic to very loopy. So here's a loopy system. Here is a non-loopy system. I found one loop in the Mississippi Delta here. This is about 20 kilometers for scale. You can see it right here. But other than that, you can skeleton. You can skeletonize this image and put it next to a, I believe, a neuron, and can't really tell which one's which. We actually modeled the growth of this type of system as a modified type of Laplacian growth, Halley Shaw viscous fingering. So, but that's not what we're going to talk about today. So, the stabilization of these. The stabilization of these loops. The conceptual model we're going after here I read in a paper by Elaine, and it just was the biggest Eureka moment in my career so far, and I've contacted her and we have to work on this. But the idea is that you have an adaptive channel network where channels are adapting to very slowly to the flows through them. Very slowly to the flows through them. So you can think of them as adapting to the average flow through them. But on short time scales, flow is going everywhere. These are flows in, if here's our loop, and here's the flow in here, here's the flow in here, and here's the flow in here. There's like in a delta, you can have tides going in and out, but then at other scales, you can have floods coming in, you can have storm surges. You can have storm surges, you can have biota changing resistance, all sorts of fluctuations that these channels, which adapt over the scale of decades, is appealing all the time. So they're adapting to some sort of average flow. And then the second assumption is that if there's not a lot of flow going through these channels, then they fill in with sediment and shrink maybe to zero. Maybe to zero, and if there's a lot of flow-government force through these systems, then they widen to erosion. So we've seen this graph before. Over here, on this axis, we see this is an entirely river-driven system, an entirely tidal-driven system, and somewhere in the middle we have strong rivers and tides. And if this is an axis of loopiness, our models predict a peak around the center, and our field data, while noisy, suggests. While noisy, suggests similar. But, you know, we've heard lots of different flavors of looping models here, so they at least deserve to be described. That's the first one. Alternatively, loops can grow from a developing network geometry, which I would say is at the beginning a system doesn't want to be loopy, but then something happens in the physics which makes the change. Which makes the channels attracted to one another again, and then you get these. So we've heard a number of systems that way. There's also, you can say, there's a dynamical system of flow partitioning between channels, and that can reach a stable state of equal sediment transport on either side. And Icolo spoke a little bit about that. And then somewhat Somewhat obtusely, I could just say, bioengineering, where there's some magical substance or growth factor which changes the game. I've learned a lot about that stuff this week, and I don't understand it at all. So if we're going to make a classification of loop geometries, definitely need help there. But it just bears mentioning that we have these different types that are coming into focus. That are coming into focus from this concept this week. So, how do Lukes show up? Here's an example from 1973 and 2013. 1973, Bangladesh was very rural, not a lot of development, and here was the channel network. Over these 40 years, this became one of the most densely populated parts of the world that there is, and a lot of development and a lot of poldering of. And a lot of poldering of islands out here. That just means building a levee around it, which keeps, which allows you to farm and not get flooded to my city. So basically, all of these regions were removed from flooding. The hydrodynamics changed. And very rapidly, channels that had been around for centuries started to fill in with sediment. 12 billion kilograms of sediment per year, filling in these channels to become cost lined. And that caused rechanges to navigation patterns, all sorts of things by the changing hydrodynamics brought on by these lines. So, this is the type of reason why I got excited and interested in this system. So, we built some We build some, we have this idea of fluctuation works in aggregate, and then I went to Poland on a Fulbright Fellowship and we built a stability model for a single elementary loop. Basically, the idea is if you can give me something about the geometry of the loop, which is in the lengths here, and you give me something about And you give me something about the type of fluctuations in the loop here. We can assess whether a link will be stable to, will respond to filling by erosion or will respond to filling by morphism. So that's what this is, and you can see we're going to talk a little bit about angles, but the key thing is you can set up a single, one flow situation where one channel. Flow situation where one channel, the conductivity of the channel, you think about that as the cross-sectional area, shrinks to zero exponentially, or you can have things remodel and reach an equilibrium condition where all three channels are open. So, of course, the next thing to do is you want to build it and see if you can do it in the lab. So, I built an experiment. So I built an experimental loop here over the last two years. It's three pipes connected to one another with pipes coming in at the nodes. These pipes are about this big and they're filled mostly with sediment. We can force any type of flow pattern into two of the channels and then the third one will just respond by conservation of mass. We can measure pressure gradients and sediment fill. And here Sediment fill. And here is what sediment transport in the pipes looks like. Pretty fun. Can the sediment escape that man or not? Key question. The answer is at this point it is a closed system. So we have a bucket, bucket, we have buckets in the corners, and we start out with the system mostly full of sediment, but if the sediment Sediment, but if the sediment just makes it to the bucket in the edge, we're not adding, we're not forcing new sediment into the system. Does that answer your question? But then sediment from a given bucket can enter the system again. Yes, it could, if, yes, it could, and it can freely partition however it wants at the junctions. So, we now have a system that can go through all of our Go through all of our fluctuating possibilities as outlined by the theory, and we can see if it works. So on the x-axis, we have this angle, which you can think about as the difference of flows, the ability for things to fluctuate, and we have the expected conductivity at an equilibrium for all three of the channels. All three of the channels. Now, just by how we set it up, BC and CA are almost identical through here, so these are on top of one another. But the idea is below 60 degrees, we have link AB is expected to fill with sediment and to go down to zero. Above 60 degrees to 300 degrees, we can have all three channels exist at equal. Channels exist at equilibrium with open flows. And then above 300, we're back to channel AB filling with 70. And we're going to focus on two cases right here. One where go to zero, and one where everything remains stable. Okay, and here's Okay, here's our experimental results, and you can see they match perfectly, and we're done. Absolutely not what happened. So this data is one month old, so we're very excited to have it. And the beauty of experiments is, you know, you don't choose the physics inside them, so when they don't do what you expect them to do, that's progress. So, you know, if you're You know, if you're feeling charitable, you could say that link BC has a high conductivity. These are equilibrium conductivities at the end of the experiment, right? High conductivity to low to higher again, but CA was supposed to go high, low, high, and it went low, high, low. And AB had some variation, but But not what we expected to find. I showed this to Preja yesterday, and he said that there was some very clearly, there was something happened at the 60-degree transition and then this 300 transition, which I didn't see. But maybe so. Are there error bars? Did you do them only once? Because maybe the 100 ones, for example. Yeah, we've done them twice so far. Yeah, we've done them twice so far, and I can draw some inclusion from them, but the error bars are wide too. But here's what I want to show you, what I think is progress on these experiments. So I'm going to show you first the data from this experiment and then the data from this experiment. So here's the data coming through. Here are the flows that we apply to the system. We're fluctuating back and forth between two flows. Here are the pressure gradients. Again, AB just means in the channel from node A to node B. And you can see where we definitely are getting some fluctuations here. And then here's the sediment fill height. So one means you'd be 100% filled with sediment. Filled with sediment. This is what we were hoping for. And zero means empty. And you can see that over the first couple fluctuations, very rapidly we have erosion in reach BC and a little bit of erosion in CA, but not much happening in AB. You can transfer your fill and pressure gradients into And pressure gradients in conductivity and discharge in between the links, and a measure of sediment transport shield stress in the channels. And what I see pretty quickly is that our high stresses drop quite rapidly in our first few fluctuations to a state here. We have a lot of action in the beginning. We have a lot of action in the beginning, but you can also observe visually that after the first few fluctuations, there's not much sediment moving. And what do we call a channel where the sediment has moved into adjusted so that it's just at the threshold of motion? A river. A river, we call it a threshold chair. You guys, it's been a long time. You guys, it's been a long time since you heard Olivier talk. So, this is what the model said. And what I see here is that the first impulse of this system is to increase the conductivity of B C and C A quite rapidly. But the problem here, the disconnect between the theory and the experiments, is that Is that there's not, the sediment's not filling in AB. Because if the sediment was filling in AB, that would lead to a feedback to promote more erosion in the other channels and moving on to equilibrium. So, in this first set of channel experiments, we didn't see that. We can see the first impulse somewhat happening here, too. Once again, a Once again, a ramping down of the shear stress in the channels to approach equilibrium. You can see an increase of conductivity in a couple of the channels, and in this case, maybe some stability in AB, but it just gets stuck here. There's easy ways to fix this. One is to provide a constant sediment source to the system. Two is to add Add a fine-grain component. These are the things we're exploring right now. So, in my final two minutes, I'll summarize. Looping deltas at the field scale appear to require hydrodynamic fluctuations, although other models still deserve scrutiny. Two, the experimental loops are after initial impulse are unresponsive to the Are unresponsive to these models of channel deposition because the flows reach transport thresholds so quickly. And then the final little food for thought here is we go back to this graph here, and we built some models that showed loopiness where we wanted it to be. But the real deltas are actually more loopy than the models we've given credit for. We didn't think too much about this because we made a lot of simplifying. This is because we made a lot of simplifying assumptions in the model. But I am now looking at this variation and said, well, maybe it's easier to keep a loop stable than we gave it credit for, and maybe that's what I have. Thanks for listening. Trent is largely responsible for this, making the experiment run, and I have two years of post-stock funding to. Two years of post-stock funding to support anybody who wants to work with this. So, Ignacio, here's at the beginning you mentioned scale-free loops. What do you mean by that? So, what we mean by scale-free loops is that the adaptation equation has a linear exponent to it. Now, if you look at things in nature, Things in nature. Sometimes, for example, bigger channels are more efficient at transport, and if you put that into the model, then that would add a little bit of nonlinearity to promote large channels at the expense of small ones. But it is not a third quantity, so adaptation. It's not the size of loops. The size of loops is emergent and And okay, so you're talking about the scale-free measurements of loose. Yes. There's definitely studies out there that shows that island size is fractal in these systems. Well so I'm delighted to see this experiment running. This is fantastic. Thanks for this. Uh I can ask lots of little questions, maybe answer whatever. Questions, maybe the answer, whatever is more at this time. I'm wondering about the junction. You seem to assume that everything happened in the pipe itself, that maybe the junction could control some of the distribution of, let's say, one class. Yes. And maybe a second question is, you mentioned that they reach thresholds very quickly. Or and so how many I have never thought about it if you have the three junctions and you assume they are all at thresholds. If you have multiple solutions for a given Multiple conditions for given a set of discharges to this farmer? It would be maybe a simpler problem to look at. So, the third question: Do you have multiple solutions to this? No idea. It seems mathematically possible. The second question was about the junctions. Junctions, let's do the better. Yes. So there is some head loss in the junctions, which is Which is a pressure term that's not in the models yet. And it's worthy of exploring, but yeah, I think absolutely, in addition to having more available sediment, which I also think will be very important. Len, so the what you were saying about roofs, so add them. Adam, I don't think we put it in the paper at all. So, if you have correlated fluctuations, that helps the loops go up. And I think what Kurba was showing, which is essentially correlated fluctuating, which is basically tights, that could also lift uh the uh collectively in the system in the system it could lift the loops. The problem is right now we can't uh Right now, we can't try it yet for large networks like the ones we have for technical reasons. But the hope is that at some point we will try a vascular system, not with just three loops, like what Kumba was showing, but many more loops. And the hope is that that would lift the curve, which means tides would play a role. I'm sorry, not tides, the fact that when tides come in, we take correlations. But I don't know yet, but correlated. Don't know yet, but correlated fluctuations listed them. Yes. Which is a very good sign. So, one quick question for you. Yeah, it's probably a very naive one. So, you were saying that all of the free channels are at the threshold, and from what I have the excuse from Olympia and Data was that the real readers are threshold because they are controlling a slow. So, is it the same mechanism? Well, everything is flat. Well, everything is flat here, but we have a slope applied by a pressure gradient. So we have a head slope, and the magnitude of these head slopes dropped, which would be analogous to a river dropping its slope until it sediments. Shall you think that basically there was a magic resharfing of sediment so that And there is a magic reshuffling, absolutely. And what I wanted to happen, what I wanted to happen was the erosion in one channel ends up in the other channel, which drives the but the erosion in one channel left the system to a bucket and didn't upgrade the channel it wanted to, so that feedback couldn't really get lost in this first one. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you very much.
