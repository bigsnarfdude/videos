He's from the University of Saint Andrews, located at UWA, and he will speak about non-commuting, non-generating graphs of groups. Go ahead, yes, thank you. And thank you to the organizers of this workshop for inviting me to talk about my research. So I'll note that my slides are available on the website if you want to follow along for those. And I'll also note that some of the results in this talk, I'll specify which, are joint with my PhD. Which are joined with my PhD supervisors, Corva Roni Dougal and Peter Cameron. So, several of the talks in this workshop so far have involved looking at groups acting on certain graphs, but this talk is going in kind of the opposite direction, where we take a group and define on it a graph. In particular, the graph will encode a certain binary relation defined on the group's elements. And so, before talking about the specific graph that I'll be looking at in this talk, I'd like to talk about a more well-known and more studied graph for some motivation. And that graph is the generating graph. So in this talk, G will always denote a group. In general, it could be finite or infinite. And the generating graph is the graph whose vertices are the non-identity elements of G, with two vertices joined if and only if they generate the group. Generate the group. So let's look at the example of the case where G is the Hedral group of order 12 generated by an element A of order 6 and an involution B. So here we have the graph. We see that, for example, there's an edge between A and B because they generate the group, whereas A and A to the fifth are not joined because they generate a proper cyclic subgroup. A cubed is an isolated vertex because it's a central element of G, and so it of course cannot generate G with any other element. With any other element, and we also have a couple of other isolated vertices. So, we observe that even though the graph itself is not connected, if we delete the isolated vertices, or rather, the non-isolated vertices form a connected component, in other words, a subgraph that is maximal among the connected subgraphs, and its diameter is two. The diameter is the maximal distance between any pair of vertices in the component. So, as I said, this graph has been very well studied. And for some additional motivation, I'd like to talk. And for some additional motivation, I'd like to talk a bit more about some other graphs defined on groups. And so here we'll be talking about a few different graphs. And as observed by Peter Cameron, these can be arranged in certain hierarchy. So these will all be defined on the non-identity elements of a group G. So we start with a complete graph, and then this contains as a subgraph, the non-generating graph, which is of course the complement of the generating graph. So here again, we have the example of D12. So here again we have the example of D12. A cubed is joined to every other vertex but I haven't drawn in all the edges. Now this contains as a subgraph the commuting graph where two distinct vertices are joined if and only if they commute. This has a subgraph something called the deep commuting graph which was recently defined by Peter Cameron and Buyana Kuzma. The definition is a bit technical and it won't come up again in this talk but I mean including it for completeness. So two vertices X and Y are joined. That's what this Vertices x and y are joined, that's what this notation means, if and only if their pre-images in every central extension of G commute. Now, this graph contains as a subgraph the enhanced power graph, where two vertices are joined if and only if they generate a cyclic subgroup of G. And in fact, for D12, it turns out that these two subgraphs are in fact equal. Now, the enhanced power graph contains as a subgraph the power graph, where two vertices are joined if and only if one lies in the subgroup generated. One lies in the subgroup generated by the other. Okay, now all of these graphs are interesting in their own right, perhaps except for the complete graph. And these graphs have individually been studied quite a lot, and there's still a lot of work to be done related to these graphs. But we can also consider the difference between subsequent graphs in the hierarchy. For example, the generating graph is the difference between the complete graph and the non-generating graph. And in this talk, we'll be focusing. And in this talk, we'll be focusing on the next difference between the non-generating graph and the commuting graph. So, some questions we could ask are, for example, when does the difference have no edges? In other words, when are the subsequent graphs in the hierarchy actually equal, as in the case of the deep commuting graph and the enhanced power graph for D12? Well, a lot of work on this question has been done. And in fact, the answer is known for the graph we'll be looking at. I'll talk about that shortly. Talk about that shortly. But other questions we could ask are: well, the opposite question: when is the difference connected? And more generally, or I guess more specifically, what is its diameter? And so that is in fact what we'll be focusing on in this talk. But before getting into that, let's actually define the graph we'll be looking at. So the non-commuting, non-generating graph of G, which we denote by gamma of G, has vertices, the non-central elements of G. The non-central elements of G with two vertices joined if and only if they do not commute and they do not generate G. So, in other words, they generate a proper subgroup of G. Okay, so let's look at one way of constructing this graph, and we use the example of D12 again. So we can start with the generating graph, then we take its complement to obtain the non-generating graph. Now, gamma of g is the difference between the non-commuting, sorry, between the non-generating graph and the commuting graph. Between the non-generating graph and the commuting graph. So we'll remove the edges between vertices that commute. So we remove these dashed edges. And finally, we want to remove vertices corresponding to the center of G. And so this gives us the non-commuting, non-generating graph of D12 in this case. And I'll note that we define the graph on the non-central elements of G, because of course, any element in the center will commute with every other element. And so, of course, these would always be. And so, of course, these would always be isolated vertices. And so, to make things nicer, we delete these vertices from the definition. But as we see here, there can still be additional isolated vertices. Okay. Now, as I mentioned before, the main questions we'll be looking at in this talk are connectedness and diameter. But before going into details about gamma of g, I'd like to talk a bit more about the generating graph to set up some additional motivation. And a few times in the talk, I'll be comparing times in the talk, I'll be comparing the generating graph and gamma of g. So when talking about the generating graph, I'll be using these strawberry colored blocks. Okay, so a very famous result in the area of graphs-define on groups is this theorem from Royal-Gurant and Cantor. So they showed that the generating graph of any non-abelian finite simple group is connected with diameter two. Of course, any non-abelian finite simple group is two-generated, but this theorem gives a stronger result. And in fact, Result. And in fact, this result was generalized further earlier this year by Tim Burnes, Paul Guranik, and Scott Harper. They showed that if the generating graph of any finite group has no isolated vertices, then it is in fact connected with diameter at most two. So that's a very nice result. And it, of course, leads us to ask the natural question: well, what about gamma of g? When is gamma of g connected? And more generally, what are the diameters of its connected components? Now, Now, gamma of g is a naturally defined proper subgraph of the complement of the generating graph, and we see that the generating graph often has a very small diameter. So you may expect that maybe gamma of g has a very large diameter, but we will actually see that in many cases, the diameter of gamma of g itself is also very small. But for now, we can observe some basic facts about gamma of g. So, first of all, because the vertices of the graph are the non-central elements of the graph. Of the graph are the non-central elements of the group. It's clear that the graph will be empty. In other words, there will be no vertices if and only if the group is abelian. And we can also show that no connected component of the graph has diameter one. So to prove this, I'll make some room by hiding these two blocks. So let's suppose for a contradiction that there is a component of diameter one. Then it will contain at least two vertices, say x and y, and they must be joined by an edge because the diameter is one. By an edge because the diameter is one. Now, whenever y is joined to x in the graph, it's easy to show that y must be joined to x inverse. So, let's suppose for now that x and x inverse are distinct elements. Well, x and x inverse, of course, commute, and therefore they can't be joined by an edge in the non-commuting, non-generating graph. And so x and x inverse actually can't be part of the same component of diameter one. So, actually, this extra vertex and extra edge do not exist, which means that x must have ordered two. X must have ordered two. X cannot have ordered one because then X would be central on G. And of course, this holds for every vertex in this component. Now we can also show that because X and Y are joined in the graph, each of these vertices is joined to X times Y. So X, Y, and X times Y all have ordered 2, and it follows immediately that X and Y commute. But then this edge that we assume to exist in the first place actually doesn't exist, which is of course a contradiction. And so indeed some. Cost of contradiction, and so indeed such a component cannot exist. Okay, so we just saw that the graph has no vertices if and only if G is abelian, but we can also characterize the groups where the graph has vertices but no edges. And as I mentioned before, this is exactly the case where the non-generating graph and the commuting graph are equal. So we'll suppose that G is non-abelian, so that there are vertices. Now it's clear that. Now, it's clear that an edge in the graph is exactly a pair of non-generating elements that do not commute. And so the graph will have no edges if and only if every pair of non-generating elements do commute. And it's quite easy to see that this is equivalent to the property that every proper subgroup of G is abelian. That's because any pair of non-generating elements that don't commute will generate a proper non-abelian subgroup, and any proper non-abelian subgroup will contain an edge. Contain an edge. And a non-abelian group with a property that every proper subgroup is abelian is called minimal non-abelian. Okay, now what do these minimal non-abelian groups look like? Well, in the finite case, they were classified by Miller and Moreno as early as 1903. And roughly, any such group is either a p-group or a non-non-potent group whose order is divisible by exactly two primes. So, of course, any such group is soluble. Now, in the infinite case, not every minimal non-abelian. Not every minimal non-traveling group is known, but some well-known examples are the Tarski monsters. These are infinite simple groups where every proper non-travial subgroup has order of fixed prime p. And in fact, in 1982, Olshansky showed that a Tasky monster does exist for every prime p that's greater than 10 to the power of 75. So these infinite, minimal, non-abelian simple groups do indeed exist. Okay, now let's let D be the minimum Let's let d be the minimum size of a generating set for g. It's quite easy to see that the generating graph for g is only interesting in the case d equals 2. So why is that? Well, that's because if d is 1, then of course the group is cyclic, and therefore we know exactly what the graph looks like. And if d is greater than 2, then of course there are no generating pairs, and so the graph has no edges. And in fact, the d equals 2 case, for our purposes at least, is For our purposes at least, is the only interesting case for gamma of g. So that's because when d is one, again the group is cyclic and therefore abelian, and so the graph has no vertices. And if d is at least three, then again the group has no generating pairs. And so two vertices will be joined in gamma of g if and only if they do not commute. And so gamma of g is precisely the non-commuting graph of g, which again has vertices, the non-central elements of g. So why is this case not interesting to us? Well, in 2000, Us? Well, in 2006, Abdullahi, Akbari, and Maimani proved that any non-abelian group has a non-commuting graph that's connected with diameter 2. So, for example, here's the non-commuting graph of D12. It's easy to see that this has diameter 2. But why does this result hold in general? So let's let x and y be vertices in the non-commuting graph, so that they're non-central elements in G. Then because they're not central, the centralizer of x and g and the centralizer of y and g are proper subgroups. Centralizer of Y and G are proper subgroups of G. Now, an easy exercise is: we'll show that the union of two proper subgroups of G is a proper subset. And therefore, there exists an element H in the group depending on X and Y that does not centralize X or Y. And so, of course, X H Y is a path in the graph. So, what we've shown is that given What we've shown is that given any two vertices in the graph, the distance in the graph is at most two. So we've shown that the graph is connected with diameter at most two. We can also show that the graph cannot have diameter one using the same argument as in the case of gamma of G. And so indeed this result holds. So that's why we're only interested in gamma of g when g is two generated and non-abelian. That's because when g is abelian, there are no vertices. And when it is non-abelian but not two generated, then we always know that the Then we always know that the graph is connected with diameter 2. So, for our purposes, that case is not interesting. But we can actually use this result about the non-commuting graph to obtain some useful results about gamma of g in the case that is interesting to us. And to highlight this, I'd like to look at the example of an alternating group. And here we'll also look at some applications of basic permutation group theory to fit in with the theme of the workshop. Okay, so we'll let G be the alternating group of degree. So we'll let G be the alternating group of degree n acting naturally on a set omega of n points. We'll let alpha and beta be distinct points in omega, and g will be the intersection of g alpha and g beta. Okay, we'll also assume that n is at least five. In other words, that g is simple, because otherwise the group would either be abelian or minimal non-abelian, and so the graph would have no edges. Okay, so here we have the diagram showing A diagram showing G alpha, G beta, and the intersection J. Now, of course, the point stabilizers G alpha and G beta are each isomorphic to the alternating group of degree n minus one, which is trivial center. But what I'm about to say actually applies more generally to any proper subgroups of any group. And so I've included these central subgroups here, even though in this specific case, both central subgroups are trivial. Okay, now any. Okay, now any two elements of G alpha will of course generate a subgroup of G alpha which is proper in G. And so that means that any two elements of G alpha will be joined in gamma of G by an edge if and only if they do not commute. And so we see therefore that the subgraph of gamma of G induced by the non-central elements of G alpha is exactly the non-commuting graph of G alpha, which we know has diameter two. So given any two non-central elements of G alpha, they're joined by Elements of G alpha, they're joined by a path of length at mouse 2 in gamma of g. And in fact, we can say a bit more. So let's let x be an element of g alpha that doesn't lie in its center or in j, and y an element of g beta that doesn't lie in its center or in j. Now, j is isomorphic to the alternating group of degree n minus 2, and it's easy to see that this is the alternating group you'd expect. It's a maximal subgroup of each of G alpha and G beta. And g beta. And therefore, we can show that the centralized of x and j is a proper subgroup. That's because if all of j centralized at x, then x would be centralized by the subgroup generated by j at x. But because j is maximal, the subgroup is all of g alpha, and x is not in the center of g alpha. So indeed, the centralizer of x and j is a proper subgroup, as is the centralizer of y and j. And therefore, again, because the Therefore, again, because the union of two proper subgroups is a proper subset, there exists an element R in this intersection J that does not commute with either X or Y. And of course, R does not generate G with X or Y, and so X R Y is a path in the graph. And again, what I've said here applies more generally to any proper subgroups that intersect maximally, as in this case. Okay, so all we've shown here in this case, though, is that given any two non-deranged Is that given any two non-derrangements of G, in other words, any two elements that have any number of fixed points, there's a path of length at most two joining them in gamma of g. So in order to complete our discussion of the diameter of gamma of g for g and alternating group, it remains to consider the derangements. In other words, the elements with no fixed points. And in fact, we can prove this theorem. So again, with g and alternating group of degree n at least five, gamma of g is connected with that. Gamma of G is connected with diameter at most four in general, and in fact, at most three, if any is even. And I will note that these upper bounds may or may not be tight. In particular, for all alternating groups of degree between five and ten, gamma of g has diameter two. And more generally, I don't know of an alternating group where the diameter is greater than two. So maybe these upper bounds are tight, or maybe they could be reduced. But in any case, how do we prove this theorem? Well, let's let S and T be Well, let's let S and T be derangements in G. We want to show two things. So, first, we want to show that there are non-derangements X and Y and G, such that S is joint to X in the graph and T is joint to Y. Now, from the previous slide, we know that X and Y have distance at most two in the graph. In fact, this holds if we replace Y by any non-derring. And so this means that because S is joint to X, the distance between S and any non-derangement will be at most 3. And in fact, because Y is 3. And in fact, because y is joint to t, it follows that the distance between s and t will be at most 4. So this gives the upper bound of 4. And for the upper bound of 3, we have to consider what happens when s and t are not n cycles. Now, because we're looking at the alternating group, there will only be n cycles in this group when n is odd. And so when n is even, s and t will always, well, s and t will never be n cycles. And so in this case, where they're not n cycles, we want to show that we can choose. Cycles, we want to show that we can choose the non-derrangements x and y from part one so that x and y are actually adjacent in the graph. And this will immediately imply that the distance between s and t is at most three. And so this gives up a bound of three in the case that n is even. So I'd like to prove parts one and two, where relevant, in a couple of cases. So let's look at the example first where the derangement S has exactly two orbits on omega. Has exactly two orbits on omega and with a derangement t has at least three orbits. And here I've represented s and t as products of disjoint cycles. Now, because s and t are derangements, they contain, well, these cycles contain all elements from omega. And so we can assume that the first cycle in each has a first element that is equal in each case. So we'll call that element alpha one. Okay, so we'll let x and y be the non-derrangements shown here. And I've color-coded the relevant elements. Here and I've color-coded the relevant elements to make matching these up a bit easier. So, first, we observe that the image of s under conjugation by x is not equal to s. That's because, well, n is at least five. And so we can assume without loss of generality that this first cycle has length at least three. So there's some alpha three here as well. So x, of course, maps alpha two to alpha one, which is not equal to alpha three. And so x does not map, does not map s to itself. Does not map S to itself. And so S and X did not commute. We can also show, well, it's easy to see, that the subgroup generated by S and X isn't transitive, because, for example, there's no element mapping alpha1 to beta 1 in the subgroup. So the subgroup generated by S and X is proper in G, and so S and X are adjacent in the non-commuting, non-generating graph. For similar reasons, P and Y are adjacent in the graph. And so we've proved part one for these arrangements, S and T. Arrangements s and t. But s and t are not n cycles, so we also have to prove part two. So, first we observe that well, because x and y both move the point alpha one, if y were to map x to itself under conjugation, then y would have to fix at least two points, sorry, fix either exactly two points or at least four points. But y fixes exactly three points, and so x and y indeed do not commute. And so it remains to show that x and y generate a proper subgroup of g. Generate a proper subgroup of g. So let's let d be the degree of the subgroup generated by x and y, which is just the number of points moved by at least one of x and y. And it's easy to see that this degree is at most six. Now, if d is less than n, then of course the subgroup is proper ng. So let's assume that d is equal to n. Now, because t has at least three orbits on omega, we see that in fact n is at least six. And because d is at most six, if d is equal to n, 6 if d is equal to n, then d must be equal to 6. And in this case, in the subgroup generated by x and y, there's again no element mapping alpha 1 to beta 1. So this is an intransitive and therefore proper subgroup of g. So in general, we've shown that x is joined to y in the graph, and so we've proved two. Now, the case where both s and t have exactly two orbits on omega, and the case where they both have at least three orbits can be solved using similar arguments. But now, But now let's look at the case where S is an n cycle, so that n is odd. And because here we only have to prove part one and not part two, we don't have to worry about what t is. We can just focus on s. So at least in the symmetric group, we know that there's an element mapping s to any other n cycle. And we can assume that that other n cycle starts with alpha one. So we can assume that the element of the symmetric group actually fixes alpha one. Okay, so in particular, So in particular, S inverse is an n cycle. And so there's an element V in the symmetric group that fixes alpha 1 and maps S to S inverse. And in fact, because N is at least 5 and odd, there's an integer, well, there's a power, S to the I of S, that is an N cycle and is not equal to S or S inverse. So there's this distinct element W in the symmetric group that fixes alpha 1 and maps S to S to the I. Now, because both V and W Now, because both V and W lie in the symmetric group, at least one of V, W and V times W will lie in the alternating group. So we choose X to be any such element out of these three that does lie in G. And we see that in each case, X and S do not commute, because of course, S inverse and S to the I are not equal to S. And Vw maps S to S to the minus I, which is again not equal to S. Furthermore, as I said, so S and X did not commute. As I said, so S and X did not commute. And furthermore, the subgroup generated by S and X, of course, lies in the normalizer in G of the cyclic subgroup generated by S, which is, of course, proper in the simple group G. And therefore, S and X are adjacent in the graph, and so we've proved part one. Okay, so that's all I wanted to say about alternating groups. For now, let's move on to looking at abstract groups in general. So we previously looked at the case where the graph Where the graph had vertices but no edges. In other words, where every vertex was isolated. And we can, in fact, say more about isolated vertices in general. So we'll suppose that we're in our interesting case. In other words, that G is non-abelian and G generated. Now, again, an edge in the graph corresponds to a pair of non-generating elements that do not commute. And so a vertex in the graph will be isolated if and only if, whenever there's another element that doesn't generate with it, those two elements must commute. Those two elements must commute. And it's quite easy to see that this means that a vertex will be isolated if and only if every maximal subgroup containing that vertex also centralizes it. Now, it's easy to show that a non-central element of a group is centralized by at most one maximal subgroup. And from this, it follows that a vertex x is isolated in gamma of g if and only if x lies in a unique maximal subgroup m and x is central in m. So let me explain this a bit. Explain this a bit. So it's clear from the above that x is isolated if one and two both hold. If one holds but two does not, then x is a non-central element of m, and so x is not isolated. And if one does not hold, then x lies in at least two maximal subgroups. It's central and at most one, and so it's non-central in at least one. And so again, x is not isolated. Now, a question that I have here is, if x is isolated, can the group M be non-abelian? In other words, if we have In other words, if we have an element of a group that lies in a unique maximal subgroup and it's centralized by that maximal subgroup, can that maximal subgroup be non-abelian? Now, I don't know the answer to this question in general, but what I do know is that if M is normal in G, the answer is no. M must be abelian. So why is that? Well, let's assume that X is isolated, so it lies in a unique maximal subgroup M, and that means that X generates G together with every element Y. generates g together with every element y that lies outside of m. Now x is central in m, so that means that g is generated by the center of m together with y. And that means that the quotient of g by the center of m is cyclic. And this quotient is well defined because m is normal in g. Now, this quotient being cyclic implies that the quotient of m by its center is cyclic. And this implies immediately that m is abelian. Okay, now as I said, I don't know the answer to this question in general, but we To this question in general, but we will revisit this question later towards the end of the talk. For now, I'd like to state some results about gamma of g in the context of certain families of groups. In the first case, we'll look at the family of groups where every maximal subgroup is normal. So for finite groups, this is exactly the family of non-potent groups, but for infinite groups, this is a strictly larger family of groups. Okay, for convenience, let's write delta OG. For convenience, let's write delta of g to denote the subgraph of gamma of g obtained by deleting all isolated vertices. So for example, this is not an opponent group, but it's a nice example we've seen already. On the left, we have gamma of d12. If we delete the two isolated vertices, we obtain delta of d12 on the right. Now, the main theorem in this case is joint work with my supervisors, Peter Cameron and Colveroni Dougal. So if G is a group with every maximal subgroup normal, then either Subgroup normal, then either delta of g is empty or it's connected with diameter 203. And if it is connected with diameter three, then actually delta of g is equal to gamma of g. In particular, that means that gamma of g itself is connected with dameter three, and of course there's no isolated vertices. And I will say that there are cases where gamma of g itself can be connected with diameter two, and cases where there is a component of diameter two plus some isolated vertices. So, as I mentioned earlier, well, this is one of the cases that I mentioned earlier where the diameter of gamma of g is very small, even though gamma of g is this well-defined, naturally defined rather, proper subgraph of the complement of the generating graph, which itself has a small diameter. Okay, so this is a nice result. I won't prove it here, but what I will say is that it's proof users. say is that its proof uses some arguments similar to those that we looked at in the in the non-derangement case of the Lugmaiden group. And in fact, and it also uses the fact about isolated vertices in normal maximal subgroups that we saw in the previous slide. Okay, now something else I want to say is that we can actually prove a more detailed version of this result in the case where G is finite and therefore important. And this gives a precise relationship between the structures of A precise relationship between the structures of G and gamma of G. Now, I won't prove this result here or state it because it's too technical, but basically we look at the structure of gamma of G when G is a finite P group, and then we use the fact that any finite repotent group is the direct product of a T L subgroups. Now, what I do want to talk about, however, is what happens when we take a direct product of groups in the context of gamma of G. In the context of gamma of g. This is part of, we use this result to prove this precise relationship in the case where g is a finite component group, but it is also more interesting, what's interesting in a more general context as well. Okay, so this result is again joint work with my supervisors. So we'll let A and B be arbitrary groups with A non-abelian. So first of all, if B is not cyclic, then the graph of the direct product of A and B is always connected with diameter 2. with diameter two okay and if if instead b is cyclic then sorry if b is cyclic and the graph of a is connected with diameter k then the graph of the direct product is also connected with diameter at most k so i won't prove this lemma but the main idea of the proof is the observation that if two elements of a do not generate a then any pair of corresponding elements of the direct product will not generate the direct product and so Direct product. And similarly, if two elements of A do not commute, then the corresponding elements of the direct product also will not commute. And of course, the same holds if we swap the elements of A and B. And so basically, what this is saying is that it's very easy for two elements to be joined directly in the graph of the red product. And so that's why, at least in case one, the diameter is as small as possible. Okay, now let's look at an example for case two. So these again are not looking. So, these again are not important examples, but they're nice small ones. So, if we take the graph of the symmetric group of degree 4, that's connected with diameter 3. If we take the graph of the direct product of S4 with the cyclic group C2, then the graph is now connected with diameter 2. But if we take the direct product of S4 with C3, then the graph has diameter 3. So, this indicates that the at most part of the lemma is important. We can still have diameter k after taking the direct product. Diameter k after taking the direct product, or we could have diameter strictly less than k. Okay, so you'll notice in particular that if we take a direct product of any number of non-abelian simple groups, then part one of the lemma tells us that the graph will always have diameter two. This is very different to what happens in the case of the generating graph. So, indeed, Christine Einley Keeney proved in 2013 that for any positive integer k, there exists an odd prime p and a positive integer. Odd prime p and a positive integer n, such that if we exclude isolated vertices, then the generating graph of the direct product of n copies of the simple group PSL22 to the p is connected with diameter greater than k. So excluding isolated vertices, if we take a direct product of non-abelian finite simple groups, the diameter of the generating graph is unbounded. Again, this is the opposite to what happens for gamma of g, where the diameter Where the diameter is always 2 in this case. Okay, now let's move on from North Poten groups to soluble groups. And here I'll mostly be talking about finite groups. So again, starting with something about the generating graph, Andrea Lucchini proved in 2017 that a two-generated finite soluble group G, excluding isolated vertices, will have a generating graph that is connected with diameter 2 or 3. That is connected with diameter 2 or 3. And you'll notice that this looks very much like the theorem that we proved, or that I stated rather, for non-potent groups in the case of gamma of G. So does this theorem still hold when we look at soluble groups in the context of gamma of G? Well, in fact, it does not. So why is that? Well, there exist two generated finite soluble groups G, with maximal subgroups M1, M2, up to Mn. To up to mn, where any pair of distinct maximal subgroups have intersection the center of m1, which properly contains a center of g, and the center of g is the center of any maximal subgroup other than m1. Okay, now the graph of this group actually has two connected components, each of diameter two. So one component consists of the non-center elements of M1, and the other component consists of all other vertices. Component consists of all other vertices. So, why are these components disjoint and of diameter 2? Well, let's try to join a vertex in the upper component to one in the lower component. We can't join a vertex in the upper component to a vertex in the center of M1, because those vertices commute. And we can't join a vertex in the upper component to a vertex outside of M1 because those vertices generate OG. Those two vertices each lie in unique, distinct maximal subgroups. So, indeed, these two components. So, indeed, these two components are disjoint. Furthermore, the subgraph of gamma of g induced on the non-central element of M1 is precisely the non-commuting graph of M1, which we know has diameter 2. So indeed, this upper component has diameter 2. As for the lower component, because we have vertices that are in the center of M1, but of course not in the center of G, it's easy to show that M1 is the full centralizer of any such vertex in G. So any such vertex does not commute with any. So, any such vertex does not commute with any vertex outside of m1. So, starting at such a vertex, we can join it directly with an edge to any vertex outside of m1. Then we can join that vertex directly to any other vertex in the center of m1. And then we can join that vertex to any other vertex outside of m1. So it's easy to see that this lower component also has diameter two. Okay, now for convenience, let's call a group G a 2, 2 group if, as in this case, gamma of G consists of two connected components. Of G consists of two connected components, each of diameter 2. Okay, now for a finite soluble group, if G is not a 2,2 group, then we get exactly the same possibilities as in the non-potent case. Namely, either delta of G is empty or it's connected with diameter 2 or 3. And in the diameter 3 case, actually, gamma of G itself is connected. If we consider infinite soluble groups, there's only one more case that could occur, and that's that gamma of g has diameter 4. That gamma of G has diameter 4. Now, I don't know if this case actually can occur. If it does occur, then the corresponding group G has to satisfy very specific properties. And I also say that we can classify the finite 2,2 groups in abstract group theoretic terms. I won't go into too many details here, but any such finite 2,2 group is soluble and it looks like the group pictured here. Furthermore, we can obtain an infinite family of finite groups. Obtain an infinite family of finite 22 groups by taking certain subgroups of the finite simple exceptional Suzuki groups, and the smallest 22 group has order 96. Okay, now let's move on from soluble groups to insoluble groups. And in this case, I will really only be talking about finite groups. So let's look at three different cases. In the first case, if the quotient of g by In the first case, if the quotient of g by its center has a proper non-cyclic quotient, then gamma of g is connected with diameter two or three. And both of these cases can occur. In the second case, if g is trivial center and g is not simple, then delta of g at least is connected with diameter two or three. And again, both cases do occur. And finally, if g is simple, then the graph is connected with diameter at most five. That is the graph gamma of g. Gamma of G. Now, there are simple groups G where gamma of G has diameter 2, 3, or 4. I don't know if there is a simple group where the diameter is 5, but this is at least an upper bound. And so where does this upper bound come from? Well, let's let M1 and M2 be maximal subgroups of the simple group G, and we'll assume that M1 and M2 have even order. We'll also let X and Y be non-central elements of M1 and M2. Now, because M1 and Now, because M1 and M2 have even order, they of course contain involutions A and B. And we can in fact choose A and B so that they're not central in their corresponding maximal subgroups, and so that A and B do not commute. Now, because X and A are not central in M1, we know there's a path of length at most two in gamma of G joining them, and the same is true for B and Y. Now, as I said, A and B do not commute, and they generate a dihedral subgroup of G. Generate a dihedral subgroup of G, which is, of course, a proper subgroup. And so A and B are joined in the graph. So we have a path of length 5 here between X and Y. So basically, what we've shown is that if every maximal subgroup of G has even order, then at least delta of G is connected with diameter at most 5. And in fact, the proof of this does not rely on the classification. So to complete the proof of path three, we have to consider the simple groups G, where there are maximal subgroups of R order. Where there are maximal subgroups of our order and these are known, and we also have to show that there are no isolated vertices in general, and so we can perform both of these steps, but both of these do rely on classification. And I'll say more about isolated vertices shortly. For now, you may have noticed that actually I haven't accounted for every insoluble group in this theorem. Namely, we could take a central extension of a group in case two or three. So if H is a central extension of G, and if G is trivial center, And if G is trivial center with gamma of G connected with diameter K, then gamma of H is also connected with diameter at most K. So in particular, if H is a central extension of a finite simple group, then gamma of H has diameter at most 5. But in case 2, we don't know that gamma of G is connected, just that delta of G is. So how do we resolve this case? Well, the question here is, is there actually a finite insoluble group G where delta of G is not equal to gamma of G? g is not equal to gamma of g, in other words, where gamma of g has an isolated vertex. So this brings us back to the question of isolated vertices. And recall that a vertex x is isolated in the graph if and only if it lies in a unique maximal subgroup M and it's central in M. And the question from before was, if X is isolated, can M be non-abelian? So again, I don't know the answer to this question in general, but something important to note is that it Important to note is that it is that no finite insoluble group contains an abelian maximal subgroup. So that means that if the answer to this question is no, at least in the finite case, then that means that every finite insoluble group G has a graph with no isolated vertices. And so delta of G is equal to gamma of G and therefore connected with diameter at most five. But in the previous slide, I did mention that gamma of G has no isolated vertices. Of G has no isolated vertices when G is finite and simple. So, where does that come from? Well, in his talk on Monday, Gareth Tracy mentioned results joined with Bob Guraunik, classifying elements of finite groups that lie in unique maximal subgroups. And using these results, we can show that if G is finite and simple, and X lies in a unique maximal subgroup M, then in fact, X is non-central in M. And so, indeed, this means that X is not isolated. And so, of course, this means that the graph gamma of G has This means that the graph gamma g has no isolated vertices. We could perhaps actually use the results to prove that there are no isolated vertices in additional cases, for example, for almost simple groups or more generally insoluble groups in general, but that would require some more work. Okay, but yeah, so basically to answer this question, it suffices to consider primitive in Suffices to consider primitive, insoluble, non-simple groups with no proper non-cyclic quotients. Okay, at least in the finite case. For the infinite case, more work would be required. Okay, now this table here gives the finite simple groups and either exact values or upper bounds for the diameter of gamma of g. So where do we get these values from? Well, in the first two rows, the diameter of the graph was computed directly using magma. Using magma. We also have a value of 4 for the baby monster and PU72. Now, there's another graph called the intersection graph of a group, where the vertices are the proper non-trivial subgroups of that group, and two subgroups are joined by an edge if and only if they intersect non-trivially. I was recently able to show that the baby monster and PSU72 each have an intersection graph of diameter 5. In fact, the baby monster and certain unitary groups are the only. And certain unitary groups are the only groups, the only finite groups at least, that can have intersection graphs of diameter 5. So, because this graph is diameter 5, it's easy to show that 4 is the lower bound for the diameter of gamma of g. And by looking at, for example, the maximum subgroups and centralizers of elements in these groups, we can show that 4 is in fact an upper bound, and so the diameter is exactly 4 in this case. Using similar arguments, we can show that the upper bound Similar arguments, we can show that the upper bound is four for the remaining sporadic groups and the tits group. We've seen why, well, we've seen where these upper bounds of the alternated groups come from already. We can get an upper bound of four for PSL and Q using some linear algebra and field theory. And for the Suzuki groups by looking at the structures of their maximal subgroups. And we can also get an upper bound of four for some exceptional groups of lead type in October. For some exceptional groups of late type, you're not characteristic by considering centralizers of involutions. And we've already seen that for the remaining simple groups, there's an upper bound of five. Now, a question here is, can these upper bounds be reduced? So I don't know whether any of these upper bounds are tight or not. So maybe some or all of them could be reduced, but perhaps not. So finally, I'd like to conclude by talking about a few more infinite groups. Just give a few more examples. Just give a few more examples. So, of course, I'm a student at the University of St. Andrews, where many researchers like to look at Thompson's groups. So, I thought I should talk briefly about one of them. So, Thompson's group F is an infinite two-generated group given by this presentation shown here. Its commutator subgroup is an infinite simple group. Now, it's well known that this commutator subgroup is the unique minimal normal subgroup of F. minimal normal subgroup of f and the quotient of f by this subgroup is isomorphic to z squared now i won't explain exactly how but we can use these facts to show that the graph of f is connected with diode two okay now our next example is the infinite dihedral group generated by involutions a and b with no relations between them now the graph of this group consists of two isolated vertices a b and b a AB and BA plus a component of diameter two. Next, the free group on two generators can be thought of as generated by elements A and B with infinite order, having no relations between them. This is another graph where the diameter is two. And more generally, if we have a group generated by two elements A and B, with A having order R, B having order S, R and S are at least two and possibly infinite. At least two and possibly infinite with no relations between A and B, then either G is the infinite dihedral group or the graph is connected with diameter two. And I'll note that G here is the free product of the cyclic groups of order R and S. Okay, so here we have some examples of infinite groups with small diameter. And all these examples are, of course, two-generated. Okay, well, that's everything that I wanted to say. Thank you very much for listening. Thank you very much for listening. Thank you very much, Saul. Does anybody have any comments or questions? Please either speak up or put them into the chat. So I have a question, Saul. On your previous slide where you had this table with all of the diameters there, so you said that for the smaller sporadic groups at the top of the table that you use some computational techniques, is that right? Use some computational techniques, is that right? Yeah, yeah, just like looking at using like computing information basically about the maximal subgroups and elements that centralize certain elements in those maximal subgroups. Okay, and so what sorry, you go. Just like, so like, I mean, you can do it very naively, just like, you know, consider elements, which elements. You know, considerable elements which elements don't commute with them and don't generate with them, but for these bigger groups, of course, that's not feasible. So you have to use some group theory to make the computations more feasible, but it's not anything too complicated. Okay, so this so what would you say is the main bottleneck for the remaining sprouted groups? Of course, you can't expect to do like the monster group or anything computationally, but maybe with some of the next biggest. With some of the next biggest numbers for me. Yeah, so it's been a while since I looked at the code, but I think it's something to do with like constructing all the conjugates of a given maximal subgroup or something, or like constructing all the maximal subgroups of the group. And just like, I guess, yeah, lots of maximal subgroups, lots of elements, something to do with that. Okay, cool. Thanks. Okay. Anything else? Sola, I had one question too. At some point you looked at the graph of a direct product of two groups, I don't know, something like S4 and C two or something like that. And you said something about the diameter of that. So is that related to the individual graphs of the factors at all? Of the factors at all? Well, so when B is not cyclic, it's not because the graph always has diameter 2, no matter what the individual graphs are. But when B is cyclic, you basically, it is closely related in the case where B is cyclic because you basically will get a path. So as long as there's a path between elements in In the graph of A, then like the corresponding elements. So basically, yeah, I mean, so for the main idea, from we see from the main idea of the proof, if there is an edge between two elements in A, then there'll also be an edge between the corresponding elements in the direct product. But in the case where B is not cyclic, there will be a lot more edges in that as well. Right. Okay. Right, okay. Yeah, essentially, I was wondering if you have some group theoretic construction, be that a direct product or a free product or whatever, a normal series or something. Can you write the graph in terms of the individual graphs? Yeah, I think that I looked at this briefly, but not too much because, again, there are just a lot of edges that appear when B's are not cyclic. Wimby's not cyclic, but um, it is very much possible that there is such a construction, yeah. So, I can't say with certainty that there isn't, but at least I don't know of one. All right, thanks. Um, were there any other questions or comments? If that's not the case, then I will ask David to stop the recording.
