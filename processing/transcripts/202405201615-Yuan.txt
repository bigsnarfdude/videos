Thank you for giving me this opportunity to give this talk online. Thank you. So this is what I'm going to talk about. First of all, I'm going to introduce you the dimension counting problem on supplies. And we'll see that on this problem, these notions like gridded rings, ideals, and modules appear naturally in the context of split. Naturally, in the context of splines. Then we are going to talk about some homological things, right? So, chain complexes, exact sequence, and how do Hilbert functions come into play. And then we will talk about the very classical tool, the Bellara-Schenk-Stillman complex. And then I also want to introduce some computational methods. So that's a plan. So let's start with. So let's start with the dimension counting problem. And throughout this talk, this is our notations. Delta means a finite simplicial complex, which may come from a triangulation of a region. Well, sometimes I'll use the lines which has delta in between to mean the region. And in most cases, we think of the planar case, which is n equals to n is the. Which is n equals 2, n is a dimension here. So n equals 2 means the planar case. r here is a non-negative integer, which is supposed to be the smoothness. That is CR continuous. And D here is a non-negative integer, which is supposed to mean the degree of polynomial functions. And we use this notation to denote the spline space, that is the set of piecewise polynomial functions over delta with degree at most. delta with degree at most d and global smoothness r and we know that this spline space is a finite dimensional r vector space so this is the dimension counting problem so because it is finite dimensional we want to ask what is the dimension and this problem is one problem that has attracted much attention and also it is highly non-trivial even for the planet case Even for the planar case, r equals 1 and d equals 3, we do not have a complete formula for the general case. And among all the important problems on splines, perhaps this one is the best one that fitted in the algebraic framework because it has an algebraic nature. This is some history on this problem in the planner case. In 1974, Strong conjectured a formula. Kramp conjectured a formula for the dimension for the case r equals one. And in 1979, Schumacher gave a formula. We use this notation for that formula. I think this is because of the name of Schumacher, L, and proved that L is a lower bound of the dimension of the spine space. And this works for any delta R and D. And in 1986, And in 1987, using Burst and Berthere methods, Alford and Schumacher proved that this L equals the dimension for D is greater than or equal to 4R plus 1. And this was later extended to D is greater than 3r plus 2 by Hong in 1991. So the conjecture made by Strong was that for a generic triangulation, Generic triangulation: the dimension of this spline space is exactly the Schumacher's formula. So the Schumacher's formula was not there in the time, but it was actually the Schumacher's formula. And in 1988, Bilara proved Strong's conjecture using homological approach. And this is what we are going to talk about later. So, Schumacher's formula is like this. You can see that it has. Like this, you can see that it has many components, but among them, for example, there are, of course, there are R D. R D are always there. And also, you can see that this one and this one are numbers. This one is a number of interior edges, and this one is the number of interior vertices in delta. So they are called. In delta. So they are called combinatorial data of delta. And this sigma, this sigma is here. If you look closer, it has something like this. And this one is the number of distinct slopes at an interior vertex VI. So this is called local geometric data. So this formula includes DR and combinatorial and local geometric data. And local geometric data. However, the actual value of the dimension of the supply space also depends on the global geometry. And so you can see that this is not reflected from the formula. So that is why there is a discrepancy of the dimension of spine space and this formula in some cases. So we are going to introduce these rings ideals and modules. This is because This is because commutative algebras always talk like, well, okay, let A be a graded ring, I is the ideal, and M is a graded A module, something like this. We want to know how do these notions make sense in the context of splice. First of all, let's deal with the ring. We can see that the set of polynomial functions is a graded ring. It has a natural grading. So it is. Natural grading. So it is, and also it is one of the most important prototypes of commutative rings. So commutative algebras care about this ring very much. And we use a notation, such a notation, which r here means coefficients and x1 to xn are the variables. We use this notation to emphasize that here we are considering the algebraic structure of the polynomials rather than dealing with them as actual functions. Than dealing with them as actual functions. So that was the ring. Now let's take a look at ideals. So let's consider such a configuration. It's a simplitude complex with two triangles, that is, two faces, and they share one edge. Let's assume this edge lies on the line defined. On the line defined by x equals zero. So the ideal generated, so this is a notation for an ideal generated by something. So in between of the brackets, this is the something x. So it's a generator. So the ideal generated by x is a set of all polynomial functions vanishing along this line defined by x equals zero. So, in fact, you will see that. So in fact, you will see that if an ideal, so if a polynomial is in this ideal, that is equivalent to say that g is divisible by x. So these two conditions are the same. So as a result, if we put, for example, an f1, a polynomial f1 on this triangle on the left and put f2 on the triangle on the right, then so this. Then so this f this piecewise polynomial is continuous across the boundary defined by x equals zero if and only if the difference of these two polynomials falls in this ideal generated by this x. So this is the c0 continuous. What if you want continuous with high orders? Well, you just simply raise the power of x. Of x. So similarly, if you consider the ideal generated by x to r plus 1, then it is the set of polynomials vanish up to order r along this line. So therefore, this piecewise polynomial is CR continuous across the boundary if and only if the difference of these two polynomials is in this ideal generated by a power of this element. Now, if the boundary lies Now, if the boundary lies on a line defined by degree equation, L equals 0, well not just x, then we simply replace x with L and everything works. Okay, and I want to mention that this criterion is called the cofactor criterion, and it first appeared in Wong's paper in 1974. So, this is a conclusion. This is a conclusion, saying that if this piecewise polynomial is CR continuous along tau, if and only if this L tau to R plus one divides L1 minus F2. That is the cofactor criterion. Okay, so this is the first step to put the problem into an algebraic formula. Into an algebraic framework. Now let's talk about A module. A here means a polynomial ring, and A module is just a linear space. The only difference is that there may be an algebraic relation among generators of A module, which we call syzegies. Syzegy is a Greek word. And I asked a Greek mathematician, do you still use syzeges in your life? They said yes. Life, they said yes, and they said it means husband. So, on the other hand, our module is always free. That means it does not have algebraic relation among their generators. Okay, we call this space, this is a space which is a union of the spline spaces in all degrees, and we call it the total spline space. Well, this Supply space. Well, this space is an A module because if you multiply any element in this set, you will get another element in this set. So it is a linear space. Okay, let's take a look at an example. This is called a star of a vertex. So this is a So, this is a planar triangulation, which is a star of a single interior vertex in the middle. In this case, well, if I put H1 in this triangle, H2 here, H3 here, and H4 here, you will see that this piecewise polynomial is an element of the total spine space if and only if they satisfy such a system of equations. Such a system of equations. Here, A1, A2, A3, A4 are supposed to be polynomials. And now you see that if we take the sum of the four equations, we'll get another equation. That means these polynomials A1, A2, A3, A4 must satisfy such an equation. That is A1, A2, A3, A4. is a1 a2 a3a4 is a sydergy of this element it's it's an algebraic relation among these generators so it's a sydergy well and another useful observation here is that in this example if we assume the vertex in the middle is located at the origin now all the ls these ls are homogeneous they are they are linear forms right so as a result the a So as a result, the A module SR of delta can be generated by homogeneous plans. Well that means the restrictions on each phase are homogeneous polynomials. So this means it can be this module, this total spline space, can be sliced into homogeneous degree pieces like this. Pieces like this. You take a direct sum of its homogeneous degree D pieces. And each of such a piece is again a finite dimensional vector space. So, in general, if an A module M can be decomposed at this, then we say M is created. Graded. And the Hilbert function of a graded A module M is defined to be its input is a degree D, and its output is a dimension of the homogeneous degree D piece. So we have seen that if delta is a star of vertex and with the interior vertex at the origin, then the total Then the total sprite space is graded. And the dimension of this sprite space is the sum of the Hilbert functions from i equals zero to i equals d. However, we know that not every vertex, sorry, not every delta is a star vertex. Well, we still want to relate the So we still want to relate the dimension of the spine space with the Hilbert function. Then we need to consider a technique called conning. That is, we want to embed this delta. Delta here is not a planar triangulation. It's a one-dimensional thing. This V1, V2, V3, V4 is a line above. It's a one-dimensional simplicial complex. So we embed it. So we embed it into the space x equals one in the space with one additional dimension. So now the space is Rn plus one. And then we take the cone of delta with the origin. So if we do this, we get another simple complex with Simple actual complex with one dimension higher. And now this simple action complex is a star vertex. And the homogenized spline module, we call this, we call this total spline space of this delta hat to be the homogenized supply module. This spline module is a graded A module. Moreover, we have that the dimension We have that the dimension of the spline space we care about is actually exactly the Hilbert function of this homogenized spine module at degree D. So we already have Hilbert functions. Now we can talk about chin complexes and exact sequences. And we can see that the Hilbert And we can see that the Hilbert function has a good property with such things. That is to say, Hilbert functions are additive. What does that mean? So we can begin with consider the sequence of R vector spaces like this. This is a sequence. And now, if we assume the image of this map is a kernel of this map, then we see the sequence is the Then we see the sequence is exact at V. And if, in addition, this map is an inclusion, and if W is isomorphic to V quotient by U, then we see this sequence is a short exact sequence. And in this case, we have that the dimension of the space in the middle is the sum of the dimension on the left and on the right. On the left and on the right. So the idea is this. So now let's consider the sequence of graded A modules. Let's assume this sequence is an exact sequence. And this happens if and only if it gives the exact sequence in every homogeneous degree d piece. So every such So every such short exact sequence, such sequence of R linear spaces is a short exact sequence. Therefore, we know that the Hilbert function of the module in the middle is a sum of the Hilbert function on the left and on the right. So this property is called additivity. So Hilbert function has this property, this additivity property. Similarly, if we consider a long exact sequence, that is, this sequence is exact at every x sub i, then we have the alternating sum of the Hilbert function in this case is zero. Well, why do we want to do that? Because now we can construct some. We can construct some complicated things from simple objects because we already know that the Hilbert function of the ring itself is like this. This is we know. Then it is not difficult to compute Hilbert functions for free modules. Free modules are just a direct sum of ace with some degree shifts. The degree shift is like this. So if you take this shift, If you take this shift, it just means the degree d of this thing is a degree p plus d of a itself. So it is not difficult to compute the Hilbert function of such a thing. And free modules are just a number of such things. So you just sum them up. So we know the Hilbert function of free modules. And there is a fact that we can do something called free resolution to any finitely generated finite. finitely generated A module. That is, we have a sequence of F's. These F's are free modules. And this sequence is an exact sequence. We can always find such a sequence for a given M. Such a sequence is called a graded free resolution of M. So therefore, using the additivity property of the Hilbert functions, we can always obtain the Hilbert function of Obtain the Hilbert function of m from a graded free resolution. And this is Hilbert's own idea of computing Hilbert functions. We have even more good news. Given a set of generators of M, there is an algorithm finding a free resolution by computing synergies repeatedly. So there is an algorithm that guarantees we can find a free resolution. A free resolution according to a set of generators. So, the question is how to obtain a set of generators of this total spine space. Well, let's see an example. Let's start with the simplest example that the simplest complex has two triangles sharing one edge. And now, this module, this total spine space, is actually the kernel of Is actually the kernel of this map. So these two copies of A corresponds to the two triangles, the two phases. And this A over this something, this is actually the cofactor criterion. And this copy of A quotient by this cofactor criterion corresponds to the edge. And the map one minus one means that if you have means that if you have fg here, it maps to f minus g. So according to the cofactor criterion, if f minus g falls into this ideal, that is, if they are zero on this side, then it is a piecewise polynomial with C R continuity and it is inside this. Is inside this spine space. So we know that this total sprine space is actually the kernel of such a map. Therefore, by computing the CDG, we can find a set of generators of this total splice space. And again, you can see in this star of a vertex case. Vortex case, this total spline space is a kernel of such a map. Again, this four copies of A corresponds to the phases. And these four copies of A over the cofactor criterion ideal corresponds to the edges, to the four interior edges, because there is no cofactor criterion on the boundaries. Cofactor criterion on the boundaries. They are only on the interior edges. And the maps means that if you start from this face and you go to this face, then it is one minus one. So you take a subtract of this element here by this element here, and so on. So you go in a circle. So this is the map. Well, it looks like the matrices we saw in the two previous examples are the same as the top boundary map. In this case, because we are in the planar case, so it is a second boundary map in the relative complex of the simple actual complex. The relative complex of the simple actual complex is just a quotient of these two complexes. Where this chin complex is a chin complex constructed from the simplest complex delta, and similarly, this one is the chain complex constructed from the boundary. Well, a chain complex of A modules is a very similar notion. It is a sequence of graded A modules such that the image of, for example, Of, for example, this boundary map is inside the kernel of this boundary map. And that is true for OI. And note that an exact sequence can be viewed as a special case of chain complexes. Well, that is because in the case of exact sequence, we take the equality here. And then we define the whole. And then we define the homology of this chain complex to be the kernel of partial i over the image of partial i plus one. And note that the homology is also a chain complex if you take the zero maps at each step. And we have the alternating sum of the Hilbert function of the original. function of the original chain complex is the same as the alternating sum of the homology chain complex. So that's another good property of Hugler functions. Now let's introduce the Bellara-Schenk-Stillman complex. Let's start with Belarus complex. Start with Belarus complex. So, Belarus complex has this s to be the relative complex we have already seen with coefficients in A. So, originally, this relative complex was in integers, with integer coefficients. Now, we want the coefficients to be polynomials. And that is S and the ideal complex I. ideal complex i is a sub complex of of s so it looks like this if n equals 2 this i has only two non-zero terms this term corresponds to interior edges this notation is for interior edges and this term corresponds to interior vertices we're for this term For this term, I of tau, where tau is an interior edge. Well, actually, I should put integer here, but tau is an interior edge, and this is, you can see it is again the cofactor criterion. And I of v is actually also very similar to the cofactor criterion. And what is this p? This p is a set of all polynomials vanishing. All polynomials vanishing at v. So, I mean, it is also the cofactor criterion, actually. So this I encodes the cofactor criterion. So the spline complex Q is a quotient of this S over I. And one can define this QI for arbitrary dimensions similarly. Dimension similarly. Here we just show n equals two, but you can actually define it similarly over any over any n. Okay, so this is Bellara's theorem. In the planar case, assume delta has no pinch points. Then we know that the total spine space of this delta hat. This delta hat is a top homology, in this case H2 of Q. In fact, we know that Q is so the zeroth homology of Q is zero if delta is connected. And hence, because we have the good property of Hilbert function, we know that Hilbert function of H2 minus Hilbert function of H1 is the alternating sum. Is the alternating sum of Hilbert function of those Qs. And so the formula for the right-hand side is not very difficult to obtain because those ideals, the criterion ideals, the cofactor criterion ideals are very familiar with commutative algebras. We have a lot of ways to obtain these Hilbert functions. And now you know that this part, we already know this part. And so this part is actually the dimension of the spline space we care about. So this leaves only this part. We have to deal with this part. Well, so to prove Strong's conjecture, Bilara used rigidity results from Vitali to show that when r equals one and When r equals one, and delta is a generic triangulation, this term is just zero. So that's how Villara proved the Strong's conjecture. Well, however, for R is greater than one, this first homology need not vanish. So we cannot generalize Velara's result to Velara's result to r is greater than one with this complex. So in 1997, Schenken Stillman modified Valara's complex by replacing this term, this cofactor criterion with respect to a vertex with such an ideal. So instead of taking all the polynomials that vanish around that point, we take That point, we take the sum of i of tau, that is the sum of cofactor criterions along edges. So we call the modified complex BSS because this is Belarus and Stillman BSS. Note that BSS and Q agree at the top two terms. So their top homology are still the same. So in particular, we still have. Same. So, in particular, we still have that the total spline space is isomorphic to the top homology of BSS. And more, now we use this new BSS complex. We have the following results. We know that this total space is a free module if and only if each one of these is zero. Well, this means. Well, this means h1 of this complexity is zero at all degrees. And if this delta is homeomorphic to a disk, that is, if the genus is zero, then H1 of BSS equals zero for D greater, well, for D is very large, for D is very large. So it vanishes eventually. Vanishes eventually. And the Schumacher's formula holds for equality if and only if the H1 of BSS is zero at D. So you can actually use this criterion to say the bound of when the Shoemaker's formula holds for equality. Well, why is BSS complex so cool? Because it encodes different types of data of delta in different levels. Well, the combinatorial data is encoded by S because S is from the relative complex. And the local geometric data is encoded by J because you can see that J counts how many slopes of edges is around a vertex, and the global geometric data is counted. And the global geometric data is captured by the homology. Here's a remark that last year, Deepash and Nelly generalized the BSS complex to work over supersplice. So now this complex can be used to work over supersplice. Okay, so I think I almost, no, I still have time. Good, I still have time. Yeah, yeah. I still have time. Yeah, yeah. So, I want to introduce some computational things. So, all the computations, including free resolutions and BSS complex, is implemented in MyColli2. MyColli2 is a free software using a symbolic computation. So pure algebraic computation. And there is a package for splice called algebraic splice. Splice called algebraic spice. So we can start with a very simple case where we have two faces. This is a case for two faces. So to use this package, you have to load it. You can use needs package or load package. And this is the package name. So you have the package. And now, first of all, you input a polynomial ring A. This is a polynomial ring in three variables. This is a polynomial ring in three variables. We have the planar configuration, but we want to do the coning. So we have three variables here. And V is the set of vertices. This is the locations, coordinates of the vertices. So you can see that I input four vertices. And this F is a set of faces, in this case, triangles. Physics in this case, triangles. So we have two triangles and they share one edge, which is 0, 1. So 0 corresponds to this vertex, 1 corresponds to the second vertex in the set V. And S0 here is supposed to be the total spike space with R equals 0. So for this function, you have to input the have to input the set V, which is the location of vertices, and F the physics, and R is the smoothness. And I want the base ring to be A. You can omit the base ring of the base ring A, and then it will give you a default base ring. So we don't have to worry about this. And now you see that it returns something like this. This it is a it is in an image. This, what does this mean? This is supposed to be a matrix, and you should look at the columns. The first column corresponds to the global polynomials. You can see that one, one means one on one face and one on the other face. And you can multiply it with any polynomials. So, this is actually the global polynomial. And x0, this column. x 0 this column means that x on one face and zero on the other face so it is also continuous and then you can multiply it with any polynomial so it is that that is fine so this s0 space is generated by these two elements so they are the generators of this s0 so in the end it is that it's an a module end it is that it's an a module and it is a sub module of a2 so we can try another one with smoothness two so i use the same v and same f but i change the r to be two and it gives me the result that the global polynomial 11 is still zero and we have instead of x zero have instead of x 0, we have x cubed 0, and that makes sense because we require higher smoothness here. So also we can use this function to see a dimension table. Here I choose from degree 0 to degree 8 and I want to see the dimension table of this S2. And what is this? Well it looks like this. So on the top it gives you the degrees you want. You the degrees you want, and in the bottom, it is a dimension. And is it the same if I use the Hilbert function? So, this is the Hilbert function of S2 at degree 5. It gives me 27. And you can see that here it is 527. So, this is correct. And also, we can try the BSS complex. Well, it is a command spline complex, but spline complex. Spline complex, but spine complex in this case is actually BSS. So again, you input V, you input F, you input the smoothness and base rate, and it will give you a spline, sorry, a chain complex, a chain complex like this. And let's take homology of this chain complex. So we do this by using the command hh. This means to take This means to take homologies. So by taking homologies, you can see that H0 equals 0, H1 also equals 0, that makes sense, and H2 is isomorphic to A2. And it is a gradient module. If we want to take a closer look at the second homology, we just take HPSS, which is this thing, this is like at the second degree. At the second degree, then it gives this module, which is a free module in degrees 0 and 3. And this corresponds to the global polynomial, and this corresponds to the generator x cubed 0. Yeah, so I think everything here makes sense. Okay, so the conclusion is that the dimension counting problem. But the dimension counting problem on splines has an algebraic nature, which allows us to study it with commutative algebra and homological algebra. And from computational perspective, we can obtain the dimension of any spine space by free resolutions and BSS complexes. The algorithm has been implemented in the software Macaulay 2. Besides computation, BSS complex helps us to understand the Complex helps us to understand the theory better. Okay, so I think that's all. And thank you for your attention. And actually, I have some a little more examples. I'll show you if you if we have time. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, any questions? So you have questions or comments? Uh so you have questions or comments? One question on does software compute superspliance or not? The sol the package, the supply package, does it compute superspliance? I'm not sure, maybe. I think so. Because last time when Michael, yeah, I think so. Yeah, no, sorry, that one is not there, the one that's actually provided with Macaulay. I don't. I have a fork of it where I've implemented superstrines, but that's not for it. It's not part of the package. Okay, so, but I think last time when Michael talked to me, actually it was last year in Nashville. And I think he talked about something about silver spice. Maybe I was wrong. Yeah. I didn't check. Do you want to put that in the version that's? In the version that's part of McCollitu, along with some other things, that's a work in progress. But I get done in some other web page. I mean, the code is available. The code is available on my webpage. So it's not part of my call to put it in. You could get even there. But they should mean like H symbol or vertex info or also vertex. Also vertics and it can be cheaper also but okay more questions maybe I can ask you to see the other examples. Yes. Well maybe one short question. So in my colleague too, what is done behind is computing Sigis, correct? Yes. Yes. By Grubner basis or other means? By Grubben basis. But actually, to obtain just Hilbert functions, you do not really have to compute in free resolution. I mean, if you want to compute free resolution, that's fine with Michael 2. But if you only want the Hilbert function, there is an easier way of doing that by computing the tor functor. So that's the tool functor, the tool functor. The toll functor, the toll functor. So, you can use the Guzu complex to compute the toll functor, and that is less expensive. Okay. Okay. Then maybe you can show us the extra examples. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. Maybe we make I can make it larger. I want to make it larger. Sorry, let me stop. Okay, so right, so this first This first one was the one I showed just now. It is a two-phases case. And now we can maybe we click log also at Morgan Scott configuration. So let's start with loading the package. And then we input the polynomial ring. And then, well, the Mogens got configuration has one, two, three. Configuration has one, two, three, four, five, six, six vertices. And you can see that I choose the coordinates in a symmetric way. So to make it the Morgan scott, the symmetric Morgan scored. And this is the physics of the Morgan scott. It has seven physics, seven triangles. And this is the Morgan scot with smoothness r equals. With smoothness r equals one. This is the total splice space, ms1. And I want to take a look at the dimension table. So it's like this, the dimension table. I can also do a free resolution of this Morgan squad. This is a free resolution. You can see that this Morgan scored is not free because. Not free because you can see that it has two non-zero terms. So that means it is not free. And the spline complex of this guy is like this. Let's take a look at the homologies. So by the theorem of Schenken and Stillman, it says that if the first homology If the first homology of BSS is non-zero, then this MS1 is not free, right? Let's check it. Well, it is not zero. So it is a co-kernel of something, and it is not zero. So it coincides with the fact that this module is not free. And we can take a look at the dimension table. At the dimension table, also of this H1. This is the dimension table of the H1. You can see that it has one non-zero thing in degree two. Okay. And how about the dimension table of the second homology of PSS? Well, you can see it is the same as the dimension table of MS itself. Table of Ms itself. So that makes sense, right? Because we know that the second homology of this guy is actually the total spine space itself. Okay, then we can do a generic Mogensquot. That is a Mogensquot, but not symmetric. Okay, so I choose the vertices this way. It looks This way. It looks that it is not symmetric. It is. Well, I jiggled this vertex a little. And then this Morgan scored is this. I use p to mean prime, ms1 prime. And let's take a look at the dimension table this time. Well, it is like this. We can compare these two dimension tables. these two dimension tables um yeah so they are almost this almost the same except at degree two right degree two this dimension table gives seven and this dimension table gives six and if i do a free resolution to ms one prime what do i get well you will see this is uh Well, you will see this is a free module. Well, because it has only one term. It is free. And how about the BSS complex? Well, let's take a look at H1 of BSS. It is zero, and it is coincided with the fact that this module is free. Module is free. And how about the dimension table? Well, of course, it is zero, right? Yeah, so that's an additional example I want to see you. So you can play with this software like this. Yeah. Okay, that's how much I want to share with you. Yeah. And by the way, if you print these plane modules, how do they look like if you show them? This is very. This is very large. So I can see the good stuff. Yes. We want to see the nice stuff. Yes. Yes. Yeah, it is very long. Yeah. But still, still first column, you can see it is a global polynomial. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Is there more questions or comments? Not everybody knows what FS is. Can you draw the more install on the word? I'm between the people that I don't know what it is. You can do it. Let me draw that. It's a good idea. It's a good draw them. They have drawing it on the board. The Morgan Scott. The Morgan Scott. The Mogus Goddess. Remember how she said in the beginning that global geometry affects the dimension, not just the local geometry, and that's why Shane Prospin cannot actually give the right result because there's no global geometry here. So, this is an amazing example that has been known for a very long time. It's a very simple triangle. It's a very simple triangulation of with seven triangles, right? So what she called symmetric and non-symmetric, they both look exactly like this. So in other words, combinatorially, it's the same symbol complex if you don't look at the geometry. It's the exact same situation complex. But the semantic now, this is it, right? There are, as she said, there are six vertices. There are, as she said, there are six vertices you can count and seven triangles, right? So, in both cases, this is the same configuration. So, what makes it, we call it symmetric. So, what makes it symmetric versus not symmetric is the following, which is not in the partition, right? I'm going to draw, take this vertex connected with this, and I'm going to draw the line. I'm going to make a dashed line, right? And I do this for all three. And if these three lines are concurrent, in other words, if they intersect. Concurrent, in other words, if they intersect at one point, this configuration is what she called symmetric configuration, and generically, of course, they don't. So the dimension goes up in the symmetric case or as we write this here, right? So this dimension is seven in the symmetric case and six in the generic case. And the dependencies, of course, it's a global. Dependency is, of course, it's a global property of the ventilation. It's not related to any vertex in particular. It's a global thing. This is also told for as, correct me if I'm wrong, guys. I think it's 2R and R, right? Yeah. So you can generalize it to 4 and 2, for example, and so on. There are very many ways to prove it. There are several papers, and they look at it from different standpoints, including algebraic geometry, ends points, whatever. ends, points, whatever. So, but that's one of those. And there are many other examples when things like that happen. There's also software by Peter Outfield, who was invited to come to this. Maybe this is one of the things we should show everybody, and that is Alfield's software at some point. You can play with these triangulations there. Moreover, I think you can take geometry from Alfeld's outlet where you can see the geometry and import it into Macaulay. Important into Macaulay, they can communicate that. Maybe it could be also interested to mention that all the machinery that you mentioned and also this kind of phenomena also happens in the different situations, which are the images. It's exactly the same. Well, not exactly, but it's a similar. We can show that exactly. Yeah, there is this. We can show that example where dimension jumps. I'm also saying also the homological part. And the homological part. Just you have to change the global degree. So we don't have any more speakers on homologies, could we? Because now we're not talking. Who else is going to talk about homologies? Nobody. It's a very sad situation, yeah. Well, working groups, right? So yeah, this is also those of denser products plans, with teeth plants. Also, tensor products, clients, critique clients, and this approach has been generalized. And we have an expert in the audience, that would be Nellie, right there in the back, who refused to give a talk. And then there's Tipich. And who else? Well, I mean, Carla has questions as well. So, how was gender as well? Yeah, gender as well. But we lost some of the main players in that field. Yeah, how long here? Bay Wei is long here. But thank you for the talk, Baywe. It was great. Thank you. Yeah, the one we have to say that maybe one or two. We should found that, but there it is. So, we don't need any more speakers. Oh, they wait there. Okay. Thank you, Mayway. Thanks, Maywa. Hope I could join next time. Thank you.
