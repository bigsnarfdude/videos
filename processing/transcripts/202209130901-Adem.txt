Is kind of a converse problem. So, so you know, yesterday we talked about given a group acting on a space, what are the restrictions that imposes on the group? So, what we're going to try to do is talk a little bit about how you might construct some actions of a particular group. And we'll see that the rank, of course, plays an important role, and then the two kind of points of view kind of meet. Of view kind of meet, you try to construct some minimal models on which a group might act freely. And you'll see that there's a lot of work remains to be done in this area. So I will start out now with talking about periodic cohomology. As we saw, that's a very nice situation from the point of view of cohomology groups, and it's also a nice situation from the more geometric point of view. So we'll start out with the basic result due to... out with the basic result due to Smith for 1940, which said that if a finite group G acts freely on a sphere, then all of its abelian subgroups are cyclic. And explicitly in terms of the group theory, that means that G does not contain any subgroup of the form Z mod P cross Z mod P for P A prime. So, and we mentioned last time that those have been classified. We know that the PCL subgroups are either cyclic or Subgroups are either cyclic or generalized quaternion. And there's a nice list of all those groups. So now examples of actions. Well, you can convince yourself that the cyclic group of order N acts freely on any odd-dimensional sphere. You can certainly see an action on the circle, and then if you take joins, you can see actions on higher spheres. So that's, of course, a good example to have. Good example to have. The second example is one which is very popular. Take the quaternion group of order 8. We can think of it as a subgroup of the 3-sphere. And any finite subgroup of a compact Lie group, of course, acts on the compact Lie group and freely. So Q8 acts freely on the 3-sphere. This is perhaps the first, the most basic example of a non-abelian group acting. It has a lot of interesting geometry. Acting has a lot of interesting geometry associated to it. Now, this is just a special case of a more general construction that has to do with representation theory. So if you have an orthogonal or unitary representation, then you can take the vectors of length one, and that is a sphere topologically, and g will be acting on it. On it. So, one of the classical problems was determining exactly when you get free actions on such spheres. So this is called linear free actions. So it's an important category where, of course, representation theory is connecting with topology in a very natural way. So there is a classification due to Wolf, and the result is a very beautiful result. It says that G acts freely It says that G acts freely on some representation sphere if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied. First, every subgroup of order PQ, where P and Q are prime in G is cyclic. And the second condition is that G does not contain SL2FP with P bigger than 5 as a subloop. So those are the conditions that arise. So you see then that these representations. Then, that these representation spheres are nice to have, but somewhat special. So, topology attempts to move beyond representation spheres, but using those as a model on certain subgroups, particularly on p groups. This is kind of the philosophy that permeates. Because we saw that for p groups, somehow the structure of the fixed point sets is homological and it's homotopical, if you want. So, that's kind of the. If you want, so that's kind of an underlying fact behind all these things. Okay, now the perhaps most striking geometric restriction is a result due to Milner, which says the following. In fact, this will apply to any manifold having the homology of a sphere. A finite group G acting freely on a sphere must have every element of order. Must have every element of order 2 in its center. So, what this tells us is: you know, if you have an involution, element of order 2, then it has to commute with every other element in the group. So, it's a very beautiful result because it directly connects a geometric condition, the fact that you're acting on a sphere, gives you a very nice, succinct algebraic condition on the group. Condition on the group. That's the kind of result we like. Certainly, the algebra topologists in this crowd, which I think is everybody, should appreciate that. Now, that means that, for example, if you look at the dihedral groups, D2P, D2P can be described as an extension where you have Z0P in the kernel and the element of order 2x by inverting. So there's an element of order. There's an LMR2 which is not central. So this group cannot act freely on any sphere. So we think about that for a bit, and it turns out that this condition is really more of a geometric condition than a homotopical condition. So here's where, now we have like three streams. There's the algebra, there's the geometry, and there's the homotopy theory. Somewhere homotopy sits between Somewhere homotopy sits between geometry and algebra. If you know something that works in algebra, then you might be able to construct a homotopical model, but you won't always be able to construct a geometric model. And there are some well-defined obstructions to promoting an action from action up to homotopy to an actual action on a sphere. And if you want, even further, a smooth action, actually on a smooth manifold. So that's kind of the game. So that's kind of the game that's played in the theory of group actions. So the basic result in the homotopy world was Juda Swan. He showed that a finite group acts freely on a finite complex homotopy equivalent to a sphere, some sphere, if and only if every abelian subgroup in GSC. So Smith's condition is necessary and sufficient. Condition is necessary and sufficient if you just want an action on a homotopy sphere. So, now from the point of view of algebra and so forth, this is of course closer and easier to understand than a Milner's condition over there. So, this is an indication that actions up to homotropy will be better behaved than the more geometric ones. Okay, now. Okay, now so there was a lot of work then in the 60s, 70s to try to characterize all finite groups that can act freely on a sphere, the so-called topological spherical space form problem. And the ingredient, important ingredient that was used was the theory of surgery, which we're not going to talk about here, but it's a series of methods and techniques. A series of methods and techniques that allow us to promote actions to manifolds, to actually geometric actions. And the very beautiful result is that, in fact, a finite group G will act freely and smoothly on some sphere if and only if all the abelian subgroups in G are cyclic and every evolution is central. So the Milner condition and the Smith condition, these together, are necessary and sufficient for a free smooth action on. For a free smooth action on some sphere. Now, I'm not saying what sphere, this is a different problem. If you give your group, well, we'll know the cohomology of the group is periodic, but knowing exactly what sphere they might be acting freely on is a different issue. And if I give you, say, the five-sphere and ask you which are the groups that act freely and smoothly on the five-sphere, again, this is a more subtle kind of question. Subtle kind of question. Now, there's an example. Here's a group of order 48. It's the semi-direct product, Q16, that's the quaternion group, quaternion group of order 16, where you have that element of order 8 acting non-trivially on Z mod 3, then this group has periodic homology at period 4, but does not act freely on any finite homo to be 3-sphere. So what we see then is. So what we see then if a finite group G acts freely on an n-sphere, one can only conclude that G has periodic homology of period dividing n plus one. I think I learned this example from Jim Davis, who was in the audience yesterday, might be here today. All right. So there's a whole... This is my thesis. Your thesis, there you go. Jim Davis's thesis. Thank you, Jim. And I direct the audience to Jim Davis for all questions about surgery. Davis for all questions about surgery. Oh, Ian Hamilton is there too, so you can also ask me. All right, so that's all right, that's kind of interesting, but let's say let's try to think of periodicity a little bit more generally, more from the point of view of homotopy theory, general homotopy theoretic and the bundle theoretic idea of periodicity. So we now zoom forward a few decades. Forward a few decades, to the early O's, I guess. And now I want to consider what it means for the cohomology of a space to be periodic, periodicity. And I hope commutative algebraists think about periodicity in their work, because it is a very interesting algebraic concept. So we will say, and this definition, And this definition, I guess Jeff Smith and I introduced it in our paper. It kind of builds on other previous forms of previously. So it says the following. Suppose you're given a topological space, connected topological space, let's say a CW complex. We'll say that the cohomology is periodic if we have integers r and s greater than zero and a cohomology class in HR of W with coefficients, trivial coefficients. trivial coefficients such that for any coefficient module M, cup product with alpha is an isomorphism, this is an isomorphism from H T of W with coefficients in M to H T plus R of W with coefficients in M for all T sufficiently large or bigger than or equal to S. So we're getting periodicity after a certain height, we're getting periodicity occurring there. So that's a So that's a notion of periodicity that we define. If you look at the core knowledge of a finite group, if you get periodicity sufficiently high, you have periodicity throughout. So finite groups are kind of special. So what we've been talking about is the periodicity of BG as a space. And in fact, periodicity with trivial coefficients is enough for periodicity. Triple coefficients is enough for periodicity with all coefficients for a finite group. And the characterization for BG is that it has periodic cohomology if and only if every abelian subgroup of G is cyclic. So now you can go to the realm, for once let's go to an infinite group. So we can look at a group of finite Of finite VCD, finite virtual cohomological dimension, something like an arithmetic group or something mapping class group, something like that. Then the classifying space has periodic cohomology if and only if every finite subgroup of gamma has periodic cohomology. And again, the principle there is that the cohomology of the high-dimensional cohomology of these groups depends on the lattice of finite subgroups. On the lattice of finite subgroups, and you can see that the periodicity of the finite subgroups gives rise to periodicity for the whole group. So that's the condition there. Now, one can talk about periodicity more abstractly, that the functors are isomorphic, you know, without talking about cup product. And one of the questions, I'm just throwing it in here because maybe somebody has an answer: is the abstract periodicity always induced by cup product? I've seen that. Production. I've seen that raised as a question. And certainly the topological situation, we haven't found any kind of counterexamples to that, but you know, it just would be interesting for me personally to know the answer to it. So sorry about that. So, okay, so now we've defined a notion of periodicity, and now which includes, it will include the periodicity, traditional periodicity for cohomology of finite groups. So now what we can So, now what we'd like is to have a topological characterization of this form of periodicity. So, I'm going to recall for you what is known there. So, it's a theorem new to myself and Jeff Smith, which characterizes spaces with a periodic homology. So, the result says the following. So, when you see periodic cohomology, if you want, think BG, a finite group with periodic cohomology. So, a connected CW complex X has periodic cohomology if and only if there exists an orientable spherical vibration. So, this means that the action of the fundamental group is trivial on the homology here, where E has the homotopy type of a finite dimensional complex. To be type of a finite dimensional complex. So this has periodic cohomology. Here you have a sphere, and what you have in the middle is finite-dimensional. So this might be infinite-dimensional. Typically, the interesting examples are infinite-dimensional. It will have cohomology in infinite number of degrees. But then by constructing, by looking at constructing this vibration, this sphere gives rise to a class in the Gives rise to a class in the cohomology of X through the spectral sequence, serial spectral sequence of this vibration. And then that gives you a way of wiping out all the high-dimensional stuff that occurs in a cohomology of X, leaving something which is finite dimensional. So that's kind of the, and of course in periodicity, the algebraists will know, well, you have this class which is like giving you these isomorphisms, so it's a the ring structure there is very The ring structure there is very, very well behaved, right? So there's a lot of strength in just looking at the powers of a particular periodicity class. So this is a so now you can consider the case when x is bg, as I said, and then what this is giving you really is a version of Swan's theorem. Going from finite dimensional to finite is something which topologists can take care of. Is something which topologists can take care of through some obstruction theory. But, however, in the theory of discrete groups, it gives you a result just to give an idea that there is a world outside of finite groups. And this query is actually, it was conjectured by Wall. It says a discrete group gamma acts freely and properly on some sphere across Euclidean space if and only if the group is countable and B gamma has. Countable and B gamma has periodic home. So and one of the for me interesting examples are these Burnside groups. They have these generators where all the elements have finite order and the exponent here has to be sufficiently large to get the periodic cohomology. And so this group acts freely on some sphere across structural space. So again, there's some very beautiful work about actions. Some very beautiful work about actions on spheres across Euclidean space. For that, we refer to Ian Hamilton, who was in the audience at least yesterday. So, we have a lot of experts around here. So, okay, so now, you say, well, what does this have to do with group actions on products and spheres is the question you might ask. So the question is, how can we get a space with periodic cohomology out of a finite group action? Okay, so let's think of this a little bit as a black box that we're going to apply to the question. Apply to the questions about group actions. Now, to study group actions in this generality, what we have to do then is consider actions up to homotopy. So as we said in the case of Swan theorem, we are looking at things up to homotopy. So it makes sense to try to formalize that from the point of view of homotopy group actions. So we're going to. So, we're going to give a little introduction to homotopy group actions. This theory I learned from Jasper Grodal. So, he's the resident expert, although he's thousands of miles away. And the idea here is that you can look at group actions in a much more general sense. And under the right conditions, you can actually recover a lot of the classical. Actually, recover a lot of the classical theory of group actions, even the co-homological theory, and then use that to construct actual group actions. And the full strength of this approach is really required in order to apply a homotopy theoretic result, such as that theorem with Jeff Smith. So, and a lot of interesting stuff in this area that deserves to be explored. So, let's fix X and X and generally X will be if you want a space which has a finitely generated homology you could assume it's a finite complex if you want but that's unnecessary and so then you have the following proposition the following sets are natural one-to-one correspondence and all defined homotopy G actions on a complex X here we're looking at homoto sorry Here we're looking at homotopy classes of maps from BG to B outX. Out X are the homotopy self-equivalences of X. It's kind of a quasi-classical object. The second, fiber homotopy equivalences, classes of vibrations. So remember from the Borel construction, we obtain a vibration just like this, where X is in the fiber, BG is in the fiber. Is in the base. So, and it's well known that if you have a map from Bg to B out X, it determines this and vice versa. So, this is sort of classical. Third one, G actions on spaces Z homotopy equivalent to X, where two spaces Z prime and Z double prime are deemed equivalent if there exists a zigzag of G equivariant maps here, which are homotopy equivalences. Which are homotopy equivalences. So we're looking at G spaces which are homotopy equivalent to X without the G. And then there's an equivalence class between these so that they can be compared. And the last one, G homotopy equivalence classes of actions on free G spaces, Z, homotopy equivalent to X. What's interesting about this theory is suppose you have a G. Is suppose you have a G-action on a space Z, then I can take Z and take the product with EG, and that space is homotopy equivalent to it, and we have a map which induces a homotopy equivalence. So we might as well assume all the actions are free. So in this theory, the isotropy is just going, you're forgetting about the isotropy group. So this is a more nuanced way of. Nuanced way of thinking about group actions. So, on the other hand, you do have these representatives, the Z, so we have some invariants that we can obtain and try to apply sort of the classical approach to try to understand what is going on there. So, we're going to try to say something about that. And again, I'm just giving you kind of the tip of the iceberg here. So, suppose you have a homotopy G-action. So, suppose you have a homotopy G-action on X in any G space Z, which realizes it. Then you can construct the Borel construction on Z. Now, these will all be homotopy equivalent. If you have that relation, which I mentioned before, these induce equivalences of Berl constructions. So, in fact, the homotopy type of this space is an Type of this space is an invariant of the homotopy action. So we're going to write it as xh sub g, the homotopy orbit space of the homotopy action. This being a commutative algebra crowd, I just am looking at the cohomology. Okay, but we apply the cohomology and say, well, well, that's an invariant of the homotopy action. So now we'd say, well, we can go back into cohomology groups. Into cohomology groups and say, gee, what can we say about that? What do we know in terms of our general theory? And how can we try to bring back some of the classical results due to Quillen, Borel, and others to this homotopy group actions setting? That's a kind of fascinating subject. So I'll just give you a few facts about that. So now you have this homotopy orbit space. So you have the same familiar spectral sequence. The same familiar spectral sequence, cohomology of PG with coefficients in the cohomology of X converted into this cohomology. And we have assumed that the cohomology of X is finitely generated. So we get a module which is finitely generated over the cohomology of BG. And as before, the cruel dimension ranges between zero and the P rank of the finite group G. So we get some number. So we get some number associated to reaction. So then you can define a notion of isotropy up to homotopy. So given a homotopy G action on X as above, then you'll say that a finite group G acts with H isotropy of P rank equal to N on X if the cruel dimension of this homotropy orbit space or equivalent homology is equal to N. Or a covariant homology is equal to n. So we're just thinking of this as a commuter algebra, whatever that cruel dimension is. And then we can say that the global isotropy rank for a homotopy action of G on X is defined as the maximum of the H isotropy ranks over all primes P dividing the order of the group. Again, we're talking about a finite group, so we have these distinguished primes, so we can put them all together. And this, of course, in the theory of group coordinates. And this, of course, in the theory of group homology with coefficients or not, there are ways of pasting together the local information to get a global. There's some versions of these theorems where you glue together different primes. There's a way of making statements about the thing over the integers in the end is what we topologists like to see. So far, we're just apply algebra and our intuition to these. Intuition to these homotopic actions. So there's something that we can play with. So then the question would be: what do these invariants give you in terms of the actions on the geometry? So here we're going to talk about the kind of the smallest ones, which are already kind of interesting. So suppose you're given a homotopy action. So the first one you can ask is, well, when is a homotopy action H-free, homotopy-free? Homotopy free. Well, homotopy free means that the cohomology of this Borel construction quits after a while. That's what it means. That just has to be zero after a while. So now if you look at the criteria given by Wall, this is in fact equivalent to G acting freely on a finite dimensional complex, homotopically equivalent to the action. So you can choose a finite dimensional representative for the homotopy. Representative for the homotopy action. This is special for finite groups. Again, the Wall's criteria is for general discrete groups, etc., etc., and somewhat more complicated. So this could be the homotopic reactions. And the next one, which is related to periodicity, that we talked about. And the result there is the following. The action has H isotropy rank equal to 1. If and only if Equal to 1 if and only if the cohomology of the homotopy orbit space is non-zero for infinitely many values of i greater than 0 and the homotopy orbit space has periodic cohomology. So periodicity in the sense of this, AS, for x equal to homotopy orbit space is precisely equivalent to h isotopy rank equal to 1. HI shall be ranked equal to 1. So we can allow to say that an action with each isotopy rank equal to 1 is a homotopy periodic action. I think that's what we called it, right, Jesper? So and now we can reformulate an application of the previous results that characterizes homotopy periodic actions. So this is like within this big framework, trying Within this big framework, trying to formalize this. And now you can imagine that the whole theory, well, I'll say that a little bit later, but direction that things can go in. So the theorem, this reformulation, is the following. Given a G-homotopy action on a connected complex X with a homology of X finitely generated, then the action is homotopy periodic if and only if there exists an orientable If and only if there exists an orientable spherical vibration over the homotopy orbit space where E is homotopy equivalent to a finite dimensional complex. It's a reformulation way of expressing it in terms of homotopy group actions. Now, okay, so once you have something finite dimensional and you go to universal covers and you apply a And you apply appropriate obstruction theory. There are certain invariants you have to take care of. Using the fact that it's a finite group, all these things can be taken care of. You get the following very beautiful corollary. Let X be a simply connected finite CW complex with a homotopy periodic G action. Then there exists a finite free GCW complex Y, which has the homotopy type of X cross Sn for some n bigger than 1. In other words, Than one. In other words, you can promote this to a fibration, which then splits by taking appropriate fiber joints and using the obstruction groups are finite. So I'm not saying what the n will be. But so now if you think about this in the case of, say, a point and a group with periodic homology, then you get Swan's theorem. It's the version coming from it. Theorem is the version coming from it. So now, so then the idea here is to, well, if I have a homotopy periodic action, then I could get an actual free action on a finite complex by taking a product with a sphere. So, hey, if I want to construct actions on a product of two spheres and I'm totally lost, what can I do? Well, I say, well, Do? Well, I say, well, if I construct a periodic, homotopy-periodic action, I guess a homotopy-periodic G-action, not a periodic homotopy G-action, well, I guess it's the same thing, on this sphere, then G will act freely on a finite complex which has a homotopy type of a product of two spheres. So this tells me that a homotopy periodic action on a sphere gives rise to a free action on a product of two spheres. So I have a new way of constructing actions now on a product. Way of constructing actions now on a product of two spheres. So if you go to the constructive version of the rank conjecture, constructing actions of groups of a given rank on a product of spheres, then I have a way of doing it, promoting from periodic to non-periodic. So, and as you will see, progress in that kind of constructive conjecture is very slow, rank by rank. Is very slow rank by rank. So, even understanding rank two groups is quite complicated, and that will be what we'll talk about in the next section. So, there were some unexpected complications that arose in the case of rank two groups. Now, when Jeff and I proved this theorem here, we went through the list of finite simple groups of rank two, and then we Two, and we constructed homotopy periodic actions for almost all of them. And the ones that we couldn't handle contained a particular subgroup. And it seemed like a coincidence or not, but it turned out that the obstruction to constructing homotopy periodic actions is really contained in that group. So there's a new type of restriction which is arising. Arising. So we're going to get to that. So let's go back now and say, okay, we have that technology. It's all loaded. The periodic homotopy gun is loaded. Now we can step back and look at the rank two groups. So we say if G acts on a complex X with isotropy that has periodic cohomology, then from Kuhlen's results, it's not hard to see that the action will be homotopy periodic. So that is quite explicit. If you look at the spectral sequence for the If you look at the spectral sequence for the cohomology, remember there's a spectral sequence involving the cohomology of the isotropy subgroups. If they're all periodic, then you can find a class in the cohomology of the group which achieves periodicity on all the isotropic subgroups simultaneously. So you can have a periodicity class for the equivariant cohomology. If you want to do it with equivariant tate cohomology, it's even nicer to do. So one, and in early days, that was the initial approach. Construct an action on a single sphere which has isotropy with periodic homology. Now, that turns out to be a hard question. I asked many of the experts from the 60s and 70s, well, for example, does the symmetric group on five letters act on a sphere with periodic isotropy? And it turns out that there are some rather complex restrictions. Rather complex restrictions which apply there. Well, little did we know, of course, because this thing we're going to talk about was aligned there as an obstruction. And there's been some nice work by Ian Hamilton, Ergon Yeltsin on that problem. So however, let's say the cases where we can find the solution. So for a rank 2p group, we could take a central subgroup. A central subgroup of order P, one always exists, and a faithful character. Induce it up and take that sphere. And then, if you look at the Mackie formula, when you restrict it back, you get copies of that character. So it's acting freely on that sphere. So the central element of order P will always act freely on that sphere. So if the group has ranked 2, then the isotropy has rank 2. Isotropy has rank at most one. So you have a canonically given, well, a nicely given sphere with rank one isotrope. So then that allows you to settle the problem for the two spheres for p groups. And you have the following theorem. A p group P does not contain Z P cubed as a subgroup if and only if it acts freely on a finite complex with a homotopy type of a product of two series. Some type of a product of two spheres. So that involves, that includes the proof that Zp cross Zp cross Zp does not act freely on a product of two spheres. That was proved by, I guess it was Heller who settled that one. So we have both sides. So it's a nice characterization for p-groups of that one. But you already see it used a little piece of technology that was a little bit different. So here we can get away with the periodic. So now there's another approach I just want to mention here because, given that people here are algebraists, you might wonder if any of these actions actually exist in nature. So it turns out that there are some geometric examples which arise out of representation theory, which are not just representation spheres. This is kind of like the generalization of the linear space forms. Of space forms. So I just kind of briefly just mention this. So consider G and Un. So then we saw that G acts freely in Un. However, it also acts on these homogeneous bases. And you can define the fixity as the smallest integer F such that G acts freely on these homogeneous bases. Fixity zero corresponds precisely to these spherical These spherical space forms because un minus 1 is a sphere. But there are many intermediate cases. So I'm just going to briefly recall some nice results, joint results with Jim Davis and Osgood Ulu, who I think is also in the audience. I think I saw him. Yeah. And so now this fixity one situation tells you that UN mod. Situation tells you that u n mod u n minus 2 has a 3 g action. On the other hand, we have a vibration. This is an equivalent map, and this is a sphere. So you have a spherical bundle over a sphere and a 3G action. So this is an example of what you saw in the theorem already given to you geometrically. And now what you have to split this, this can be split using bundle theory, and the result you get is that The result you get is that if G has fixed T1, that G acts smoothly and freely on S2n minus 1 cross S4n minus 5. These actions are very nice actions. So this is an example of things you get from nature. So for example, subgroups of U3 act freely on S5 cross S7, A5, SL3, F2, and the triple cover of A6 all appear there. So these are nice examples to know about. And okay, sorry about that. Now, for rank 2p groups, it's a little bit technical here. You can show that either they act 3D on a product of linear representations or p has a representation of fixed T1 in UP. And therefore, you get that a rank 2P group acts smoothly and freely on a product of two spheres. This was P greater than 3. I believe Osmoon has taken care of the case. Has taken care of the case p equals 2, also, I believe. So, this is a way, this uses a lot of group theory, the description of the finite p groups, rank 2 p groups. So, and for fixity equal to 2, then you have an action on something which has periodic homotopy theory, periodic homotopy and looks like a product of two spheres, which is Of two spheres, which is this. So then you can always ensure that you can have a free action on a product of three spheres. Now it's a finite complex. We're not making a claim. So again, this playing the same game using those techniques. And finally, and the main result in that paper, again, using here the propagation techniques due to Jim Davis and I believe Schmel Weinberger and others, but Jim. Others, but Jim again is the expert. Suppose that g acts on u n, acting freely on u n mod u k. If the order of g is prime to n minus 1 factorial, then g acts freely, smoothly, logically, trivially on this product of spheres. Now this is interesting for an algebraist because, no, u n has the cohomology of a product of spheres, by the way. And un mod uk also has the cohomology of a product of spheres. Of product dispersion. So, how far is that action from an action on an actual product of spheres? And by assuming that the order of the group is prime to n minus 1 factorial, you can propagate that action to an action on an actual product of spheres. So that gives you an interplay between certain numbers that appear here to do with K-theory and the order of the group. And here's an example. And here's an example for those of you who know finite group p groups. Suppose you have a finite non-bedding p group with a simple center and having an abedium maximum subgroup. If the rank of p is r less than p, then there exists a free, smooth, and homologically trivial action of p on the product of r centers. So anyway, I don't want to dwell too much on this. These are part of the b theory, I call it, of group actions that exist in nature. Now we get the question: Does every rank two group act homotopily periodically on some sphere? Was the question, obviously, that we had after those results. And the answer is no. And in fact, we can give a complete description of how it goes wrong. So let QDP denote the semi-direct product of Zp cross Zp with the action of SL2P and And the following result tells us that this group does not give rise to a periodic action, even up to homotopy. And this result, due to Jesper, every homotopy action of QDP on a sphere X has rank 2H isotropy at the prime P. In other words, the equivalent cohomology will always have cruel dimension 2. So whatever you do with this group, you can You can never reduce the cruel dimension of the cohomology down from two to one, which is what you would need to get a homotopy periodic action. Now, this involves homotopy fixed points, the work of Dwyer Wilkerson and Anstee functor. And what is interesting here then, so this is the group that we picked up in our early calculations as being the problem. And it turns out that this is all that can go wrong if you want to construct homotopy. If you want to construct homotopy actions on spheres with periodic homology, so a little bit of group theory. Okay, this is non-commutative algebra, that's okay. So a subquotient of a group G is a factor group H mod K, where H and K are subgroups of G with K normal in H. A group L is said to be involved in G if L is isomorphic to a subquotient of G. In particular, for prime P, we say that L is P prime involved in G. we say that L is p prime in all the G if L is isomorphic to a subquotient h k of G where K has order relatively prime to P. And the genesis of this is that in homotopy, if you're doing things at a particular prime, things in the tail, which are at primes different from P, aren't going to play a role, right? Because these have local, you can do local considerations. And so we can obtain a complete character. A complete characterization of those finite groups that can act homotopy periodically on spheres. And the result is the following. Now, this builds on work in Michael Jackson's thesis, and I'm just stating it as Jasper and I know it. A finite group G admits a homotopy periodic action on some sphere if and only if the rank of G is less than or equal to 2, and Q dp is not P prime involved in G for any P greater than 2. For any p greater than 2. So there you go. An action, a periodicity question goes, focuses down to not having this particular group, a P prime involved in the group G. So you see how different it is from the other conditions. A lot of interesting group theory coming in and exotic kind of situations that are arising here. Okay. Um okay. Now the uh so that tells you all right okay you have a complete answer for the approach using periodicity It's not totally bad so all those QDPs have order divisible by two so for example this will imply that every odd order rank two group acts freely on a finite complex homotopy equivalent to product of two. Complex homotopy equivalence product of two series. So it's progress in the rank two case. And it is an open question whether or not QDP can act freely on a product of two spheres. I believe I gave this to Osgun as a problem when he was a student. So we're still waiting for an answer, Osgun. So any such action, you would not be able to. Any such action, you would not be able to project it onto a sphere because when you go from a product that's two spheres to one sphere, the cruel dimension goes down by one, right? So somehow it's like an irreducible new type of action that we'd have to see. So what we can mention here is that using the theory of p-compact groups, homotopy analog of compact Lie groups, and Jasper here is one of the experts, Natalia. Here is one of the experts, Natalia, also quite an expert. We can construct an exotic example for P equals 3. Qd3 acts freely on a finite-dimensional simply connected complex Z, such that the chromology is isomorphic to the cohomology of the product of S11 and S15 as an algebra, but which is not homotopy equivalent to S11 cross S15, because there is a cohomology operation collecting the 11 and the 15. So we have another question. So, we have another question for your problem session. Does every rank 2 finite group G act free in a finite-dimensional simply connected complex such that the cohomology of X is an exterior algebra on two all-dimensional generators? That would already be interesting to answer that. So, that exotic example, now going to a finite complex, there's some obstruction theory there that would have to be resolved. It's not totally clear. Resolve is not totally clear. Okay, so now we can try to thread together the two approaches. You'll see that they're related. So we want to go beyond the rank two case. We want to think big. So Rg is the rank of G, defined as the maximal rank of a P elementary V and subgroup G over all prime divisors P of the order of the group. Let's define the home. Let's define the homotopy rank of a finite group as a minimal k such that gx freely on a finite complex homotopy equivalent to a product of k spheres. All right, observation. Problem for the problem set. Every finite group acts really on some product of spheres. Go ahead and do that. So it's a well-defined number. Secondly, the Rand conjecture from lecture one is equivalent to a requirement that R of G be less than or equal to. Requirement that R of G be less than or equal to H of G. And now, let's go back to algebra. This is a commit of algebra meeting, after all, anthropology. So, there should be something that algebraists can say in this context. And it turns out they can give a complete answer. So, let me here sketch out a result due to Benson and Carlson. Let K be a field of characteristic P and consider a homogeneous system. P and consider a homogeneous system of parameters in the chromology of G, yeah, okay, that's commutative algebra, where the degree is ni. And Benson and Carlson proved the following. There exists a finite complex of projective K of G modules, projective, finite, think of that as a free G action on a finite complex with a cohomology of C on exterior algebra on generators of degree ni minus 1. Think product of C. Think product of spheres, and there's a spectral sequence with E2 term, the cohomology of G, tensor, exterior algebra on those classes, which converges to the cohomology of HOM, KG, CK, think every cohomology. And this satisfies Poincaré duality in this formal dimension. And in this spectral sequence, we have that these generators, oh, this I. Uh, these generators, oh, this i transgress to this, the xi, and if the cohomology of g is cohemacauli, in other words, free and finitely generated over this polynomial sub-algebra, then the cohomology of this function, this Holmes space, equivariant cohomology, is isomorphic to the cohomology of G, modularly ideal generated by those classes. Classes. So, gee, that's a nice result, right? Because it says if you could do this in topology, wow, what would be very, very nice, right? If you could do this with a construct and action or product of spheres where all this happen. But of course, we know that there are many extractions, and we mentioned it in the other exotic example because of cohomology operations and homoto-theoreic things that make this much more complicated. So, this is a ground zero for trying to construct actions on products of spheres. Actions on products of spheres. Now, here's a geometric example. Are we running out of time? Maybe. Okay, a few more slides. Here's a geometric example of this kind of phenomenon, which kind of inspires it. So suppose you have a p group with center z. And for each factor in z, you can choose a faithful linear character that extends your representation of z. So we're doing it for each of these factors. And let's take these induced representations and consider the spheres associated. And consider the spheres associated to it. So there's an action, diagonal action, on this product of spheres, the product of equidimensional spheres. Now the center Z will act freely on X because by construction we made these somands act freely individually here. So and by that same restriction, induction restriction argument I mentioned, they will be acting freely. And you can look at the spectral sequence and echo vanquology. This is a result due to DuFlow. This is a result due to Duflow, and it shows the following. In the multi-spectral sequence for the p-action on X, the generators transgress to a regular sequence in a cohomology, and you can write the cohomology of the Borel construction as a cohomology of P module of these generators. So this is a very nice situation. And of course, no one's saying that that's finite dimensional. There could be all the other stuff which remains that you divide out by this regular sequence. This regular sequence. And we make the following observations. If every element of order p is central, then the ranks agree. R of p is equal to r of c equals p, and that yields a free p action on a product of spheres with the cohomology of the orbit space equal to the cohomology of p modulo, oh just one bar here, modulo this idea. A very, very nice. And the top class, which And the top class, which occurs there, has some very, very nice, very interesting properties. You can apply the theorem. In this case, you can apply our previous theorem to construct an action product with a sphere. And notice that this argument shows that the depth of the chromology of the group is greater than equal to the rank of the group, of the century. So that's a very foundational result in the cohomology of finite group. Result in the cohomology of finite groups. So, okay, so using Gluin arguments, Benson and Carlson were able to construct a projective ZG complex that has a cohomology of products of R of G spheres, leading them to conjecture that every group of rank K acts freely on a product of K spheres. So that was conjectured by Benson and Carlson. Every group of rank K acts freely on a product of K-spheres. It's a good conjecture. Well, I think maybe you need to be an algebraist to make a conjecture like that, probably. But it has stood the test of time. And now you can say more generally, conjecture for a finite group G, well, R of G is equal H of G. That's what we're basically saying. We know that R of G is equal to 1 if and only if H of G is equal to 1. H of g is equal to 1. This corresponds to groups with predator homology. We have also seen that if g is a finite group with R of G equal to 2, then H of G is equal to 2 if Q D P is not P prime involved in G for any P greater than 2. So remember then that any rank 2 group that does not, where Q D P is not P prime involved, will act freely on a product of two spheres, and we know it cannot act freely on a single sphere. Indeed, if G is a group of odd order, then R of G is equal to 2 if and only if H of G is equal to 2. So, and this is more or less as far as we go in terms of this conjecture. And again, it would be great to find a rank 2 group that does not act freely on a product of two spheres. I don't know. So, a lot of work to be done in the problem sessions. Now, of course, you would probably want to be. You would probably want to be state these things in terms of finite dimensional complexes instead of finite complexes. That sounds like a subtlety, but there are potential issues there that we saw in that exotic example. So in the language of homotopy actions, we say, does every finite group G of rank equal to N act H freely on the product of n-spheres? That's how you say it in that realm. That realm. Now, if you're motivated by the periodic case and the exotic example constructed for QD3, we can pose this sort of structural question. So this is the structural question where commutative algebra meets topology. So suppose you have a connected CW complex X. And you might ask, under what conditions on the cohomology of X does there exist a vibration? Does there exist a fibration like this, where the fiber has the cohomology or the homotopy type of a product of our spheres, and E is homotopy equivalent to a finite dimensional complex. So this is kind of at the core of what we're talking about. On the base, you have some algebra, polynomial type, and then in the fiber exterior classes that in the spectrum. Classes that in the spectral sequence manage to kill off things and give you something finite-dimensional. This is sort of the way we'd like to see it. Now, if x has periodic homology, that was precisely the condition that it is characterized using f to be a sphere. So we might say, well, what condition can we give on the cohomology of x to get to build? Get to build more parameters. So, for example, what if the cohomology of x is, say, coherence over some polynomial ring? That should help because then you'd have this regular sequence and you'd have some better hold of the homological algebra. Is there a higher level definition of periodicity for the spaces X, which can lead to this possible characterization? And so, anyway, that's a question. So, anyway, that's a question for which I have no good answers. And I mean, it's a good place to stop. Thank you very much. Are there any questions from the online participants? Are there any questions from the participants in the room? You kind of talked about this. This is James Cameron, by the way. You kind of talked about this a bit, but I mean, would you have a guess for what the condition of like on the Comal Evac should be? Like if it was Cohen Macaulay and had curl dimension? Yeah, at the very least, you would. Yeah, at the very least you want crude mention R. Throw in Coin-Macaulay, it makes it uh easier, but uh I think you'll need something stronger than that. Uh I mean the purely homological arguments in the spectral sequence it gets quite complicated. So I don't know exactly what it will be, but certainly throw the book at it and then see how much you need to be able to ensure that existence. So those certainly would be important. Well, I have one question. Could you say something about this exotic example? Well, what you want me to say that's deep in the compact territory. Yeah, there's a like a it kind of sits inside. This comes from DI, what's it called? DI2, that's the one we called. DI2, it comes from. The DI2, it contradicts an invariant guy, D Di2. So, because you see the SL2 invariants, right, attached to that. So, that's how you can construct, you construct the homotopy action. And again, I didn't labor this, but the here, this B out, B G to B out X, what this allows you is to kind of break things up locally and construct things one prime at a time and glue them together. Prime at a time and glue them together. This all will appear in a forthcoming paper. Okay, yeah, looking forward. Okay. Questions? Let's thank Alexandra for her collection. Thank you. And I'll be sending the slides in. Alejandro, does your slides also?
