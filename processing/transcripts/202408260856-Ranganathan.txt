Here we're watching my back screen and see it. Good, that looks like that's not everywhere. Looks great. All right. Oh, in fact, I can even see my own screen. That's confusing. All right. So, sorry, would you like me to start or wait the three minutes? And either is time or can be. Oh, maybe we should. Oh, that's a good point. Okay. Because there might be people sort of rolling in. Because there might be people sort of rolling in. Okay, that's great. It's three minutes. Yeah, good point. Actually, given the number of people who didn't raise their hand, probably a lot of the veterans were like, I'm going to skip the 15-minute introduction to birds. So I think we probably will have people coming in a few minutes. So let's give it a few minutes.   Do you look right on anything to tell? Yeah, but people just   Okay, so the first speaker is Dhruv Ronakram from Cambridge. And the title is Frontovs. Thank you. Yeah, great. Thank you. So thanks to Balash, Jim, Kirsten and Muraf for the invitation. I was really looking forward to coming in person. So I was actually in Burs about a year ago. Actually, in Burs about a year ago and for the first time, and that was just totally magical. And yeah, I'm sorry I can't be there in person, but I'm looking forward to chatting with people during the week, hopefully when we get a chance. So my goal today is to just discuss some aspects of enumerative geometry. And as the first speaker, maybe just to get us talking. And the aspects that I'll discuss are close to my heart. Close to my heart. So that will reveal a certain bias. But hopefully, I've tried my best to touch upon some aspects of work that other people do. And so hopefully it'll prove useful. I should apologize that there will be a lot of spaces in the talk, but we have until Friday to get beyond the spaces. So, okay. So Ah, goodness. Yeah, okay. So, so, um, all right, so, so, I'd like to start with just a smooth projective manifold. And as a pedestrian, I'll work over the complex numbers today. And basically, the points of view I'd like to take. So, I'll use Gromoff-Witten theory as the point of view to tell this subject. And from my perspective, this is really about the interaction between sort of abstract, let's say, small. Between sort of abstract, let's say smooth curves on one hand and curves in X on the other hand. So for me, I'm really interested in this interaction between abstract curves and parametrized or embedded curves. And oh, sorry, my slides are a little bit messed up for some reason. So this interaction is captured by the moduli space of stable maps. So I'll just remind everyone what this gadget is. So it's some This gadget is. So it's some space, Mgnx beta, and it's the space of maps from nodal curves. So I'll allow my nodal curves to have n additional marked points, which are my little crosses over here, which are hopefully visible. And then I have a map from that curve into X. And I'm interested in basically the space of such maps. So it's just natural to fix the topological data. So for example, the genus of the curve, the arithmetic genus of the curve is something we want to fix. The curve is something we want to fix, and the curve class of the image, so the push forward of the fundamental class, I'll fix that to be beta. And then there's a stability condition that's usually thrown in, and I'm not going to say too much about that. So Gramo-Fuyden theory, at least, that part of enumerative geometry is sort of all about this object. So what can we say about this? This object. So it's a proper Dlee-Mumford stack. So that's a relatively straightforward consequence of the definitions. What's sort of more magical is, sorry, I'm just going to pause for a second. Yeah, okay. So what's a little bit more magical is that this object has something that maybe these days is called a derived smooth structure. So what that means in practice is that because of the nature of the deformation theory of curves inside Deformation theory of curves inside or maps from nodal curves to projective manifolds. The space comes with what you should think of to first approximation is a sort of canonical expression. So this space, although it's quite singular, and I'll say more about that in a second, it comes with a sort of canonical expression locally as an intersection of two smooth things, maybe Z1 and Z2, inside of a third smooth thing. Maybe we'll call it X. Okay, so it's not literally. X. Okay, so it's not literally true that there's such a canonical representation, but when we say that something is derived smooth or virtually smooth, certain artifacts of this presentation, certain consequences of what would come from such a presentation, they survive. So for example, if this was just a scheme and it was presented as an intersection of two smooth schemes inside of a third, then we all know we learned while growing up in algebra. learned while growing up in algebraic geometry that the structure sheaf of that object would just be the tensor product of those rings or those sheaves of rings. But if we had such a presentation, there would be more structure. So for example, because of the three smoothness hypotheses that I placed, one thing it means is that there is natural higher tors as well, rather than just the tensor product. And one of the consequences of being derived smooth is that additional structure, even though there's a Additional structure, even though there's not such a global presentation, that additional structure makes sense. So, these what would be higher TORs still exist and they can be calculated, and that's what manifests as what some people like to call the virtual structure shape. So, in this talk, I'll stick with cohomology or chow. And what that means here is that there's a manifestation of that derived smooth structure, which is this virtual fundamental class. So, this virtual fundamental class is So, this virtual fundamental class is a class in the homology of this moduli space. The star here is a single number, so it's not a mixed class. It's a pure class, and I know what star is. I'm just not writing it down. So it's basically what you're getting from a naive dimension estimate. And this virtual fundamental class is really sort of the key object in Gramov-Witten theory. So, in some sense, our entire pursuit in this subject is to just try and Pursuit in this subject is to just try and understand it a little better. And so, the moduli space of stable maps, well, I said that I want to think about it as an interaction, sort of something somehow capturing an interaction between any given x and mgn bar, or the space of curves. And that's sort of captured by this diagram over here. So, given a curve with a map to x, I can follow along my end points to get endpoints in x. So, I have an actual evaluation map to x to the n, but then also given a nodal curve. But then, also, given a nodal curve with a map to x, I can sort of stabilize it at least and remember the curve and maybe stabilize it to get a point of mgn bar. And sort of with the perspective that this is maybe one of the richest objects in algebraic geometry, so mgn bar x beta gives us access to the geometry of mgn bar through some specific knowledge of what x might be. So maybe the main player in Gromov-Witten theory are these Gromoff-Witten cycles. Witten theory are these Gromoff-Witten cycles. So basically, the objects that I get by pull-push operation. So I pick some cohomology class or some Chao class on X or X to the n, I pull it back. I intersect it with this virtual fundamental class, and then I push it down. And those objects, those Grammar-Witten cycles, are in some sense the fundamental objects in Gramov-Witten theory. And the primary goal is just to understand these classes. So, of course, it's worth saying that often, and it's very powerful to just focus on the case when Focus on the case when this is a degree zero class. So we just calculate the numbers, but I think understanding the classes all in one go is just a cleaner thing to do in general. Okay, so that's sort of the goal of the subject, so to speak. And so the question becomes, okay, you know, what is this object that is defined in this kind of complicated way? You know, it's never like you actually have local equations that would give you this structure. That would give you this structure, or almost never, you almost never have such equations. And so, how does one even access this object? And I think maybe as one starts to explore this, what you notice is that in some special cases, this object has really beautiful geometry. So, I think the one that, you know, if depending on what part of mathematics you're coming from to this conference, the one that I think you can get to know the best is the modulized. Think you can get to know the best is the moduli space of genus zero curves in projective space. So, so this is, as you might imagine, basically, you know, you can imagine mapping a P1 into a PR as basically giving a bunch of polynomials in one variable, essentially, or homogeneous polynomials. And because of that, at least a big chunk of this space is something you can really get your hands on. You can really imagine what it is, and you can write down essentially a global presentation of this. And we know lots about this. Presentation of this, and we know lots about this space. So, for example, we know its dimension, we know that it's connected, we know its cohomology, at least generators for its cohomology. So, this is really a very well-known space. And this allows for some progress. So, a lot of the early work in the subject, for example, having to do with the study of rational curves on hypersurfaces, really used this in a powerful way. And this certainly allows some progress, so I don't want to dismiss it. But this is a little misleading. But this is a little misleading. So, the raw geometry, so when I say raw geometry, I mean things like what is its dimension, is it connected, and that kind of thing. This is just plain hard. So, even for, let's say, x equals projective space, when the genus is positive, the questions about, you know, very big questions about the space of smooth genus G curves with a map to projective space is the subject of Berliner theory, which is a rich and accurate. Theory, which is a rich and active subject in which we certainly don't know everything, but we also, in some sense, never expect to know everything. It's just a sort of high complexity subject. And in general, Ravi Vaquiel proved this, what's called Murphy's law. I'll call it Vakil's law, which basically says that the local geometry of this moduli space, in fact, even for simple smooth projective manifolds X, is basically unconstrained. Is basically unconstrained. So we expect to see every singularity defined over Z appear at some point in one of these spaces. And that's a sort of daunting, you know, if our goal to understand the space of curves in X is going to be to understand the space of curves in its own right and then study the virtual class later, that's, you know, we're going to run into lots of difficulty here. Okay, so the lesson behind this is that the virtual class, the fact that we can study it, okay, we've been studying it. The fact that we can study it, okay, we've been studying it for decades now. The virtual class is your friend. So I think this is a lesson that I learned quite late in my life. But the virtual class is really, even though it's scary, it's easier. And so it provides some structure where there is no structure otherwise. So that's the first thing I want to mention. So this shadow of the derived structure is actually good for you. So then the question sort of becomes, how do we actually access this class? So it's a cohomology class on a space. Class, right? So it's a cohology class on a space, and okay, maybe we're going to hit it with something and then push it forward to the moduli space of curves. So the first technique really that engages with this virtual class in a serious way is equivariant geometry and Taurus localization theorems. So these are results that are classically due to Attia and BOT, and they've really been in the subject since the very beginning. So Grant-Witten theory, in some sense, has one paper that it stems from, which is Devich's enumeration of rational curves using Taurus actions, and there in the title is Taurus actions. So the setup is that if C star acts on a variety X, and let's say an interesting way, then rather than needing to know, for the purposes, I should say this, for the purposes of understanding the virtual class, rather than needing to know the fine geometry of this space on the right, the full space of stable maps. The full space of stable maps, it's essentially enough to understand the fixed locus. And that fixed locus is more likely to be something you can get your hands on. So let me just illustrate that by a simple instance. So let's just do a thought experiment. Let me think about mapping a nodal curve in orange or yellow, however it shows up on screen. Then, this nodal curve into P2. And let's just take a generic C-star action on the P2 and then sort of try to. On the P2, and then sort of try to, oh, no, okay. And then just try to think: okay, if I take a generic Taurus action, what's actually going to happen? And what are the spaces of maps that are likely to be fixed under the Taurus action? So very quickly, when you do this thought experiment, you'll realize that this is a remarkably strong constraint. So if I have a Taurus, you know, maybe I'll just take a generic Taurus NP2 or even the full C star squared, the dense torus NP2. The dense torus and P2, it's very difficult for a curve if it interacts with the sort of bulk of P2 in any interesting way whatsoever, you're going to be able to see that interaction and move it using the torus action. So for example, you know, if I have a curve that intersects the complement, so these are my, the three lines here are meant to be the coordinate lines. I'm a toric geometer in my heart, so I'll always draw that picture. So if my curve just even meets the complement of those three lines, then it's not going to be. Of those three lines, then it's not going to be Taurus fixed because whatever that point is, you can move it. So it basically is constrained to be on these three lines, but actually it goes further. So if you had a curve that maps onto a single P1, if that curve is ramified at all in an interesting way in the interiors, let's say in the middle of that P1 somewhere, again, that's going to be something that a C-star action can detect. And that's not going to be in your fixed locus. And so something that people noticed quite early on is that there is very few fixed low. Very few fixed loci or very few stable maps that are actually fixed by this torus action. And that again brings the complexity right down due to the ATABAT localization theorem or the virtual version proved by Tom Graeber and Rohol Anaripande. So this is a remarkable, absolutely remarkable technique. You imagine inventing this technique and suddenly you can do things that, well, okay, you can do things that you could never have imagined doing before. So you can write down four literally explicit. So, you can write down literally explicit formulas for all of those Gromoff-Witten classes when x is toric, when x is homogeneous. So, something like a Grassmannian or projector space. And that really sort of moves your subject along significantly. But something that was already noticed then is that if I give you, you know, at the beginning of this talk, X was a smooth projective variety, that's all. So, having a smooth projective variety admins. Having a smooth projective variety admit a torus action is basically a pretty low chance phenomenon. So to go beyond this toric and homogeneous case, one really has to say something more. So localization, very powerful tool, definitely still a key part of the subject, but limited in some broad sense. So the other tool, so in the abstract for this talk, I mentioned that there's this cliche in That there's this cliché in Gramo-Footing theory: that there's only two tools: there's degeneration and localization, and then there's cleverer versions of degeneration and localization, and that's basically. And so it's really the second part of that that I think that I'd like to focus on today, although localization will play some role in the background. So the first hint that degenerations, which I'll introduce Degenerations, which I'll introduce more formally in a moment. The first hint that they're important is that this virtual cycle is, in appropriate sense, insensitive to deformations of x. So if I take x and I slightly move the complex structure, so you can imagine, to be concrete, maybe I take x to be some hygieneous curve and then I move it until it's a hyper elliptic curve. So these can be really quite dramatic moves. The virtual The virtual class just doesn't change in an appropriate sense. You have to make sense of what that means, but I won't. But the virtual class is just constant. So, for the purposes of calculating invariance, if you just move that complex structure around, then you just no longer see the moduli space of stable maps, or at least its virtual class, only its virtual class, doesn't see that deformation at all. So, I mentioned the hyper elliptic example, the classic example that I Example. The classic example that everyone gives, but I think is worth keeping in mind, is the example of a K3 surface. So if you take a K3 surface, then there are deformations that maybe everyone knows, there are deformations at that K3 surface that are no longer algebraic. And so they contain no algebraic curves at all. And so in particular, the virtual class is just zero. And so that gives you some sense for whereas the spaces of stable maps are definitely not the same. Maps are definitely not the same. So that just gives you a sense for how strong this constraint really is. But in order to use it, you need something more dramatic. So we want not just deformations, but degenerations. So in some sense, limits of deformations. So this is one of the lessons that we've learned in the subject: a very powerful tool that is applicable for maybe almost all X or for some definition of almost is that you can. Some definition of almost is that you can degenerate x, right? So you can factor, if it's a hypersurface, you can factorize the polynomials after changing the coefficients. And so, you know, in my head, each, this, okay, so this is a pretend picture of a degeneration. I'll get to this three-letter acronym in a moment. So in my head, this base, you know, the space x is defined by the vanishing locus of some polynomial. Let's say it's a hypersurface in projector space. And then as this t parameter moves along, I'm just very As this t parameter moves along, I'm just varying the coefficients of that polynomial until when t equals zero, maybe the polynomial just factorizes into a product of linear terms, and I have a bunch of planes meeting or hyperplanes meeting. So that's the sort of picture you should have in mind for what an SNC for what a degeneration is. And again, already in that simple example, I hope that you can see that you've sort of gained something, right? High degree hypersurface in projective space. Maybe it's hard to imagine what it really says or what its geometry really is. Says, or what you know, what its geometry really is, but a bunch of planes is something even I can understand. So, um, sorry, was there a question? Yeah, yeah, sorry. Just yeah. Please do interrupt if you want something clarified. So, I want to say a word about this SNC degeneration. This is just the correct technical framework. So, in general, we're going to be studying. So in general, we're going to be studying families over. So this is always going to be, in my mind, A1, but okay, maybe some kind of curve B. I'm going to have a family X over it. And then the word SNC degeneration or the phrase SNC degeneration means something. So what it means is that the fancy X is a smooth space, B is a smooth curve, and there's a flat map, a flat and proper map from one to the other. But what the SNC part is that wherever over the critical fibers, so when the map is not smooth. When the map is not smooth, so when the map fails to be smooth, the pre-image is sort of a transverse union of hypersurface. Sorry, I shouldn't say sort of. It's a transverse union of smooth hypersurface in the total space. So that's what you keep in mind. And out of this, the sort of goal of this line of inquiry is to say, well, Gromoff-Witten theory here, quite difficult, but somehow Gromoff-Witten theory here on X naught should somehow break into the Grammo-Witten theory. Should somehow break into the Gramo-Witten theory of the individual pieces, and the individual pieces are things we like to call SNC pairs. So these are just smooth varieties, but we record in pink or whatever your favorite color is, the divisors where that Y, which is one of these people, meets the remaining component. So there's some kind of residual divisor left on Y, an artifact of how it's at in the degeneration. And we call that an SNC pair. So an SNC pair for me will just be a smooth variety with. Will just be a smooth variety with a finite union of smooth hypersurfaces meeting transversely. Okay, so that will be important. So, since the rest of the talk will sort of go off the rails, if this doesn't make sense, maybe I'll pause and ask if there are any questions here. So, you assume that the special fibers reduced then? Yeah, that's right. So, I'll assume the components are the components are smooth. Yeah, so special fiber is reduced, yeah. So special fibers reduced. Thanks. Okay. So our goal, the goal of this degeneration story, the story of degeneration, is to relate the Gromo-Fuenten theory of X to the Gromo-Footen theory of X0, and then eventually all the way to the Gromo-Footen theory of this pair. And I've not defined these latter two things. So when I say, because I'll say it a lot, when I say Gromoff-Witten theory, A lot. When I say Gromoff-Witten theory, I just mean this bunch of cycles that we've decided or I've asserted that I'm interested in. All right, so I've sort of given you the definitions for the leftmost one, and I want to move along to the next two. Okay, so this question and this circle of ideas is part of what you might call logarithmic enumerative geometry. So that's the subject that I want to introduce here. So let me start very basic with just where do you store this in your mind? So I'm going to introduce a bunch of moduli spaces with the word logarithmic in front. And the way you store it is that the logarithmic moduli space of stable maps is going to be the right moduli space of curves when you have x naught, which is singular, reducible union of smooth hypersurfaces. So when x naught is singular, or when you have a pair. Singular, or when you have a pair. Okay, so in both of these situations, it's a bad idea for reasons that I can explain later to just study the space of all maps from a nodal curve into X naught or the space of all maps from a nodal curve into Y, D. It's just, yeah, that's just not a good idea. In the case of X naught, the lack of smoothness of that space will have a knock-on effect, which is that the moduli space will no longer have that derived smoothness property I mentioned in the beginning. And in the YD case, it's because if I study curves inside Y. It's because if I study curves inside y, if I don't somehow frame the interaction with d, it's going to be hard for me to relate this thing on the right with the central fiber. Okay, so for those reasons, that's why it's the right one. I'm going to tell you what it is. So first on the non-degenerate locus. Okay, so I should say I'm going to focus on this YD case for the most part. Okay, so a smooth variety with a union of A smooth variety with a union of smooth hypersurfaces meeting transversely. It's just easier to say things, it's easier to get some intuition because there's not sort of a moving target. So I'll stick to that case. But basically, if you invented everything in that case, you would also invent everything in the other case. There's not a fundamental difference between the two. Okay, so this is going to be some kind of moduli space of maps from curves to y, d. y comma d. And at least on its non-degenerate locus, so the locus that we actually imagine, it's going to just involve something, it's very simple. It's just going to study maps from smooth curves to x, sorry, to y, but I'm going to fix the tangency order with d. Okay, so I'm going to fix some marked points on the domain. It's going to map to y. I'm going to fix all the discrete data, but in addition, I'm going to fix this tangency. So why exactly we fix the tangency is a very sort of interesting discussion. So I think Of interesting discussions. So, I think maybe the most one of the most interesting things in the development of relative Grammar-Witten theory or law Gromo-Witten theory was the understanding that you really need to fix this tangency, that the tangency is a fundamental part of the story. It's, yeah, there's many aspects of this that I'll have to omit, but I'm happy to talk about where this comes from with anyone who's interested later on. Okay, so that's all it is. It's just curves with a map to X together with some tangency data along D. And the theorem. And the theory, so I should say, when you fix tangency data, so if I study smooth curves with a map to y, or even nodal curves with a map to y, if I fix the tangency data, it's quite likely that I'm going to end up with something that's not compact. So fixing tangency, just from, you know, as we learn in high school, fixing tangency tends not to be a compact, yeah, it tends not to be a compact. Um, yeah, it tends not to be a compact condition. Um, all right, so our high school days are behind us. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, yeah, well, exactly. Yeah, absolutely. So, so maybe the simplest thing that could go wrong is that, let me pick it a slightly different color. So, so this curve, let's say, you know, let's say it's tangent in the way that the picture looks. In the way that the picture looks. So it has a sort of double tangency there, two transverse contacts, and then a double tangency here. So, what could easily happen is that you could take a limit where the entire curve, for example, falls in to one of the components. And now even the notion of tangency doesn't make sense, right? So tangency is a question about the order of vanishing of a function on a curve at some point. And so if the function is zero, then that order of vanishing is infinite. And so that's the simplest thing that can happen. And so that's the simplest thing that can happen. But other weird things could happen. This could interact with the way in which the curve breaks. So the curve can break in some way. And you can sort of have tangency from the two components interacting in complicated ways. So yeah, does that help? All right. Great. So it's sort of not my aim to give a complete introduction to, let's see what's going on here. That's right, I'm just trying. Sorry, I'm just trying to get this out of my way. Yeah, so it's not my goal to give a complete introduction to logarithmic enumerative geometry today. But I want to tell you a little bit about how you might go about interacting with the subject later on. So I'll just tell you a few pieces of the theory. So the first part of the theory is just what it outputs. So what the theory outputs are two moduli spaces, one for the Are two moduli spaces, one for the pair situation and one for the degeneration situation. So it outputs a space of stable maps to the central fiber that's well-behaved. And well-behaved for us means it has this virtual structure. And I'll tell you more about how good that virtual structure is later on. And then it provides a good compactification of the space of stable maps to Y with fixed tangency. So throughout, whenever I need to keep track additionally in addition to the G. track additionally in addition to the g and the n. If I also want to keep track of the tangency, I'm just going to pick capital lambda. I don't know why we just picked this notation and it seems to have stuck at some point. So capital Lambda includes the tangency information. So it's going to provide you with these moduli spaces and I am actually going to define exactly what they are, but you may not be satisfied at the end of that, but I will tell you what they are. Okay, so they'll come with these virtual structures. So let me explain what So, let me explain what it is in good situations. So, in good situations, it's just the closure of the space of maps that you know is actually in there. So, this probably no one can read this. This says geometrically tangent is what I meant to write there. So, there is a sort of obvious space, which is the one that I mentioned. So, maps from curve C to Y with a given tangency along D, a given curve class with fixed tangency orders and so on. So, I said that that's a non-compact space. That's a non-compact space. So, in very good situations, well, each of those also happens to be just a stable map to y. That's just true. And so, I can take the closure, right? So, in good situations, by good situations, I'll say more about this in a second. So, the intuition here should be what you should take out of this is that it's not unreasonable, right? The spaces, the extra spaces of maps that I'm throwing in are. Extra spaces of maps that I'm throwing in are at least close by to being actually tangent in good situations. There are limits of tangent maps. Okay? In general, there's a trick, which is that actually you do the same thing. So you pass to what we think of in the subject as the universal good situation. So let me say a word about that because it's just a neat trick and I thought it might be nice to share it. So here's the universal good situation. So suppose I So, suppose I've given you a smooth projective Y and a divisor D with K components, so D1 up to DK. So, that's the data I've given you. So, these are Cartier divisors. You can try to formulate by universal mapping properties if there is a best possible choice, namely a pair Y universal, D universal, such that any other Y D with these labeled components comes with a map to that guy. Maybe you ask for that map. comes with a map to that guy, maybe you ask for that map to be nice, flat or smooth or something. And that turns out to be a moduli problem. And if you're one of these people that work with Art and Statics all the time, you'll immediately know which moduli problem it is. It's the moduli moduli problem represented by the stack affine space to the dimension k, moduloites dens torus to the dimension k. Well, moduloites dens torus. So a k mod g m to the k is the universal example of a y d when you've labeled the components d1 up to dk. Components d1 up to dk. So the pair, the divisor, is oh, sorry, this is, I've written something wrong here. So, so what I meant, let me just fix this. So it's a BG oh that's okay. Okay. Ah, okay. I guess I want to say coordinate boundaries. So you get like a DGM along the dense open set in each coordinate. Yeah, yeah, sorry. It's the divisor. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Yeah, absolutely. So, so if k were one, then it would be indeed Bgm. And if K is bigger than one, you just take BGM times affine spaces and the other factors for each of the factors. Okay, so that's the universal good situation. And okay, so that's the universal pair. And then actually, the definition, once you take this point of view, is rather easy. So this space of logarithmic stable maps, this kind of central player in log enumerative geometry, is just Log in numerative geometry is just defined. Well, it's the closure in the universal good situation, and then it's defined by pullback in general. So, okay, maybe now you know why I was saying that you won't be happy with the definition. So, I have the space of maps from curves to AK mod gm to the k. This is a perfectly reasonable object in algebraic geometry. It makes sense to ask for the naive geometrically tangent locus because a map to AK module. A map to a k mod gm to the k is a bunch of line bundles and a bunch of sections, and you can ask for the sections to be zeros to certain orders in certain places, and you can take the closure of that locus. So, I've really not done anything here. I've just taken this thing and I've just applied that in this universal situation. And then the rest is just by pullback. Okay, so this is totally formal. And so, when I say the definition is easy, so I just mean that it's just not, it's just, it's, it's not. It's just not, it's just not like a wild object, okay. Um, but okay, and probably many people have the complaint that when you define um something by closure, that's just another way of saying you have no idea what it is. Uh, and so where that's where the logarithmic in this comes in. So, so if you're just interested in definitions, this is a perfectly good definition. So, this is this gives you the space with its virtual class and proof compactness and all of that stuff. But the miracle, the reason that those of us, you know, Reason that those of us that work in the subject still care about log geometry is that log geometry gives you a context in which these two sort of pink problems on the left, that they're actually moduli problems. They actually represent some functor, but they don't represent a functor in the category of schemes. You have to work in log schemes, and that leads to a whole other theory. Okay, so it's not the context, you know, it's not the right conference for me to give that a lecture, but hopefully if you ever come across a time in your life where you think you might want to use A time in your life where you think you might want to use this, hopefully, this will be useful. Before you move on from that page, is there some reason why you don't have a bar over the lower M's and have changed the font a little bit? Are these actually applicable to the spaces? Yeah, so this is these are maps, just all maps from nodal curves, nodal VSG curves to AK mod gm to the k. To ak mod gm to the k. So in some sense, you have a bar, but you've gotten rid of the stability condition. Well, yeah, so it's a question of what you believe the bar is for. So I think the bar is for several things in this life. But one thing that the bars here are for is the stability condition. So the bar makes sure that you're proper. And we think of failure of properness as a lack of limits, but here this fails to be proper because it has too many. Here, this fails to be proper because it has too many limits. So, yeah, this is just some giant mapping stack. And I'm just using the fact that this is a closed on the left. And so, the fiber product is a closed inside of a proper. And so there's the, I don't need, I mean, this is just one of those things. You don't really need the properness on the target of this map. Even if you could formulate something, it wouldn't really change the answer. So you just need something big enough to accommodate this. Can I ask a question also? So do you see anything writing new about the existence of? That everybody knew about the existence of the virtual class of disclosure before knowing that it virtuous a module? Yeah, yeah, you do. So, this is a fact that I quite like. So, maybe the key point that I'll make is really here. So, this map here has an obstruction theory given by the cohomology, and this is maybe the surprising part. So, on the curve, so of course it's a value. Part so on the curve, so of course it's a vector bundle, etc. Um, of the pullback of the tangent bundle of y rel d, so the log tangent bundle of y rel d. So this is a sort of peculiar fact. So I'm saying that this vertical map, so what we're used to saying in Gromo-Witten theory is that if I map this to the stack of all nodal curves, that has a virtual fundamental clock. So, but in fact, this map also has a virtual fundamental. This map also has a virtual fundamental class, which is slightly bizarre. And it's actually, there's something strange about this. There's nothing logarithmic about the domain, and there's nothing logarithmic about the codomain. But nevertheless, the logarithmic tangent bundle makes an appearance because the map from y to the stack is, in some sense, that is what a logarithmic structure is. So then you're done because this. This locus is irreducible, and so then I have a Giesen pullback on the left. Can I ask a question? Please, yes. So can you describe this map on the right-hand side? The Y plus AK mod GM oh yeah, well yeah, can I describe it? Only by tautology. Yeah, so only by tautology. So so the so A1 mod G. So A1 mod gm, right? This represents a functor on schemes, right? And whatever, let's pretend it's all fine. Okay, shouldn't get yelled at. Shouldn't get yelled at on the first day. Let's do groupoids. So from schemes to groupoids, what does it do? It says, well, I have a scheme and I'll send it to line bundles, a collection of modulized line bundles and sections on the scheme. On the scheme, sorry, line bundle little s, maybe t on t. So that's a reasonable moduli problem, and it turns out to be represented by a1 mod gm to the n. And so what does it mean for me to give you a map from y to a k mod g m to the k? Well, I have to give you, well, k effective Cartier divisors, and they're d1 up to dk. So it's defined by tautology. Thanks. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Any other questions? Okay. So, oh, I'm going slower than I expected, so I'll try and move along. So how does one actually work with this space? Well, the key point about this space is that it's stratified. So there are, so the stratification is maybe the first place where we really see tropical geometry appearing. So this is a space, and it's stratified. So, this is a space, and it's stratified into locally closed pieces. And if my divisor has k components, the locally closed pieces can be understood in terms of relatively concrete data. So, I'm just going to give you a flavor because I think there are other tropical talks later in the week, and you'll hear more. So, a tropical curve, just for the purposes of today, is a metric graph. So, it's a graph. I'll have a picture next. So it's a graph that looks like something on the left. It has some notion of metrics, the edge length section. Some notion of maps, the edge lengths actually, the edges actually have lengths. And it has these legs kind of going off to infinity. And a tropical curve, let's say, in R positive to the K, so this K is this K, is just like a piecewise linear map from gamma to R positive to the K. That's literally all it is. And they're very concrete objects. So when K is equal to 2, I can draw it. And these objects, they have natural. These objects they have natural deformations. So, for example, I could kind of lengthen edges here. I can sort of imagine continuously deforming these graphs from just moving the edge lengths along. And that provides you with a notion of when two tropical curves are kind of close together, when they're deformation equivalent. And if you mod out by that deformation equivalence, you end up with a finite set of tropical curves. You end up with a finite set of tropical curves. It's just a bunch of graphs, basically, with some labelings. And that is the data structure that specifies the strata of the moduli space of logarithmic stable. So that's a bit of a mouthful, but let me just say that it's just some piecewise linear bookkeeping. But the book keeps track of quite a lot. So this keeps track, including, among other things, it keeps track of, you know, if I have a domain curve C. You know, if I have a domain curve C and it's mapping to Y, you can ask for every component of C, where does it go in Y? Which divisors is it contained in and not contained in? So that keeps track of which components mapped to which strata. It keeps track of the tangency orders of the map. So with the different divisors, or at least what they want to be, it keeps track of the topology of the domain, just like it does on the moduli space of stable curves and some other things. Again, leaving some stuff out, but Leaving some stuff out, but so the first place, so where is the relevance for tropical geometry in logarithmic and numerative geometry? The first place where you see its significance is that you have a space, it's naturally stratified essentially by topological types, and the data structure that controls those topological types is a tropical curve. Okay, so I have, I think, 20 minutes. So, what I'm going to do next is I have six little Six little items that we'll see. Well, I have only 20 minutes. I think I was planning on 30, but I'll get through as much as I can. And I'd like to just share kind of six different aspects in which this story talks to other stories in nearby enumeration of geometry. Okay, so I want to start with, in some sense, the most obvious, which is this degeneration package, which is the fulfillment of the goal that I set out to, that I set out. That I set out when motivating this whole story. So, I want to study the numerator of geometry of X using the pieces of a simple normal crossings degeneration. And we can do that. There's lots of names here. So, Junli worked this out in a simple case, basically for degenerations that are sort of one-dimensional in an appropriate sense. There is a lot of theory that was developed by Brahmavis Chen, Gross, and Siebert, both together and separately. And a part of this is. And a part of this is, the last part of it is in a paper of Devesh Malek and mine. And then there's a whole other story in symplectic geometry that, you know, that slide is only so big. So there's lots of other people that have worked on this and made sort of striking contributions. Okay, so the generation package I always think of as having three pieces to it. So the first is that it says that this virtual class is reasonable. The virtual class that we defined here is a reasonable class. Defines here is a reasonable object in that the virtual class that we're after is actually just equal to this one. Okay, so that's the first thing. So it's something you can compute on the special fiber. So that's some kind of deformation invariance property. The second, this is sometimes called decomposition. So decomposition states that, well, the virtual class on the space of stable maps to the central fiber decomposes as a sum over these gammas are tropical maps. Okay. Maps. Okay. And again, just like in the pairs case when tropical curves were indexing strata sort of deep in the boundary or in the boundary, the gammas here are indexing kind of irreducible components of this virtually. So if there was no virtual involved, so if you ignore all the derived stuff or pretend it wasn't there, this would just be saying that, well, your space decomposes into a bunch of irreducible components indexed by these graphs. So just that. These graphs. So just that. And finally, there's the final degeneration formula, which says that for each one of these constituent pieces, m gamma, I'm going to say more about this in a second, you can reconstruct the m gammas, these pieces that you're interested in, from the virtual classes of the spaces of stable maps to the individual components of the special fiber. So this star operation, this is meant to be schematic, the star operation is kind of The star operation is kind of complicated. And I want to zoom in on some of the ways it is complicated in later on. But roughly speaking, okay, let me tell you how it works. So the idea is that you start off with some curve in X, and you take this degeneration. So this is like the image of a stable map, maybe, and you just specialize this green curve. And when you do so, it'll break in some potentially interesting way. Way. So it'll break. Maybe this is the way in which it breaks. And if it breaks in this way, you can kind of see the degeneration formula. It's not so hard to see. What it's saying is that, well, you can glue up the limits of curves that come from X, you can glue them up from curves inside the individual components with sort of matching conditions along the intersection, which are sort of provided by diagonal cohomology classes. Oncology classes coming from this evaluation space. So that's roughly what it's saying. And at a virtual level, this is literally true, right? So each gamma, that's sort of fixing the topological distribution. Maybe if I had some genus 2 curve here, maybe one genus goes here and one genus goes here, and then there's a rational curve connecting them here. So that's part of the data of the tropical curve. But crucially, it also keeps track of the tangency. Right, what is the delta xcon? Delta, what's the delta of xcon here? Ah, yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry. The um, the um um right, so this is the dual, uh, this is the dual dual complex of X naught, which is just a simplicial complex whose vertices are the irreducible components, the edges are the pairwise intersections, the faces are the triple component intersections, and so on. So it's some gadget that it makes. So it's some gadget that it makes sense to map a tropical curve into, a graph into. So in good situations, so I just want you to have in mind why this ends up helping you at all. So in good situations, the curve class, the beta, the G, and such and such, they split across the components of the special fiber. So maybe you're interested in some hygienous curve to begin with, but you degenerate the curve. And now maybe the individual components are all going to be rational curves, and you can try to use other techniques to solve them. To solve them. And maybe the last thing I'll say is that this last step, this looking across the components, this is maybe the key part of all of it. It's quite subtle, right? So this is, you know, it took us about 20 years from the moment Jun Li wrote his first paper to get to the formula, maybe 25 years almost. And that last bit is where all the subtlety happened. But maybe the nice thing about it is that this provides a strategy to calculate the Gromo-Fuynen invariance of almost any x, right? So you take an x. Almost any x, right? So you take an x, you try and stick it in projector space in some way, and you try to degenerate it. Maybe you take a limit of a torus action, you run a semi-stable reduction theorem. Hopefully, and at least it's reasonable to hope for this, maybe it breaks into a bunch of pieces that you can understand. So that at least in principle should solve the Gromo-Fuenten theory of almost any X if you could just keep running it. So it's quite a powerful tool. The second aspect I want to touch on is how this talks to tropical geometry. How this talks to tropical geometry in the way that maybe it'll be discussed later this week. So, there are a few different aspects of this degeneration formula. So, there's these individual curve contributions, so individual tropical curve contributions, and then there are these vertex multiplicities, which come in the last step. So, in some situations, and it happens much more than you could sort of ever hope for when you begin. For when you begin, these vertex contributions become essentially combinatory. So, this is really what's going on in these sort of remarkable papers of Mikalkin from 20 years ago and Nishinu Siebert around the same time. So, these lead to tropical correspondence theorems. And I want to show you how that goes. So, let's say, for instance, you're interested in counting curves in P2, and you might set that up in the following way. So, you set it up using logarithmic Gromoff-Witten theory. You take your Y to be P2. You take your Y to be P2, and you take your D to be the toric boundary, the three lines. And you study degree D curves, let's say in Gina zero. Your goal is to say, okay, I'll add some marked points, and then I want to send them somewhere. And so if I add the right number of marked points, there's some magic number here, my 3D minus G plus 1, 3D, 3D minus 1 plus G. Yeah, 3D minus 1 plus G. If you set up this capital N correctly, all you're really after is calculating the degree of this. After is calculating the degree of this evaluation. And so, because it's just the degree of the map, you can calculate it in many places in many ways. And one thing you can do is degenerate P2 along its torque boundary. You replace P2 with some degeneration, and you specialize the endpoints to be, in some sense, very far from each other. So, for example, in components, in entirely different irreducible components of the degeneration. So, here's doing it in the simplest possible example. Simplest possible example. So let's say we were interested in five in conics through five points. So here's my cartoon of P2 on the left. And I can break P2. I can take a degeneration where P2 breaks into four components, a central P2, and then these three outer P2s. So the tropical geometers are very good at coming up with these kinds of degenerations. And what you find is that this conic, this conic over here, it This conic over here has to break in some pretty specific ways if it's also going to meet all of these point constraints in the special flyer. So, you can, so there are not so many options for what that conic could possibly specialize to. And then you can just bookkeep, you can come up with a clever tool for keeping track of these degenerations. So, the tool already exists for the degenerations themselves. So, this is, you use subdivisions. You use subdivisions of polytopes instead of polytopes, or use their duals in some sense. And then the other tool is tropical curves. So I'm not going to talk about exactly what the bookkeeping is, but this is what it looks like. So this is why, at least those of you who have spent time near tropical geometers, before too long, they'll draw some picture like this and say, ah, it's clear. So if you're one of those, if you've had the misfortune of chatting with one of those people, they'll draw some picture like this. So this is just a bookkeeping. Picture like this. So, this is just a bookkeeping tool for what could possibly happen here. All right. It turns out that in these Mikalkin, Nishinu-Ziebert cases, up to some combinatorial factor, all the vertex multiplicities are basically just counting lines in P2 through two points. So the vertex multiplicities come out to be one. And if you are very careful and skilled, you can turn this into a proof and this gives Mikalkin and the other correspondence theorems. So it's really calculating by some kind of extreme degeneration where first. Where curves are just forced by the nature of the incidence conditions to be very simple. Okay, so in my remaining, I have a few more to get through, but I'm not wedded to getting through. So please ask questions if you have any. Okay, so the third one that I want to discuss are a topic that I think has received a lot of attention, but maybe the link to Received a lot of attention, but maybe the link to this part of mathematics is less clear. So, which is the double ramification cycle. So, here's our strategy. We take an X, we generate it to an X naught, of pieces meeting. So, there is, in a meaningful sense, a deepest contribution of this theory. So, basically, what I mean by that, there are components that, you know, so we moved from just studying curves in X. From just studying curves in X to curves in some Y with some tangency along the torrent boundary. And these are ordered in some sense by complexity, roughly speaking, the interaction between their actual dimension and their tropical dimension. And there is a sort of end point in that, a deepest possible, a simplest possible contribution. And that happens when Y is a torque variety of some dimension and D is its full torque boundary. And D is its full torque boundary. So, in this case, the entire theory is governed by a particular cohomology class on the moduli space of curves that's called the double ramification cycle when y is just p1, and it's called the higher double ramification cycle when y has positive dimension. So this is a sort of remarkable class. So, the lambda is still keeping track of some kind of tangency, although I can be more precise in a moment. And it's a class of some predictable dimensions. So, algebraically, Predictable dimensions. So algebraically, it's in codimension R times G in Mgn bar, where R is the dimension of X. So it's codimension G. And this is a class that we have been studying for a long time, I think something like 15 years, and all of these people have been involved. So I think Yanda, Pandre Pandey, Pixton Zvankin wrote a remarkable paper in 2016 that really solves the one-dimensional case of this problem. And then we've just sort of been taking that and hammering away at it. And hammering away at it until we've basically got this full version down. Okay, so the basic question, just to convince you that this is not a kind of totally crazy or trivial pursuit, is just the following. Okay, so the name double ramification cycle does not convey this picture, but here's what it is. You imagine just having a family of nodal curves, or honestly, even curves, and you put a line, you take a family of line bundles on that family of nodal curves, right? So for every curb you attach. Of nodal curves, right? So for every curve, you attach a line bundle. So a simple way to do this might be you pick some marked points, and then you take, on every curve, you take a sum of AI times pi for that marked point. So that's all it is. And you can ask a kind of, I think, very basic question, which is, what is the, can you describe the locus on the base where this family of, where this, where the line model and the fibers becomes trivial? So you have for every point a C and an L, and you can ask for which points on the base. For which points on the base is that L trivial on that C, right? So, so that's a well-defined class. So, you know, if you ask questions like this about families of vector spaces, then you invent the theory of Chern classes. And if you ask questions like this for the moduli space of curves, you invent the tautological ring or you invent the double ramification cycle. So the answer is a cohomology class on S. And after 15 years of work, I'm not going to put it down, but there's some closed formula for this. Put it down, but there's some closed formula for this. So, what can you do with this formula just to give an application? So, the correct way in this context to package the lambda is the following. You take a r by n integer matrix with vanishing row sums, and this will give me the cycle. And so what you should imagine is that every row of my matrix is attaching a number to every marked point. And so, every row of my matrix is giving me a line bundle, right? Namely, sum of AIPI on whatever that. Sum of AIPI on whatever that curve is. And I can ask for the line bundle associated to every row to be trivial. That's a reasonable condition, hence the R times G codevention that came up earlier. So just to say, okay, you don't need to keep track of the bookkeeping, but I'll need it in a second. So there's a calculation just to emphasize that we do understand something about this. So for example, So, for example, when lambda is a 3x3 matrix, so a 3x3 matrix with vanishing row sum, so not invertible, it defines a class on mg3 that happens to be codimension 3g, right? So it's a codimension 3 class on a codimension 3 space. It should be a number, and that's the number. So it's just a completely explicit formula. This formula is due to Boriak and Rossi, but it's also in Pierre Bousseau's work, and there's other derivations of it. But so, what is But so, what is it? Up to some combinatorial factors, it's just this number delta. And this delta is the G C D of the 2 by 2 minors of the matrix lambda. Okay, so I just want to bring us back down to Earth. We can really calculate, I know we've gone beyond numbers and beyond spaces, but it's good from time to time to calculate something. So it's not for no reason that I've mentioned this. So when you sum over the genus, when you add up over all the genus, then you get Then you get a connection to this refined optical curve counting, and you should just find Pierre and get him to explain this to you later in the week. Okay, I have a few things to get through, but I'll say them quickly. So there's just been a paradigm that I thought I would share that as an interlude, which is that a lesson that we've learned in log and numerative geometry in the last maybe five years is that the basic formulas, in particular, Is that the basic formulas, in particular the two formulas that I've mentioned-the double ramification cycle and the degeneration formula-they don't seem to want to live in ordinary cohomology or ordinary intersection theory. And I think, you know, when I was thinking about giving this talk in person, I thought there would be lots of people there that I would want to ask about, ask their thoughts about this. So maybe I'll try and do that anyway online. But the setup of this new cohomology, this logarithmic homology theory, is kind of simple. So for SNC pairs, it's just the following. It's just the following. So, given an SNC pair X, so a variety with a bunch of divisors, I can blow up that variety, let's say it's this picture, I can blow up that variety at one of the strata, an intersection, a connected component of the intersection of some subset of the divisors, maybe it's that one in this example. And if you blow it up, you know, you introduce this exceptional, and you can just keep doing this, right? So now you have some more strata, and you can blow those up, and so on and so forth. Up and so on and so forth. And the cohomology algebras, of course, they just inject, right? These are injective ring homomorphisms in cohomology, and you can take the direct limit. So why would you want to do this? Well, the typical class that lives in this kind of space is where you start off with some cycle on X. So usually that would just give me a cohomology class. But if I take that cycle on X and I start pulling back, sorry, if I start taking strict transforms under the blow-ups, eventually those strict transforms will actually stabilize under pullback and define. Stabilize under pullback and define a class in this ring. So, for whatever reason, this is where the formulas in log-Gromoff-Witten theory want to live. They want to live in this sort of infinite-dimensional ring, or said differently, the naive formulas tend to be wrong by these strict transform correction terms. And we're just, I think we're just trying to understand. So, of course, the moduli space of curves is a great example to plug into this. It has a boundary divisor, so you can study the log homology of the moduli space. The log homology of the modulized basis of curves. So there's some ongoing work on this, and we understand at least some part of the story. And maybe I'll just end with a quick application, since I think I have a minute or two. So I'll bring us back to the beginning of the talk. So I just want to recall these Gromoff-Witten cycles. So in comology, these are defined by taking a class, pulling it back, capping with the verb, and then pushing it forward. So these are my These are my Gromoff-Witten cycles. So there's a really nice conjecture of Levine and Panaripande, I guess Mark is there, from maybe 2006, which says that these Gromoff-Witten cycles, they lie in a very small and predictable part of the cohomology of the moduli space of curves. So this is called a tautological subring. I won't define it now. But one thing that I want you to note is that it's very small. So for example, it avoids So, for example, it avoids all of the odd cohomology. It's actually entirely made up of algebraic cycles, but it's not even, it's kind of a small part of the algebraic cycles, and it's just a very tiny part of cohomology. And as an application of some of these degeneration techniques, Daveesh Malik and I have been able to prove this in sort of, I think, a reasonably large set of examples. So if X is any complete intersection in a toric variety or any complete intersection in a Any complete intersection in an abelian variety, we can prove this conjecture. And the proof is exactly by using all of the techniques that I've mentioned earlier. So you take your complete intersection, you factorize the polynomials until you make a nice degeneration into pieces. The pieces are somehow inductively smaller, so you control them by using, for example, DR cycles or localization techniques. The whole calculation is sort of organized by tropical geometry, and these insights from log homology have been crucial in getting. Insights from log homology have been crucial in getting those calculations right. So, yeah, you can ask me about my thoughts about whether this means all varieties or not, but we come to that later. So, this is an old question. A lot of people have worked on it. Some of the names are here. Okay, so I think that's a reasonable place to stop. I thought I'd just end by saying that, you know, there are other directions for this degeneration package that I think are potentially very interesting. So, there's things like So there's things like K-theoretic enhancements, but also in these tropical, refined tropical forest theorems that we'll hear about later in the week, these seem like steps towards understanding quadratic or motivic enhancements of the degeneration package. And there's also some connections to motivic integration coming from earlier work of Nikkei and others. So all of these look like exciting directions. I'm sad I'm not able to be there with everyone to talk about it, but With everyone to talk about it, but yeah, I hope you enjoy the week. This picture was from Banff last year, so yeah, I hope you have a nice time. We have time for questions, so any questions, I'll solve stops. I want to stop very quickly.
