Thank you. Okay, thanks for the introduction. First of all, thanks to the organizers for the invitation. Today I'm going to talk about a sharp well-posnet and spatial decay for a generalized curamoto-large track equation. This work is jointed with Professor Oscar Harin of Universidad de las Am√©ricas in Ecuador and In Ecuador, and go here. We have the all night of this talk. First of all, we introduce the model. After that, we talk about the well-ponet issues. And the next topic is talk about the decay properties of the solution of this equation. Finally, we talk about the optimal decay in spatial variables. Special in spatial variable. So here we have several interesting equations of the free dynamics. All these equations can be seen as particular case of the following theoretical equation. This equation is the main part of this talk. Here, U is the velocity of the fluid, and here U0 is an initial data. U0 is an initial atom belong to some sovereign space. This equation has the properties and dispersive and dissipative effect. The second term of this equation give the dispersive effect and the third term of this equation give the dispensative effect. Also, here D is an D is a pseudo-differential operator defined in Fourier variables like that, where the symbol m is a polynomial called interlake. Okay, that is our problem. So now we talk about the well-posnet, the local and global PostNet. And for that, we are interested to understand the role of alpha and beta. Of alpha and beta play with respect to well-posed net issues and the spatial decay properties of the solution. For this one, recur the equation in this and we consider the sovereign space HS. After that, we define the float map function is and here. Here, we are going to see the important role of the parameter alpha. So, our first result is this. If we suppose alpha more bigger as beta and alpha more bigger as seven-half, then our problem is local while positive in HS with S. S with is more bigger like as and minus alpha half. Moreover, the fluid map S is a C infinity function. The sketch of the proof is not too complicated. First of all, we describe the solution in the integral description because we are interested in the my solution of this problem. Of this problem. Here we have the kernel associate T alpha beta, which in Fourier variable is described on this expression. Here also we can see when the alpha is more big as beta, this quantity is negative at the high frequencies. And after that, And after that, we consider this Banag space where the norm has three parts. The first one is very useful to control the first nonlinear term of this equation. The second part of this norm is so useful to control the second nonlinearity term of this equation. Term of this equation, and the third part of this norm is so useful to control the third nonlinear term of this equation. Also, this equation is composed of the two weights in time variable. These terms are very useful to control the kernel and its derivative in solar space. Over the space. So, after with this, we can use the point fixed theorem. With that, we can show the local well posted. So, now our next question is to prove that our result is optimal with respect to Anders of the Soviet space. For this, we have the next result when S is. When s is smaller, like n minus alpha half. If consider if half in the same framework of the first result, and if we suppose this problem is local well posnet in H S when S is smaller as one minus alpha half. So Alpha half, so the float map associated is not an C2 function and zero. The sketch of the proof is again recall the function s. After that, we make the second derivative of the s at the point zero. And after that, we consider two. After that, we consider two initial data in HS, which depend of n and so big, such that his norm is equal to one. After that, we analyze, we make a computation in Fourier variable to have this inequality with that as one minus s minus. minus s minus alpha half is positive, so and the second derivative at zero is continuity, then we get this inequality. This inequality is a contradiction because here we have and is enough is big and in the same time is smaller like one. So here we have the the we have the the the and contradiction for have all result what happens in the case when the s equals to and minus alpha half that is an open question and after that we we continue it uh in the for the global goal postnet for that we need to analyze uh the non-linear Analyze the nonlinear term of this equation. So the first one, the first nonlinear term of this equation, is not too complicated for make and control in L2 norm of the solution. In the same way, the second nonlinear term is not too complicated, but have this result. But when made the computation respect to the third nonlinear term of this equation, term of this equation is not it's complicated to have and control of in l2 norm of the solution it's for that we need to make a an another condition for have the well well global well positive so in the framework of the first theorem and if we have this equality i mean minus two gamma minus two gamma two more gamma two equals to zero then our our problem is well is global well posited in each s what is the the the sketch of the proof is not too complicated we need to um we need to uh estimate with the energy estimates and with that we get this inequality and in our case the second All case the second term of this inequality in the right side is equal to zero. For that, okay, after that, we have and we can use the Roman voilema for take and control of the L2 norm of the solution. With that, we have the global workpost. But what happened when this quantity And when this quantity is not equal to zero, in this case, there is an open question. Maybe there is a blog up or not, but we have a blockout criterion for this case. So if we have a blockout in time finite, for this case, in L2 norm, if is in L2 norm if and or if this quantity is infinity. With all this, we have the first part of this talk. After that, we propose to some results about the decay properties of the solution of this equation. So here we can see the relevance of the parameter beta for this. Parameter beta for this kind of the result. So recall the integral expression about the solution of this problem. And here again, we have the kernel associate. And our gold is a study the point wise decay properties in spatial variable. Okay, so. Okay, so here is enough consider an initial data belong to H2. So our first result in this topic is the next, is the following. If we suppose alpha and beta are even, then if we consider an initial data belong to L2 and have this point. And have this point-wise side decay in spatial invariable space, then the solution associated with this initial data have this similar don't go say decade. Okay, the sketch of the proof is not too complicated. First of all, in this case, when the alpha and beta are even or kernel in full Or kernel in Fourier variable belong to short space. After that, we have a good prof field of the solution like that. And with all this, it's easy to get this result. Okay, what happens when alpha and beta are not even? So, in this case, we have the next result. If we consider an initial data belong to L2 and have this point-wise side, the gate, and if F is not even and alpha is not even, so the solution associated have this one-way side decate in variable space. And at the white side, when the V is even. V is even and alpha is not even, then the solution associate has this bandwise side decay. Okay, that is not too complicated for some comments about this last result. Here's all this constant involving. Is all the constant involving on this result strongly depends on the norm each one of the solution. What happened with the previous result? There is for certain equations have the average decay the result. For example, when we work on the equation, average shows set the equation Alvarez showed if the initial data have belonged to this L2 space with this weight then the solution associate have the belong at the same space and similar for the perturbed BO equation the Fonseca and collaborate showed a similar result and for E and for the Kuramoto Shaminsky Kuramoto Shaminsky, Eitan Tanmo showed a similar result. Okay, so now we need to talk about the optimal decay. For this one, we need to have an asymptotic profile of the solution. So here we have an asymptotic profile of the solution when beta is not even. Theta is not even. So, in this case, we have two terms. The first one is a multiplication, the kernel with one quantity, which depends of the average of the initial data and depends of the gamma tree. Gamma tree, remember, is the parameter of the third non-linear term of this. non-linear term of this equation and and error and function which pointwise ideas is like that and in in the other ways in the other case when the beta is even and alpha is not even so the asymptotic profile of the solution give it a similar but here the function r have another function r have another point wise i decided so this point wise i decate depends on the alpha here so with all this information is is possible to show the next optimal result with respect to penguin side the gate of the solution so here we suppose gamma tree not equal zero in this case Uh, zero in these cases, when alpha and beta are even, and we consider an initial data belong to L2 and have this decade, pointwise decade in its passable variable. So, the solution associates have the similar point decade, and this point decade is optimal. Is optimal. What happens when beta is not even? In this case, if we consider an initial data in L2 and have this Pangoisi decade, then the solution have this Pangoisi decade and this Panguai side decade is optimal. In the case when beta is even and alpha is not even, in this case, if In this case, if we consider an initial data belong to L2 and have this point-wise site decade, so in this case, the solution associates have this point-gravity site decade and this point-going site decade is optimal in this case. Okay, some comments about this result. First of all, First of all, if even if we consider an initial that very smooth, the point coefficient decay in variable, in space variable of the solution associate is the same. Okay? What happened when the parameter gamma 3 is equal to zero? In this case, we need to analyze the average. To analyze the average of the initial data. If the average of the initial data is different to zero, so we have the same result. But what happened when both quantities are equal to zero? In this case, we have the next persistent property. So we suppose here gamma tree equals zero and Gamma tree equals zero and the average of the initial data equals to zero. In this case, when beta is not even, we have persistence property. I mean, if we consider an initial data belong to L2 and have this pointwise side decay in spatiable variable, then the solution associated. The solution associates have the same point where say the gate in spatial variable. In the case when the beta is even and if we consider and initial data in S2 and have this panguite side decay, so the solution associate have the similar panguite side decay in specific. Pangoiside decay in its persecution bio. Okay, so here there is an open question about the optimality because here we don't have the point-wise side, the optimal decade for the solution because it's an open question. Our competition is not too good for give this answer. Give this answer. And what is the stage of this proof is make and control about the second derivative of the kernel and the first derivative of the kernel and after that, we use the point-wise ideas of the ignition data to have this control. Data for half this content with all this, we have our last result. Okay, thanks for the attention. Thank you. Do we have any questions? Yes, so. Yes. So in your equation, you have both the dissipation and the dispersion, right? Here, yeah, the second and third term, yes. Is the dispersion essential for your results? Sorry, can you repeat me, please, the question? Is the dispersion essential in your results? Okay, no. Here we go. I mean for the k properties. For the k properties, I have the it's very useful the the third term of this of this equation is the is the main part of this of this result because here there is an unplay between alpha and beta. So here this one when you make the kernel associated. Make the kernel associated in Fourier variable, we have this expression. With all this, we have here behavior between alpha and beta. That is the thing we need to prove the pointwise syndicate. So, you mean if you don't have that discrossing of path, the results will be the same? Sorry, yes. If your equation does not have the disposable part, the second part, the results are the same. I don't understand the question, sorry. If you consider the equation without the dispersion, okay. Without the dispersion, yeah, okay, dispersion, okay, I got it. Let me know when in this case. No, when in this case, in this case, I know if you consider this equation without this term, this perceived, the problem, the result is good, it's not the problem. What happened if you don't have this term, the third term? So, in this case, my first term is when you don't have the second term, is it a result? Is the result the same or not? Do you have a difference? Ah, no. So there is no difference? No, no, no, no difference. In any of your results? What? You have many results, but they are just the same without the discourser. I don't have this thing to very well. So you had many results. So you have many results, but if you don't have the second term, there is no difference. No, there's no difference. There's no difference. Are there any more questions or comments? Not let's thank the speaker again. And we are driving GPUs and it's only
