And the port. Um I hope I can give an overview of SUMUS dynamics and I hope you learn something or at least you keep something and I hope I don't make a complete mess and you get with less ideas than you had before I started talking. Let's see how it goes. So let me just start with some very basic notions. Some very basic notions, just mostly for notation. I'm sure that several of you have some sort of idea of this, but it's just general dynamics. Okay, and let me do it through the first very general definition, but then I will concentrate in a very specific type of situations. And even my idea is to go down to examples, very precise examples of smooth dynamics, which are some parallels. Most dynamics, which are some parallel of the type of things one wants to see new dynamics, one hopes to see. So, in general, you have G is a group, X is a space, and you act on the space. Letters they are called the guy, but you act the group, act on the space. Now they are starting to grow. So I'm eventually going to smooth dynamics. So this space will be a manifold or something very close to be a manifold. So the action typically I would want to be by diffeomorphisms. But of course for general definitions this is maybe a colossal space, maybe a measurable space and so on, or L space. So once again. So let me then just move and assume X is a topological space. And then once it's a topological space, one of the more most important objects of Most important objects of study of group actions, well, these are two guys, basically. So one is the orbit of the point, and I'll put the circuit G to make sure is the orbit of the whole group. So the sum of the Gx such that G comes to the group and Gx is just apply the holomorphism, say G to the group. Holomorphism, say, g to the point x in the group. And since this is to be in a topological space, it's very important what is this, or the closures. So one of the things one may pretend to try to do is to try to understand all these orbits closely. To try to understand all these orbit closures. When we would have this nice understanding, then one I come to say that's completely false as always. But that's completely false. Even if you know all these guys, it depends on how much you want to know about the guys. So I can have actions where this is these processes are always either finite or everything, but then you always want to know something. Then you always want to know something. Find the torpids. How are they? How many are they? How can you describe them? How many? You find them and do these types. So eventually, as I said, I will go to examples where these questions and these problems become more explicit. So, of course, one thing if you are moving in some general situation, one thing you can Situation: one thing you can always pretend to do is: okay, you take an orbit closure, this is a nice closed subset of your space. You can restrict your attention to this closed subset and just look at the dynamics in this closed subset. But this sometimes this idea is very useful, sometimes it's really disaster. But if X was a manifold, this closure may be a very bad set, and then you are losing the surrounding picture. Picture and even more, even though this is an orbit closure, it doesn't mean that if I take a point C inside here and I take the orbit of C, which will have to stay inside here, and I take the closure of this, this very often will be just a strict subset. And then not that knowing this set will imply knowing what happens for all the dynamics inside of the doshole inside, unless you have. Shows in the slide. Unless you have our first definition of minimal set C close set is called minimal if If it is minimal with respect to the inclusion relation, if it is minimal with respect to the inclusion relation, the fortress relation among closing variations and then it And then in this case, if you have such a minimal object, when you take a closure, this is a closing parenthesis, so it has to be a quite. That's why minimals are like smallest in this. Well, the first example. This is the group is and not ask me to really try to go to non-school groups, but more than half of the time for sure I will be on the integers. That's fine, no no. I I will try I still will try I still will try to go to marcina groups, but uh To marginal groups, but focus on C. So you get the integers, and let's say X is the circle in a space. And the transformation now, so this group action, C acting on the circle, we have a generator which is the bias. Which is the pi associated with the action of one. And in this particular example, you can look at the rotations. So if you get as the real small green integers, then this r alpha of x is x plus alpha of mod one. Not putting a plus z or a mod one. Not putting a plus z or a mod one just translation there. Given any algebra. Okay, so this is the best understood dynamics, and even this best understood dynamics is not so well understood. They are just rotations, but it's the ultimate. But it's the ultimate smooth and nice dynamic, so it's isometric, it's foreign just a translation. And still, you have that have two main possibilities. Alpha is rational, I will not put them on z, or alpha is not rational. So these are the two main different situations. And when alpha is rational, Rationalize P over Q, which means that when I do R alpha to the Q of X, what I get is X plus Q alpha, but this is X plus P and this is X. And now I will put the mod one plus mod P. So, I think that's the first thing that So this means I'm composing R alpha since I Q time, and when I do in this composition, I get that this is a fixed point and every point. So this is true for every point. So it's just a residual by angle. So if this were two pi, I should do two pi times alpha. Then you just put this by alpha. And then you just go alpha. This guy goes here, I go here, I go here. Here, I go here, and here, but then it doesn't close because alpha is not one over q, it's p over q, so it just keeps on going somewhere else until it closes. So it has p times around the circle before it closes. It has some combinatorics there, so which is determined by the p and the q. So the q, in a sense, is much nicerly determined. Uh determined by the fact that take any point, you iterate it two times, it comes to itself. But there is a P, which is also very important in this combinatorial picture. Okay, and then there is the other equation, alpha. Not rational, where this is impossible, just by the very simple. Possible, just by the very same reason this was true, you will get that r al to the power q can be different than x plus p for every state, unless we both are zero in each stage. Because if it were equal, then you will get n q alpha equals to p an alpha misty. Now, in this second case, I catch I, so when you draw I, you get that every orbit is dense. This is a nice exercise, so I leave it as the first homework exercise is to show that every More exercise is to show that every orbit is tense. Just couple of observations, you take C integr C and then you can look at this set as a subset of the real or a subset of the circle. So either way, you want to show first that this is dense. This is dense, and this is the orbit of zero for this R alpha. And then if you show this tense, then the orbit of zero is and you rotate because that's the point of being an isomorphism. Okay, so that's the easiest. Yeah, I didn't say that in case I let's draw the picture again. Let me Then let me do the R1 over Q. So you have this 0, the 2Ï€ over Q, and you rotate this, and you get now exactly the next guy, and that's it. Okay, then you can what is called a fundamental domain for your system. And once you take any of it here, just for that job. If you So if you look at the orbit equivalent relation, you divide by the orbit equivalent relation, this is again a circle. And here the portion by the orbit equivalent relation is disaster from my point of view, so I'm just going to say how disaster it will be. Okay, so that's so far first example. First example let me want more definitions, a couple of more definitions, and then I go to a couple more of examples. Definition is this table set the point Point and now I want X to be a metric space, not just a logical space, and eventually all my examples, modules and very few of them will be compact metric spaces. So this is like that and Efficiently known by that, and I sometimes we call it stable manifold because in smooth dynamics these often are manifolds, and then I'm accustomed to call them manifolds, but basically they are just sets. Yeah, and there's only points y in x such that y goes to 0 as n goes to infinity. Actually, if I put the draft If I put plus infinity, this is the stable set of x and I have the unstable set of x is the same as a minus infinity. These are the points that in the future go to the same places. Same places. Unstable set, you said it's the stable. At the end, you send it to management. So the point of stable sets is, and this is very important, so this is part of the problem of general groups in general is that don't have this order on the general group. So On the general group. So going to plus infinity or minus infinity in general groups is a bit more complicated. But here you have the notion of going to plus infinity or minus infinity. So if you look to orbit closures, you can actually decompose this orbit closure into the forward part of the orbit closure, the negative part of the orbit closure, and then whoever is in between. T transformation, you have, of course, the points of the orbit. Then you have the forward orbit closure, which is called the omega limit set, which is the accumulation points of the future. And then you have the same, but it's the backward. This is not the dischant union. This is not a disjunct union, so it's just the union of these three guys. And the point of the stable set is that if two points belong to the same stable set, then this set will coincide. F notice this point. So if two points, if one is with the state root of x, then then alpha x equals o So wherever the x accumulates the y will have to accumulate and y stabilize in the future and similarly for unstables in the past now this partition into Now, this partition into stable sets, well, it is a partition, let me just say. So, this is a partition. This is an implication, so there is no equivalence. You could have same omega limit without being the same. Sorry, can I ask a question? Um, so is this forward or closure W of X the same as W S of X, the same? No, no, this yeah, this is an omega actually. Okay. This is an omega actually. Okay. My omega is my calculus. But yeah. So this is omega of x. So this is called omega limit. Let me write down exposition definition. x, we have two equivalent definitions. So one is integral intersection is n positive of the union, no need of union, of the d n of x n larger than n, and then equal to closure, and this is the same as the Same as accumulation points. Of course, then depends on what is the notion of accumulation points. I think this is the same and u is the same. I take all the sub-sequences limit of PNRX such. Everywhere you can accommodate the most accurate function of this one or the other is alpha. Alpha is like minus. And the alpha. The alpha is when you go to the mass. Your T is in the grid. Yeah, that's very important because actually one of Very important because actually, one of my main examples is non-invertible. So, yeah, this definition so far are for invertible system, but when the T is not invertible, then you don't have a C action, but you have a semi-loop action. It can do stab. In this case, this makes sense, and the omega makes sense. And then, of course, the orbit will be only the forward orbit. Whether alpha makes sense or not has to be discussed. You can make trying to make sense of alpha, but you have to have choices to make, and depending on what you want to see, is the definition you will make. Sorry, it's good to not date any question. When you have a superscript, yes, and you When you have the superscript, it has a mu, it's w's, those are w's. W, I don't know who invented the w, but it's uh w is more unstable. Those are w's. The others are only. Yeah, that's my. My owners are the same as my DAPUs. No problem, my handwriting is worse than you slack. Yeah, I don't know who was the first calling them DAPUS. Yeah, some people calling them V's. There are some people calling them Vs, but of course then we have also. But uh let's comp try to compute these values in a very concrete example and try to see second example. Distinctly variable in the third example probably will be not take this matrix, so this is This matrix, so this is matrix in SF2C. So I terminate one integer entries. I call it A, and I still call it A, the induced automorphism on the top. So this means you have a matrix, then this is an isomorphism. And isomorphism of R2, it preserves the integers and so it induces a map from the quotient by the integer, the quotient by the integers. And it's invertible because you just take the inverse of this matrix, which determines at one place you have zero. In this case, it's just like this. No, I guess I don't know how to maybe stick. And this is the inverse I So this is again the transformation. This induces an action of the integers. Now we can try to look at what are the orbits and even what are the orbit closures. And things get a little bit more complicated, although For the cover of exercises, should be 2 because I already equal 1. But this is if point X is rational, so to be more precise, X is V over Q is square to At once, then your orbit is finite. Finetorby, so the closure is itself called a periodic point. So again, here rationality and periodicity is coming together. is coming together. And actually if this is an if and only if so this orbit is finite if and only the point is rational. And one direction is not too hard and the other is also not too hard. So in one it's pretty much the same as for the rational case. The fact that if this orbit is finite then the point has to be Solve it is finite, then the point has to be rational because when you come to the guy, you are solving. So, what is this picture? So, you take x, you take a of x up to some n of x, but this n of x is equal to x on the torus. But being x on the torus, it means that you have this equality now on R square. Have this equality now on R square. But then you just invert the matrix here. And then matrix. Now, why this matrix is invertible, and this is one of the first, main important part of this particular matrix, that this has no eigenvalue one, no eigenvalue of more than one. Nice example. So you can invert this matrix, and of course, this matrix has a Matrix, and of course, each matrix has a determinant, so the inverse will have some denominator which is rational, and that's how we get. And the other direction is more fun, so I will not do it. So I will take it. Okay, so these are for rational, so the rational orbits are finite. So what about the irrational orbits? Well I have a stable set of one of these periodic cortic, let's say zero, zero is the nicest periodic cortex here because zero is the fixed point of the outcomes fission. So, what is the stable manifold of this guy? I don't know exactly what it is yet, but I know that if I take a point x here, then omega of x will be the same as this formula of 0, which now is just 0 cross. So that's how easy I can compute. Though alpha of x could be alpha, has a lot of naturally. Actually, it could be whatever it wants to be pretty much about these alpha files. In the meantime, hopefully we understand the role of these stable sets and unstable sets. But then, if you believe me for a second, the stable set of zero may be a line. Line x is here, and pretty much what is happening is that you take a of x, a square of x, a correct. Okay, so I was just going to stay hard. I'm not trying to deduce that. But it's good for the I guess you can match. You have a splitting of R2 into two subspaces, so linear subspaces, which is the invariant eigenspaces. Vector Bs for vector and A of B U is the inverse of B U, so German is one, so one has to be the inverse of the other. It is also self-adjoint, so these two vectors are orthogonal and it's diagonalizable, so if these guys were one, then it has to be identity and the matrix is not identity. So from there, you can deduce that these lambdas are. You can reduce that these lambdas are not one, either minus one by the same reason. They could be negative, but you can check that it preserves such a positive matrix. So it's a pronoun for Linux matrix. So eigenvalue is one. It's positive. But you can compute the spacing. So it works b plus minus column five divided by two, I think. So this is true. So So eigenvalues, so lambda is minus and the lambda inverse is the first an irrational number which are continuity to but still number smaller than one. That's the stable that is the vector space associated with this eigenvalue where it is contracted. Why this is useful because if I This is useful because if I take any x in the ES and I start applying A, I get X, which is a cost to C. And that's it. This automatically tells me that the stable phase S is contained in the stable set in R2. Now I have to be a little bit more careful and consider the stable set in the toes, not in R2. Now, there are two things I want to do with a couple of pictures. Is to try to convince f you first that on R two the stable set is exactly yes, it's not just it contains this yes. Just it contains this DFs, exactly DS. And the second thing then is to convince you that when you project this line to the torus, you get a stable set on the torus. Let me just do a couple of features for that. S and perpendicular to it is u. Here they have perpendicular. This is the 0, 0, this is the 0 p. Then I should have like Then I should have made a picture correctly but what to do. Could be right or wrong, so, but well, the point is this line could go out through this or through there. Yet another exercise. This is the vertical. This is the vector domain. So, this is the fundamental domain for my torus. Now, if I take any point here, as I said, so this is stable, I put these arrows. Also, points this way or that way. So, if I take a point here and I go forward, it goes into here. Now, if I take a point y here and I apply And I apply my A, Arcumis goes away. That's multiplying by lambda every time. So is A the same A from the previous matrix? Yes, yes, it's always the same matrix A. So the only thing I'm doing, maybe not a good choice, is I'm calling A when it acts on R2 and I'm still calling A when it acts on the torus. Sorry. And sorry, ES and EU are the spaces, these eigen spaces, so the eigen product. So it's this form notation, but it's the eigen space for the eigenvalue lambda. The lambda is less than one. So it's just you do the diagonalization of the matrix A and these are eigen directions for this matrix. It's just plain linear eigenvalue eigen at this level there is nothing fancy. So when we go to the torous So when we go to the torus, then we have to be a little bit careful. But uh on R2 is just plain linear algebra. What is nothing to report it? On this direction, the guys are contracted exponentially. In this direction, the guys are expanded exponential to the future. When you go to the past, then they are contracted towards. Now if I take a point Take a point, if I take a point here, any point, let's call capital P, this point, so it has two coordinates, not two standard coordinates, but two coordinates in my splitting, ES plus E. Guy that actually I will start to call it XF now, and the other guy I will. X now, and the other guy I will call Xu. This point P so we have this pleating, this point B becomes Now when I try since everything is linear here. When I apply my dynamics to P, it's the same as applying to the x, and then adding. Means that this point, the first coordinate is getting contracted by lambda, the second coordinate is expanded by lambda's inverse and so this point is going So this point is going reversion. It cannot go to zero. You are showing me that let me go here. Make sure stable set on R2 I yes. Anyone else cannot go to zeros and diversions of the distance between zeros to infinity and now you take A inverse and the same goal, you same go. Okay, now I can project. I have my projection with going by for a second to two and I can project multiples. Yes? And one very important fact, very crucial for my argument, but it will be very important point in life, that the pi restricted to this ES line is one-to-one. And the reason for that That follow, there are several ways of proving it. One is just following the argument I'm going to write down here. The other is you can compute this guy very explicitly. So the entries has to go with this number of 1 minus square root of 5 or something like that. And so it's a rational slope. It cannot go through any integer. But there is a second argument which essentially should follow. And as I said, this guide will be contained just a second to emphasize. So the reason for that is if I take a point X here, so I can directly call it. here, so I can directly call it pi of x and pi of y. Then when I iterate a n of pi of x iteration on flows, this is the same as iterating this 'cause that's how yeah this works. This works. This is what's square. This is pi. This is A, this is A. So the mission of A is so that this die will commute. So if I apply A n down here, the single supply A n up there, but then this guy goes to zero. To zero. So this time I of zero is better than I thought. It shows that this inclusion here, if you want, l let me just comment in two seconds to the one I'm fifty. Okay, so let me do it very fast. So why this projection is one-to-one? So if this projection were not one-to-one, then you will be projecting this to a circle. Because there are two possibilities. If you go to an integer, you don't go. If you go to an integer, this is a circle. But now, not only these guys going. But now not only this guy is going to zero, the length of this circle when you apply dH is multiplied by lambda. So that this circle which goes to itself is contracting its length. That's not possible. That's how you can show differently that this is one to one. In any event, you get this. Now how you get the other inclusion? Other inclusion So this is also an A invariant set. So when I apply the A dynamics, this guy doesn't change very simple perfection. So if I take now the point Now the point here, I start iterating it. It has to go to zero on T But then I go to zero, I go the very small neighborhood of zero. The pi is one to one on this one neighborhood, it's a local isometry of part two, and I have And I have, if taking n larger than very large n, I have that all this remaining orbit starting from this capital n should stay in here, in neighborhood of zero. You cannot escape. I will see it here all the time. It has to remain all these positive iterates here. But then, if it were not in this line, starting from the This line starting from this capital N, then it will have a radical component, and this vertical component is pushing me out of there. The only way that this guy goes to zero is that starting from this capital N, the guy lands here. And once it lands here, it goes all the way there, but it's in the stable space. Okay, so let me repeat. Otherwise, it has coordinate components. It has coordinate component in the vertical direction and then it has to follow the hyperbola and get out of the vector. That's why it's called hyperbolic behavior, it's because this movement around hyperbolas of the output. So this shows that for zero, we have an infinity here, so it's just this line, the stable of zero. But then these are linear maps, so Maps. So it's not like the rotation that you had isometries, but still you have this homogeneity of being linear. So if I now take the translate of the linear map and I project it, this would be the stable Z over value X. And this is simply because both in the Os and Both in the torus and on hard square, this is steam job. So this goes to zero in our zero. And same for the absolute line. So what I have is in R2, I have all lines parallel to the table of zero. To a stable of zero. We have four lines parallel to the unstable of zero. And this is the blue ones are the partition into unstables and the white ones are the partition into the stables. And when you project this to the torso, you get the corresponding partition. The corresponding partition, two partitions of the top of the top. So this lucky situation now in a sense because this partition into stable state is also the partition into orbits by a flow, which is this translation flow on R. Now it's an irrational flow, so the orbit partition is as aggregate as the rotation wave. As accurate as the rotation by alpha partition, but something that you can quantify somehow. The same with unstable. Now let me say one more thing about this picture. Okay, so we have this here. So, what about this? Why this can be essentially whatever you want is because of the following. So, depending on your choice of x, of course. So, you have here your stable space. This is only two, so here is a fundamental domain. You have to imagine this is traveling around here, and so they are traveling here. But in an event, let's say you take any point in Z in T2 and you have some alpha limit point. It could be a periodic orbit, the C is. It could be a periodic orbit, the C, so it's finite. It could be who knows yet, but anything. So I have this point C here, but then I take this blue guy, nothing but new. I don't even know it was blue to begin with, but blue guy here. I take this X. If alpha C will have to be the same as alpha X, because if you are joined by the blue, it's because you're in the same. If you are joined by a blue, it's because you are in the same unstable set. That this alphas are the center. That in this table of x, I have all the possible alpha unit sets for all points on t2. If I understand what happened along this table set, I know what happened for my whole life. Not much actually, but after much more time, let me finish one minute. Let me finish one minute. So a much simpler example than this that I'm going to analyze in the afternoon is already on the circle multiplication by two. So So instead of doing a matrix, you do the most trivial matrix one, which is multiplication. And I will repeat a little bit of the analysis, even though here what is stable and what is unstable. And try to give a most accurate description possible of this system. Thank you. Thank you. We need to start the transition. Juave. So, why don't you do that and we'll have questions? We can keep the audio line. Then just do it in the transition. We just have to start the projector piece from the So, are there questions? So are there questions? Yeah. Can you maybe say a few words about the tweet not to say that this alpha of x can be anything? Yes, anything that is allowed on the top of t2. It's not that it can be any set. I'm saying that what I was trying to say is that we have all the possible alpha limit sets for points on the topic two and this alpha limit set And these uh alpha limit sets already appear for points in the state. I still cannot say, I will try to attempt to say something in the case of multiplication by two, what are all the possible actually omega limit set. Which is not everything, but it's huge on that. So that's why it's so hard. So if I understand for a clear with this phenomenon that we I mean we look at positive orbits then. We look at positive orbits, then we have a much better understanding somehow. Yeah, hold on. We're recording this one after the recording, I guess, until he starts.
