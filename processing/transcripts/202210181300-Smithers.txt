Interesting topic of like payment sales. So we have already heard about them in this in this workshop already. So you all know they form these kind of very interesting phenotypes. And so one of my adjusted, so this is my P. So, this was my PhD project with Dr. Rosemary Dyson. And one of the things we wanted to test was the hypothesized network of microtubules and ROPs that are said to control pavement cell morphology. We wanted to take this quoted this network, which you see in the literature, and wanted to test if it can actually develop payment cells and whether it can also initiate payment cells. So, to go over this network quickly, so the literature kind of repeats this kind of system that says the ROP2 localize in the lobes and the ROP6 localize in the indents, where they set up patterns of microtubules and actin, which then soften and stiffen in their respective regions that can help. Yeah, that can help develop their shape. So, to study this system, we built up a novel system of three interacting models. So, we built up a stochastic microtubal model to incorporate their dynamics, which directly interacted with reaction diffusion model to incorporate all the signaling proteins. All the signaling proteins. And then the results of these simulations then informed a vertex element, viscoelastic, anisotropic model to model pavement cell growth. So with this model, we then said, can this hypothesized network help developed payment cell shape? So in developed payment cells, the answer seems Cells, the answer seemed to be yes. So we got that ROP2 localized to the lobes and that microtubules formed organized arrays and localized to the indents as experimentally observed. So with and then with our mechanical model, we then allow payment cells to grow and we find that yes, indeed their payment cell shape does develop, right? The average Does develop, right? The average lobe aspect ratio increases as they grow. And we also found that anisotropy, when we include anisotropy in this growth simulations, was a vital part for their development of their shape. So then we moved on to try to validate it and compare against mutants. So constitutively active. The constitutively active ROP6, the observation is there, was that the experimental observation was that microtubules form transverse rays perpendicular to the elongation axis. This is a result we recreated in our model. As you can see, with the black line depicting the long axis, then we looked at constitutive. Then we looked at constitutively active, hang on the bar, is VOP2. Yep. And here the experimental observation was that they have a disorganized microtubule array and then a lack of microtubule organization to the indents, which we also saw in our simulations. So we see more disorganized microtubules and less localization instances in our mutants. So this is like two ticks for our. Is like two ticks for our model system. Um, um, then we looked at dominant negative uh ROP, sorry, VOP6. Um, and here saying like the experiment observations where microtubles were more disorganized, but the microtubules were less bundled with one another. So, we got that the microtubule array was uh disorganized, um, but we didn't get so this one result was 55. didn't get so this one result was 50-50 that microtubules were less bundled with one another we didn't get that result um and so and lastly the dominant negative two and this is where we get an interesting observation from our uh results is that the increased microtu this right the experimental observation is the increased microtubule bundling um which we got um but there's no mention of a disruptive There's no mention of a disrupted microtubule array or ROP6 disruption, which in our simulations we got. And so, this is where we think our model found like a gap in the literature. So, we took the hypothesized network from the literature that says ROP2, when ROP2 localizes to the lobes, this helps promote through like auxin and pin localization. This helps This helps promote FOP6 on the opposite side of the boundary. So with less FOP2 in this, there's less ROP, then there's less FOP6. So we kind of like, we, through this result, we kind of like propose that there's maybe some we missing hole, there's some other mechanism that ROP6 helps that ROP6 localize to the indents. And then there was the paper that was released, I think. And then there was the paper that was released, I think, last year. So I need to update our reference. It was now actually fully released. That said, through some frony pathways, that through mechanosensing, that can help activate ROP6. So our model actually predicted this mechano sensing. So then we went to say, can our system initiate this network initiate lobes? And our results kind of hint at no. Hint at no in its current form. So we found no evidence that ROP2 and microtubules form like spontaneous patches of ROP2 microtubule, ROP2, microtubule that could help initiate loaves. We didn't see this in the small payment cells and our mature payment cells as well. So to conclude this bit, so we have shown the model to create experimental results and it has shown out missing parts. It has shown out missing parts. A model has shown missing parts in the network. And we have said this hypothesized signaling network helps develop payment cell lobes, but doesn't seem to explain initiation at the moment. So what about initiation? So this next bit is all provisional simulations. I am not saying any of these are correct or completely valid. These are just messing with the system to. To questions like how can payment cells initialize. So we have this toy system of cells and we're testing out different scenarios. So we write different chemical strategies. So maybe when we have like variations in isotropic viscous properties, which could maybe be pectin initiation. Or so here we vary like so here. Vary like so. Here we've got low viscosity, and here we've got high viscosity. So they complement each other. We've got maybe potential anisotropic cellulose initiation. So here we are defining anisotropy in specific regions. We also test mechanical tissue effect strategies. So here we've got a para cleaner wall, C and D, power cleaner wall differential growth rate. So this is where we define the whole cell to have a different growth rate to its neighbor. Growth rate to its neighbor, neighbouring one. And same here, we have these white different growth rates on the anti-cleaner walls. And then our last one is this hypothesis that maybe DR payment sales formula is because they are buckling because they have restricted growth. So to go on about the results of these simulations, so when we have differential pectin stiffness, it seems to us struggle to initiate lobes. Initiate lobes. So, in this result, we hardly see any cell wall bending. And here we see a tiny bit, but for to get this result, we had to increase the difference between the different viscosities values to really high and maybe arguably unrealistic levels. And then we tested out anisotropic. Yeah, what happens if we get anisotropic? We get anisotropic, you know, viscosity. Can that initiate lobes? And we have some, like, we do have some bending here. And like, and according to Anya Geithman's previous model, so you only need a little bit of a curve here to then actually start the stress feedback, where then maybe microtubules can start to localize and then help develop this lobe further. Further. And then we also have the differential growth rates. And so, if we have differential growth rates between neighbouring cells, this can help cells bulge into one another. But for this to be a feasible possibility for payment cell initiation, you would need cells to constantly switch between being fast growing and slow growing. And then, lastly, one of the most actually convincing pictures of this is the restricted growth. Pictures of this is the restricted growth. So, this is where we like suppose there's access wall deposition and they are still allowed to grow, but they are being restricted. And we do see some like lobes form, but this is on a very conditional case of if you believe that these payment sales have actually been restricted. Um, which I'm not uh suggesting, I just want to say none of these I'm suggesting as absolute truth at all. Um So, yeah, what are our current objectives? So, yeah, so like the hypostasis signaling network can explain a payment development, but not its initiation. So, how do they initiate? Loads could be initiated through sales or pectin deposition, but anisotropic initiation seems to be more effective. But previous payment cell papers have shown that pectin to come first. To come first in some cases before the microtree rules localize. So that's a bit of like a possibility, an interesting thing to investigate further. And then differential growth rates and bucketing can also cause lobing, but are these actually legitimate ways? So maybe possible future directions is saying like in 3D, I think any future payment cell model would need to be definitely done in 3D. To be definitely done in 3D, possibly using the tissue software which I have been helping to develop with the Johnson lab. And the combination of mechanics and chemical signaling outlined in this model, which I have included in this model, I think that definitely needs to be continued. And also, like to find the missing parts of the signaling network. So whether, you know, if this is through like Whether you know if this is through like touring patterning, maybe you know, like there's like inactive forms of the ROPS, which could be important. But yes, so acknowledgements, thank you to my current group, the Robinson group and the Janssen group and the Dyson group, which I did my PhD with, and also the paper group. Thank you for listening. Questions? Questions? Jorges? Thank you very much for the talk. I have two questions. First, in the rock mutants, you mentioned is overall growth of the leaf blade altered and could that be having an effect rather than sort of local effects? And second, what is the genetic evidence that pectin has a role here? I just I just don't remember, so excuse my ignorance. Can someone repeat the question? Sorry, it wasn't, you know, it's not like clear at the back. His question is if in the Rob mutant you have a phenotype on your leaf? That's the first? Yeah, is leaf growth affected in the Rob mutant? In the Rob two mutant, yes, so some of them are white are smaller, white overall. White the overall leaf, but I can't, yeah, I can't remember all the details about whether it affects all the curvature or not. Could that be having an effect on the process, the overall leaf growth? I would not be able to conclusively say yes or no. I think, yeah, there's a vague. Yeah, it's a very good question. The second question was about pectin. How good is the genetic evidence for pectin having a role here? So maybe Arnie would be able to answer this question better because I think it was their paper who showed that the pectin coming first. So there are mutants, pectin methyl esterase mutants that have a slight phenotype. It's not enormous. There's a lot of... It's not enormous. There's a lot of redundancy, but we have some evidence that there's a lower number of weights. So I guess an interesting question. I mean, given what Dan very nicely explained about the possible role of pet in wall load bearing, then I mean, I don't know the answer to that. I'm just wondering how easy is that to square with this. Is that to square with these proposed large effects on the no? Do you have a question? No, I was just going to respond to that. So I think one thing it's important to differentiate between is the periclinal walls versus the anticlinal walls, right? The anticlinal walls are hypothesized to be glued together by pectins. So in that case, the mechanics are different from the example of a single layer of wall, the period of wall. And that was my exact. Thank you. And that was my exactly the question I would have had to you. And is that when you modeled that, did you use pectin in the anti-clinical walls or in the pericleino walls from your drawing? That wasn't so obvious. Yeah, so this was in the pericleana wall. So that is a good point. And saying that I think this is the vantage that maybe future 3D models could. Because in our model is from like a previous model. It's like 2.5D, so it does include 3D aspects. 3D aspects, but it is on a whole 2D. So I think then any future model would need to be 3D so we can answer some of these questions. Which I think Henrik is going to start discussing in his workshop on Thursday. Okay, so I just wanted to make a small announcement. So indeed, there was a problem. Sarah gave a lovely talk. There was a problem. Sarah gave a lovely talk, seemingly, to know what. Yeah, and it's we heard a nice talk about pavement salt, but she was going to also make references to the discussion we just were having about Sow Wall. So Sarah, really, this will happen on Thursday, and we'll be just as interested on Sow Wall and growth on Thursday than we are today. But thanks a lot, Ion, for stepping in. So that was great. And yeah, Slaki confirmed that she could do it on Thursday. Do it on Thursday, so maybe we are having the clashes, and yeah. So, without further ado, because we have our lunch here, I want to thank all the speakers and just remind you all that we will have another session after lunch, which is 1430 local time here in Mexico. No, yes, 14:30 local time here. And so, everybody is welcome to join, and we'll take it from there. So, thank you, everybody. Everybody from this kind of version from the lunch and from Lily, then we need to.
