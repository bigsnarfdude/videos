  Um Good morning, everyone. Welcome back. Our first speaker today is Matthew Stover, and he'll speak on super rigidity in rank one. Please go ahead. Great, thank you. Yeah, many thanks for the invitation. Thanks, all of you, for showing up virtually. Strange world we live in, but math trudges on. But math trudges on. So, I'm going to talk about some joint work with Uri Botter, David Fisher, and Nick Miller on superigidity in rank one. But like with many great talks about discrete subgroups of Lie groups, we'll start with a theorem of Margulis that most of you know. But so it's super rigidity. So you have a semi-simple Lie group and an irreducible lattice. I'm not even stating this in its fullest generality, but you have a But you have a representation of your lattice into some algebraic group over a local field. And you'll notice there are a few assumptions on the group. And, you know, for those that know that you know why they're there. And for those that don't, they're just typically some trivial little nitpicks you need to be careful about. And you need to state these things properly to avoid these little minor points. But so as the talk. Minor points. But so as the talk goes on, I'll get looser and looser about these assumptions. But you know, for those that know all the standard assumptions, they're basically always going to be there. But yeah, so you have a representation of your lattice into some algebraic group over local fields as Zariski dense, then there are only two options. Option one is that it's bounded, or option two is that it actually, in disguise, you would put the entire Lie group G or map. Lead group G or map the lead group G to your group H and then just sort of gamma went along for the ride. So that's there's super rigidity for you. And so then sort of leaning into the rank one world for spn1 and f4 minus 20, Corlette and Gromov Shane also gave superigidity there. And so really the remaining rank one groups are SON1 and SO1. Groups are SON1 and SUN1. And so those are really going to be the groups that we'll talk about today. And so the point will be to state a super-rigidity theorem for those with an application to the geometry of these locally symmetric spaces. And the application was really what got us thinking about this. So I'm hoping to tell you that whole story over the next 22 or so minutes. Okay. So point one. So, point one is that these are the two groups where there's where super rigidity hasn't been proven, and that's for good reason, because full stop superigidity is just not true. And so, the first sort of key example is that there are many examples of lattices in both of these groups for which there's a map on disease. Okay, and if you have a map on disease, then superigidity is just done because you. Just done because you can now map into your group H of K unboundedly. And just because this has a gigantic kernel, you're not going to have a continuous extension. So it's pretty elementary to see that once you have a lattice with non-trivial first Betty number, then super rigidity is completely out the window. So, okay. So it goes. In fact, for SO2. In fact, for SO21 and SU21 and SO31, it's even worse. It's known now, you know, it's classical for SO21, but sort of a long story ending with the work of Ian Agel that if you have a lattice in SO21 or SO3.1, there's a finite index subgroup of that lattice that in fact admits a free quotient. So not only are there some representations to algebraic groups over any To algebraic groups over any local field you want for which superigidity fails, they're just everywhere, right? Because now, once I have a free quotient, I can just pick any matrices in this group I want, and there's a representation. And so, I mean, failure is just very, very bad. So, that's the sort of broad picture of superigidity. It's known to hold for certain groups, and for the groups, it doesn't. Certain groups, and for the groups, it doesn't. It doesn't for very good reason. I mean, I might add that there are lattices that could be super rigid in these groups. We just don't know any examples, but I'll leave that. And for a second, I'll move on to one of Margulis's key corollaries to super rigidity, which is arithmeticity. And I think that's arithmeticity is something dear to the heart of. Arithmeticity is something dear to the heart of many people in this room. But I want to just briefly sketch the proof that super rigidity implies arithmeticity, just because it'll help sort of motivate why we proved our super rigidity theorem for SON1 and SUN1 in order to prove an arithmeticity theorem of our own. So the sketch. So, the sketch goes about like this. So, I'm going to assume the group is simple. That's not really even an important reduction, but it's just to keep this, as is only 25-minute talk, I'll try to be somewhat gentle. But so the first step is to apply local rigidity for the lattice and to see that there's some algebraic group over a number field into which up to finite index you can. Up to finite index, you can put your group. And I'm leaving this unsaid. You need to choose your number field optimally. It should be the adjoint trace fields, but let's not worry about those finer points. You get that your group goes into an algebraic group over a number field. And now what I do is I start taking completions of that number field. And that gives me homomorphisms into algebraic groups over some local field. Great. Local field. Great. And so, because I assumed it was just a simple adjoint over the reels, there's one Archimedean place for which I get my group G, and my group gamma goes in as a lattice. Great, fantastic. And for all the other ones, now I apply superigidity. And I see that for all of the other possibilities for a completion, either I'm bounded or I extend. But you can't extend. Why can't you extend? Why can't you extend? Well, if this were a non-Archimedean local field, then this group is totally discontinuous. And so you're not going to have a continuous homomorphism of my real Legroup into there. So that's just done. But then for the other, say, real or complex embeddings, you're changing roots. And changing roots is also everywhere discontinuous. And so you have to be a little careful to argue this properly, but you can't have changing a root give you a continuous. Have changing a root give you a continuous homomorphism of Lie groups, and so that's the sort of basic sketch of how it goes. And so great. And then, so yeah, so now you put it all together and you basically have the definition of arithmeticity, right? So you see that for all the other Archimedean places, this group is compact, and you're viadically integral for all the non-Archimedean places. And so it's, you know, all the Galois conjugates. The Galois conjugates are compact and it's integral, and that's the definition of arithmeticity. Okay, so that's the sort of brief sketch of how you get from superigidity to arithmeticity. And so let's move back to my two rank one groups, SON1 and SUN1. So there are known non-arithmetic lattices, and there's even infinitely many up to commensurability in SON1. In SUN1, we've only got finitely many, so the challenge. We've only got finitely many, so the challenge continues. I would even say we don't really understand non-arithmetic lattices in SON1 very well. And I'll give an open problem very soon related to the geometry of non-arithmetic lattices. But, you know, so just broadly, we care about discrete subgroups of Lie groups on the one hand, because they give us important geometric manifolds. Important geometric manifolds, hyperbolic manifolds. And so, you know, you would care very broadly about giving a geometric characterization of arithmeticity. And that's really what our goal was with this project, was to give a geometric characterization, a characterization. And so I actually would consider the commensurator theorem itself to be a geometric interpretation of arithmeticity. Of arithmeticity. But so another one of Margulis's very famous theorems is that if you have an arithmetic, a subgroup of my semi-simple Lie group G is arithmetic if and only if its commensurator is dense. And again, you need to be a little careful about finite extensions and so on and so forth. But, you know, afford me that. And so, you know, really that saying that symmetries in finite covers of arithmetic manifolds are Are much more broad than you see in the arithmetic, in the non-arithmetic setting. So I do really consider this to itself be a geometric characterization of arithmeticity. But I'm going to go even further and give a geometric corollary of the commensurator theorem, which is that if you have an arithmetic lattice, you take your locally symmetric space, maybe let's even take a torsion-free one and get a manifold. If it contains just one property, Contains just one properly immersed totally geodesic submanifold of some dimension D, let's say two, then it has infinitely many and they're everywhere dense. And this is just a standard trick and it's a sort of buzz term it goes by is commensurated around. Once you have your one, you use density of the commensurator to basically move that around, intersect some more, and you get that they're infinitely many and they're everywhere dense. Okay, so you know, just for a concrete example for For a concrete example, for you know, if you have an arithmetic hyperbolic three-manifold, it contains one totally geodesic surface, then contains infinitely many, and they're everywhere dense, they're just everywhere. Which, from a differential geometry point of view, is actually surprising. It's not obvious. If you're a negatively curved manifold, you have infinitely many closed geodesics, and they're everywhere dense. And that's a standard fact that goes back to the 20s, even earlier, if you want to interpret. Even earlier, if you want to interpret it. But, you know, once you get to two-dimensional sub-manifolds, it's not clear that you should have infinitely many. It's not clear that you should have any at all. In fact, generically, you should expect no totally geodesic hypersurfaces in a hyperbolic four-manifold. And I'll come back to that a little more later. But so the commensurator theorem tells you that once you have one, say totally G, it has a You have one, say, totally geodesic surface, then they're just everywhere. And so, in dimension three, Kurt McMullen asked, so for hyperbolic three manifolds, Kurt McMullen asked this, and Alan Reed had sort of informally been pushing this question around. If you have, say, a hyperbolic n-manifold, finite volume, and it contains infinitely many totally geodesic hypersurfaces, codimension one, totally geodesic sub-manifolds. Well, I put a dimension grid to. Well, I put a dimension grid too well, anyways. That's to get n greater than or equal to 3 to get rid of geodesics. Then, is it arithmetic? And to just pause on this for a second, in relation to the geometric corollary, you know, basically the, you know, the reason for asking the question was this. The commensurator is a great tool to promote one to infinitely many. And it's a pretty easy trick. And it's basically the only trick we know. And so it doesn't work. Know. And so it doesn't work for non-arithmetic manifolds because of Margulis's commensurator theorem. So, what happens in the non-arithmetic setting? And so, you know, this question was posed without a single example for which the set for which a non-arithmetic manifold was known to have only finitely many totally geodesic submanifolds. So it was basically, you know, we have a trick. The trick is inherently arithmetic. And so is this property? And so, is this property of having infinitely many geodesic submanifolds itself a geometric characterization of arithmeticity? So, the first examples where the set of totally geodesic hypersurfaces could be proved to be finite was given in some joint work of mine with David Fisher and Jean-Lafont and Nick Miller. And, you know, for those of you that know the Gromov-Pioteski-Shapiro examples, that's what we studied. And we showed that. Studied. And we showed that in the Gromov-Pioteski-Shapiro examples and certain generalizations of those, so certain hybrid hyperbolic manifolds, we could actually prove that the set of totally geodesic hypersurfaces was non-empty and finite. And non-empty, if you know the Gromov-Piotesky-Shapiro example, there'll be a picture later if you haven't seen it. Basically, you've cut open some arithmetic things, you've glued them along a hypersurface. So you have at least one. And so, you know, you could then ask the question: are there others? You know, you have this one, you know, there's finitely many. But our theorem is not effective in that sense that it tells you exactly what they are. Another quick remark is that there are known arithmetic and non-arithmetic hyperbolic three-manifolds for which the set is empty. There are just no totally geodesic surfaces at all. And well, such is life. Well, such is life. But coming back, I said I was going to come back to this point. We do not know a single example. I do not, maybe somebody else in this Zoom room does. I do not know a single example of a non-arithmetic hyperbolic four-manifold without a hypersurface. Because how do we build them? We take hybrids of arithmetic things, or we take reflection groups. And those all inherently have hypersurfaces. And typically, they're arithmetic hypersurfaces, in fact. Arithmetic hypersurfaces, in fact. And so I don't know off the top of my head, maybe somebody can do this. Maybe a reflection group could do this. I don't know off the top of my head an example of a non-arithmetic hyperbolic four-manifold for which all of the totally geodesic sub-manifolds are non-arithmetic. There could be an example, particularly from a reflection group, but I don't know off the top of my head. But I'd like to announce this is some work. Announced some work of my two PhD students, Con Lee and Rebecca Palmer. They actually, a very beautiful paper that should be available quite soon. So for all k greater than or equal to one, they construct infinitely many commensurability classes of hyperbolic three manifolds containing exactly k totally geodesic surfaces. And so I mentioned before in this work with David and Lafonton Miller, Fisher Lafonton Miller. Miller, Fisher, Lafonta Miller, we couldn't control. We could prove finiteness, because a dynamics argument, we could prove finiteness, but we couldn't actually tell you how many. And Khan and Rebecca have constructed infinitely many commensurability classes where the beautiful one is exactly one. And all the ones with exactly one are not complemented. That's just fantastic. So look out for this on the archive pretty soon, but sort of please me. But you know, okay, now for. Okay, now for our result. So, this is the work with Uri and David and Nick. So, we proved that if you have a basically, you can extend this to locally symmetric, all locally symmetric manifolds. But really, here you're caring about SON1 and SUN1. But so, if you have, say, hyperbolic or complex hyperbolic manifold with infinitely many maximal totally geodesic submanifolds of dimension at least two, so now I'm not just Mention at least two. So I'm not just talking about hypersurfaces. I'm going a little further. Then it's arithmetic. And of course, you would better not prove this for dimension one geodesic submanifolds because everything has infinitely many closed geodesics. And there's a good reason why our theorem fails there. So that's great. And so, what does this maximal condition come down to? If you look at these Gromov-Pioteski-Shapiro examples, So let's say I had, you know, I've basically taken some arithmetic things and glued them together. And so I have a, say, as a hyperbolic four manifold that contains a totally geodesic, arithmetic hyperbolic three manifold. Now that could contain infinitely many totally geodesic surfaces, two manifolds. It's just the way life is. So really this infinitely many maximal totally geodesic submanifolds. Totally geodesic submanifolds. Really, you should think about that as saying that they equidistribute in the larger locally symmetric space. That's really what we care about. Because at the end of the day, we're going to do dynamics and we want these totally geodesic submanifolds to equidistribute. But, you know, really, you know, so you wouldn't, you want, you need to rule out this situation because otherwise the theorem is just wrong. But so if you had infinitely many totally geodesic surfaces lying around here that were not contained in a total That were not contained in a totally geodesic hyperbolic 3 manifold, then you would conclude arithmeticity. Okay, so that is that theorem. And so yeah, so back to super rigidity. So again, we, you know, as many people have done to great effect, we follow in Margulis's footsteps. And so to prove arithmeticity, we're going to prove a super rigidity theorem. And since super rigidity is not true in general, what are we going to do? Well, General, what are we going to do? Well, what we're going to do is we're going to exploit the fact that I have my lattice. It lives in this algebraic group. And inside of it, I have these infinitely many lattices in some subgroup. You've got to be careful. It's a compact extension of some group generated by unipotence is what we really need. But basically, we have some lattices in some subgroups of my algebraic group. And really, you have to worry that this could be defined. Really, you have to worry that this could be defined over a subfield, and so you know, the small lies are starting to accumulate, but you know, you have to be careful about this. But so, the point is, we're going to follow basically the spirit of deducing arithmeticity from superigidity. So, we have some completion of our field L. It's some local field, k sub v. I don't know why it's not L sub V, but that's okay. And so inside of it, we'll have a group. And so inside of it, we'll have a group over, we'll have an algebraic subgroup, and these are contained inside there. And so, you know, we've just included, just like you do in the superigidity implies aerophoticity. And the key fact we're going to exploit is that all of these totally geodesic submanifolds give us subgroups that are not Zariski dense. And for those of you that maybe know SL2R instead of SL2C, you have to be a little careful here. 2C, you have to be a little careful here. Should really be thinking about SO31 inside of SO21 inside of SO31. But so you have to be a little careful about this, but don't worry, we were. Theorem's not wrong. And so that's what we're going to exploit. So we're going to exploit the fact that we have a lattice and we have all of these lattice subgroups. We have a representation of that lattice for which the image of the subgroups are not Zariski dense in the target. That's what our super-rigidity theorems. That's what our super rigidity theorem is about. Okay. And so here it comes in its largesse. So we have our lattice in SON1 or SUN1. We have a representation into a group with the same assumptions as with the Margulis superigidity theorem. And we have these equidistributed totally geodesic submanifolds, so which the image is not Zariski-dense in the target. Zariski dance in the target. Now, there's an additional assumption on the target group that we call compatibility. And compatibility is, well, it's what you need to prove the theorem. But in fact, we can push it a little beyond that. So I'll maybe just say now we have two papers, one on SON1 and one on SUN1. The SON1 paper is really about studying the compatible target case. The SUN1 paper is about pushing beyond. Paper is about pushing beyond there because we had to to prove the theorem. But so, yeah, then if you have this set up, then you get the same conclusion. Either the image is bounded or it extends. And so from this super rigidity theorem, the proof of arithmeticity now proceeds exactly the same. Okay, you need to check that the various target groups are what we call compatible. They are, except in one case. They are, except in one case where we still prove the theorem. Okay, but yeah, so I want to also mention that the case of compact hyperbolic three manifolds was also done by Margulis and Mohamedi. And they also prove a super rigidity theorem, but they prove a slightly different super rigidity theorem. And actually, some of the spirit of their super rigidity theorem is what we do to handle the incompatible case. We do to handle the incompatible case for SUN1. But so it's a different type of idea than what we used for hyperbolic three manifolds. And then also recently, Baldi and Olmo did the case of complex totally geodesic sub-manifolds of complex hyperbolic manifolds. And their proof is completely different. It's from Hodge theory and variations of Hodge structure. And it's a completely different type of result. And actually, they come up. Result and actually they come up with an independent proof of the commensurator density theorem, which I think is very, very beautiful. So there's been other work on superginity theorems and so forth in rank one that I think is also exciting in and of itself. But I'm going to talk about our work for the rest of time. So I've got two minutes left to make a few remarks. So basically, we to start, we've followed. To start, we follow the general Margulis outline. Really, we started off basically trying to make the proof you find in Zimmer's book work, given our assumptions. You're bound to fail because superagidity is wrong. So, one novelty, and I won't have time to talk about this in more detail, but if you know superigidity proofs, the ones in the literature, either you're using a boundary map, so G mod a parabolic subgroup, or you're using a harmonic map. And so we actually use a different type of map. We use a map from a non-compact homogeneous space. And so you think about G being SO31 and W being SO21. So the space of hyperbolic two spaces and hyperbolic three space. And so we have to build this map. And that's an interesting step that I just don't have time to talk about. But so it's a novelty of So, it's a novelty of our proof that I find quite nice. And then we use this generalization of Margulis's argument by Bodder and Furman that uses a categorical language in a very pretty way, I think, and really helped us conceptualize some pieces of the argument. And one thing that's very important is in higher rank, you use centralizers, right? In the higher rank proof, you use the fact that things commute. That things commute. But really, if you look deeply at the proof, you really only need a normalizer trick. And so we have to exploit that. And the Bodder-Furman proof really does a great job of doing that. And I'm out of time, but so I'll say, so there's this compatibility condition. For those of you that have never read Zimmer's book, you can just sort of close your eyes and not look at this. But for those of you that have, I'll just say very briefly, there's a point where you have your map. There's a point where you have your map to some homogeneous space for the target. And there's a homomorphism to a subquotient of that. And it's really about acting on this homogeneous space. And so there's a point in the sort of proof you find in Zimmer's book where in rank one, you're just going to get stuck. And the point of compatibility is to just get you around the fact that you were stuck. And again, the Botter-Furman way of talking about. Way of talking about this really shows you why this is the right criteria. But so I'm just sort of putting it up there for those that have seen the proof to sort of see where this compatibility comes in. And so some important things, just some examples down at the bottom of compatible targets. So I'm going to end just saying our super rigidity works for every non-Archimedean local field target, for instance. But thank you for your attention. But thank you for your attention, and that is all I have to say. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? Okay, if there are no questions, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you very much. So, the next talk is at 10:40. Let me have about 13 minutes.
