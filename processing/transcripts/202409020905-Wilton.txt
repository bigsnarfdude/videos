Recording, screens. So we're very happy to start with Henry Wilton to speak about service groups among cubic groups. Yeah, I'm maybe ready. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks so much to the organizers for the invitation. I've never been to Banff before. This place is incredible. I'm really looking forward to this week. I'm really looking forward to this week. Okay, uh so I am yeah, my talk is the title of the talk ch I think the first schedule that went out had a slightly different title. So apologies if you're expecting a different talk. This is the one you're getting. If you wanted to hear about the other talk, you're welcome to come. Please come and chat to me. Likewise, I'm very happy to answer questions if anyone has any questions during. If anything I say doesn't make sense to you, which it might well not, I wrote this talk on the fly. Well, not. I wrote this talk on the flight yesterday and I'm a little bit jet lagged, so I may not make much sense. So if you need, if something doesn't make sense, please ask away, ask questions. I'm happy to try to answer them. Okay. So here we go. Okay. So yeah, so I want to talk about a theorem that went up on the archive earlier this year. And first section of the And the first section of the talk will be about free or perhaps non-free subgroups. So let me remind you of two well yeah, let me remind you of two very famous theorems, and these two theorems make a particular point. Here's the point. Here's the point. When we do geometric group theory, two of our favourite examples, two of the examples we spend most time thinking about, are free groups and surface groups. And we often say that they're kind of cousins. We often say that to each other. The surface groups and free groups are close to each other. But we might ask ourselves, well in what sense is that really true? Now there are lots of ways in which you can sort of put some meat on those bones and say that it is that they're cousins in some sort of precise sense. That they're cousins in some sort of precise sense. And I'm particularly interested in subgroups. So, if you give me a group, I'm also particularly interested in the subgroup structure of them. And so, one way you could ask yourself how are free groups and surface groups cousins is to ask about what their subgroup structures are like and whether they're similar. And so, here are the two theorems. So, at least it's going to be visible. If I write down there, is it visible or is this in the one? We'll try. You all know this theorem anyway, so it doesn't matter. So this is the Nielsen-Schreier theorem, which was proved in about so Schreier proved the last bit of it in 1927. And it says that if F is a free group and H is a subgroup of F, then H is free. That's the Nielsen Schroud theorem. That's the Nielsen Schroud theorem. So here's the next theorem, which is almost as famous, although actually its attribution is not that famous. I had to chase down a complicated conversation on Math Overflow to find the actual attribution of this. So it's due to someone called Johansson, not the Johansson who's famous for working in this area directly, and proved it in 1931. Proved it in 1931, it's his PhD thesis. What he showed was that if sigma is a closed surface, and if H is a subgroup of the fundamental group of sigma, and if the index of H in that fundamental group is, and if the index is infinite, so if we're looking at. And if the index is infinite, so if we're looking at an infinite index subgroup of a surface group, then H is free. Okay. And so if we put these two theorems together, we see we have a sort of a sense in which free groups and surface groups are cousins. They both have the property that all of their infinite index subgroups are free. Okay? Now, so what other groups might have? So, what other groups might have that property? Anyone? Maybe it's a bit early in the morning for pop quizzes. You all know infinitely many more examples of this, I promise you. Sorry? No, virtually free. Well, if it's virtually free and all its infinite index subgroups are free, then all of its torsion subgroups are free. So you're not far off. See, I'm sorry, you're all thrown because I started talking about you mentioned boothing, but the last question. Because I started talking about geometric group theory, but the answer is finite groups, right? Finite groups have the property that all of their infinite subsets. Why? Because they haven't got them. Okay. You tell us. Well, stupid example. So the stupid other example is finite groups. I mentioned that mainly just to get you thinking about it a little bit, and also because it's very easy for me to incorrectly state theorems on this talk, because I forget to mule out files, which I'll do that. Anyway. Financial groups don't do them. Anyway, so financing groups are an example. But there is a non-trivial other example, right? So a very, very non-trivial other example. So in 1979, Bolshansky constructed a finitely generated group with the property that every proper subgroup was isomorphic to the Z. Okay, cool. I guess there's the true quite as well. So I'm just going to call that Olshansky. Olchansky's monsters. So they're a sort of prototype for tasking monsters. They're a little bit easier to construct than Tarski monsters, but they have this property. And they're finitely generated, but they're not finitely presented. And so as far as I know, the following question is open. It is a, I mean, maybe I'll even go so far as to call it a ridiculous question, because it is a ridiculous question. Question. So suppose G is infinite and finitely presented. If every infinite index subgroup of G is free, does it have to be one of these two? To be one of these two. If every infinite index subgroup is free, must g be isomorphic to pi 1 of the surface? If I allow surfaces with boundary, then I get free d. So I give it. Okay? Right, so that's the question. So I say. So that's the question. So I say it's a ridiculous question because, I don't know, questions about all finitely presented groups are ridiculous. But as far as I know, it's open. Certainly, people have asked this question in various, have asked versions of this question in various specific contexts. So versions have been asked by a few people. So let's see. So Gromov actually. Actually, says something in his article about hyperbolic groups, which in particular points, at least points to this question for hyperbolic groups. The case where G is hyperbolic. The case where G is one relator has been asked in many different places by quite a lot of different people, but in particular, the person who I think is most associated. The person who I think is most associated with that is Ben Fine, who sadly passed away last year. But there are many, many different groups of people asked this question in the case where G is one writer, but he was usually an element of whichever set happens to be asking it. So he seems to have liked this question a lot. And lastly, so so Wise asks this question about virtually special groups. About virtually special groups in his ICN recent books. Okay, so people have sort of pointed at this question in many different contexts, and they tend to put hypotheses on G. But as far as I know, we just don't know the answer if we just assume G is finitely equal. All right. But that's it. It's a bit ridiculous, because it is ridiculous to ask questions about all finite equivalent groups. However, However, I mean it's it's ridiculous in the sense that if it's true for all finitely presented groups, we just we're nowhere near being able to prove that. And it seems inconceivable. But on the other hand, I don't think some questions about there are many questions asking for examples of nasty finite represented groups, which we haven't got a clue enough to answer. So that's the sense in which it's a ridiculous question. But here's a reason why I think it's not a ridiculous question and you should care about it at least in some of these special cases. At least in some of these special cases. So the reason is because it's closely related to some other questions that we do care about quite a lot. And that's because of this remark. So what I want to say. If G has a surface subgroup, by which I mean a subgroup that By which I mean a subgroup that's the fundamental group of a closed spherical surface. And it has this property that every infinite index subgroup is free, then G is a surface group. Why? Because if it's golden Why? Because if it's got a surface subgroup and every infinite index subgroup is free, then that surface subgroup has got to be a finite index. And it's also going to have to be torsion free, so by Nielsen realization, the group will actually have to be a surface indian. So what this tells you is that we can answer this question if we know that G has some kind of surface signal. And there are lots of cases where we would really like to know if G has a surface signal. So, for example, For example, because of this, so what does this tell us? It's if every one-ended hyperbolic G has a surface subgroup. Then question one. Oh, ridiculous. Oh, yeah, I'm just sorry, my notes I called this ridiculous question one. So it's also called question one. That's one of those ridiculous questions. Okay. RT. It's true for E. And secondly, so another example would be if another case where we care about finding surface subgroups of things, for example, is if. Of things. For example, if G is a Katzero group and it's not hyperbolic, we'd like to know that it contains a Z squared subgroup. And Z squared is a surface group. It's the fundamental group of Taurus. So every non-hyperbolic cat zero G contains Z squared. Squared. Then ridiculous question one holds for G. So these are two really interesting questions that are stronger somehow than this question. Okay, at least in this part of this G. And so if you care about trying to answer these questions, then you might first of all try to answer this question for those cheats before you move on to trying to answer these possibly harder questions. All right. That kind of suggests you believe the answer is yes. Sorry? Well, for these groups, yeah. Or no, but if you do you believe it's true in general? Oh, do I believe that the answer to this is yes? I have no idea. It seems extremely common. Because, yeah, this is common, I guess. But I'd love you to. Please give me another. Please give me a camera. Please give me another, please give me a camera. Lovely, in that case, give me an example area. Yeah, no, I know. Sorry about that. I'm entirely agnostic about the answer to this question. I don't know. Okay, alright. When did I start? I think it's going slower than that, yeah. 14 minutes ago. Oh dear. Okay. All right. Good. Okay. Okay. In that case, I will. Okay, in that case, I will not define cat zero Q complex. I'm going to assume we all know what a cat zero Q complex is. Okay, so here's a theorem. So this is a theorem that went on the archive earlier this year. Let G be the fundamental group of X, where X is a non-positively curved cube complex. Cube complex if G is hyperbolic then unless G is the fundamental group of a surface there is a quasi-convex Quasi-convex subgroup H of G such that firstly the index of H in G is infinite and secondly H is not free. Okay? So in other words, this answers this question positively for hyperbolic cubulated. Positively for hyperbolic cubulated groups. But it does a bit better than that, and I really want to point this out because, in practice, this is the thing we really care about. It doesn't just give you some subgroup that's of infinite index of not free. It's a quasi-convex subgroup. And that's somehow much, much better than an arbitrary, possibly infinitely generated subgroup. Okay. All right. Good. So, as I say, so that answers this question in some cases. And as a corollary, we Well, you get quite a few nice corollaries. I'll mention a couple of them. So using, so if you use a result of Capras and Eglund, you get the same for virtually special groups. So in other words, you can. In other words, you can upgrade hyperbolic to vertically special. So that answers wise's question over there. And ticker. And see if you combine this result with a bunch of quite difficult theorems by Of quite difficult theorems by a bunch of people. So, using work of Linton, some work that I did with Lars Lauder, and then a paper of Garden, Keelak, and Logan. So, if you add in all those things to the mixture, Mixture, you can deduce from this theorem the answer to this question for one-related groups as well. So you get to conclude that RQ1 holds for one related group. Although I'd like to point out here that you don't get, you know, obviously, you know, this thing gives you a quasi-convex infinite index subgroup. That doesn't even mean anything for one-way groups. You just, in general, in the one Books and actually you just in general, in the one data case, you just get a non-free subtle dividing vector. It might even be infinitely generated. Okay. Question. Yeah. So, can you say anything about H except that it's not true? So, for example, if I could say that it had a positive second Betty number, I'd be super happy. But I can't say that. Okay, so, but that leads me very nicely into the rest of what I'd like. Nicely into the rest of what I'd like to say. Yeah, okay, good. So I'm not going to be able to, in the time available, I'm not going to be able to tell you the whole proof of this, or even all of the ingredients that go into the proof. But I would like to try to spend the rest of my time to tell you, to advertise one of the new tools that had to be invented in order to prove this theorem, which seems to me to be quite a fundamental. Which seems to me to be quite a fundamental and nice way to think about certain things in context of cats or Q complexes. Anyway, I thought you might wait to hear about it. And that's just one of the tools that goes into answering this question. Revenance, yeah. Okay. And that's my section two. Might have complexes. Okay. And the point is that in order to prove this theorem, you need to have a criterion that tells you that some group is not free. And so that's the basic problem you're going to have to solve. Have to solve. So imagine I've given you a non-positivity curved cube complex, and I ask you, is the Fabernet group free? You've just got it sitting on, haven't we? How are you going to tell? If it happens to be a graph, you know it is free. If it doesn't happen to be a graph, hard to know, right? Okay, and so these are a tool that are specifically designed to answer that question. Specifically designed to answer that question. And at the end, I'll try to finish with a nice criterion. It's not an if and only if, but it's a very nice, sufficient condition that you can just stare at a key concept and say, oh, it's fundamental group as well. So hopefully that works. And as you can imagine, that kind of thing is useful for this, for proving it. Okay. So I need to define, and the tool comes from these things called Yecom. Let's start with the definition. Let's start with the definition. Okay. So, in general, we're interested in some non-positively curved cubic complex x, and that means that it's a universal cover. x twiddle is cat zero. So this will be a cat zero. We've got a cat zero x twiddle that's covering x. And we're going to be interested in a convex subconvex. A convex subcomplex, in fact a compact, it'll always be a compact convex subcomplex next to it. Okay, so let me draw a picture. Here we go, here's my cat in the cube complex. It's not a very difficult one. It's not a very difficult one. And here is, so X Trill, that's my picture of X Triddle. It's the squareulated plane. And here is a convex subconverse. So, hopefully, that picture makes sense. So, we need to talk about the bounding hyperplanes of the convex subcomplex. Now, okay, so a Q complex has all of these hyperplanes running through it. The bounding hyperplanes are the ones that are, for Y, are the ones that are right next to Y. In other words, they're the hyperplanes for which no other hyperplane separates them from Y. Okay, sorry. Hyperplane. Hyperplane H next rhythm bounce, uh bounce why if no other hyperplane separates it from water. Okay, so in this picture, the downing hyperplanes are The downing hacker planes. Ah. These words. Yes. Do you need to insist that they're. Yes, sorry. They're disjoint from Y and no one hyperplane separates them from Y. Yeah. Okay. That is correct. Okay. I won't write that down. Okay, very good. Alright, so we've got, in this case, we've got four boundary mechanics. Can everyone see the colours? I can try to pick out more visible colours, or is that okay? The blue one is indistinguishable. The blue one is indistinguishable. Okay, let's try. We've used yellow, which in my experience is the only visible colour on these candid boards. Ooh, this purple is Hagamora, so maybe it'll be better. Ooh, that's lots of Hagamora. Is the purple better than the blue? Yeah, okay, good, good, cool. Alright, good. Okay, so now what is the whitehead complex of Y? The whitehead complex of Y is a natural simplicity. It's a natural simplicity complex whose vertices are the bounding hyperplanes. And then you put simplices in when they intersect. So it's the kind of game we play, we like to play all the time. So w y as vertices are the bounding hyperplanes of y and a set of them, h0 up. Of them, H0 up to Hn span a simplex, spans a simplex if and only if the intersection is lined. So in this case over here, bottom, I'll try to draw a picture. Paint picture, I don't believe the y is a complex of y, and what we see is that we've got four bounding hyperplanes, and this one intersects these two, so I draw these two, and this one intersects these two, so the white-head complex mix up. Why am I calling it a white-head complex? Because, so it's a it's it's it's because it's an analogy, but even more it actually generalizes the white Generalizes the white hip graphs that people use to study free group automorphisms. And one of the things you can do with white-hip graphs is you can tell if a free group splits relative to an element of the free group. So likewise here, we're going to be looking for splittings of the fundamental group of this guy here, and these whitehead complexes are going to help us to do that in exactly the same way the whitehead graphs help you to do that in the context of frequency. Alright. Okay, so that's the definition. Now let me point out that. So I've given you one specific example over here, but there's another sort of very important object that you've probably thought about a bit, but this generalizes. If y happens to just be a single vertex of x twiddle, then the white head complex is just the link of that vortex. Might be complex, but y is equal to the length next to it or. Okay, and that's true more or less by definition, but very, very close. All right, now. Now, what have these got to do with splittings? Well, if you combine Stalin's end theory, Staling's Enz theorem with, if you combine Staling's Enz theorem with a theorem of Edwin's about convex hulls and cube complexes, you get a very nice statement, which is that which is that pi 1 of x is isomorphic to a free product in a non-trivial way. Free product in a non-trivial way if and only if there is a y such that the white head, the complex of y is disconnected. You should think to yourself, well, Starlings tells me that if you split freely, that means there's some compact subset of x twiddle that divides x twiddle into two. Admin tells Two, Admin tells you that you can make that compact thing convex. And now, because it divides the thing into two, its white-head complex is going to be this kind of thing. That's the idea. So this is what white-head complexes have got to do with splittings. Now, this is not completely satisfactory because, although we know it tells you there is such a compact y, but it doesn't tell you how big this one is. So it could still be hard to find this compact, it could be massive. So this is a good first step. It doesn't assume that x is. Step. You have to assume that x is essential or something. Yes, thank you. I was hoping you would ask that. Yes, this is, I've lied here. I have to assume that x is essential for this teacher, but I don't have time to define it essential in the mix. 10 minutes. Sorry? 11 minutes? Okay. Yes, but yes, this is one place where I'm going to deliver. So yes, let's just say X is essential. And if you want to know what essential is, ask Sam, because he knows a lot about essentials. A lot of annotations. Very good. Okay. So how are we going to, so this is fine, but what we'd like to, you know, for example, we'd like to have a criterion that says, oh, let's, that no such y exists. How are we going to figure out such a criterion? Well, we're going to look at this picture and we're going to understand what happens when we cut y along a hyperplane. Okay, that's what we want to do. So our goal is to. So, our goal is to understand what happens to white-head complexes when we cut y into two pieces. So, we're going to take another hyperplane, we're going to cuts y into two, and that's going to divide y into two smaller things, y1 and y2. Are those visible? Oh, no? Okay. Oh, okay. Let's try a different colour. Um the orange was the orange okay? Ish? Okay. Green? Better? Worse? Worse? I think the red is as good as it's getting twice there. Sorry? Go back to white. Yeah, let's try that. Let's try that. It's a good idea. Alright. That's it. Okay, so hopefully the picture is that we've got Y, it's a compact subcomplex. We take some hyperplane that does intersect it now. That does intersect it now, we cut along it, that'll cut it into two subcomplexes, and we want to understand how the whitehead graphs are related. And it turns out that the whitehead graphs are related via connect sum. Now, it might throw you slightly for a loop, because if you were like me when I started this project, you would think to yourself, well, connectSub is something about manifolds. But if you think a bit hard about what the definition of connect sub is for manifolds, you realize that it might. Of connects, I know manifolds, you realize that it makes just as much sense in the context of simplicial complexes. So, lemma, this number one. So, in the context of this thing, what I'm going to say is that y is the union of y1 and y2 along k. Right, that's the way I'm going to notate that. So, the whitehead graph of y1 union y2 along k is equal to. Is equal to the white hippograph of y1 and the white hippograph of y2 connect sum along k. So I better tell you what that means. So here, yeah, here denotes connect the sum of simplicial Complexes. Okay, so what does that mean? Well, what's the connect sum of a pair of manifolds? Okay, take your manifolds, you take a point in each, you delete an open ball around those two points, and you have to choose an identification of the links of those two points, in other words, the boundary of the open ball. And if you've got such an identification, then you can define the connect sum. Identification, then you can define the connect sum by. Now, the same thing is true for simplicial complexes. If you've got two vertices and their links happen to be isomorphic, you can delete their open stars and then glue the links together. And that's the same definition. And that's what connects signs. Now, so about 15 years ago, Jason wrote a paper about whitehead graphs, classical whitehead graphs, where he invented a notion called splicing, which was designed to study. Which was designed to study the way that whitehead graphs can transform in certain ways. And it turns out that this is that splicing is closely related to this connect. This somehow generalizes Jason's splicing, the splicing notion in a particular way. So I don't have time to tell you about splicing now, probably time, but I wanted to acknowledge Jason there, because somehow that paper is the beginning of a very long journey for me, which kind of ends here. So yeah, good. Okay, so let's all right. Alright, so that's the definition. I think rather than write down the definition of connects under some visual complexes, I'm going to just define by example using this example over here. So let's do this example over there. I better keep that drawing up so I've got our arrays here. So, definition of some by example. Okay, so let's see. So, what's the white hip graph of Y1? Well, it's got three, Y1 has three bounding hyperplanes, three purple ones and an orange one. Purple, purple, purple. Purple, purple, orange. And that is the whitehead graph of Y1. The whitehead graph of Y2 in my picture looks rather similar, like this. Also, three purple ones and an orange one. That's the white graph of Y2. So, when you connect some of them, you have to connect some over a particular vertex which you happen to have an identification of the length. And in this case, the vertex is k. In other words, it's this hyperplane here, which is the two orange vertices there. And what does ConnectSun do? What you do is you delete the two open stars, so that's the orange bit here and the orange bit here, and then you glue together the links, which are these two. Together, the links, which are these two vertices. You get those two things and you glue them together, and you get this code here. Okay, great. Okay, all right. Good. Okay, so that's what connect sum is. And that's how that is how whitehead graphs change when we cut up the conference. Okay, good. Okay. Good. Alright. So, let's see. So, we want to know if we can have a disconnected Y, and we want to know if we can have a disconnected Y. And we know that if we do have a disconnected Y, then we can cut up Y along a hyperplane, and the disconnected whitehead graph will decompose like this. So, the next thing we'd like to do is to understand how connects. To do is to understand how connectivity properties of complexes change under connect sign. So I'm going to prove lemmas like the next one, so you just have some fun with exact sequences and the other sorts of things you want to use to study connectivity properties, and you prove lemmas like this next way. The next lemma says, Number two, W1 and W2 are connected without cut vertices. So a cut vertex is a vertex that if you delete it, it disconnects the whole space. If they're connecting bound cutresses, then the white, then, sorry. Then the white, then sorry, then w1 connect sum w2 is connected. Okay. So that's the kind of level you can prove. I'm not going to give you the proof, but it just involves having fun with exact sequences. It's seriously the kind of thing that if you feel like you don't spend enough of your life using the Maribyator sequence, then proving this lemma will rectify it. It's connected without the calorics? No. Unfortunately, you have to be able to do that. No, unfortunately, you might then introduce a cut vertex, so you do have to be a bit cautious about that. But this is like the first kind of lemma you can prove in this direction. And so if you combine these ideas with lemmas like this one, you can prove theorems like the one I'll write down now, which is a nice example of a which is a nice example of a Of a criterion that tells you if a cube complex falls free or not. So let X be a non-positively curved cube complex if every link of every vertex has no Has no cut simplices. So a cut simplex is like a cut vertex, meaning it's a simplex. If you delete it, it just connects the whole space. Then the fundamental group does not split as a free product for A and B contributing. And in particular, it's not free. And in particular, it's not free. So, hopefully, you agree that this really is a concrete criterion that you should be able to use. If I give you a capital review complex, you can work out what all the links of all the vertices are and you can just go looking for cut vertices. Sorry, cut sympathies. And if you don't see any, you won't. Good. Okay. I think I'm out of time, so I'll stop there. Thanks for your attention. How is this related to your ridiculous question? Okay, so in order to prove my theorem A, we need a criterion that tells you that the H That tells you that the H we produce is not free. One of the conclusions is that H is not free. So this is an example of a criterion that tells you that the fundamental group of cell Q complex is not free. Sorry? Can I get a trivial? No, it can't actually. It's slightly subtle to get yourself. When you're trying to look for this behaviour, the question of whether or not it's a trivial loop is another thing you should worry about. There's another thing you should worry about, but in this case, it can't be done. So, the age that you produce, we end, is it a hyperplane structure, or maybe not? So, I can give you the idea of what you do. It's not a hyperplane structure. You should definitely think. Right, so it is true. It's a disarming question because you think to yourself, well, hang on a second, all the hyperplanes have got to be free for all of the infinite and data. So, that should make it really easy. But it doesn't seem to help that observation at all. So, what you do is you take a look at the free. So what you do is, you take your cube complex, because it's virtually special, you can pass to a cover where the hyperplanes are embedded. What you'd like to do now is to delete one of those hyperplanes, look at what you've got left, and say that's not a free group. And to do that, and if you just do that naively, it might be a free group. But you need to prove a criterion that enables you to say, if you put this to a really, really, really deep cover, and then only delete. Really deep cover, and then only delete one of the hyperplanes, then what you get left is. So, that's, I mean, there's a lot more to that story which I haven't had time to talk about. But white head complexes are crucial to making sense of the criterion that you under uses. Where do you get the quasi-complex retains? Sorry? In DRMA, where do you get the quasi-complex? Because, so in the sketch, I just wave my hands about. What do you do? You've got a cube complex, you pass to some very deep cover. You pass to some very deep cover, you delete a hyperplane, the thing you've got left is obviously quasi-that's and that's what it is. That's the pH. The d difficult thing is to see that what you've got left is not, its fundamental group is not free. That's why you need theorems like theorem D, not exactly theorem D, but things like theorem D to apply to. Do you know examples where all the hyperplane subgroups are free, but um one of the sort of hyperplane competences? So all the hydroplane subgroups are free when you have this non-free kind of hyperplane. I don't know an example off the top of my head. But you should bear in mind, for example, there are cube complexes with one hyperplane who's fundamentally. I mean, that's not, it's definitely not embedded in the hyperplane, but I mean, just to sort of give you an idea of how sort of somehow. Yeah. So that a check. Yeah. With the interest of keeping to schedule, we'll start.
