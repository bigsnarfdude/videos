Thank you very much. I'm really grateful for the invitation to this wonderful place. And thank you for the opportunity to speak. Everything I'm going to speak about is a joint work with Urban Connect. And And this is about the volumes of sections of the cube. This is a classical topic. If you consider central sections, then the extramisers for the hyperplane sections are known if you take a q q n in our n of volume one. Of volume one. So this is a scaled L infinity pole. Then the minimal section by Hansley is the coordinate one. So if the dimension of E is n minus one, then the minimal volume section is the section orthogonal to a coordinate vector. Orthogonal to a coordinate vector, and its volume is 1. The maximal volume section was determined by Paul, and this is a section orthogonal to the vector, say, 1 or square root of 2 E1 plus E2, and its volume is square root of 2, so the ratio of the So the ratio of the volumes of maximal and minimal section is bounded by a constant independent of the dimension sorry, of the dimension of the ambient space. And it can be extended to the sections of arbitrary dimensions if you have the dimensions. But the dimension of E and minus D, and D is a fixed number, then the minimal section will be coordinate. Its volume is 1. It's a result of valer. And the maximal is going to be at most square root of 2 to the power d. It was also a result of ball. So for the central sections, everything is known. Sections, everything is known. Much less is known for non-central sections, and here the results are scars. There is a result of Moody Tone and Zvovich, who determined that a maximal hyperblading section. Maximal hyperplane section of the cube so that the difference, so that the distance to the origin is almost the maximum. The distance is greater than square root of n minus 2. And there is a result of Bart and Koldowski about the slabs. Dobsky about the slabs. So the questions I'm going to discuss comes from this relation obtained as a combination of Ball's and Balder's results that the volume of the maximal section over the volume of the minimal section is bounded by a constant depending. By a constant depending only on the codimension. What happens if we consider not central but sections by a subspace which are passing relatively far from the center. Of course, the section of the smallest volume will be bounded by the central section. Section and so the volume, sorry, of the largest volume is bounded by the central section, so the volume of the maximal section will be bounded. What about minimal section? So we want to determine the volume of the minimal section, or at least estimate it, passing at a certain distance from a ball. And the problem becomes trivial if the The problem becomes trivial if the distance is greater than one half. This is one half, because I can draw a section which is missing the cube entirely. And the question is whether we can find how far is this relation that the minimal section, the volume of the minimal section of the ball. Of the minimal section of the ball is bounded below by a constant, can be extended. It cannot be extended for the distance is greater than one half. But how close to one half can we get? And here is the answer in a general codimension. So again, let E Uh e around space we have a dimension minus d, so call dimension d and let x m t per the Euclidean. The Euclidean norm of x is less or equal than one-half, and then the volume of Qn intersected with X plus E is bounded below by a constant minimum of D. So if I consider this minimal section Minimal section of a cube, then it is one when the distance to the origin, x is the distance to the origin, is zero, then it somehow decreases but remains large, relatively large, up to the distance one-half, and then it drops to zero. There is a discontinuity here. To zero, there is a discontinuity here. So the and the distance one-half is, of course, up. Now why cube and why the Euclidean distance? First, if you consider say an L P ball with P is not infinity, you would not get You would not get this sharp transition. The distance will approach zero continuously. Second, why wouldn't we consider a more general distance than the Euclidean? We can consider, for example, Lp distance, but if P is less than 2, this will immediately... This will immediately follow from this result. If p is greater than 2, this is just not true because if you consider even a hyperplane section orthogonal to the diagonal of the cube, then the volume of this section will The distance t from the origin will be well approximated by the normal density and if the distance becomes if the L P distance is one, then the Euclidean distance will be tending to infinity. Tending to infinity, so you will have a density tending to zero. So here, both the cube and the ingredient distance are going to be necessary. Well, the drawback of this result is that it has a constant depending on the code dimension, but we don't have a good But we don't have a good control of this constant. So we tried to get this control, and this was possible in codimension one. So this is a second result and let's say that Where to Earth co-dimension one and then my bet volume for again for NX and K curve norm X X less or equal than one-half. The volume of Q and intersect with E plus X is bounded above by 1 17th. This is not an optimal constant, but at least this is some numerical constant. Constant, and actually, you cannot improve it more than five times as the estimate for the section orthogonal to the main diagonal shows. And if your distance is epsilon, let's say, is it going to be strictly smaller than one immediately? I don't know. But at least yes, sorry, yes, I know it. It will be. Really? For every action of again, you consider sections orthogonal to the main diagonal. Oh no, no, sorry. Starting from yes, starting from some distance. Okay. Okay. So in the remaining time, let me say a few words about the way to prove it. The proofs here are completely different and the proof of theorem one are related to the different Relies on two descriptions of this quantity. One is direct, it's a volume of a section of a cube. This is a geometric description. But I cannot consider a probabilistic description. I can introduce a random vector uniformly distributed in a qubit. This is a vector with independent coordinates. And then I take a marginal of A marginal of this vector, a projection of it onto the curve, and it gives me a density, and the volume is the density. So we can use probabilistic tools, and the proof relies on constantly switching between geometric and probabilistic description. So, first, let's consider A space E perb, and let's take a projection of the orthonormal basis on E perb. This will be some frame which forms John's decomposition. And assume that our space E intersects shift of the space. Shift of the space E intersects it at the point X, which is somewhere here. The first case will assume that it is exactly on, falls on into the projection of one of the unit vectors. And also, the projection of this unit vector is the norm close to one, which means that the subspace is almost orthogonal to the coordinate. Almost orthogonal to the coordinate subspace. In this case, we use characteristic functions and calculations based on the characteristic function. And fortunately, it works, and it works exactly because I have a great simplification. My vector falls on the projection of the correlated vector. But this is the only case where I have a very different vector. The only case where such calculations work. Then, starting from this, we extend our lower bound to the vectors close to this projection of the coordinate vectors. And this is done geometrically. This relies on log concavity. Well, this way we treat it the vector which is close to the projection of the coordinate vector, but most of the vectors are not. So what can we do in this case? Let's consider the density of this projection, the density of this random variable. It's log concave. Concave so that a level set is going to be convex. So let's say that this is the vector x and I take the density which is greater than the points where the density is greater or equal than the density at x and this is a convex body I take as supporting hyperplane in equal to this. Plane in Eperf to this convex body. And then there is an obvious observation. One is that the density here is greater or equal than the density in the point orthogonal to this supporting hyperplane. And second, this is not obvious, but this is simple. The density can be estimated below by some power of the measure. The measure of this half space. Very well. So we have to estimate either this or the measure of the half space. And let's assume that our vector is not close to one of the coordinate vectors. Then we split the situation in two parts. It can be either compressible. Be either compressible, which means that there are few large coordinates, and others are very small, or incompressible. There are many relatively small coordinates, and the mass falling on these coordinates is non-negligible. In the second case, we use this hyperplane approach and combine it with a probabilistic estimate. The probabilistic estimate. So as soon as I consider a projection onto the hyperplane, the situation becomes one-dimensional. And we have a nice probabilistic approximation, which allows us to estimate the probability that it falls above a certain level. If it is compressible, then we and this is done by dropping a few large coordinates. If it's compressible, we do exactly the opposite. We drop the small coordinates, and then we can try to estimate again the probability that the vector falls. That the vector falls into the half space, but it wouldn't work because if the half space is too close to the coordinate, one suppose that my cube is this and the half space is like this, the measure of the half space may be arbitrarily small. But this occurs only But this occurs only if our subspace is almost orthogonal to the coordinate vector, and this was already treated. What happens otherwise, we drop the small coordinates and we rephrase this problem again into the geometric language, but this time. Geometric language, but this time the dimension is fixed. The dimension is fixed, we are far away from the coordinate directions, and then just the elementary convex geometry considerations yield the result. As for the theorem, for theorem 2, the approach is completely different. It turns out that there is an An exact formula or the density of the projection. Of course, you can get it using characteristic functions. And this is a fruitful approach. It was used by Ball for upper estimates. Because for upper estimates, you can take the integral of the absolute value of the characteristic function and estimate it above. For the lower estimate, Absolute value is useless, and there are a lot of cancellations, so we want to do something different. And luckily, there is a formula for this section. And if the norm of x is one-half, then the formula is let me just let me save time and write that this is. And write that this is V of X V of X is the integral over S two to the power n of the norm of the sum The sum of x j u j euclid sorry one one over this norm d u one etc d u and under the condition that this norm is at least one. Least one. Okay. And here I consider the probability measures on the spheres. So these are spheres S2 in R3 and we have to estimate this quantity below. The advantage is that this is always positive and this And this linear combination is relatively easy to show that it's sub-Gaussian, which means that the tails decay very fast. But if the tails decay very fast, what determines the value of the integral are norms close to one and the kick one. And the key quantity is going to be the probability that the sum, the norm of the sum j from 1 to n, x j u j is greater ripple than 1. So x j is here, sorry, it's not x j, it's 2x. It's not xj, it's 2xj. So let let me call say w equal to x. Then I have wj xj. What is what here? Wj uj. Wj are fixed numbers and the Euclidean norm of the vector w is 1. is 1. uj are independent identically distributed random vectors in S2. So the average of the squared norm is going to be 1 and we want to bound below the probability that it is probability that it is greater than the expectation of the square. And this is actually the main part bounding this probability is the main part of the proof of theorem 2. G if you square this quantity I still have that. So, if you square this quantity, you get one plus two halves. J different from K V W J W K U J U K. This is a bilinear form, and we want to have it a greater equal than one, which means that we want this form to be non-negative. Let's call it. Let's call it S. So we want the probability of S to be non-negative and we want to bound this below. And this can be done, this is done considering special Orlich norms using Similar to the psi one norm to the exponential moment, but somewhat different. And it is not difficult to calculate the Laplace transform of S because it's a bilinear form, but But for this bound, the Laplace transform of S doesn't give anything. We have to calculate the rest of Laplace transform of S plus and the estimate of this Laplace transform and in combination with the original estimates. Already honorable estimates field the whole result. I guess please have 20 seconds, but I'll stop here. Thank you, Mark. Any questions? So down by the proof that you don't have any characterization of the minimized vector, is that correct? Absolutely not. But would you conjecture that at some point it has conjecture that at some point it has to become the 11111. Probably. Yes. Yes, that's the feeling. Or this with the version 23 no. And returning to my first question actually, your answer was not entirely fulfilling because I think that you're correct that if epsilon is bigger than 1 over square root of n. Right, right, right. But then if for very small epsilon infinitely do you think there would be a phase transition? Do you think there would be a phase transition? That's what I was gonna say. Can this verse turn that verse? No, I can actually. I would uh this this is special to S2. What about S3? I didn't have time to talk about S3, S3 is also important. I mean the three-dimensional sphere, you can consider the same problem. Consider the same problem, but for the complex cube. And what appears in the complex cube is the same integral, but with a 3 instead of a 2. And we have also a similar result for the complex cube, only with 1 over 27 instead of 1 over 17. And it's 4? I mean, that's 24. You can do it in any dimension, but these two are meaningful dimensions. What if you were placed QN by some other convex body, special or general? Can you say anything? Again, there is no disc phase transition if the body is The body is smooth. For the polytopes, I don't know. But probably it can be, something can be done. But why is QN so important? No, I mean replaced it by some other body. Which body? Exactly. This is my my question. We cannot replace it with a smooth one. Polytops could be natural. But polytops could be natural. I don't know the answer for polytops. For other polytops. And the next stop will be in two minutes we'll replace marks by another place. More mean full fear.
