For the last talk of this morning's session or evening session, we have Emmanuel Milman who will talk on the Log Minkowski problem. Please. Great. Thank you very much, Alina. And also, thank you very much to all the other organizers for the invitation. It's a pleasure to speak here. And I'd like to start by apologizing to many of the other participants because I was not able to attend their talks. So, right, this Talks. So, right this year, I'm situated in the US, which makes it particularly difficult with the time difference. And also, I had a couple of private personal events earlier this week. So, I'm sorry, I'll try to at least make it up in some have decent talk, I hope. So, let me doing a little bit of a yeah. Yeah, let me start with some standard notations which we use, which we use in convexity. So I'll denote by this calligraphic K the collection of all convex compact sets with a non-empty interior. And in fact, for the purposes of this talk, it'll be useful to always assume that the origin lies in the interior of K of these convex bodies. Okay, we'll denote by H of K the corresponding support function, just the width in a given. Support function, just the width in a given direction of k, and we extend this as a one-homogeneous function on our n, as is usual. I'll denote by n the unit outer normal to the boundary of k at a given point x, and thanks to convexity, of course, we know this exists almost everywhere. And finally, I'll denote by s of k the surface area, a measure of k, which lives on the unit sphere. And I denote the unit sphere by this s here. Sphere by this s here. How is it defined? This is just given by using the outer normal and pushing forward the n minus one dimensional Hausdorff measure on the boundaries. This is just the Gauss map, and you push forward the usual boundary measure onto the sphere, onto the unit sphere. Okay, so that is the surface area measure of K. I'll denote by M the induced Lebesgue measure on the unit sphere. And finally, I'll use this notation. So we're going to denote by K2 plus the collection of 2 plus the collection of all C-tooth smooth convex bodies with strictly positive, let's say, Gauss curvature. So, Gauss curvature is denoted by this kappa. This is just the determinant of the second fundamental form of the boundary. And once you have these assumptions, then you can, of course, perform the computation. You can calculate the Jacobian of the Gauss map. And you will see that the surface area measure always has a density with respect to Lebesgue, which is given by the determinant of this. Of this n minus one by n minus one positive definite matrix, which I denote by d squared of the support function. So, what is this d squared of the support function? There are a couple of equivalent ways to define it. First way is just to use the usual flat Euclidean connection on our n. Just take two standard derivatives of the support function, which is recall one homogeneous. But then the problem is that in the radial direction, of course, the function just increases. And of course, the function just increases linearly, so the second derivative is zero. So you want to just be perpendicular to that direction. So you restrict to the tangent space to the sphere. Equivalently, if you prefer to take derivatives on the sphere, so you take the second covariant derivatives of the support function on the sphere. But then since the sphere itself has curvature equal to one, then you have to add back in the support function times the identity. Okay, so this is this. Okay, so this is this tensor, and this is the Jacobian of the Gauss map. The only thing I'll also mention is that this Jacobian is also equal to the reciprocal of the Gaussian curvature. Okay, I'll use this maybe once later on. Okay, so this is all very standard. So the starting point of our work is the classical problem posed by Minkowski, posed and answered by Minkowski and Alexandrov. By Aminkovsky and Alexandrov, which is to characterize the collect all measures on the unit sphere, which arise as the surface area measure of some convex body k. Now, if this measure has a density f with respect to the bag, and if this k belongs to this nice class, then you just write equality of densities, and this amounts to the classical Mungeon-Pere partial differential equation, the determinant of the second derivative here. Of the second derivative here of the support function should be equal to f, and you want to solve this equation for convex body k. Okay? So as it turns out, if you want to solve this equation, there are two easily seen necessary conditions, which turn out to also be sufficient conditions. The first is just that the bare center of the measure should be at the origin. And the second is that the measure mu should not be concentrated on a single. Not be concentrated on a single hemisphere because otherwise the resulting body would not be compact. Okay, and it turns out that this is a characterization of the existence question. You also have uniqueness for this problem. There's a unique convex body, of course, up to translations, because if you translate your convex body, then nothing happens to the support, to the surface area measure. So uniqueness actually is an easy consequence of the classical Brun-Minkowski inequality, which has been. Minkowski inequality, which has been mentioned a thousand times already in this workshop, which states that the nth root of the volume of K plus L, I'll recall in a second what is K plus L, the Minkowski sum, is at least as large as the nth root of volume of K plus the nth root of the volume of L with equality. The point is that the equality conditions here are characterized. This yields a uniqueness with equality if and only if L is a homothetic copy of K. So you're allowed to translate and to K. So you're allowed to translate and to dilate K. Okay, so that takes care of existence and uniqueness. And as is well known, this Minkowski's problem served as a great impetus to the development of the theory of a fully non-linear elliptic PDE. This Munden-Perry equation is by now classical, and many people have worked on the regularity theory, like Levy, Nierenberg, Cheng and Yao, Pogarelov, of course, Caffarelli, and many others. Of course, Caffarelli, and many others. So, for example, if you know that the density F is strictly positive and belongs to the class CmÎ±, then the resulting convex body K will be a Cm plus 2 alpha smooth, and of course, with strictly positive curvature. Okay, so these are all landmark results and very well known. Yeah, I promise to recall what is the Minkowski summation here. So, this is just set-wise summation. Set Y summation. So you take all points in K, all points in Y, add them, and if you want, you can also multiply by some coefficients here. And the nice thing about this operation of Minkowski summation is that on the level of support functions, you just get a linear addition, linear addition of the support function. So that's very nice. Now, in the 60s, Fiery suggested to use another type of summation. He called the LP-Minkowski sum. Minkowski sum, which we denote as follows. And instead of taking the L1 combination of the support functions, he suggested to take the Lp combination of the support functions. Okay, and we use this notation. And notice here, just a little remark. You see this little dot here marked and maybe red. I hope you see it. The point is that this dot is not dilation of k by a factor of a, but rather by a pth root of a, as you can see from this formula. As you can see from this formula, we take the pth root. So, in principle, it does depend on p, but it's traditional to suppress the dependence on p because otherwise the notation just becomes too cluttered. So, this is a useful kind of generalization of Minkowski sum. For example, if you have two ellipsoids, then in general, their Minkowski sum will not be an ellipsoid, but their L2 Minkowski sum will always still be an ellipsoid. So, that's very useful. In addition, by the way, can you hear me? Just a little feedback. Just yes, okay. So, in addition, February established the LP Bruminkovsky inequality. So, let's assume that P is now strictly larger than one. Then he showed that the volume of the L P combination of K and L, but now you have to raise the volume not to the power of one over N, but to the power of P over N, is larger than the corresponding. Larger than the corresponding thing with equality, if and only if L is just a dilation of K. Now there are no translations allowed because P is strictly greater than one, and in this case, translations don't really commute well with this operation. Okay, and really, actually, this inequality, it's important to understand that actually it's a consequence of the classical Bruminkovsky inequality and just an application of Jensen's inequality because it's immediate to check on the level. Inequality because it's immediate to check on the level of support functions that this body actually contains this LP combination actually contains the usual classical Minkowski combination. And then you just kind of optimize on the scaling, use the homogeneity of the Lebesgue measure and conclude. Okay, so the more this is, and for me, it was yesterday. So in terms of yesterday's talk, this would be an LP transference principle. So the moral of the story is that when you increase P, the thing That when you increase P, the things become easier just by kind of Jensen's inequality. Okay, now in the 90s, Erwin Lutwack significantly developed and advocated and was a big proponent of the LP-Bruminkovsky theory. So for example, just as the surface area measure of K, just as it arises as the first variation of the volume with respect to Minkowski addition, then Addition, then Irwin said, Okay, let's take a first variation of volume with respect to L P Minkowski addition. What kind of measure will I get here? And he called this measure the L P surface area measure, denoted by this S P of K. And it turns out, if you perform the calculation, this is the usual surface area measure times an additional factor, the support function raised to the power of 1 minus p. And indeed, when p is equal to 1, you get back the classical case. And now, Case. And now the natural question asked by Bailutwak is the L P-Minkowski problem. That is to characterize all measures on the unit sphere, which arise as the LP surface area of some convex body. And again, on the level of PDEs, this means that you have your Manjum-Per equation, but with an additional factor, an additional nonlinearity on the left-hand side. Okay? And this changes the problem. So when P is larger than 1, So, when p is larger than one and the measure is even, again, the existence was answered for this question, was answered by Lutrois. Actually, the case p equals n was excluded because this is a scale invariant case. That is, if you dilate k, then nothing happens to the ln surface area measure. So, this case requires a bit of different normalization. And this was done by Lutot, Yang, and Zhang, which, by the way, throughout this talk, I'm going to denote by Lyz. To denote by LYZ. And finally, this is all for when the measure mu is even. When the measure mu is even, things become simpler. But for a general measure, indeed, all of these results were extended in a very important work, which I like very much by Chu and Wang. And again, in all these questions, the existence happens, is characterized if and only if the measure mu is not concentrated on a single hemisphere. Now, there's no need to assume that. No need to assume that the barycenter is at the origin because you have no translation invariance here. Okay. The regularity theory was studied by Lutwak and Oliker and by Chu and Wang, and it turns out to be exactly the same theory as in the classical P equals one case. And also we have uniqueness. Again, no translations now, just plain uniqueness. And again, this is automatic from the equality cases in the FIRE's LP Bruminkovsky inequality. So you have uniqueness automatic. So you have uniqueness automatically. And finally, let me just mention, of course, that if the measure mu is even, then uniqueness automatically will imply that your set K, your convex body K, has to be origin symmetric. Okay, just by uniqueness. And I'll just use this remark to introduce this notation. So you see, origin symmetric bodies are denoted by K sub E. So anytime you see a subscript of E in this talk, this means that something is even, something is. That something is even, something is symmetric with respect to the origin. Okay, so this is what this E stands for: even. Okay? Okay, now everything so far was for P larger than one. And now, let me try to convince you that actually it's also very natural to ask this question for P, which is smaller than one. In particular, the case P equals zero is very natural. Let me try to convince you. If you make the calculation, you will see that. If you make the calculation, you will see that the L0 surface area measure, well, maybe up to some normalization, exactly coincides with what is called the cone volume measure of K, which I denote by V sub K. What is the cone volume measure? So instead of taking this kind of n minus one dimensional surface area element on the boundary and pushing it forward via the Gauss map, what you do is you take this element and you consider the little cone, the n-dimensional. The n-dimensional cone which it spans together with the origin, you take the n-dimensional vonman element now, and now you push this forward onto the unit sphere. So that's a very natural construction, which appears often in convexity. Actually, one of the first instances where it appears is in this work by Firey, very interesting work and very influential, I think, who asked what is the ultimate shape of a worn stone? So consider the following model. So, consider the following model. You have a little stone or whatever or pebble on the beach, and you know it's on the beach. So, waves are hitting it from all directions. Fiery, consider the isotropic case, meaning that all waves hit it with equal likelihood from any direction. And, you know, slowly but surely, the stone gets eroded. And of course, in places where the stone is highly curved, it's going to be eroded faster, right? So, the PDE, the model that Firee proposed, is to say that. is to say that the variation in time is proportional to the Gaussian curvature of the boundary at a given point. And of course, the erosion goes in the direction of the normal. So this is what's called the isotropic Gauss curvature flow. And if this thing is getting eroded, let's say you can show that this thing will converge ultimately to a point. If you can show this, then of course the limiting shape as it converges. Limiting shape as it converges down to a point will be given by self-similar solutions to this to this PDE. What is the self-similar solution? So, just the x is proportional to the variation of x in time, right? So, let's try to solve, let's try to solve this self-let's try to see what is the self-similar solution. So, let's take this equation and take the scalar product with the ultranormal. So, on the left-hand side, the scalar product of x with the ultranormal will give you exactly the support function. Normal will give you exactly the support function. Okay, and on the right-hand side, if you use this PDE, the scalar product with the normal with itself is just one, so you just get the Gauss curvature. But remember, the Gauss curvature is the reciprocal of the determinant of the second derivative of the support function. I said this in the very beginning. So let's move the denominator to the left-hand side and divide by whatever the dimension. And you will see that on the left-hand side, you get exactly the density. Get exactly the density of the cone volume measure, and on the left-hand side, you get a constant. Okay, so this means that self-similar solutions are exactly given when the cone volume measure is proportional to Lebesgue measure. Okay, so the question now is, what kind of convex bodies solve this equation? Of course, the ball does, but maybe there are additional convex bodies. And if IRE showed that, no, there's uniqueness. At least if K is smooth enough and origin symmetric. Smooth enough and origin symmetric, then necessarily any solution to this equation, so con-volunte, cone volume measures proportional to Lebesgue, must be a Euclidean ball. So you have an uniqueness in this particular case. Okay, so Firey's work was very influential and many, many authors like Andrews, Chen, Chao, Wan, Nietzsche, and many others have extended upon this work. And one can extend this in two ways. First of all, In two ways. First of all, why does the change have to be proportional to the Gauss curvature? Maybe you want to raise the Gauss curvature to some positive power alpha. That's one generalization. And another generalization is to consider the anisotropic case because maybe the waves are hitting the stone, not with equal likelihoods. So you can introduce some anisotropic potential row, okay, to take that into account. And then if you repeat the exercise that we just did and you try to calculate what are the You try to calculate what are the self-similar solutions to this equation, it's immediate to calculate, and the self-similar solutions exactly solve this equation. The LP surface area measure of K has to be equal to rho, the anisotropic potential, times Lebesgue measure. But for which value of P? So P and alpha turn out to be related by this relation. Okay, so already it's interesting that when P crosses zero, then alpha crosses one. Zero, then alpha crosses one. Okay, and therefore, I hope I've convinced you that the uniqueness question for this equation is very natural and important because if you had uniqueness, that you would know. Nowadays, it's known, of course, that this was an Anzatz in Fiery's work, but nowadays, I think thanks to the work of Tsu, it's known that indeed this thing will be very well, will be well posed until a maximal time where the solution reaches volume zero. And if you knew that you had If you knew that you had uniqueness for this equation, you could say that, oh, we know the limiting shape as this thing degenerates to a point. Okay, so the uniqueness question is indeed very, very natural. Already, let me tell you that there is a critical exponent to this problem, which prohibits uniqueness for arbitrary p. The critical exponent is p equals minus n. And the reason is that in this case, the L minus n surface area measure is what is called the centro affine. Is what is called the centro affine Gauss curvature. It's called centro affine because it enjoys a nice invariance under centro affine transformations. So what is centroaffine? It's just a synonym for a linear non-degenerate transformation because it's affine and it keeps the center in place, the origin in place. Okay, so if you make the computation, you can show that if you apply a linear transformation and compute the density of the L minus N surface area. Of the L minus n surface area measure, then the right-hand side just changes by, it's being pushed forward by T0, where T0 is kind of a zero homogenization of this linear map. It has to be zero homogeneous because you want it to act from the sphere to itself. Okay, so in particular, this means that if you start with the Euclidean ball and you apply a volume-preserving linear transformation, the right-hand side will not change because this is just the one. not change because this is just the one. This is just the density equals to one. This doesn't do anything. So in particular, all ellipsoids having the same volume give you the same L minus N surface area measure. So you absolutely have no uniqueness, okay, for the critical exponent. And let me just mention for completeness that actually Calabi showed that the only solution to this equation is indeed given by ellipsoids. There are no additional solutions. Okay, so this means that you cannot just expect to have So, this means that you cannot just expect to have uniqueness everywhere. But what about this range? So, you're below one, but above the critical exponent. This is called the subcritical range. What about this range? Do you have uniqueness? And only very recently, it was established by Brendel Choi and Descolopoulos in a paper in ACTA that indeed, without any assumption, of course, this build upon previous works by many people, for example, Andrews, Guan, and me. Example, Andrew's Guan and Ni. But anyway, without any origin symmetric assumptions, that's very important, very difficult. The only solution to this equation is indeed when K is a Euclidean ball, okay, in the entire subcritical range. This is the best possible result. Okay, any questions? Okay, so let me tell you a bit about Let me tell you a bit about the LP-Minkowski problem. I actually want to spend all my time talking about uniqueness. I don't have time to talk about existence, okay? But the existence theory to show that there exists a solution is rather well developed. So somehow, one, the typical way to show existence is to follow the direct method of calculus of relations. You introduce this L-P-Minkowski functional, and it's possible to show that if it attains a minimum. That if it attains a minimum, then the Euler-Lagrange equation at that minimum point will exactly solve your equation. It's not obvious, by the way, because there is an issue with not being convex. And there's anyway, and there's an issue about origin symmetry. I don't have time to talk about this. It's very nice and interesting, but I don't have time. And let me just flash a bunch of, out of respect to our colleagues here, just flash a bunch of existence results. So when the measure is even, When the measure is even, for instance, you have a characterization of when you can expect an origin-symmetric solution. And in fact, something interesting happens at p equals zero. It was shown by Borotsku, Iluto, Yang, and Zhang that actually it's not the usual condition that mu should not be concentrated on a hemisphere. Suddenly, you get something stronger, which is called the subspace concentration condition. Without origin symmetry, it's been shown by Chen, Li, and Zhu that these are sufficient. Li and Zhu, that these are sufficient conditions, but they are not conjectured to be the necessary ones. Okay, so so there is a gap here in terms of what we know. And when you go below zero, then you usually have to assume that the measure has some integrable density. And this is, I said, the state-of-the-art result by Bianchi Borotsky Kolo-Santienyang about existence. Okay, but I really don't have time to talk about existence, unfortunately. Unfortunately, let me move on to talk about uniqueness, which is what my talk is about. So, what about uniqueness? Well, in general, uniqueness in the LP mean costly problem for piece smaller than one is immediately false. Okay, just no chance of having uniqueness in general. And again, many, many people have constructed counterexamples, including Alina. You know, it's always good to score some points with a chairperson because that. With the chairperson, because I can already see that I'm going to run out of time. But anyway, the statement is that as soon as P is below one, you can find two different convex bodies, K and L, having the same L P surface area measure. However, notice that if you fix one of these convex bodies, K, then certainly you can have uniqueness well below one, all the way down to some exponent depending on. Down to some exponent depending on p. For example, this is the Brendel-Choida-Scalopoulos result, right? For if K is the Euclidean ball, you can go all the way down to minus M. So, this question does make sense. That's one remark. A second remark is that all of the counterexamples for positive P's below one, but positive P, were never origin symmetric. They always violated origin symmetry. However, as soon as you cross zero, we showed, for instance, You cross zero, we showed, for instance, in our work with Kolesnikov that you can find origin symmetric counterexamples. So something happens at p equals zero, so it seems with origin symmetry, right? Okay, now let me try to explain why this problem is challenging. The reason is that when you cross, when P is below one, you just don't have a good L P Bruminkovsky theory. Because remember, the uniqueness in when P is one. Remember, the uniqueness when P is larger than one was kind of automatic from the equality cases and the L P-Brominkowski inequality. But now, when P is below one, it's not even clear how to define the L P-Minkowski sum. Before that, we took the LP combination of the support functions, but now this function, if p is smaller than one, this function is not necessarily convex anymore. So the typical solution in the literature is to use the so-called Alexandro. Is to use the so-called Alexandrov body, which is the largest convex body L, largest with respect to inclusion. This is well defined, so that its support function is majorized by this possibly non-convex function. Okay, so at least we have a definition of what is an L-P-Minkowski sum. And now that we have a definition, we can, of course, ask, is it true now that you have the corresponding L-P-Bruminkowski inequality when P is below one? And the answer. Below one? And the answer is that, in general, no. As soon as p is below one, this is just false. You can just see this by taking a cube as the first body and taking a little infinitesimal translation of the cube, and you will easily check that this thing is violent. Okay, so the big idea, which I think is due to Borotsky, Luto, Yang, and Zhang, is, you know what, if this is just wrong, let's just rule out translations. Let's get rid of the problem. How can we rule out translations? Well, let's. Rule out translations well, let's assume that the bodies are both of our bodies are origin symmetric, right? That, of course, rules out translations. And hence, we arrive to the celebrated even-log-Brumnikovsky conjecture of Borodsky, Luto-Gang, and Zhang from almost 10 years ago, which states that indeed when both bodies are origin symmetric, and if P is below one, but not below zero, between zero and one, then you have the corresponding. 0 and 1, then you have the corresponding L P Bruminkovsky inequality. And of course, the case p equals zero is interpreted in the limiting sense by taking the geometric average. Now, again, continuing a comment I gave early on, but Jensen's inequality, notice that these inequalities actually become stronger and stronger as p decreases to zero. So therefore, it's just enough to establish the logarithmic case when p is equal to zero. Okay, so this is basically conjecture. Okay, so this is basically conjecture. And also, I want to remark and put this kind of in a historical perspective: if this conjecture were to be true, this would be a rather dramatic, I think, strengthening of the classical case p equals one. The classical Bruminkovsky inequality has been known for over 120 years, but if you restricted to origin-symmetric bodies, the supernatural class, this would be a rather dramatic strengthening, which would. Dramatic strengthening, which would have gone unnoticed for over 100 years, right? So I think this is a very important and also very interesting problem. Why do we stop at p equals zero? Well, it's just because as soon as you drop below zero, this is just false. You can see this again by using two origin symmetric centered cubes. But if you take their axis lengths to be different, you'll see that this is just false. So p equals zero is kind of the best you can hope for. Okay. Okay. So, this conjecture actually turns out to have many equivalent formulations. So, let me give you this formulation, which is obtained. It's non-obvious. It's obtained by combining the results of Borotsky, Lutuang Yang Zhang, of our work with Kolesnikov. And finally, a very important ingredient is the work by Chen Huang Li and Yu. And this is the statement that the following are equivalent for any P below one up to the critical exponent. The first statement is. It. The first statement is just the uniqueness statement and the LQ Minkowski problem. But what is Q? Q is anything slightly larger than P. Okay, and K and L should belong to this class of C2 alpha smooth bodies with strictly positive curvature. So the first statement is the uniqueness statement and the LQ-Minkowski problem. The second statement is the even L P-Buminkovsky inequality, which we've already mentioned. Already mentioned. And the third statement is kind of a variant of the second, which is the even L-Piminkovsky inequality, stating that the L-Piminkovsky functional, which I briefly mentioned, just attains a minimum whenever L is a dilate of K. Okay, so these turn out to all be equivalent. And I want to, and really the BLYZ conjecture is that any or all, equivalently all of the above hold for the case P equals zero. Case p equals zero, and this is what is called the even log bm or log Minkowski conjecture. Uh, one little comment that I want to make is that you know, maybe some of you have already seen, uh, you know, talks about this problem and you've seen some equivalent formulations, but notice here that I don't assume any equality conditions here or here. Okay, so really the inequality is equivalent to the uniqueness question, okay? And this is exactly why I have to pay a little bit. And this is exactly why I have to pay a little bit of a price to go a little above P. So I think in some traditional formulations, these are stated with the corresponding equality conditions. But here we don't, for this version, we don't need any equality conditions. So what is known about the even log Minkowski conjecture? Well, it's known that it's true for the plane. This was proved by Brodsky, Luton, Yang-Zhang, and given some alternative proofs by Ma, by Xi Lang. And I forgot to mention. And I forgot to mention Puterman. But already, from the mention three, to the best of my knowledge, this is open in general. Let me just, out of respect to our colleagues here at the conference, let me kind of quickly flash some sample results. I mean, definitely this is not extensive by any means. So it was shown by Liran Otem and Christo Saroglou that indeed these conjectures are true when the bodies enjoy some type of Enjoy some type of symmetries like being complex convex bodies or unconditional convex bodies. It was shown by Kolesanti, Galina Lifshitz, Noma Scalietti, Kolesdikovi, myself, and the last piece of information is Cheng Wang Lien Liu, is that these conjectures hold if K is an appropriate perturbation, small, tiny perturbation of just one of the bodies. It's actually enough to be a perturbation of the Euclidean ball. And finally, I want to mention that these conjectures, this is due to Kolesniko and myself and to Chen Huang, Li and Liu. These conjectures are true. So it's not science fiction. It's not some conjecture which is some fantasy. It is true for general convex bodies, origin symmetric convex bodies, slightly below one. So you can break the barrier of one and obtain an improvement of the classical Bruminkovsky inequality. Of the classical Brumikovsky inequality, but unfortunately, we cannot go all the way down to p equals zero. What can we get? Well, in the paper, we got one minus constant over n to the three halves, but actually, thanks to recent advancements in the KLS conjecture due to Yuanzi Chen, if you just use his best possible estimates on the Chiger constant and you plug it into the formula from our paper, you'll immediately see that this improves actually to one minus essentially a constant over n. Okay, so to the best of my knowledge. Over n. Okay, so to the best of my knowledge, that's the state-of-the-art result here for general convex bodies, originally symmetric convex bodies. And the rough idea is in our work, we were able to prove the local uniqueness in the even LP-Minkowski problem. And the important work by Chen Huang Li and Liu adds the local to global step, which we did not know how to do. Okay, and combining them, you get this result. Result. So, this is kind of ancient history by now. And in my last minutes, of course, last, I want to tell you some new things from this year. So, our first main result states the following. So start, assume you have a convex body, C2 alpha smooth, strictly positively curved, of course, origin symmetric. And assume that you can find a linear image of this body, K tilde, so that its principal radii of curvature are pinched between. Curvature are pinched between little r and capital R. Then you can get a positive answer to the uniqueness question and the L-P-Minkowski problem. But for which range of P's? So you can go below one, but how far can you go? Of course, you're going to pay a price depending on the pinching constant squared, but it actually gets multiplied by the dimension. So that's pretty good. We'll see in a second. Okay, so for all. See in a second. Okay, so for all these range of P's, we get the uniqueness, we get a uniqueness statement and the L P Minkowski problem and the corresponding L P Minkowski inequality with characterization of equality cases. Equality holds if and only if L is a dilate of K. And of course, the most interesting case is when can we hit the value of P equals zero? So if you try to solve this condition for P equals zero, the condition is that the rate The condition is that the ratio of the radii squared should be at most something like the dimension over six. So that's that's pretty good, you know, because you know it could really be violently changing. I mean, the curvature, right? So it's not really a small perturbation. It's actually pretty fairly decent. And then we get the case p equals zero. So this means that in this case, we get the uniqueness statement for the cone volume measure and the corresponding log. And the corresponding log-Minkowski inequality with its, I didn't write this, but with its corresponding equality conditions. If you like, you can see this as an extension of the Brendel, Choi, and the Scalapoulos result to self-similar to the uniqueness question of self-similar solutions, but to the pinched anisotropic power of Gauss curvature flow. So let me compare our result to the one by Brendel Choi and Deskolopoulos. So they only treated the case when K here, K is a Euclidean ball. K is a Euclidean ball, so they have the Lebesgue measure on the right-hand side. In fact, you can extend the result to ellipsoids. But anyway, so this means that in their case, the pinching constant is just equal to one, right? All curvatures are the same for the ball. And if you plug this into our formula, you get here one. So this means that with our general formula, you can go all the way down to p, which is something like minus n over two. Whereas the sharp answer, which Brendel Choi das Kalopoulos get is. Which Brendel Choidas Kalopoulos gets is minus n. So we do not get the sharp answer, but we get it up to a factor of two. So it's not so bad, and it works in general under general pinched curvature assumption. Okay, so that's one main result. And a second main result is that we can use the theorem from the previous slide or some version of it to actually resolve all of these conjectures, but not for the original body itself, but rather after some approaches. Body itself, but rather after some appropriate perturbation. Okay, so what is a good way to measure distances between two convex bodies? There are two traditional ways. One is called the geometric distance. So this is just the best sandwiching ratio. How tightly can you pack one convex body inside two homothetic copies of the other body? This is called the geometric distance. And another variant of this is called the Banach-Mazur distance, where you also allow to allow. Where you also allow to apply linear transformations to the bodies to make the sandwiching even better. So, our result is that if you start with your favorite convex body, origin symmetric, k bar, and let's denote by d the Banach-Mazur distance of K bar from the Euclidean ball. And we know by the classical John's theorem that this is always at most the square root of the dimension. Okay, then for any perturbation parameter gamma. Perturbation parameter gamma, you can find another convex body k tilde, which is you know c infinity, smooth, strictly positive, curved, whose distance from the original body is at most gamma. So gamma, you know, controls how much do you allow to change k bar. So that all of these LP-Brunikowski conjectures hold for any linear image of K tilde, but in which range of P's? Again, we can go below one. Again, we can go below one. We have something which depends on gamma, on d, but they get multiplied by the dimension. So that's again pretty good. And therefore, if you try to hit the value of p equals zero, which is the most interesting case, we get the following theorem, which states that for any convex body, the origin symmetric, you can find another convex body which is at most distance eight from it, such that for this new body, the Log-Minkowski conjecture indeed holds for any. Indeed, it holds for any linear image of it. So, this is what I would call the isomorphic resolution of the even Log-Minkowski conjecture. So, you know, the name somehow suggests the analogy to Boas-Clartag's isomorphic resolution of the slicing problem from some 10 years ago. Isomorphic is just nomenclature from Banach space theory because we change the body by a factor of eight. If you don't like this factor of eight, If you don't like this factor of eight and you want to improve it to an isometric result, to one plus epsilon, then you can do this as soon as your original body is essentially not a cube. So essentially, you know, the worst case that it could have in terms of distance from the Euclidean ball is square root of n by John's theorem. But if it's asymptotically below square root of n, then this eight will improve to one plus epsilon according to this formula here. Okay, so this would be an isometric. So, this would be an isometric result. What is going on? Sign in. I'm getting some renewed session. Hold on. Something is happening with my Zoom. Can you still hear me? Yes. Yes. Okay. Something happened. Okay. I know I'm out of time. Like, how many minutes do you have? Do you have like three minutes? I don't know. No. Oh, yeah. Okay. Three minutes. It's okay. Alina, I scored some points. You forgot. Okay. So that's why you have. That's why you have three minutes. Thanks. Okay, so of course, I don't have time to talk about the proofs, but basically, all of our approach is local because, thanks to the local to global results of Chen Huang Li and Yu and later on in a different fashion by Puterman, we know that the problem is local. So, what you can do is you start with your LP surface area measure and just linearize it. And if you do this, you'll uncover a very interesting second-order elliptic operator, which we called the Hilbert-Bruming-Koff. called the Hilbert-Bruminkowski operator because it was actually used by Hilbert over 100 years ago to prove the Bruminkowski inequality. So the entire question turns out to just be a spectral question about the even part of the spectrum. So because everything is origin symmetric, so you only allow yourself to look at even test functions when you try to study the spectrum of this operator. So really the Log-Brominkowski problem. The Log-Brominkowski problem boils down to getting this kind of even bottom-of-the-spectrum lower bound estimate for this operator. And actually, this family of operators has very nice properties. Their spectrum is centro affine invariant. So it's not every day that you find a family of differential operators whose spectrum is invariant under linear transformations. But they have this very nice property. So all of these problems are equivalent. So, all of these problems are equivalent to getting a sharp lower bound. But you could also ask the question: what about a sharp upper bound on the bottom of the even spectrum for this operator? And this is something we asked in our work with Kolesnikov, but we did not know how to solve. But just this year, I did manage to solve this. And it turns out that the sharp bound is indeed attained if and only if K is a centered ellipsoid. So we actually have kind of a spectral characterization. A spectral characterization of centered ellipsoids in this language. If you want, you can call this a Sego-Weinberger type easel spectral bound. And as a corollary of this result, you can actually get new examples, new counter examples to the uniqueness question and the LP-Minkowski problem. Because if you start with any body which is not an ellipsoid, any non-ellipsoid K, our result means that you can find a non- means that you can find a non-empty range of subcritical exponents p, so above minus n, but below some value depending on the body k, for which there is a counterexample to the uniqueness question. And everything is origin symmetric. So you can do these types of names. And just let me conclude by saying how do we prove our results? Really, and if and I think this is actually the most interesting part, not the results themselves, is actually we realize that. Is actually, we realize that it's important to use, and I think I encourage everyone to get into this. It's a beautiful field. One has to use affine differential geometry as opposed to weighted Riemannian geometry. So you're not supposed to use the usual Levitico-Vita connection when you're doing all your L2 estimates and so on. You want to use another affine connection, which is not Levicia-Vita. And the typical normalization that people use is the so-called Blaschke, Blaschke-Berwald equi-affine. Berwald equi-affine normalization, but in our case, you know, we want to use kind of an almost trivial normalization. Normalization means a choice of a normal on the boundary. We want to use the centro affine normalization because it has beautiful properties. And basically, it turns every the boundary of any convex body into a centro affine sphere. So, any convex body is actually a sphere, which means that it has constant, beautiful, positive. Has constant, beautiful, positive rich curvature. And if you know that it has great positive richie curvature, you can use classical tools like Buckner formula and the Lishnirovich estimates, but of course, adapt it to the affine differential geometric setting to get some spectral estimates. And the whole point is that, as it turns out, the Hilbert-Bruminkovsky operator actually coincides with the centro affine Laplacian. It's a usual Laplacian adapted to this centroffine. This centro of fine normalization. And of course, the challenge is to use the evenness of the data to get improved eigenvalue estimates. Anyway, I'm of course out of time. I'll keep this slide a bit longer, but anyway, thank you very much for your attention.
