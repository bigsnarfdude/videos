Like to come like last time, we had a lot of interesting conversations, and hopefully, with COVID over next time, we'll be able to all be together. So, today I wanted to give a short talk on some work that we've been doing. I did together with Jesse Capisilatro and one of my PhD students, Jing Peng. This is a topic that I've been working on from theoretical perspective. On from theoretical perspective, for I guess two or three years now. We published some papers on it, and it has to do with particle-fluid-particle pressure tensor. So, Duane Zhang at Los Alamos has also been publishing on this. And so, we've been working on this in particular in an Euler-Euler and an Euler-Lagrange context. And I want to show you in this particular case why this term turns out to be important. Why this term turns out to be important in a case where it's most important is probably gas-liquid flow because the bubble density is very small compared to liquid. But in this today's talk, it's going to be on liquid-solid flows. So on a sedimentation problem. So let me. Okay, so some background on this. So liquid solid sedimentation. There's some nice DNS data sets that have been coming out of Delft. Coming out of Delft by Wimping von Bruken's group. They're fully resolved directly simulations of homogeneous sedimentation. So it's a 3D periodic box with a gravity pointing downward. The particles fall. In this case, the Galileo number, which is a gives you a ratio, basically tells you how fast they're going to fall. It just means the density difference in gravity. The density difference here is the solids are 1.5 times more dense than the liquid. Dense than the liquid. So it's pretty far from a gas particle flow in that sense because it's just slightly more dense. This results in a single particle Reynolds number of 186. So the particles will fall fairly rapidly, even though the density difference is not enormous. The DNS data set they have are for particle volume fractions between 005 and 0.30. It's well known in these systems. It's well known in these systems that the settling velocity. So, for when you have a group, this is for terminal velocity for a single particle, and then for settling velocity is the group particle effects. There's group effects. So, the settling velocity in this case depend on both the Reynolds number of the particles, REP, and the volume fraction. So, there's a strong effect of volume fraction and settling velocity. And from their DNS data, they have data for settling velocity. They've also measured. They also measured the fluid and the particle turbulent kinetic energy. So these flows do not remain totally laminar, I guess you could put it that way. They have fluctuations in volume fractions. So some particles fall together. And that then leads to fluctuations inside the box of both the fluid. Think of turbulence and also for the particles. Another thing that comes Another thing that comes up in these flows is they generate kinematic waves, and kinematic waves we'll see have to do with the average volume fraction on a cross-section is not uniform. It doesn't remain uniform like the initial conditions, but it forms wave structures. Okay, so we started this problem because we were looking at a liquid food ice bed with a group in Toulouse, and we had data for all of these variables except for the kinematic waves. We had data for We had data for the slipping velocity, settling velocity, and terminal kinetic energy. And we thought that it would be rather simple to take Jesse's DNS code for Euler-Lagrange simulations and simply simulate this fluidized bed. So we have an Eulerian description for the fluid, a Lagrangian description for the particles. We simulate all particles. And we were thought, I guess, naively when we started out that it... I guess naively when we started out that it would be straightforward to simply add, to simply simulate this and get the right answers. It turned out it wasn't. And so that's what has led to this talk. Looking then at the DNS data, just through, this is a preprint from Rubin's group. Here's what you get when you look at the settling velocity as a function of the volume fraction of the particles. It's well known that. It's well known that this follows a Richardson-Zacchi relationship with a coefficient n that depends on the particle. This basically one minus phi is the void fraction, or particle volume fraction is phi. And the coefficient here is approximately three. It does have some dependence on the Reynolds number, but it's very weak. And so for this case, for example, they have actually data for three different Galileo numbers, and you can see the slope is pretty constant when you predict the When you predict the settling velocity over gravity times dp, which gives you the characteristic time scale force for the problem, so you can see at different volume fractions, these curve goes up. For different Galiers numbers, the curve varies a little bit, but pretty much the slope is the same. If you look at the fluctuations of the particles, so this is velocity fluctuations as expected. We know this from Expected, we know this from gas particle flows and even just writing down the Reynolds stress equations. We know that the velocity fluctuations are going to be highly anisotropic. They do depend weakly on the Galileo number. And so, for example, for the particles, the RMS velocity, so here are the vertical velocities and the horizontal directions. It's isotropic in the two horizontal directions. But as we know, the vertical, because of the drag, the vertical fluctuations are larger than. Fluctuations are larger than the horizontal ones. And likewise, for the fluid, you get much larger vertical fluctuations in the fluid velocity than you get in the horizontal directions. So there's strong anisotropy, and there's a dependence on the volume fraction that's important through the coupling between the mainly the drag term. Kinematic waves. Kinematic waves are, again, volume fraction waves that are moving up or down the column depending on the Down the column, depending on the overall mean volume fraction. So here's a plot that comes from again the DNS data. The original idea for doing this came from Prosperity's group in this paper from 2017. So what we have, what I'm showing you here are, this is the height of the column. So dp, y divided by dp, and then this is time. So we're averaging the volume fraction across the horizontal direction. Volume fraction across the horizontal direction. So every point on here is an average at different heights. And so we go up the height. And then we plot that as a function of time. And you see, you can rarely see it in the original data. There's the black line, which corresponds to just the falling rate of the particles. And then there's the red line, which is the kinematic wave. And so, in order to actually bring this out so that you can see it in a very distinct way, you can take autocorrelations. In this case, we pass it through seven. Case we pass it through seven autocorrelations, and you get then these waves. The waves here are corresponding to upward-moving kinematic waves. You can see they look like this from the DNS data. Okay, so these waves, I'm going to come back to them, but they are important in the overall dynamics of the liquid-solid food ice bed. They're easy to extract from a Lagrangian simulation, also, so we'll extract them in the same way as they did in the Same way as they did in these two papers. Okay, so here's some of what the DNS data looks like. If you look at the DNS data, it looks like this. You can see the lines here are theory and then from Kensch. But the DNS data, you can see the wave speed changes sign at about 0.25, a little bit larger. And it says a weak dependence on the Galileo number. Has a weak dependence on the Galileo number, but you see upward moving waves or downward moving waves depending on the volume fraction. And then the wavelengths are a bit more noisy from the DNS data, but you can see the wavelength. So this is basically the distance between two waves on average. It looks like something like this as a function of volume fraction for the data is a little bit noisy, but the one that we simulated is the 144, and you can see basically a constant wavelength. And then it goes. A constant wavelength, and then it goes down at higher volume fractions. So, the theory here is a very simple theory. It comes from Kensh and I'll look at a little bit later, but it's a theory that just has to do with purely inertial part of the transport. So there's no diffusion needed. It's basically a two-fluid model, just looking at the transport in a two-fluid model. And I'll come back to it in a minute. And I'll come back to it in a minute. So you can see the theory work predicts pretty well what the DNS simulations look like. Okay, so as I mentioned earlier, we thought it would be very simple to reproduce the DNS data by using the NGA code. NGA coded tracks particles with collisions, uses a filtered fluid equation. That means that the fluctuations in the fluid that are smaller on the order of the particle, two particle diameters are going to be filtered out. Diameters are going to be filtered out. And so we use a filtering function to do that to pass information from the particles, the Lagrangian particles to the fluid. So what that means in practice is that the subgrid scale fluid velocity fluctuations are not resolved. And so the plot that I showed you earlier about the fluid turbulent kinetic energy, we know from this code, we'll not be able to resolve all of it because most of the energy is at the particle scale. So we're going to underpredict that. Going to underpredict that. And the other thing that's not included is a fluid-mediated particle force. So, this is the force that I talked about earlier. I'll show you again later. But there's a force between particles through the fluid, and it changes the dynamics. And so that's not included in the original NDA model. Okay, so if you run then the NGA code, you get structures that look like this. These are colored by the particle velocity. Are colored by the particle velocity. So red particles are falling faster in groups, and blue particles are moving upward. You can see there's a difference in the speed. So you get something, well, you can call it multi-phase turbulence if you like. The code does a good job of predicting the settling velocity. So this is the Richard and Zacchi relation, but that's not surprising because for the NGA code, we have to put in a settling, we have to put in a drag formula. And so we fix a drag formula that gives And so we fix a drag formula that gives us back Richardson Zacchi. So that's kind of built in. The particle RMS velocities, though, if you look at the fluctuations that are generated in the base code, the velocities tend to be much too large. So the particles are oscillating too quickly or fluctuating too quickly. And they're way too anisotropic. They're moving up and down much faster than they move to the sides. And so without any, just using the base code with the collisions and the filter velocity with drag. And the filter velocity with drag and the standard pressures, you get things that are too large. Likewise, if you look at the kinematic waves that are produced by the NGA code, which is the standard models, the wavelengths are too short. It turns out the speed is correct, but that's controlled by Richardson Zacchi, but the wavelengths are too short for the kinematic waves. Okay, so if you look at this, this is again. Okay, so if you look at this, this is again Richardson Zaki. You can see our data. The PR DNS is the simulation data from the DNS. The Lagrangian NGA code is the triangles, and you can see, well, this is just the settling velocity versus void fraction. We fixed the Richardson-Zacchi law, so you get the right settling velocity on average. And then here's the Kensch theory for the kinematic waves. It's paper in 1952. In 1952. Basically, it says that the kinematic waves depend on the Richardson-Zacchi coefficient, which here is 3 times the volume fraction divided by 1 minus the particle volume fraction. So in our case, it's 3. And so the change of sign is going to happen at about 0.25 in our case. So if you apply this theory, you get a wave speed and you get a change of sign. change of sign. So we were able to, well, predict the drag velocity, but we weren't getting the right, we were getting the right wave speed through this formula, but we weren't getting the right wavelength and we weren't getting the right fluctuation dynamics. Okay, so at that we went back to say, well, can we improve our predictions for the RMS velocities, for the particle phase, and also can we get the right kinematic way? And also, can we get the right kinematic wavelength? So, that we have, we did, we tried a couple of things. One thing you could do is implement a stochastic model for unresolved fluid velocity fluctuations. I think you've seen during the week some papers. Tony Wach is working on this. Jesse's worked on this. Shanko-Simuranium worked on this. So, you could write a stochastic model that increases the fluid velocity fluctuations. It turns out for our It turns out for our case, we're already over-predicting the particle velocity fluctuations. So, if we do this, we make things worse. It actually adds too much energy to the system by adding more random fluctuations. The other thing that we can do is use a fluid particle fluid model, a PFP pressure tensor. Again, you can derive this pressure tensor from kinetic theory. I've done it in a GFM paper, and Dwayne Zhang has also done it. So, it's a force or stress. It's a force or stress tensor. I write it always a pressure tensor. Duane writes it as a stress tensor. They just differ by a minus sign. It has this functional form. It depends on the volume fraction times the fluid density. So it's important when the fluid density is large compared to the particle density. And then it has a form of a constant times the isotropic kinetic energy. So this is granular temperature. So this is the trace of the particle fluctuation tensor. Of the particle fluctuation tensor, and then it's the fluid particles velocity, so the difference in the velocity. So, this would be the slip velocity squared. But it has this isotropic part, and the anesthetic part has this standard form that you get, which is that it's this tensor made from the vector, the slip velocity vector. So it has a, it's basically in the vertical direction and zero in the horizontal directions and a constant B2. In an Euler-Euler model, I'll show later. Well, if you put this in an Euler-Euler model, Well, if you put this in an Euler-Euler model, that was my original contribution showing that if you put this in an Euler-Euler model, then you have a well-posed two-fluid model. So the system is hyperbolic even for gas-liquid flows with Archimedes forces. So it was purely for theoretical reasons. Wang et al. with Bala's group and Duane Zhang, they worked together and extracted these codes, these constant B1 and B2 from DNS data, and they have some correlations that depend on. That depends on volume fraction and the particle Reynolds number. So, B1 and B2, we get from their DNS simulations. And so, for us, then, this is an Euler-Euler-Euler format. We had to develop a version that we can put in an Euler-Lagrange code. So it was a force term to implement this tensor, or this stress tensor. Okay, so our Euler-Euler model, the Euler-Lagrange model, excuse me, the Euler for the particles, we solve for the velocity. Particles, we solve for the velocity of each particle. We have the interaction forces through the stress sensor. We have collisional forces. So, this is and gravity. So, this is what was in the baseline code that Jesse developed. We could put in this term, as I mentioned earlier, a stochastic model to get more fluctuations for coupling with the fluid phase, the pseudo-terminal kinetic energy model. And we can put in the term for the particle, fluid-particle. The particle fluid particle force term. As I mentioned earlier, we didn't use this one because our kinetic energy was already too large and this would add a net kinetic energy, but you could do it by putting in a basic stochastic model with a white noise term. We turned it off. It turned out we didn't need it. And then the fluid particle force term, we wrote this as a mean field type term. So we calculate the tensor that I have here using. Tensor that I have here using the mean velocities for the fluid and the mean velocity for the particle and the volume fraction. So that's a you can calculate that at any location on the grid. And then we can take the derivative of that or the diversions of it. And then the rest is for scaling. So that's the force that would appear here for the particle C's. And then you have to do the same thing for the fluid phase so that it conserves momentum and energy in the two phases. Phases. So, the question then we ask: if we do this, will we get better predictions for the macroscopic properties from the DNS? And so, here's our results. So, in terms of it did help. So, let me show you first what it looked like without it. What we started with was the blue lines. So, what I'm plotting here is the RMVS velocity of the particles versus Of the particles versus void fraction. And so the blue lines are just the Euler Lagrange model that everyone, most everyone uses without the PFP term. You can see that, as I mentioned earlier, you get a trend that decreases correctly, but the anisotropic part, the vertical point, is much too large. And likewise, the horizontal component is much too large. And if you sum together the trace, the overall energy is way too large. The symbols here are the DNS. Here are the DNS for vertical and horizontal components, and so that we're showing you. And then the green lines here are what you get if you add this force term. So the PFP term, put it in and solve the same simulation with that term. And you can see that it using the coefficients that were neglected were calculated in the paper that I mentioned earlier about Baalis group. You can see that it moves down. You can see that you it moves down the vertical components and you get the right dependence on volume fraction, and likewise the horizontal component goes down. So the overall energy goes down and the anisotropy improves between the two components, vertical and horizontal. Of course, the PFP term doesn't help for the unresolved fluid phase. And so for there, you have to add a PFP turbine kinetic energy model in the fluid, but you don't need it for the particle phase. You don't need it for the particle phase, you just need this PFP term. The other thing that we can look at is then the kinematic waves. And so here's the effect of the PFP term on kinematic waves. I mentioned earlier, if you don't include any model, you get kinematic waves with the right slope because you get the right settling velocity, but the frequency or the wavelength is too short. And when you add in this PFP term, basically it adds some dispersion and you. term basically it adds some dispersion and you you lengthen out the the wave so the wavelength becomes longer uh we've we hit the same slope as before because slope just depends on settling velocity but we increase the the spacing we increase the wavelength okay so uh just to to summarize then the wave speed is not affected by this pfp term because it only depends on the drag correlation the wavelength increases and it Increases and it, and when you check, compare it to the DNS, we're only well much closer, but just a little bit, a little bit longer than the DNS. So, in theory, you could use the PFP term to, or you could fit the PFP coefficients using the kinematic velocity and the wavelength instead of doing it the hard way as what Ballows Group did and compute it, try to compute it from the particles, which was a complicated method. So, okay, so to finish up then, I just want to show, well, what is this? To show, well, what does this look like in a two-fluid model? We published a paper in 2020 on two-fluid modeling with added mass. And so I won't go into details on that, but the model treats the added mass not as a force, but as really as an added mass. This was done by Harlow's group back in the 80s, and it turns out it's a very convenient way to do a two-fluid model because it's a Galilean variant and it has a lot of nice properties that Harlow showed back in the 80s. Harlow showed back in the papers in the 80s. We have material densities for the two phases, the continuous and discrete phase, and then you get an effective density of the particle. So the particle is defined here is the fluid plus the particle moving with velocity up. We have pseudoturbulence in the continuous phase. And as I mentioned earlier, by adding this PFP term, you get a well-posed fluid model. So you don't have to worry about having complex eigenvalues or anything like that. Complex eigenvalues or anything like that. If you look at it in terms of modeling, though, the mass balances, the mass balances are now written in terms of these starred volume fractions, which the starred volume fractions include the volume fraction of the fluid moving with the particle. So the continuous phase, and they still sum up to one. And so we saw balance equations for the particle, for the continuous phase. And then you have some mass exchange terms between the wakes. So the wakes of these. Between the wakes. So the wakes of these added mass terms can change size. And so you exchange mass, energy, and momentum and energy as you change size in the wakes. And those are represented by some source terms. Momentum balance for the continuous phase looks the same. So we have a couple of additional terms. We have the PFP term that I mentioned earlier. And we have a force term, which I derived from kinetic theory in the GNFM paper. We also add a term for kinetic theory for pseudo- A term for kinetic theory for pseudo-kinetic kinetic energy. This is something I did with Jesse. We had a source term and a sink term for that. So that's a natural thing to do in a two-fluid model. And then for the mass balances for the dispersed phase, so the particle phase, they look very similar, except for now you have the volume fraction, just the particles, and then with the added mass as a source term. And then we give a momentum balances with these additional forces and source terms. And you also solve. Source terms, and you also solve for the total kinetic energy of the particles, you get the granular temperature, and so you have a drag production term and these force terms. And so, all of this then can easily be solved in a two-fluid modeling context. And we've shown analytically that these models equations are hyperbolic. So, you can use any hyperbolic solver that you like to do that. Okay, so to finish up then, a couple of what you have to do for two-fluid modeling. Well, you have to add. For two-fluid modeling, well, you have to add these source terms to take for account the exchange of mass between the weights and the continuous phase. The most important term, though, is this PFP term you need it to make the system hyperbolic. The compression and lift terms, well, these are important for compressible flows. For example, I'm now working with Ryan Huham from the University of Florida, and we're doing compressible gas phase. So, this delta U is not zero. Del dot u is not zero, and so we add these additional drag terms for that. And then you have kinetic energy terms to get the fluid phase, terminal kinetic energy correct. And then PC is the overall mass conservation. So that inserts the systems hyperbolic. So to finish up, just a few conclusions. We found that the standard EL model, which works well for gas particle flow because the gas density is much smaller than the particle. Than the particle density. Well, in a gas-liquid flow, that over-predicts the RMS particle velocity and anisotropy in liquid-solid cases. By including this PFP force, it's possible to get back the correct particle velocity and anisotropy. And moreover, you get the correct wavelength for the kinematic waves. So we think this term is significant for both of these two reasons. Using the Using the pseudo turbo kinetic energy, basically, if we put that in, we found that that's not needed because that increases the particle velocity, which we're going in the wrong direction. So the PFP term is the most important, will be most important in bubbly flow because there the density of the bubbles is much, much smaller than the gas. And so you get a large density ratio. Finally, if you want to do polydispersity, we now have a version of the two-fluid model that works well with quantum. Of the two-fluid model that works well with quantum-based moment methods it's developing on our fully compressible flows. So I'll stop there and be happy to answer any questions. Well, let's thank Professor Fox. A very exciting talk. The floor is now open for questions, audience in the Zoom. You can put your question in the chat box and I'll take questions from the room. Okay, we'll start. Hey, Rodney, this is Charles. Hey, Rodney, this is Charles. Hi, Charles. I wish you could be there. You would have enjoyed being here, I'm sure. Yeah, I was here last time. We had a great time. Okay, great. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, real nice talk. I was curious, you know, normally when you add terms to equations, typically fluctuations go up, just kind of typically. And so I was wondering, is there an easy way to understand why when you added this pressure tensor to the equation? Pressure tensor to the equation that you actually reduce the variance? Yeah, I think that I mean, basically, it ends up in a momentum balance and it kind of adds. When you look at it, it kind of, well, in the fluid phase, it doesn't do much because the pressure of the fluid is so much larger than it's effective. If you take the trace of this, it's so much larger. So it doesn't do much for the fluid. But for the particles, it adds a pressure. It's going to kind of damps out. So you can think. It kind of damps out. So you can think of two particles, they don't approach each other as fast effectively in the Oil Lagrange because it's a force, it's the fluid between them is transferring a force. And so it basically damps out fluctuations because they see each other. They know each other through the fluid. And that's the physics of when you do the kinetic theory, it's a long-range force. It's a long-range force that's keeping two things from moving. So yeah. I see. So is that so the main effect is through the So, the main effect is through the relative velocity term, right? Exactly. I guess it had it had both an isotropic part and a relative velocity. Yeah, it has the, let me just go back to the, if I can, yeah, it has the, I mean, the theta p is the, is the n the is the fluctuation of the particles, but the main, this is just relative velocity squared. So, if there's no relative velocity, this, well, this will be zero because there's no source term for granular temperature, and this will be zero because there's no relative velocity. So, it's um. So it's really relative velocity that's driving it. But is it the relative velocity in that term, the isotropic term, or the tensor? I think it's mainly this one. But the tensor term is going to get you the relative magnitude between the two. Yeah, because this is really big. This is only, if you look at it, the relative velocity is only important in vertical direction. So this is only functioning in a vertical direction. And then this is isotropic term. So this gets you back to the anisotropy. So this gets you back to the anisotropy, correct? And then the overall trace gives you the force, just the overall force of it. Yeah, great. One quick question. I didn't quite understand your comment about the settling velocity. Like, is that fitted or are you taking a settling? Yeah, Euro Lagrange, we fit it. So we got, you do Eul Lagrange, you've got to give a drag coefficient, right? In the DNS, of course, you compute it, but Eul Lagrange, you got to get a drag coefficient. And so if you're a drag, Drag coefficient, and so if your drag coefficient is fitted, then you get the right settling velocity. It's used for the momentum value. But it's the drag coefficient of a single, a single particle which it's a drag coefficient that depends on volume fraction too. On the volume fraction, yeah, yeah, yeah. So basically, it looks like Richardson-Zaki drag claw. Okay, got it. Thank you. Thank you. Aaron? Okay, good. Could well, thank you, Professor Fox. Uh, this was very exciting talk. Uh, quick, just an understanding: these kinematic waves that you're talking about, do they actually have some sort of acoustic signal? There's some experiments that we are conducting at LSU with the sand and liquid, and all these signals are basically uh DAS and DTS. So, or do you do you have any intuition on how does these kinematic waves would actually show up in a DAS signal? Show up in our desk signal? I don't know. I mean, there is a pressure fluctuation. I don't know if this is large enough because they're not really, they look large, but if you look at them, they're not very large. They're just a few percentage of the volume fraction. But it does generate a pressure. It does generate a pressure fluctuation. Yeah. So you suggest that we calculate the sound pressure level or flow generated sound using some simpler Folks Williams-Hawkins type of formula or so? I'm not familiar with that, but yeah. Anyway, I'm not familiar with that, but yeah, I don't know how they would show up. I mean, if you look at some, there's some experimental work in Marseille, Olivis Gazelli's group, and John Hench, they did some earlier papers, and they actually measured these in fluidized beds, liquid-solid fluidized beds. So they're known to exist. And so I think one interesting thing that I like to do is go back and see if you use a two-fluid model with their own setup, you get the same kind of wave. Better on the setup, you get the same kind of wavelengths as they find, and the save, yeah. I'm pretty sure you get the same slope because it just depends on settling velocity, but you get the same fluctuations as they see in their experiments. Yeah, exciting. I'll definitely read the papers and see if we could use it in some CFD codes. Thank you. Okay, yeah. Bye. We are taking a coffee break and we'll resume at 11 p.m. local time. And let's thank the
