So, what I'm going to talk about are some findings I did with a student of mine, Javier Peraza. They have to do with the possibility of putting certain static vacuum pretty regular solutions that cannot be. Irregular solutions, they cannot be put into stationary rotation. These are the solutions, these static solutions are very regular. However, they are not asymptotically flat, of course. These are three plus one solutions. And this seems to be, I mean, to the best of our knowledge, seems to be like a very novel phenomenon. Some black holes, starting black holes, they cannot pull it. The starting plateau they cannot put into rotation. Of course, perhaps they can put into rotation, but not a stationary rotation. If you think about, for example, the Schwartz solution, I mean, of course, it can be put into, can be added small angular momentum to make it stationary close to the Schwarzschild solution, right? So, but these solutions I'm going to talk about, actually, these are the Mayos colochemicalized solutions. Cholerochemicalized solutions that were discovered like about 30 years ago, these solutions can don't have that property, some of them, some of them. So let me go then to the talk. So as I say, these solutions are, we are going to explore here in this talk, are these Myerscore organic relief solutions. Um, these are these are not very well-known solutions in general relativity. Some people know about them, uh, but um it's a pity. And I think the reason that they have very interesting properties, the reason why they are not very well known is that they are not asymptotically flat. They are not asymptotically cast. And well, so this is somehow a peculiar. And well, so this is somehow a peculiarity and they don't find applications in physics like in our universe so far we know. But nevertheless, they are pretty attractive from other viewpoints. So let me explain, because it's a little bit magic at the beginning. So these static solutions are a concatenation, actually, an infinite periodic array of Lightholes. You can see here the periodic array. You can see here the periodic array, right? They are line, they are coaxial, right? And they are infinitely many. I mean, in principle, this type of configurations perhaps may not exist, but they do. And this was proven by Myers in the first a few years later independently by Koroti Nicolai, which called the Which further analyze these solutions. So these are axisymmetric solutions. So they are rotationally symmetric and they are static, they are vacuum, they are regular. They don't have struts here between the different horizons. They don't. They are pretty regular. I put just here these lines just to mark here the axis, but these are regular solutions. You can write actually in a pretty simple form this way. This is bi form. It's very important for this talk. The way this solution is constructed is using Bind method to superpose infinitely many Schwartz solutions, which are static and axisymmetric. And you know, Byn method allows you to superpose in a In a pretty easy way, several static solutions. So, yeah, so you have to prove, I mean, in the whole construction, you have to go over it. And there are some counter terms that you have to add or so, but there is conversions and finally you get aligned solutions. Unfortunately, here, what you can see here, there are two functions, which are x and delta. These are the only functions. These are the only functions, like three functions over there. And there are no explicit solutions for them. I mean, the explicit form of them can be given in a series. But what is important for us is that these solutions depend only on rho and z, right? And they are periodic. And the period here is L. And the period here is L, capital L. So these two conditions are the periodicity. Here, when you shift up in Z, C goes in this direction, rho goes in this direction, and Phi goes in this direction. So when you ship upwards by L, then you get the same solution. So they are periodic. So these are somehow the The minus corrosion nuclei solution explains very roughly. It doesn't matter, really, as I said. I mean, the explicit form at the moment. But we will not concentrate on this infinite array of it, but rather we will portion it, we will portion it just by a translation. And when you portion it, I'm sorry that I can back and forth. Can back and forth. When you quotient biotranslation, this configuration here, you end up just with one horizon, right? As you can see here, this is the only horizon, right? And you have only one axis component, because in a sense, I'm sorry, I'm going to go back. In a sense, what you are identifying is these black holes with this black hole, with these black holes here, all the same black holes when you do the question, right? And so you have one piece of So, you have one piece of axis here, here, the blue line. You have one black hole, right? And the topology now of the space at certain time is a solitary, which is drawn in green over there here. This is somehow the manifold, the spatial manifold, right? Of course, this is just a picture. Infinity will be here. infinity will be here right infinity will be here uh and here right and this is of course at that infinity metric distance from the horizon right um right um and therefore uh therefore uh if you if you think about it the functions c and delta functions C and delta that are needed to give the metric right here. They are functions on this green domain that I drew here. This green domain. The axis is, it turns out that I mean this I'm plotting, I'm writing the domain in this bi coordinate. In the domain in these bi coordinates, right? It turns out that, well, perhaps some of you know that these bi coordinates degenerate over the axis and the horizon. And therefore, that's why you see the horizon here. You see the horizon as just one line over the row equals zero axis, right? But this is because a special feature of the body coordinates that they generate near the horizon here. Uh, near the horizon here, right? Uh, so yeah, so this these functions then, uh, the functions on these coefficients or metric coefficients of the metric, the Myers-Kero-Kiniquer metrics, they are functions on here and they can be, like, as I said, written as a series. And so, um, and so the question we face. And so, the question we face now is whether we can put these configurations to rotate. So, namely, the question is whether we can deform them to stationary axisymmetric vacuum solution with non-zero angular movement. And the answer is roughly speaking, the answer is roughly speaking is that no, no, if the North Pole is too close to the Southern Pole. So namely, if this blue line here, which is the axis, is too short. The answer is no. Cannot be put to brought into rotation. Brought into rotation. It's a very peculiar feature, but in a simple sense, when you try to put some angular momentum, there is too much rejection from the north and the south, and just such configuration doesn't exist. Here, so let's go, let's go slowly into some details. So, here, as I say, AR. So, here, as I say, L is the period of the configuration, and M is a parameter that's related to the ADM mass of the original Schwarzschild black hole that you use to adapt and construct the Myers-Kernac and Nicola resolution. To fix your mind, you can think that M is somehow the mass of the black hole. Right. This L. This L and M depends. I mean, if you scale the y coordinates, this L and M, they change, they scale too, but they scale equally. So here there is a special quantity, which is a geometric quantity, which is L over M. This is a geometric quantity, right, associated to this configuration, like, for example, Configuration, like for example, the area of the black hole or the length of the axis, these are geometric quantities. Well, the same way, L over N, the pure over the mass somehow somehow is also a geometric quantity and plays a big role, right? If there are questions, just let me know. Right. So, as I say, Right. So, as I say, well, the question is: we are going to discuss: can this solution be put into stationary rotation? And the answer, as I mark here, the answer is no, if L over M is less than 4. Recall that L over M, L over M is greater than 2 always. Two always, but if in addition is less than four, right, um, then it cannot be to put into the rotation, so it cannot be deformed into the rotating vacuum solution. Well, you may say, you may say, well, you just say that. You should say that it cannot be put into rotation if the North Pole and the South Pole are sufficiently close, right? But maybe this L over M is not related to the distance between the North and the South Pole, but it is the case. I didn't want to go into that, into this presentation, but you can prove that they are two quantities related. So L over M is related to Is related to the distance between the North and the South Pole, right? In such a way, whenever these two quantities are too close, right, here, then they cannot be put into rotation. But I didn't want to go into that. We are going to just work with this geometric invariant that, however, doesn't have a clear geometric interpretation, but is an invariant. Geometric interpretation, but it's an invariant. So, the theorem I'm going to discuss is the following, that, as I said, for a stationary solution, so perhaps I should go here. So, what I want is to is to have a rotation symmetric stationary solution next to the Stationary solution next to the micro-recognition solution, right? And it is a fact, it is a fact that such solutions can be cast in this form here. This is somehow the Vi-Papa Petro form and also plays a good role in this talk. So, what we want is a metric like this, right? Like this, right, over a similar domain as before, right? Well, these coefficients B, W, eta, and gamma depend only on rho and z, right? Of course, it must satisfy the they don't depend on time, but on time, but they must satisfy. But and on time, but they must satisfy the Einstein vacuum equations, right? And in these solutions, this matrix turns out not to exist whenever these two quantities here are too close. Here, this arrow here means that in this domain, this here is identified to this here. Identified to this here. So the theory I'm going to discuss is that for a stationary solution like above, so like here, to exist, it must be L prime over m prime greater than or equal down 4, right? So if you take a solution with L prime over a minus 2 solution with L prime over N. solution with L prime over m prime less than four then cannot be put into rotation because you start to deform slightly the this invariant l over m will change slightly and will remain less than four for for a short uh for a short epsilon and and and therefore um and therefore you violate this yeah you're violating that that So, you are violating that environment, right? This condition for the environment. So, what we are going to do now from now on is to analyze certain things about this type of metrics, right? And to conclude that if such this type of solutions like this, they exist, then they must be like that. So, there is quite a bit of geometry here, quite a bit of geometry here. geometry here to discover. So let's go over that. And there is where somehow comparison appears, right? Martin? Yeah. Sorry. Sorry to interrupt you. No, maybe you said this. I missed it. Why you changed the L M into L prime and prime? Oh, because it doesn't. Well, yeah, so, right, right. Well, yeah, so right, right. So, um, so you have, let's say, a minus corroborate integral solution with some L and some M, right? Yeah, you want to deform that solution, but when you deform that solution, you may change L and M, but it will remain close to it. Okay, okay, sorry. That's why I put L prime, M prime. And concerning the original M, it's an explicit function. It's an explicit function of the mass of the star shield or not? It is actually the original mass of Sharshield. It is exactly because. I think so, yeah. I think so. Yeah. Thank you. But this plays no role. This plays no role. Right, right. I have to say that I forgot to say that we published a paper together with Peraza and Ortiz, where we did some numerical computations, some numerical experiments, where it is clear that these solutions cannot be put into stationary rotations. Stationary rotations, these Myerskolochi Nikolai configurations. I mean, we try to find them, and somehow doesn't happen. The computer somehow shows a singularity a little bit far away from the horizon. However, if you start to separate the black holes, so you start to separate the North and the South Poles slowly, then at some moment, then stationary solutions rotating show up next to the original. Show up next to the region of microlocinic line. So, this is a proof that actually what I'm discussing is a proof of what we have seen numerically in that paper. So, let me then go into the more technical part, and I hope people grasp at the idea. Let me go into the more technical part. So, from now on, my talk will be about. My talk will be about discussing the main equations. The main equations, I mean, the reduced Anison equations, and which part of them are going to be relevant for this talk, the main estimates that came out of these main equations, and finally, how to use A and B for the main argument to prove the main theorem, right? The main theorem, right? And of course, I don't have time for to give a detailed proof, but well, so I will mention the highlights, right? So as I say, we want metrics of the form here, and the unknowns here are these metric coefficients B, W, eta, and gamma, right? Now, define at the moment, define. Define at the moment, define f to be the logarithm of rho. So when you reduce the Einstein equations, assuming the metric is of this form, you get a series of equations. Somehow they have a ladder-like fashion, so there are some important equations. Equations and all the other equations, somehow they are related to the first. The main equations for us are the following two system of equations and are these ones here. Now, this eta is the origin, it's the eta before, it's this eta here, right? Which is this eta here. Which is this eta here. And here, this omega that didn't show up until now is so-called the twist and is related to the angular momentum you are adding, right? If this omega here is zero, then there is no angular momentum. So this function cannot be zero for the type of solutions we are looking at. So this is a closed system, and in the terminology. And in the terminology of just, this is called an F-harmonic map equations. Let me say here I didn't write, but forgot actually, this Laplacian sub F is the Laplacian here. I forgot, sorry, to write the Laplacian. I forgot sorry to write the Laplacian with respect to Q. I'm going to say what is Q plus the gradient of F in the product here Q. So here goes something, here goes something, and here goes something. Right? So let me say who is this Q. It turns out that a very important metric is the following. I'm going to put in some color here. I'm going to put in some color here. This metric here is very important. And this is a metric Q from now on. So you forget about this denominator and you concentrate on this metric. So it's e to the 2 gamma d rho squared plus the oops. And that's wrong. This is not z. This is not 3. C this is not V is C. So this metric Q somehow lives here. It lives here. Or if you want, in this cylinder, it's the same. This metic loop plays a big role. And in this equation, this Laplacian here, or this Laplacian, oops, this Laplacian. Oops, it's Laplacian, is the Laplacian with respect to Q. And here the inner product is with respect to Q. And here the norms, here, the norms are with respect to Q. This is how we think the equations, but note that these equations, all of them, the two of them, they are conformally invariant. So actually, I can erase the coefficient. The coefficient here, for example, I could erase this coefficient here and work with this conformant coefficient, this one, I can erase and work only with a flat metric in this domain. And these equations, if I work with a standard Laplace and start an in the product flat, then these equations, which are conformally invariant, would work as well. Would work as well, right? But it is important, it is important to somehow to, for some estimates, I'm going to mention now, it is important to work as if they were Laplacian with respect to the metric Q and inner product with respect to the metric Q, right? Now, and one of the reasons is that when you calculate the battery Mary Richie tensor, right? right for q for q which is this rich here it is non-negative and it has this explicit form related to the two functions i mentioned before which are eta and omega the twist omega right actually if you take the trace of this equation you get that the scatter curvature You get that the scatter curvature is actually the energy of the harmonic map is greater or equal than zero. It's not negative. This is also very important. Here, this F harmonic map goes from the manifold SQ into the hyperbolic plane. So, these actually are F harmonic map equations from SQ. S is this. SQ, S is this manifold, is the usual domain into the hyperbolic plane. So as I said, I mean, the Einstein equations, they can be organized in a ladder-like fashion. And once you solve these equations, then you can reconstruct all the metrics coefficients V, W, and eta by just line integration. Just line integration. So the main important, the most important equations are this, right? And they are, and the operators here, like the Laplace and the norm, as I said, they are with respect to the metric cube, which has this very nice property here. So what is remarkable about this system is that this That this plus this is a very highly structured equation, and it's very easy to get estimates over the main functions over eta and over omega. And these are the estimates I'm going to talk about now, this B. And the main estimate. And the main estimates are the following. These are estimates one. You can find these estimates, the proof of these estimates in the archive I mentioned at the beginning of the talk. It's a paper of mine. It turns out that if you use Bochner formulas for F harmonic map equations into the hyperbolic plane, plus some basic comparison geometry. Plus, some basic comparison geometry on SQ, which has Gaussian curvature or scalar curvature actually greater or equal to zero. If you combine these two pieces of information, this and this, then you can prove estimates, the following estimates here. Of course, it is an effort to do. I mean, this is not extremely, I mean, this is not direct, but it's not very difficult. But it's not very difficult either, right? But there is something to be done. These types of estimates are very closely related to Anderson estimates for stationary solutions, but they are not the same. They're similar. They are not the same. These Anderson estimates are pretty important. Are pretty important. You can prove, for example, that a complete stationary, complete and stationary solution without black hole must be a quotient of Minkowski. Right, so let me explain a little bit what these estimates are. Here, you can see the norm here of the gradient of eta divided by eta squared. So, I mean, the norm of So, I mean, the norm of the gradient of the logarithm of eta squared less or equal than a constant z divided by the distance squared from the point P where I'm evaluating to the boundary of S. If you have a point here P, you have a certain distance to the boundary of S here. And this is the distance I'm talking about. I'm going to, I'm talking about. So, actually, these are the case estimates because when the distance goes to infinity, then this whole estimate goes to zero. And the same happened for this and for this. And you have an estimate for eta and also an estimate for the twist here, omega. Omega. And furthermore, you also have an estimate for the gradient of the coordinate rho. And this turns out to play a big role. If you want to see the proof, you can see to this paper. But these estimates are very important because something I didn't say until I didn't remark until now is that the solutions we are looking for. Is that the solutions we are looking for don't have any a priori asymptotic behavior? I didn't say, well, I want stationary solutions that behave at infinity in that way. No, it's just let it free. I mean, what I'm proving is that there are no stationary solutions, no matter which asymptotic they may have, right? There are no. Right, there are no, right? Um, and this estimate somehow allows you to get a priori information on the asymptotic of stationary solutions. If they exist, and this is where things start to clarify a little bit, because then you get information, a priori information infinity, and then you have to start to play. And then you have to start to play, and you, at the end of the day, you prove that if L prime over M prime is greater or equal than 4, then there is something happening at infinity that cannot be, right? I hope you are following. If you have any questions, so these are the main estimates, and there are also. Also, an extra estimate that I wrote here as estimate number two that are proven also in this reference. And this is much harder to prove. This is not that easy. Also, I don't want to enter into that. But and this is central as well. So, this estimate here, I'm going to comment about now. And these estimates here are central. So the estimates tool says the following. There is a constant I call C double prime greater than zero and a sequence of points PI going to infinity. Recall you are working here, right? Here, right? The points are here going to infinity, right? Such that this lower bound for the gradient of the lower form of rho squared holds. But over this sequence, over this sequence, in the previous, I'm going to go backwards. In the previous estimate, you got an upper bound for the grid. For the gradient of the logarithm of a row. But this estimate I'm mentioning here, which is more difficult to prove, it says that there is a sequence where the lower bound holds, of course, with a different constant here. So as a result, you have this, and also you have, of course, this from the STMS1 I mentioned before, right? Mentioned before, right? I'm sorry. Oops. Sorry, I say it's you here. Yeah, sorry. This you have. These constants actually, C prime and C double prime and C prime here, they are universal constants. They don't depend on the solution. Okay. Okay, so these are somehow the main tools, and with these tools, you have to prove what you want, right? You have to, you want to prove the main theorem. So now it gets a little bit more technical, so I hope you can follow something. We'll be happy if you follow something for it. It's not difficult, but just lacking a little bit of time. I have I have seven more minutes. So let's go, let's use the tools we have to explain how the main arguments for the main proof are. So A, the first, there is a divergent sequence over the Over the manifold S, where you are working. So, this is the divergent sequence here in a constant M1, they're greater than zero, such that the following holds the length L of the loop here. Here at rho equals row row rho in pi is the value of the coordinate rho at the point pi, right? So the loop I'm talking about is row equal row evaluated pi. So all the points that have the same row as p i. So, in a sense, it is the length of this loop here. So, this length times rho at pi divided by the distance from p to the boundary of s, this combination, this times this divided by this, converges to a constant which is non-zero. So the idea is quite simple once you have the estimates I mentioned before is just integrate the equation Laplacian of rho equals zero between some fixed rho zero and the rho of pi where pi is the sequence Is the sequence of estimate two? So the sequence where you have this. If you do that and you use the mean value theorem, and so you integrate that, you get two boundary terms because the integration of the value is zero. You're integrating zero, which is the Laplacian. You get two boundary terms. Is the Laplacian, you get two boundary terms. One is fixed, the other depends on i, because it depends on the point. And then you use the mean volume theorem over that boundary term, and you easily get this. So I'm not going to mention more than ideas on how to prove this, but they are easily based on an integration using Gauss theorem, mean value theorem, and the previous estimates. Estimates, right? What is important is to understand this identity here. It's quite non-trivial in a sense because you're starting to get information on the asymptotic, right? When a priori you didn't have any. B is also there is a divergence sequence of points, right? Right, where the following happens: the distance from the point to the boundary, again, this dpi times this, I'm going to say what it is now, divided by rho at pi conversions to a j, j is the angular momentum, divided by the constant m1 discussed in the previous. Discussed in the previous step. Now, let me say what this is. So, here is where the hypothesis on angular momentum enters into play. It's the first time you mentioned you're looking for solutions where angular momentum is non-zero. And this is the first time it shows up. And it's important that this is non-zero. Right? So, let me say what this is. So let me say what this is. This is the tangential derivative of the twist omega in the direction tangential to the loop. This is the direction S. So the tangential derivative here of the twist at the point, yeah, so you are derivating or differentiating here in this direction, right? Of course, this. Of course, this s is a vector, it has norm one with respect to the metric q. So, I mean, this is again, it's not difficult. You should have to use that the angular momentum form is like this and play again with mean value theorem and the previous estimates. But what is important to recall is that this holds, right. C and I think I'm starting to run short of time, I guess. That's right. How much I have? Minus, minus three minus three or plus three. All right. Um, well, um, yeah. Yeah. Why can I say? Yeah, so let me try to say this just to mention the steps. Yeah, I think it is just too much. We are short. I mean, we don't have more time. I think I can finish that. There are a few steps more, but they are of the same nature. Same nature, and um, um, yeah, I don't have time, but they are of the same nature, and you get at the end of the day, you get an inequality that cannot hold. And yeah, there are two more. I don't have time to explain that, but I hope people grasp an idea which kind of work it was about. Oh, thank you.
