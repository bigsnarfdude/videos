Thanks organizers for inviting me to give this talk. Yeah, today I'm going to talk about stableness or resistance model for non-response adjustment with callback data. This is joint work with PhD student Xin Yu Li at Peking University and Professor Paulo Sun at NUS. This is based on the paper on archive. And the paper and the slides can also be found on my website. On my website, and I will upload this to this conference website later. And so I will talk about the first talk about the introduce the pirate data, callback data, and talk about the connection to a missing data problem. We establish identification and semi-parametric inference with callback data. And I will talk about three applications to three data set, CES dataset, the famous CARED dataset, and the ANES NRFU dataset. Yeah, this is a study conducted last year after the 2020 election in the US. The election in the US. Okay, let me first introduce the pair date, callback data, and missing data analysis. Pair data are the records tracking the callback. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Well, I just want to remind people to mute themselves. Yeah, because I heard some background noise. Okay, it's okay. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You can continue. Okay. No problem. Problem. So power data are the record tracking and the collection process of survey data. So table one illustrates the typical data structure or sampling survey. On the left-hand side, it called the frame or questionnaire data, which are the data collected for a specific scientific research purpose. For example, we can collect people's income. People's income, education, age for some research purpose. And on the right-hand side, it is called a parallel, which are the process of data collection. For example, we collected date, time, and length, mode of the survey, and attitude of the respondent, record of contacts, and general interviews, such features of the process of data collection. Uh, process of data collection. So, paradata are not widely available in modern surveys. For example, in the US NHIS study, in the British survey of social attitudes and the European Social Service, in almost all modern studies, we have available such parallel data. So, a traditional form of parallel data is callback data. Is callback data. This is because the frame data are often prone to missiness or other deficiencies. And in most surveys, interviewers will continue to contact non-respondents. And the contact attempts are recorded. So sometimes it is called level of effort data. Table two illustrates the structure of something with callbacks. The left-hand side is the frame data. The left hand side is the frame data where x are fully observed variables and y are variables with missing values. And r is an indicator of the missingness of y, which can be created from the frame data. And on the right-hand side, it is the contact attempts, which records the response status in each contact attempt. Each contact attempt. So people, researchers have realized that the use of callback data can improve survey quality and compensate for deficiencies in surveys. It has been routinely used in political and social surveys to monitor response rates and to study how design features can affect contact and cooperation. This book by This book by Cruiter provides a comprehensive literature on the use of paradigm and callback data in the analysis of survey data. And the paper by Olsen revealed the categories of paradigm and challenges and also opportunities in using paradigm for non-response adjustment. So the paradigm and the callback data are very useful for missing data analysis. Data analysis. So, for missing data analysis, a key concept is a missingness mechanism. It is called missing random if the missingness does not depend on the missing values itself, but it is called missing not a random if the missingness depends on the missing values. A large body of the missing data analysis literature rests on the missingness at random and assumption. But for missing not at random, the key challenge is artificial. The big challenge is identification. Adification means the joint distribution issue is that the joint distribution is not uniquely determined from the observed data distribution or the function or parameter of interest is not uniquely determined. Without identification, the statistical inference of the parameter will be misleading or sometimes lead to very bad. Lead to very biased results. So, here is a brief review of the strategies to achieve adaptation in recent years. One can impose restrictive parametric models, such as the Heckman selection model. But there are counterexamples that fully parametric models are not identified, including the commonly used normal logistic model. For identification of semi-parametric. for anticipation of semi-parametric and non-parametric models one has to resort to auxiliary variables such as instrument variables or shadow variables here are two graph models illustrate the instrument variable approach and the shadow variable approach for instrument variables we have we have to use a fully observed covariate that is related to the missingness but independent of the outcome Independent of the outcome, and on the contrary, for the shadow variable, we use a fully observed covariate that is related to the outcome but does not directly affect the missingness. There are also some sensitivity analysis methods and graph models for the analysis of missing not only random. But the researchers have but two. Researchers have to use this shared variable and instrument variables approaches. Researchers have traditionally sought such auxiliary variables from the sampling frame, that is from the frame variables. But this is surprisingly difficult for practitioners because we have to have a great deal of background knowledge to identify these auxiliary variables. these auxiliary variables and the difficulty is amplified in multi-purpose studies where multiple three variables are of interest and we have to use multiple auxiliary variables and moreover these auxiliary variable approaches invoke additional assumptions that further limit their use and lastly these approaches break down if the auxiliary variables also have missing values Auxiliary variables also have missing values. This is often the case in service when the missingness is due to failure of contact. In this case, you obtain nothing if the outcome is if the individual does not respond to the three. But in contrast, the paired data or callback data offer an important source of auxiliary information for non-response adjustment because as we have As we have talked, follow-ups are commonly made in many surveys to increase the response rate, and the contact process are recorded by insurance, and they are often kept and released after the survey. But callback data have not been widely used in statistical analysis until recently. They all stem from the early ideas of Pliss and Siemens. Of police and Siemens. And a widely used model in political and social studies is a continuum resistance model. The assumption is that non-respondents are more similar to the delayed respondents than they are to early respondents, so that the most reluctant respondents can be used to approximate the non-respondence. And there are other approaches, for example. are other approaches for example more modeling the joint likelihood of the callbacks and frame variables and Bayesian approach and the pattern mixture models and a notable approach is recently proposed by IHO Ken Qing and Hua where they use property score models to make non-response adjustment with COVID and they propose in word IHW estimation and empirical likelihood based Estimation and empirical likelihood-based estimators. Here is the model they use where they assume a logistic model for the probability score for each callback. But this is a very restrictive model. So first, it is a parametric, it is a logistic model. And the second, it has very strong restrictions on the regression coefficients. It requires a Efficients need require the coefficients of X and Y to be the same across all callback attempts. So this is a very strong model and so far identification of semi-parametric and non-parametric property score models with callbacks is not available. And in this work, we consider a fundamentally non-parametric. A fundamentally non-parametric adaptation strategy and the non-parametric inference and semi-parametric inference. So we will propose an identifying assumption that allows for non-parametric and non-linear property scores, which is so far the most flexible model considered in the analysis of callback data. And then we established the semi-parametric theory and proposed a suit of semi-parametric estimators including Estimators, including doubly robust ones. Okay, let me first talk about the identification of our approach. So recall that we have frame variables x and y. X is fully observed query and y is the missing outcome. And for instance, we are interested in the inference of the outcome mean, but later I will extend this. But here later I will extend this to a general functional. So we use Rk to denote the callback data. And Rk equals one if y is available in case call and zero otherwise. So by definition, we have a by definition, the callback data RK are monotone. That is R2 is at least as large as R1 because we will keep the value of Y. keep the value of y obtained in the first call in the second call. So but here for simplicity, I will just focus on the second call, on a survey with second call on this special case. But all the results can be generalized to multiple callbacks. So a key issue for non-ignorable missing methods For non-ignorable missingness data analysis, you to characterize the degree of non-ignorable missingness. Here we define all the ratio functions for the non-response for the response propensity in the first and second calls, where gamma one and gamma two are defined as the log or the ratio of the property scores in the first and the second call. So by this definition, gamma k measures. Gamma k measures the impact of the missing outcome on the response propensity. That is the degree of non-ignorable missingness, and it measures the resistance to respond caused solely by the outcome after accounting for the impact of covariates and other issues. So here's the identifying assumption. So the first term is just the feature of COVID. Just the feature of callbacks, as we just said, R2 is at least as large as R1. And the second is a positivity assumption. This is a routine assumption made in a missing data analysis. It guarantees the overlap between respondents and non-respondents. And the third is a key assumption, which we call stableness of resistance. Stableness of resistance, it says gamma one and gamma two are equal. This is possible in social surveys when the social stigma attached to a unit does not vary across the three or the other survey is conducted within a very short time period so that the impact of the outcome on the missingness. On the missing list does not vary across the three costs. And this assumption, we can show that the joint distribution of X, Y, and the missingness indicators is identified. And thus, any functional or parameter of this joint distribution is identified. That is, they are uniquely determined from the observed data if the sample size is adequate. So, note that. So noting that we impose no parametric models for the property scores, or we have no restriction on the effects of covariance. We only have this stableness of resistance assumption. It says the impact of Y on the missingness are the same across different across the first two calls. cause so this is so far the most flexible model uh allowing for uh this is so far the most uh flex flexible assumption allows allowing for the most paramonious model for identification with callback data so applying uh this identification result to uh the to uh the to the logistic model we To the logistic model, we immediately obtain this result that generalized previous results by Erho, Kim, and Huan. So applying to this logistic model, we observe that it is identified if we only assume that the coefficient of y is a constant, but the coefficient of x can vary across, can vary with the Vary with the call type with the callback attempts. But in previous papers, we have to assume that the coefficients of x are the same across different colours. So next, we consider the semi-parametric inference of this callback data when IID samples are available. The stableness of resistance assumption defines Of resistance assumption defines this model, which we call the non-parametric model. It only has one restriction characterized by assumption one, but besides for that, everything is unrestricted on non-parametric. And we show that under this assumption, the efficient inference function for inference for inference function for infer for the inference of the outcome mean is given here so it is a little complicated but it has a form as the Euro AIPW influence function the first term can be viewed as a IPW term where we use the inverse probability weight of that is related to the property scores and Property scores. And the second term is the augmentation term that involves both the probability scores pi and the regression, outcome regressions, which is the conditional distribution of y given x, something like that. So here is the explanation of this notation. notation so uh so the joint distribution can be factorized with uh four components where we use a1 a2 to denote the baseline property scores that which are the property scores evaluated at the baseline value y equal to zero and the third term is the observation functions gamma the common observation functions which capture the degree of non-ignorable missingness Degree of non-ignorable missingness. And the fourth term, it is the second call-out term distribution. And we for notation convenience, we let pi one and pi two to denote the probability scores for the first for the first two calls. These are the true probability scores. So pi one is determined by A1 and the author ratio because A1 is the baseline of prominence score and gamma is the author ratio. And gamma is the oscillation. And pi 2 is determined by A2 and the oscillation. And we denote F2 for the second outcome distribution. And that's the notation for this slide. The non-parametric model assumes assumption one, but the four models, A1, A2, gamma, and F2 are restricted. And restricted, and we obtain this efficient influence function. So, based on this efficient influence function, we can, in principle, first estimate the pi one, pi two, and the baseline outcome model, and then plug in the estimator into these influence functions to obtain an estimator of the outcome mean. So, in principle, we can use any estimators of these nuisance functions. We can use a flexible. And we can use flexible machine learning methods or non-parametric estimation methods. But here we consider a semi-parametric inference approach that we model some of these four models. We impose parametric models for some of these four components and we propose a doubly robust estimation. There will be assume parametric models for pi one. Parametric models for pi one, pi two, and the baseline outcome model. And we first fit these parametric working models and then plug in this parametric working model into the efficient inference function to obtain this estimator. We can show that this estimator is in fact doubly robust. Yeah, and the identifying assumption and certain regularity conditions for estimating. regularity conditions for estimating equations we can show that uh the the parameter for the uh the for the first the uh the parameter for the first call uh property score and the and the uh the outcome mean estimator are doubly robust they are consistent and asymptotically normal provided one of the these two following assumptions hold so the first So the first something, the first condition says that A1, gamma, and A2 are correctly specified. So that is equivalent to that pi 1 and pi 2 are correctly specified because pi 1 is determined by A1 and gamma and pi 2 is determined by A2 and gamma. And the second condition says that A1, gamma, and F2 are correctly specified. That is pi 1 and Pi one and the second outcome model are correctly specified. So if either of these conditions hold, then the estimators alpha one, gamma, and mu are consistent and synthetically normal. And furthermore, if all the models are correctly specified, then the outcome mean estimator, mu hat, attains the semi-parametric efficiency bound for the non-parametric model. And yeah, this is for the W robust estimators. We also propose an HW estimator that only requires parametric working models for the parameter scores. And we also propose a regression estimator that relies on the outcome regression model. But here, to save time, I will not talk about this detail. not talk about these details. So we can also generalize this approach to the estimation of a general smooth functional of the flow data. So consider estimation theta defined by the solution to a given estimating equation m. So m is a general estimating equation where, for example, the outcome is a special case of this functional where m is defined by y minus Defined by y minus mu. So under certain regularity conditions, we can show that the efficient influence function for estimating theta. Sorry, this is a type for estimating theta is given here. This is very similar to the previous influence function for estimating the outcome mean. But here we just replace the outcome mean mu by this estimating equation. By this estimating equation M to obtain the efficient influence function for estimating theta. Okay, here are some takeaway points of our method. We propose a stableness of resilience assumption for identification with callback data. It is so far the most polymonious condition, characterizing the most flexible model for non-response adjustment with callbacks. We established at scale. We established application and developed IPW outcome regression-based and W robust estimation method. And we established a semi-parametric efficiency theory for using callbacks. Then next, I will talk about some numerical and empirical results. Here is some simulations where we consider four scenarios for simulation. Pair T. Pair T and S denote whether the probability score or the outcome model is correct. We can see that if either of the baseline probability score model or the baseline outcome model is correct, the W robust can achieve consistency and asymptotic normality. And the IHW estimator relies on correct specification of the property scores and Of the probability scores and the regression estimators rely on correct specification of the baseline outcome model. And we also compute their coverage rate of the 95% confidence interval. The confidence interval can be obtained based on the salvage estimators. And here is the coverage rate. So when the required models are correct, the coverage rate is correct. Are correct the coverage rate is closer to the nominal level of 95 percent, but otherwise it is well below the nominal level. Okay, we apply this approach to three data sets. The first is the consumer expenditure survey. This is a national-wide survey in the US. It has a long history and we use public use. We use public to use micro data collected in the fourth quarter of 2018 for illustration. We have two outcomes: Y1 and Y2 are the loss of last quarter's expenditures on housing and on utility fields and public services. So why two are missing at a missing simultaneously because the missingness is caused by Caused by a failure of contact. Here, the graph illustrates the mission data collection process. The data set contains about 9,700 households with 27 contacts. And most of the respondents. Most of the respondents occur in the first two contacts. And the first graph illustrates the response rates with the number of contacts. And the last two graphs illustrate the outcome means, the tendencies of the outcome means with the number of contacts. So if you choose some kind of number of missingness and Number of missingness. And we apply the logistic properties goal models and the bivariate normal baseline outcome model to this data. And here is the analysis results. So we can see that the IPW and the regression procedure estimates are close to the doubly robust estimates. However, the completed estimates of the outcome mean, in particular, outcome mean in particular the outcome mean of mu one that is the house that is the housing expenditure it is well below the w robust estimator this and the all the ratio estimators obtained by hw regression and w robust estimator are all negative this is evidence of non-ignorable missiness and it suggests that high spending people are more reluctant to switch People are more reluctant to speak or more difficult to contact. And in particular, the expenditure on housing plays a more important role in the response process. This is maybe because the survey takes the personal home visit as one of the main modes of interview, and people with high expenditure of housing are more difficult to reach. Okay, in the second data set, we apply to the In the second data set, we apply to the famous card data set. This is one of the work that wins that won card the Nobel Prize. The dataset included about 3,600 observations on the Lodo Auli Beach in 1976 and 1978. The covariance includes years of schooling. include years of schooling and a vector of fully observed sorry the the education is uh the collection including the years of education and the working experience and the race and the working area of working area of the people and whether they grew up near near a four-year college. Uh, near a four-year college. Uh, the outcome of interest is the early wage. Uh, the wage for only about 310 units were recorded in 1976. And the previous authors have used this sub-sample to estimate the effect of education on wage. Here, the parameter of interest is the causal effect of education on age. But we observe that the But we observed that the 600 non-respondents, among the 603 non-respondents to the call in 1976, in the follow-up in 1978, 201 units were recorded. So this can be viewed as a second call sample, and we can apply the callback approach to re-analyze this data set. This data set. So let's y denote the hourly wage in 1976, and w is the covariate, and we use z as the instrument variable because in this study, confounding other bias may arise. And previous authors have used this instrument variable approach, where we use the near C4, which is whether the This person grew up near a four-year college. They use this near C4 as an instrument variable for the education. And we are interested in the instrument variable estimate defined by this estimating equation, where Z are the instrument variables, W are the treatments. Particularly, we are interested in the coefficient of education. This is a code effect of education on wage. Effect of education on wage. So we apply our estimation method to this data set. This is the result we obtain. So our estimator is smaller than the complete case estimator obtained by previous approach, but it is still significant, which shows a significant effect or application on. Effect of execution on the hourly wage. Although it is smaller than previous complete case analysis, this is reinforced by the results of the audio parameter. Both the education and the hourly wage have a significant effect on the non-response. And this shows us. This shows significant selection bias and it shows the potential heterogeneity between respondents and the non-respondents. It reveals that among the non-respondents, the education is likely to have a smaller effect on the wage than in the respondents. Yeah, okay, these are the Yeah, okay, these are the analysis results. And then in the last data set, we apply our approach to the US election survey. So for decades, overestimation of turnout has been an issue in election surveys, and researchers have struggled with how to adjust for turnout bias. The ENES is a famous surveillance in the US. Surveillance in the US for estimates of voter turnout and other purpose for the election. But it is well known that it is well known to be substantially higher than official turnout. So in last year, they conducted the follow-up study, which is an NRFU study, non-response follow-up study. Non-response follow-up study. This study used male questionnaires to gather self-reported data to facilitate the analysis of missing data. This study began on January last year with a randomized advanced postcard and the first class invitation was mailed on February and followed up by replacement questionnaires on March. there's on march uh so uh this is the the first class at invitation for can be viewed as the first call and then the replacement questionnaires can be viewed as a second call this study uh collected about three thousand and not and seven hundred questionnaires the response rate is about uh 48 percent so uh based on the based based on this Based on this study, the voter turnout is over 85. But in fact, we know the true turnout for the 2020 presidential election. It is about 66. So a severe overestimation bias occurred in this NRFU study. study so we show how to use our approach to adjust for this bias in the in this study so this is the analysis results we apply different methods to this data set where the last three are the methods we propose the hw regression the w robust estimation and the first is the complete case analysis the the analysis based on missing and random Analysis based on missing at the random, and the third is the analysis based on the continuum resistance model. So, our estimation is close to the true turnout. The truth is 0.662 and our W reversed estimation is about 0.666. And FW and the regression are close to the To the true turnout. But the other three methods are very biased. They overestimated the turnout a lot. And yeah, this shows significant selection bias in this FEO study. And we can see that from the authoritarian parameter estimator, we can see that who did not. see that who did not vote is more likely to is more unlikely to respond and more difficult to contact. And there is a significant difference in the turnout between non-respondents and respondents as illustrated in this graph. The green one is the method, is the estimator of the taut in the non-respondence. The 12 in non-respondence by complete case analysis, and the red one is by the continual resistance model. This is a classical model used in political service. And the orange one is the estimate obtained by our doubly robust estimate. The complete case and the continual resistance estimate are very biased and our Biased and our estimate of the non-resundance turnout is close to the truth. Here is an analysis about how the covariance can affect the turnout. We observe that short title and political content on the first page and a visible cash incentive can yield a higher response rate. Higher response rate. And then the mailed advanced postcards can be escaped because it has no substantial response promotion. This is also discovered by a recent research by DeBell. And female and senior people are more likely to respond in both contexts. And more educated people tend to respond. And here are the results we. And here are the results we find from the data set. And we hope this could be useful for the design of the next ANES survey. Okay, last I want to discuss some extension of our approach. With the assistance of callback data, we can test the MAR assumption because analysis assumption, our stabilizer resistance assumption. Our stableness or resistance assumption naturally holds. And they focus on non-response adjustment, but callback data are also useful to inform the design and organization of service. For example, the allocation of time and staff resources. And we propose doubly robust estimation. And it is of interest to construct multiple robust estimation. And it is also of interest to explore the idea of the stableness resistance in colour inference. In colour inference, case control studies, longitudinal studies, and environment error problems. And okay, that's all my talk. And thank you. And yeah, questions and comments are welcome. Thank you.
