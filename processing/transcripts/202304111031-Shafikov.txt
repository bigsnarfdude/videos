Great pleasure to have the Sulchafikov who will kind of work for Nominal Lexington. Thank you very much. I'd like to thank the organizers for the invitation and the wonder to talk here. It's always great to be back to Bath and songs like that. I also like to say hello to the internet people. So I will continue with the theme of convexity. Convexity, and I'm going to concentrate on polynomial and rational convexity. And my goal is sort of to introduce this notion, give some examples, state some results that are interesting, my personal opinion, and maybe formulate some open questions. And in the second half, I hope to concentrate maybe on one specific theorem, the Duval Syboni characterization of rational convexity of total reality. Rational convexity of total sets. I'm going to sort of say a few words around that result. So, this is the definition of rational polynomial convexity. This definition hasn't really changed since the previous talk. But let me just quickly recall. So you say that you have a compact set in Cn, and you want to define the polygonal complex holobit. You take polygonal, the family of holobits. The family of holomorphic polynomials, and you say that the point is in the hull if the value at the point z does not exceed the norm of the polynomial on a compact. And you do the same thing for rational functions, but you might be a little bit more careful by not allowing bolts to be on k. And then polynomial convexity. And then polynomial convexity is really holomorphic convexity with respect to Cn. So if you take a variant to be Cn and look at holomorphic convexity, what you're going to get is polynomial convexity simply because polynomials are dense in the space of orbital functions. And then a sort of general clear property is that compact is always part of the Hull. Sometimes it's just the Hull, in which case we say that it's polynomial or rational convex. The Hull Convex. The rational convex hull is smaller than, or could be smaller than, the polynomial convex hull, but in either case, all these are compacts for a compact game. Okay, so I want to give some examples and in extended form, I'll also mention some results related. So my first example is for Capax in K and as Blake mentioned, we have a complete characterization. We have a complete characterization of polynomial and rationally convex compacts in C. Any compact is rationally convex, and it is polynomial convex if the complement is connected, or if the complement does not have any bounded components. So this, of course, gives a complete characterization of polynomial inertial convexity in C. And while one may wonder if there is some topological characterization of compacts. Characterization of compact. And there are some characterizations, for example, Forsnerich proved the following: that if k is parallel convex in Cn, then these fundamental groups vanish up to the order n minus 1. So, for example, in C, the only condition that you have is that it is equal to 0, and that simply means that the complex And that simply means that the complement is connected. And in higher dimensions, you have more. So, for example, in C2, you say that you see immediately that the complement of the polynomial convex compact is simply connected, and in high dimensions, you have more information. But in general, polynomial rational convex complex cannot be identified by topological properties. Identified by topological properties. I want to mention one result due to Iser, fairly recent, and he proved the following: that if you take any compact K in Rn, and the only condition on the compact is that it's uncountable, it's quantifying to a countable union of points, then there exists a compact X in Cn plus 4, which is homeomorphic to K, but it has an alternative polynomial and rational. Polynomial and rational convex hot. But you can also sort of consider k to be in Cn by just taking Rn and thinking of Rn as the linear space spanned by just real parts of coordinates. And then as a compact set in Rn, this is itself polynomial compact. So in general, there is no hope to topologically characterize all polynomial compact. Address all other address components. Okay, so the second example is the following. Suppose I have a manifold of Cn, or it could be generally compact set. Suppose I have a holomorphic map from the unit disk into Cn, which extends continuously to the boundary and it satisfies the property that the boundary maps into M. maps into M. So in other words we have a holomorphic disk which is attached to M. Then the conclusion is that the whole disk, the image of the whole disk has to be in a polynomial in a convex holoference. And it's immediate because if you take the composition of F with any homomorphic polynomial, then by the maximum principle inside the disk, your polynomial cannot Your polynomial cannot take values more than on the boundaries. It's a consequence of the maximum principle for Hall mortal functions. So by looking at this example, one may wonder if this is a general property of HALs, that if the HAL is non-trivial, then maybe it contains some disk, or as we call it, contains analytic structure. And so this, for example, trivially holds for compacts in C. For example, trivial holds for compacts in C. If the compact is not polynomial convex, then the complement contains sort of an open set in C, and that is dynamic structure in the hole. Furthermore, if gamma is a rectifiable curve, closed curve, then it's either polynomially convex or it bounds a variety in Cn minus gamma. So in other words, the power. Curve gamma, then if it's not polynomial convex, then there is some variety that evolves. And this whole thing, therefore, it has to be, is the Hubble. Furthermore, there is the following result due to Alexander, Besson, and Siboni, which says that suppose I have a compound. That suppose I have a compact mid-Cn and the Hull is not trivial, but it has finite two-dimensional Hausdorff measure. So k is no longer a curve, but it's arbitrarily compact, but you have the condition on the dimension of the hull, or non-trivial part of the hull, then it actually has to be a one-dimensional separation. But the thing is that the hull in general may have non-international. In general, may have non-enting interior even if k is some counterside. So, this, you know, part of the reason to give these examples is to build some intuition towards these hulls, but the reality is that these hulls are so difficult to describe, they defy essentially any intuition that you may have about halts. All right, so, but going back to this question of analytic structure, the answer. This question of analytic structure, the answer in general is no. And Stoltzenberg was the first one to find a counterexample. So there is a compact set which is not polynomial convex, which has a non-terrial HAL, but the HAL has no holomorphic disks. And it's not just holomorphic disks that are attached to compact. It's just some holomorphic disk which sets non-terrival map from D into the HAL. into the HAL so that which is contained so the image of the disk is contained in the HAL. So that's in a very general sense. And there are no assumptions on the map except that it's non-constant. Okay, then there are many more examples of these compact sets that have non-trivial polynomial hull with no analytic structure. So one of them is, for example, you can take a unit For example, you can take a unit circle in C and you'll take a continuous function. And the how of that of the graph of this continuous function is not trivial. It doesn't have any analytic disk, but if you project it, it actually projects onto the unit disk. So it's quite big, but it has no disks. But nevertheless, there are some problems. There are some properties of Halz that behave almost like analytic structure. And one of them is the famous Rossi's maximum principle, which says the following, that suppose I have a point P in the how and suppose I take some open set containing P V and I take a holomorphic function. I take my holomorphic function in V, then, or in the neighborhood of V, then the maximum, so then the maximum, so that the absolute value at P cannot exceed the absolute value of the boundary. So, this is the property that you would have on complex manifolds, but you also have it on the Hulls. And so we talked about holomorphic disk being part of the polynomial convex hull, but it's not necessarily part of the rationally convex hull. For example, if you take the center torus S1 cross S1, this is rationally convex, but it has disks attached. So these disks are part of the polynomial complex, however, they're not. None of the complex, however, they're not part of the rational complex. And the general property that if k is a surface, real surface, and you have a disk, holomorphic disk attached to it, and if the boundary of the disk bounds a domain in your surface, then that disk is in the rational cometh. Okay, here's the third example. Here's the third example. So if you take a compact set in Rn spanned by just real parts of coordinates, then any compact in that plane or submanifold linear subspace is rational convex and therefore polynomial convex. And moreover, this sort of, if you take Sort of, if you take rational functions with poles of k, if you restrict them to k and take the uniform limit on k, sort of you take the closure, then it's the same as continuous functions on your component game. Okay, and this is related to approximation result. If you have this identity, that this implies that you have this identity. But this identity is already then this implies that your compact gain is rational compact. So RN is an example of a totally real manifold. A totally real manifold means that if you look at the tangent space at some point, or at any point, then if you it as a linear subspace of Cn, then it should not contain any. Then it should not contain any non-tervial complex directions. So one may wonder then, maybe the above theorem also holds for totally real manifolds. And the answer is no. There are some examples of totally real disks, so two-dimensional, that are not rationally convex, or that are rationally convex, but not polynomial convex. So there's something special. So there's something special about Rns being completely flat that allows us to conclude that any compact on that space is of a normal direction complex and everything is triggered. But as soon as your totally real manifold has some curvature, then you no longer have this result for granted. And if you look at manifolds of higher dimension, then of course high Higher dimension, then of course, higher than critical dimension, then of course they can no longer be totally real. And there are portions of that manifold that have positive CR dimension. And CR dimension is the dimension of this maximal complex subspace that is contained in the tangent space. And if that dimension doesn't change as you move from point to point, then you have a CR manifold of some other CR dimension. Of some other zero dimension, then those manifolds cannot be even locally rational or polynomial convex. And by locally, meaning that for every point, you cannot find a compact neighborhood, which is rational, polynomial, convex. But that happens for a different reason. If you have a manifold like that, you have a point, then if the CR dimension of the manifold is positive, then you can actually construct holomorphic distances. Actually, construct holomorphic disks attached to L, and in fact, they have formed a family of such disks that sort of come out to a point here. And all these disks have to be in the Hub, even in the rational complex hull. Okay, and sort of the second half of my And sort of the second half of my talk will be about rational complexity of real set manifolds in CM. So I'll come back to this question later. Okay, so as we see, formal definitions of polynomial and rational convexity are generally difficult to verify on a specific compact set that you have. So people were looking for various characteristics. We're looking for various characterizations of polynomial and rational convexity. One of them, for example, is very simple. A compact set is rationally convex if for any point outside k, you can find a complex hypersurface, like algebraic hypersurface. kind of surface which passes through P and avoids K. And if we can do that for every point outside K, then your K is rational complexity. That is already a convenient sort of alternative definition of rational complexity. Analogous statement for polynomial complexity is more complicated. It's not enough to have just a hypersurface that passes through the point. What you want to have, you want to have a factor. Of what you want to have, you want to have a family, and this is what I think Wake was mentioning in his talk. You want to have a family somehow that you can continuously sort of dewir and move to infinity. So more precisely, this is known as Ocker's characterization of polynomial convexity. So point P is not in the polynomial convex hull if there exists a continuous family of complex hypersurfaces in In Cn such that the sort of the initial hypersurface passes through your point, none of them intersect compact set K, and as the parameter goes to 1, you're sort of going to infinity. So, which means that given any compact set in Rn for some t less than 1, all your varieties for t giga number are going to be outside that gigaxet. And that means that it goes to infinity. Okay, so other characterizations exist. To formulate the next characterization, I'm just going to quickly define a Ruby domain. Ruby domain is a domain in CN. Domain means open, connected open set. So that all polynomials or entire functions are dead in the space of holomorphic functions. Okay, so here's another characterization which is due to Paletsky. And it says the following: that suppose I have some from the domain, I have a compact set K, that then when P is not in the hub, or isn't the hub rather, if for any open neighborhood K, sorry, U of K, so you have to be open neighborhood U of And any positive epsilon, there exists a holomorphic map, so it's a holomorphic disk from a neighborhood of the unit disk C into this large OB domain omega, such that the center of the disk passes through the point P, and then you want to control the boundary, and you say that the boundary in this In this, I want to make this u smaller very, very close to k and so what I what I want to say about the boundary is that it's almost there. That maybe there is some little portion of the boundary of the disk that stays. Of the disk that stays outside this Q and everything else, meaning that the set which has well this set which so sticks out is your open set U has only the back measure epsilon on the disk. And everything else is inside your U. So it's not quite attached to your compact K, but it's very close. Compact k, but it's very close to being so. And if you can do that for any open set containing k and for any epsilon bigger than zero, that means that your p is in the how. A similar sort of characterization for rational convexity or polynomial convexity, right? You can do that in terms of Currents, this is done by dual C4ni, so you have a positive one-one current, which is sort of a generalization of C2, this would be generalization of the disk. And sort of this is sort of like this condition is sort of like the boundary condition for the current. And we're saying that the boundary has to be somehow a measure of the alkompact K. You may also. K, and you may also gain some dirt sort of function at your point. Oh, so there is a type of view. That should be P X. Okay, these sort of characterizations are related. There is a well-founded way to construct these dual sequencing currents from Paletsky disks. So there is something Common to these two characterizations. And well, this existence of this positive one-long current, it's sort of morally a replacement for the holomorphic disk that you may have. And so that may explain the Ross's maximum principle, that there is no analytic structure, but there is still some analytic objects inside Hubble. Alright, so these are interesting characterizations and sort of in a sense that people come back to them and try to find different proofs and get that. But again, these are not particularly easy to use for practical purposes. In fact, I don't know a single result that would use practically any characterizations. Okay, so here's one interesting problem that I'd like to discuss, and it's a very old one. So Blake gave a proof why connected components of a polynomial convex compact are individually polynomium convex. And then the question is what happens if you take the union of some compact sets. And this is surprisingly difficult. And this is a surprisingly difficult problem. So, the result from 1964 says that the union of three mutually disjoint closed balls in Cf is polynomial convex. So each individual unit closed unit ball is of course polynomial convex. If you take the union of three, they're also polynomial convex. But sort of an embarrassing problem, open problem, is that we don't know whether the union of four bonds, this universe, Of four bolts, these during bolts is always Palinova with compact. We don't have any counterexamples and it's an open compact. It's been open since I suppose 1964. There are some counterexamples. So if you replace balls by convex sides, polydisc, ellipsoids, then that's original. You can have unions that are not polynomial complex, whereas individual sort of compacts are polynomial complex. So what I sort of to give the flavor of why the union of four objects may not be paramount or three compacts may not be paramount or convex. So one of the counterexamples that you can construct, so you start with LU sets, and you have. So you start with ellipsoids, and you have these ellipsoids that quite rat. Convex ellipsoids or each individual one is polynomial convex. Even two of them separately are polynomial convex. Proof of that is sort of the union of two balls is polynomial convex. The proof is rather simple. And what happens with this situation, if you choose your ellipsoids carefully, then somehow Then somehow miraculously you have this one-dimensional algebraic variety which looks like this. They go like that. But if you take these curves on the ellipsoids, they bounded domain, we over 8. And so therefore this has to be in the house of the union. That's a counterexample. For some Counter example. For some magic, you cannot do that with three balls. You can never find a variety like that. But ellipsoids or anything else, essentially, you can find something. Okay, so there is a corresponding problem whether the union of closed balls is rationally convex. Of course, balls are also rationally convex. And just recently, well, fairly recently, Just recently, well fairly recently, Nebrovsky gave a proof of the result is that any finite disjointing unit of closed quality is rationally complex. So the difficulty here, I mean, just by looking at the picture, the walls are disjoint, but they have, you know, when they look like this, you have two large walls like that, and then here you go. Like that, and then here we do a small ball, and then geometrically, things become quite difficult to just nevertheless. Any finite union of these joint volts is rational. The sub variety is it uh for any dimension? The sub variety you construct is it for any sub uh Construct as if for any dimensions you can construct. Okay. So, no, this was a specific counterexample. You have specific ellipsoids. Explicitly written, so you have equations that define your ellipsoids. And when you have explicitly written variables, and then you show that the intersection with the boundary of the ellipsoids are curves, and these curves bound either mainly. In in s the example is in C two C3. But that's good enough. I mean, you put C two in C three and it's the same. You don't have to change anything, you just add it to the image. The balls are four-dimensional. And you can't just take the same thing. Oh, but the balls are full-dimensional, yes. Right, so you can't take the same inst you just have to modify it. I mean the same thing would work in C2 because they are not four-dimensional bones. Well you you add a little bit. You already added sort of equation that makes all other variables vanish at the moment. Dimension is not an issue. Generically, it seems generically true or tears to be exceptional. Generically, maybe it's true. Generically, maybe it's true. I don't know. There are some partial results. For example, for the balls, if you let the balls to be only on RN, on the totally real sort of pandemic center, if all the centers are on RN, then the union is polymeric comments. And you can take as many balls as you want to. But if you allow sort of centers to be random, chosen, then equation for four balls. I have a question slash comment, if I may, about the dimension. Yes. So Kaleen's original example was actually in C3, not in C2. The balls were in C3. Maybe it isn't. I mean, the polydiscs, the counterexample that you gave the polydisc was in C3. Well, the one that I gave was for electrolytes. Was for ellipsoid. You might be right, maybe C3, not C2. So you're saying there's an example of ellipsoids in C2? Yeah, I sort of, I don't remember. I think it's actually C3. Okay. Yeah, I think all the examples I know about are in C3. Oh, I see. But there's an example of. Of Rose that's in C2 with complex sets. They're not how it is or a bit solid. Yeah, so this is also convex, but these are elixirs, but I think you're right. These are in C3. Alright. Okay, so now I want to make a connection with Now, I want to make a connection with Fleury subharmonic functions, and sort of my logo is that underneath any complex analytic object, there is a Flurry subharmonic function somewhere. So what you can do, you can define Hull, just like we sort of define rational polynomial convex hulls as Hulls with respect to a subfamily of functions, you can do the same thing with pluralisabharmonic functions. And you define a pluris abharmonic hull of a complex. 2 is a harmonic half of a complex set. And you can also do that on any domain in CN or on any complex manifold as long as you have a good supply of Plurispharmonic functions, you can define this notion. And sort of general fact that you, in general, Plurispharmonic functions are only upper semi-continuous, but in this definition, you can actually choose them to be continuous, and you're going to have exactly the same notion of a You're going to have exactly the same notion of a hull. And the general result here is that for complex sets in Cn, polynomial complex hull is the same as pluralis alpha one. Alright, so the little sort of comment here that the notion of polynomial convexity therefore can be generalized to arbitrary complexity. To arbitrary complex manifolds, even almost complex manifolds, if you only if you sort of use a Lewis half harmonic hull rather than polynomial convex hull. So for example, you can do it on almost complex manifolds. There is a notion of pseudo-convexity, pseudo-lubric of harmonicity there by just taking a jehomorphic disk and taking composition for your function, and it has to be harmonic on the disk. And for example, Rose H. And for example, Rosé showed that these Hulls, defined on all those complex manifolds with respect to Pluto's subharmonic functions, also satisfy Rossi's maximum. So they do preserve some structure similar to that of polynomial complex hulls. Okay, and then here is the sort of useful technical result that follows from this equivalence of polynomial. Equivalence of polynomial and polynomial complexity and convexity with respect to Pluri subhromonic functions. So if you have a polynomial convex compact, then there exists a negative Pluris uphrmonic function which benches precisely on your compact and it's an exhaustion function on Cm. And you can make it to be equal to mod z squared at infinity. At infinity. And you can choose your this function to be C infinity smooth and strictly Blue Rex are harmonic outside the complex. And so this is a sort of fairly useful tool for questions related to polynomial complexity. The converse is also true. If you have a negative Florisopharmonic function, which goes, which is an exhaustion function, essentially non-negative Flurry's apronomy function. Essentially, non-negative Louisophanomic functions. Then the zero set of that Louisophromanic functions is polynomial couples. Okay, so then the next question, so we saw the connection between those hyperharmonic functions and polymer convexity. So what about rational complexity? So the first result here is due again to develop siblings, and it says the following. And it says the following: that if you have a compact set in Cm, which is rational compact, then there exists a smooth, closed, one-to-one form omega k, which vanishes, so defined on all of Cm, which vanishes on k and strictly positive on Cn minus. And then you take the potential of this form, and it's a Plurisabharmonic function. It is strictly Plurisabharmonic. outside K. And the other result is sort of the, this is the result that I wanted to discuss in more detail. Suppose you have a compact total real zip manifold of Cm. Then M is rational convex if and only if there exists a K-L for omega on Cm such that M is isotropic or Lagrangian in the critical dimension with respect to omega. One direction of the proof is you can use this theorem of the first theorem to conclude one direction. So if k is where your manifold m is rationally convex, then you take this omega k from the previous theorem, and then you take the square distance function to m. The square distance function to m, because m is a totally real submanifold, the square distance function is strictly totally subharmonic. Distance function is strictly two is a harmonic in a small neighborhood of your of your manifold. And because the square distance function, the differential vanishes on m and sort of the pullback of the DDC of the square distance function also vanishes on m. And use glue together this square distance function with a potential. function with a potential of omega k and that gives you the required sort of k of one on Cn with respect to which your manifold is going to be isotropic or potential and in the other direction sorry I think I missed in the other direction the proof is quite technical and it uses the permanderal to map Fermato L2 method for solving the optical bar, and there is a technique that develops when you develop how to construct these complex hypersurfaces outside M that sort of pass through every given point but avoid M. So that's sort of the most substantial part of this theory. There is another characterization of rational condensity, which is explicitly Explicitly formulated by Nimerovsky, and it says that if you have a strictly pluralist hypothetic function on an open set in Cn such that dz extends to a positive potential to kero form of Cn, then the zero set or the sub-zero sub-level set is compact, then it's viable compact. I want to give some examples of when To give some examples of when this develops theorem can be used. One example is the eggistic standard torus in this Lagrangian with respect to the standard K-La4. Therefore, it is rational convex by the L Spirit. The next example is perhaps more interesting. We look at totally real embedded 3-sphere in C3, and the claim is that it's not Russian. Well, if it was rational come back, then it would be Lagrangian by de Val Syboni. But then if it's Lagrangian, then by Gromov's theorem, there is a holomorphic disk, non-terrival holomorphic disk attached to it. Then the boundary of that disk has to bound the domain in your S, because S is simply connected. And as I mentioned, that implies that that disk has to be in a rational component. Capital. And that's a contradiction, so that means that totally real S3 in V in C3 is never threshold. Okay, so maybe I'll discuss some generalization of results of Deval Cybernet. So there are several results that they'd like to mention. Um I may be missing some results that I'm not aware of. Results that I'm not aware of. One result is Gaia, and he gives the result is the following: that if you have Lagrangian immersion, which transfers double self-intersection points, then these are rational compacts. But note that this is not a characterization. It's only in one direction. And it's, so if it's Lagrangian inversion, then it is rational complexity. Then it is rationally complex. The converse is not part of this result. And in fact, the converse is not true. In other words, you can find rationally convex inversions which are not Lagrangian with respect to any kiloflow. So the example comes from a sort of general result that if you take two kilofilm Two totally real subspaces, each two, that are transverse intersect just at one point. Then there is a precise characterization when the union of these two things, say intersecting with a large wall, is rational convex. And the sort of description is that, well, you can always make one of these subspaces R2, and the other one is. R2 and the other one is just going to be a graph. And the graph is linear, so you have some matrix there. And the characterization is done by looking at the eigenvalues of that matrix. And then certain conditions that guarantees you that your so the the dichotomy is that either the urine is rational convex or there are these angle that look like that. That look like that. So these are holomorphic, so these are Riemann surfaces, and that has, the boundary has two components. One is attached to one of these manifolds here, the other one is attached to the other. And it's actually the whole family that goes like this. And so if you have analyte like that, then this whole family is on the rationally covered hull. And if you don't have that family, then it's rationally covered. And it's possible to find this specific Find this specific L1 and L2 for which this condition is satisfied, so with eigenvalue, so you have rational complexity. But there is no KL 4 with respect to which both of L1 are. So that is a well your manifold here is sort of not connected, but still it's a it's an immersion of a manifold. So question, if you make it degenerate at the double point, can you find a careful double? Find a car form at that point. So the intersection here is transverse, that's part of the assumption. Yeah, yeah, but if you make the cataphorm degenerate at that point, could it leave a problem outside? Yeah, that's a good question. I'll come back to it. Okay, there was a result by Getsch where he considered isotropics of manifolds in projective manifolds, and there the notion of rational convexity is sort of the one that we gave later. So the one that we gave later, that means that in the complement you have algebraic hypersurfaces that are radio compact. That's definition of rational compact. And then the condition is the same, that under certain homological conditions on the form, these are going to be rational complex. And then there is a different proof by Orubayer Torzen that uses Donanson's method. Donanson's method gives the construction gives the construction. If you have a Lagrangian manifold, then you construct these symplectic manifolds in the complement for hypersurfaces. And in the setting of these K manifolds, these symplectic manifolds in the complement can be complex hypersurfaces. And you sort of naturally have this convexity, rational complexity as of different technique. This is very different from the original approved by Genos. From the original proof by John Sigmund. Okay, and then here's a result by Mitre. So here he considered more general rational inversions and he considered sort of this Calov work with degeneracies. But sort of the result is kind of technical because you need sort of this neighborhood basis at the self-intersection points. And then there are some technical conditions that gives you rational complexity, but it is a characterization, meaning that it works in both directions. And so recent work with Boudreaux is that we generalize devolution to totally real sets. So these are not manifolds, these are generally speaking zero sets of strictly two island harmonic functions. So you have an open set on which you have a strictly two island hormonic functions. You have a strictly Puritan function, non-negative strictly Puritan harmonic function, you look at the zero settlement, that's a totally real set. So, the interesting feature of these sets is that they're locally contained in totally real manifolds. They're not necessarily contained in sort of one large totally real manifold. And the characterization there is also that sort of it's rationally convex, such as compact if you have this special cover by totally real manifolds, and each element of the cover is isotropic. Each element of the cover is isotropic with respect to the same care for. And my conjecture is, I think, what you mentioned, that for emergence, I think the rational complexity may be equivalent to having this form, which is KL outside of the double point, and you are immersing this isotropic or branching with respect to that sort of degenerate KL. So the natural question that arises here is that, well, since we have this characterization of rational complexity, what are the closed real manifolds that we can embed or emerge to complex Euclidean space so that the image is a rational polynomial complex compact. One One immediate condition here is this result by Braud, Dushang, and Staud that says if you have a closed topological submanifold in Cm of dimension N, then it is never polynomial convex. And the proof comes from this early observation that we made about the fundamental group. And so this is a condition that comes from the fundamental group vanishing in the complex. Of the group, vanishing in the complement, and then by Alexander duality converted into a condition on the cosmology of your manifold. And for a closed M manifold, this cohomology is not zero. Therefore, your compact is not polygonally connected. But this result, if you want to embed a sort of n-dimensional manifold into Cm with some convexity property. With some convexity property. That leaves space only for rational convexity. And the result that I wanted to discuss, but I don't think I have enough time for that, is the following, that, well, let S be a closed surface orientable or not, with the exception of S2 and RP2, then there exists a topological rational convex embedding of S into C2. Alright, so let me quickly discuss in the remaining couple of minutes some ideas in the proof. So if you want to consider a smooth embedding, this is a much more difficult problem, but then here we immediately run into a problem, that if it's a smooth, totally real embedding, then it has to be necessarily orangent, according to Yvonne Subrini. And if you take, you know, orientable closed surface. Orientable closed surfaces, then there is an immediate restriction on the early characteristic for agrarian or even totally real embedding of the surface into C2, and only Taurus has such an embedding. And there are additional sort of restrictions on early characteristic in the non-oriented case. So to sort of overcome this difficulty, we use the result of given tau, which says the following. Glow surface admits a Lagrangian inclusion into C2. So inclusion here in the sort of it's not the usual inclusion, it's the terminology of our null and it seems that in syntactic geometry people like to introduce new terminology. So that's a Lagrangian inclusion, meaning the following: that it's a smooth map from SNTC2. From S into C2, which is a local Lagrangian embedding, except a finite set of points. These points are singularities, which are either transverse double self-intersections, or just simply double points, or the so-called Whitney umbrellas. What is a Whitney umbrella? Whitney umbrella is this map from R2 with coordinates T and S into C2, and it's very specific. Specific. It's just a polynomial map of degree 3. It's a homeomorphism which is smooth away from the origin. At the origin, the rank of this map drops to 1. And the image is a semi-algebraic set which has isolated single errors. And so the Whitney umbrella usually is associated with sort of an object like that like this. In R3, this is the Whitney umbrella. This is now Whitney was classifying singularities of maps from Rm to Rm. And probably in this case, it's from map from R2 to R3. And this Wheatney umbrella is the only stable singularity as in map form R2 to R3. But this is a mapping to R4, and so by adding this variable. And so by adding this variable TS, sort of opening this umbrella, you ignore this stick and it becomes an open Wiki umbrella with isolated singularity. And the interesting thing is that this map, if you pull back the standard Lagrangian form of C2, then it vanishes on R2. So it's a Lagrangian Lagrangian singular. Singular Lagrangian embedding into C2. And we have a formulas for, you know, if you start with an arbitrary closed surface, you have a formula that regulates the early characteristic, the number of double points, and the number of umbrellas that you can have. In the orientable case, this is the formula due to Oden. So here, chi S is the really characteristic. Here chi s is the early characteristic, d is the number of double points, and m is the number of dots. So the total number of, well, with this coefficient, it should be zero, and the double points should be counted with index. So you sort of take into account orientation there. In the non-orientable case, here is a second formula mod four. And And uh so and that already showed that in the orientable case you can take any uh admissible triple, early characteristic, number of double points, number of umbrellas, and as long as that formula works you can realize it as in an actual map. And that tells us that any orientable surface except the sphere can be embedded using this given tau map. Using this given tile map. So the Given Tau's inclusion is actually a topological embedding that doesn't have any data points, has only umbrellas. And for the sphere, the best we can do is to look at this explicit map W that gives you an immersion with one double point and its logress. In the non-orientable case, Kivental showed that if early characteristic is less than minus two, then one can Is less than minus 2, then one can take the number of double points to be 0. So again, you get a singular Lagrangian embedding. And then Nimroski and Ziegl found all possibilities for umbrellas in this case. And you can do that for all non-orientable surfaces except RP2. So RP2 requires one double point and two umbrellas if I don't know about it. But Claire model, for example, doesn't have a smooth Lagrangian embedding in 2C2, but it has a Lagrangian embedding with four umbrellas. And so our idea then is, well, so our result says that, well, once you have this given talent immersion without double points, or even with double points, then it Then it is rational convex. And the main sort of result here, the main tool, is that we show that the umbrellas are locally polynomially convex. So you can have a compact neighborhood of the singular point which is polynomially convex. That's result in itself surprisingly difficult to prove. But once you know that But once you know that that sort of single point has a polynomial convex neighborhood, then you would use that function, that plural subharmonic function that vanishes on your polynomial convex and strictly plural subharmonic everywhere else. That is the function that you need sort of to adjust the function of Devon-Sebruni and Kaia so that it works with these singularities. And the fact that these umbrellas are local polynomial convex. Umbrellas are local polynomial convex, sort of a separate, fairly technical, difficult theorem. That sort of here I have an idea done through sort of considering characteristic foliation on some special hypersurface in which the umbrella sits. Sort of this Whitney umbrella, sort of the surprising thing is that the standard Whitney umbrella for the immersion you can use any local symplectomorphism and Any local symplectomorphism, and the result is that whatever local symplectomorphism you choose to map standard with the umbrella into yeah, that image is still polynomial convex, although the symplectomorphism is far from the polymorphic or biholomorphic. Right, so uh sort of I want to say that we don't know what happens with a student. Know what happens with S2 or RP2, whether they have a rationally convex embedding, topological embeddings, such as two, that's an open question. And in dimensions higher than two, is almost nothing is known as far as any questions from Russia. I have a question about that last result you were talking about. So you you proved that these umbrellas are are totally problematic are good at the merely umbrella. Near the umbrella, what you have is polynomial convex, I guess, right? But the umbrella itself is polynomial convex. Yes. But how do you patch that together with the rest of the immersed object? Well, I mean, it's a technical process. You repeat the proof of Gaia, and Gaia takes a Gaquela form, and it sort of modifies itself. It sort of modifies it so that it's zero in a neighborhood of the singular point. And you use this K-Lo form to, in combination with the method of DeWalt Supernit to construct these hypersurfaces. And everything works except that where that sort of K-Lo form is not zero and so on the boundary, you need some additional information to make the conclusion that the value of anime in their construction. In their construction. And that's there, you use this Louisaparmonic function that comes from local polynomial company. It's kind of technical, I can't really explain exactly how we use it. But it's there, it's only needed locally in the neighborhood of a single company. Okay. Yeah, I can understand it would be very technical, and capital can be explained in detail as well. So it's a common term, this is a kind of interaction between interaction between subject and complex. So this with the umbrella can be seen as a singular Lagrangian filling over this, but you have to TB plus 2 rotating on TB minus 2. Anyway, it's a degenerate note that does not mean that benefits but single. I mean, the benefit is not syncret. Got the comms over that singularity? Stabilized, right? Yeah, this is stabilized digital things. Stabilized digital. Last question mentioned about S2 admitting that. So if you knew S2 admitted a look around genome data. S2, if they did a look around gene embedding with some kinds of singular areas, would there be any hope of showing that that would be S2 cannot have a look on immune like single? That would open with the umbrellas, but maybe just there's some other chance that some other singularities could also apply. If there is a way to construct, I think that would be the way produce maybe some singularities that somehow you the if you take a generic embedding of sphere in uh Of sphere in C2, then it necessarily has these elliptic complex points. An elliptic complex point has the same behavior. So near that point, everything is totally real except this point, and you cannot get through it. Near this point, you have these hybrid disks. And that immediately gives you the hub. So, generic embedding of the sphere in C2, definitely not ratio embedded. But if you somehow introduce But if you somehow introduce some singularities and avoid having many kinds of complex points, for example, when umbrella is kind of roughly equivalent to like the cone over some Legendre, so you could imagine singularities which are cones of the whole complicated Legend or something like that. Yeah, maybe, yeah. I think that would be the way to go. That would be the way to go, I feel like that's right to move this. Unless there is some completely different approach. Have you talked about just the topological embedding of S2 into into C2 to be rationally convex? I mean, what if you don't worry about smoothness? You just think about the topological embedded. That is the question. If you have a topological embedded, that was the formulation. Oh, I didn't mention. Yeah, but it cannot, well, it's most likely not smooth. Most likely meaning that
