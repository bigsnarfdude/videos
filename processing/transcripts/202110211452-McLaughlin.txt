Project is also in close collaboration with Tim, who just gave a talk a few minutes ago. And I'm going to be talking about asynchronous nuclear division in fungal cells. So fungal cells are... I need to adjust all the Zoom faces. One second. So fungal cells are fascinating. They are found nearly everywhere on the planet. Nearly everywhere on the planet, from within our world's forests to the depths of the ocean to some really extreme environments, including within the Greenland ice sheet. I mean, they are absolutely critical components to functioning and healthy ecosystems. So they're very worthwhile to study, you know, just from that ecological angle. And I think for most of us, especially this time of year, the most obvious part of fungi are mushrooms. And they're obviously, you know, as these pictures show, they're beautiful, they're diverse. These pictures show. They're beautiful, they're diverse, they're colorful. They've captured a lot of people's, you know, interest and imagination because of this. But there is so much more to the fungus organism than just the mushroom. So mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of the fungus, much like an apple. But just like an apple is connected to a much larger tree, the mushroom is connected to this huge mycelial network. So if you're thinking about mushrooms popping up into the forest, Mushrooms popping up into the forest. This mycelium is going to be under all of the forest floor, this huge interconnected network connecting all of the trees to each other. And these are large, large cells that grow into this dense interconnected network structure. And when I say large, I mean, this could be hundreds of microns, this could be centimeters, this could be meters, it could even be acres. Some argue that the largest organism on the planet is a mushroom in Oregon that spans like Oregon that spans like something crazy, like three square miles. So they're absolutely enormous. And these are single cells that contain many nuclei, all within this common cytosol. And so because they're so large, they face an interesting challenge here of needing to be able to both work together as a cohesive unit, because at the end of the day, they're one organism that wants to survive. To survive, but simultaneously, because they're so big, if you think about the forest floor example, you could have one part of the fungus that's experimenting or that's experiencing a completely different environment from another part. So they really need to be able to react locally to these changing environmental conditions. And so this leads to a lot of heterogeneity within these cells. And just in general, they face a really interesting challenge of scale. And so an example. And so, an example of a filamentous fungus that grows in this mycelial state is Ashbia gasipii, which is what we study in Amy's lab. And so, this, if you can see it on the left, this is a time series movie of Ashbia, where each of these dots is a fluorescently labeled nuclei. And this schematic on the right just shows us a single time point where we're also looking at fluorescently labeled nuclei in a more zoomed-in image. And you can see that. And you can see that these cells are structured in these branch-like filaments, and each branch we call a hypha. And within these hypha, this is one continuous cytoplasm that has all of the nuclei inside of it. So there's no walls or barriers. Occasionally septa will form, but for the most part, this is all just sort of things can freely diffuse and move within this branch. And so you can see that this movie. You can see that this movie shows a little bit more of the growth of Ashbia. So it's growing from right to left here. And the way that it grows in the same way that all filamentous fungus grows is from these polarized sites at the hyphal tips. And then as the network expands and gets bigger and bigger, nuclei divide and move to fill up the space. And you can see there's just fascinating movies to watch. There's so much going on here. The nuclei, the movement is based. The nuclei, the movement is basically on a combination of background flow. So you can kind of think of the growth almost like a syringe, just being pulled at the tip, and all of the cytosol and just everything in the cell is going to have to kind of shift along and move towards that growing tip. But at the same time, there's microtubule dynein-based movement and all of that kind of back and forth, jittering, rearrangement of location. That's all based on the microtubules. So there's a lot going on. I mean, just to briefly talk about the cell cycle in general for a second. So, way back in the 70s and 80s, before we knew exactly how the cell cycle was regulated, there were some really classic cell biology experiments where they took mammalian cells in different states of the cell cycle and forced them to fuse. And what they saw, and I didn't know why at the time, but they saw that the nuclei in this newly common cytosol synchronized in their division time. Synchronized in their division time. And now we understand a lot more about this. We understand that the cell cycle is a biochemical oscillator that's based around rising and falling levels of these cyclin proteins that drive it forward. And here in this context, it was the sharing of these cell cycle regulators in this common cytosol that led to this synchrony. So back to Ashbia. What's really, really interesting about this fungus is that the nuclear About this fungus is that the nuclei in Ashbia divide asynchronously. They, you know, nuclei do not divide at the same time as their immediate neighbors. And so, you know, based on the previous slide, this is not what we would expect. It would make a lot more sense just in terms of these cell cycle regulators diffusing throughout this common cytozolic space for all of the nuclei to sync up. And not all fungi are asynchronous. Some are. There's a few other examples. Some are. There's a few other examples. Some are completely synchronous. Some have nuclear division that is in kind of waves that move down the hyphae. And there are some other species that'll kind of switch back and forth between synchronous and asynchronous states, depending on environmental cues. But as far as we can tell, Ashbia is always in this asynchronous state. And there's a couple of possible reasons why the cell might want to be in this state of asynchrony. It could help to, you know, it could. It could help if we're just thinking about each nucleus being fully autonomous from all of the others. That could help to facilitate those local responses that I was talking about. It could also be a way of distributing energy consumption among the cell. Maybe if you just don't do all of your cell, your nuclear divisions at once, that'll be a little bit more efficient. And it could also help conserve the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, which this cell does like to preserve. And if you had all To preserve. And if you had all of the divisions happen at once, the cell would need to grow really, really fast to be able to maintain that ratio. And so a few possible ways that these cells could be establishing this population of asynchronous dividing nuclei. I mean, one could be that there might be specific locations within the cell that when nuclei move into those or pass over them, it serves to kind of promote my You know, it serves to kind of promote mitosis in those regions that would not be necessarily affecting nearby nuclei. There could be active, you know, kind of repulsive signals from mitotic nuclei directly affecting, you know, the nearby neighbors, possibly like CDK inhibitors or, you know, we're not sure. Another interesting idea is this concept of cytosolic compartmentalization. And so this is the idea that there's something And so, this is the idea that there's something distinct about the cytosol around each nuclei, almost in like a cell within a cell kind of way, if that makes sense. You know, and this could be in some way, this nucleus might be kind of holding molecules that are relevant to the cell cycle near it to prevent it, you know, to prevent them from diffusing over to this nucleus. Or they could be setting up sort of diffusion barriers of some sort to be insulating, you know. To be insulating themselves from the neighboring nuclei. There's a lot of possibilities there of how that could play out. Another thing that we'll need to consider is just spatial fluctuating concentration gradients of these cell cycle regulators and this opacity involved there. But the goal of this project is to construct a mathematical model to test these, among other possible mechanisms that could be leading to asynchrony, and then compare. To asynchrony and then compare with live cell experiments. And so, here we're going to be modeling a population of dividing nuclei as coupled oscillators. And so, coupled oscillators are a really, really interesting topic. There is this ubiquitous tendency for coupled oscillating systems to synchronize. And this is across many different scales, modes of coupling, and fields. So, the sort of engineering physics example, all sort of engineering physics example all of these metronomes a moment ago started out of sync they're mechanically coupled through this board which leads to them all eventually falling into phase this is a little hard to see but these are all synchronously flashing fireflies in thailand and this is a form of behavioral coupling so each firefly is just slightly adjusting its frequency of flashing based on all of the signals that it's receiving from all of the fireflies around it until the whole population of fireflies spontaneously. Population of fireflies spontaneously synchronizes. Some more cell biological examples include coordinated electrical coupling, the coordinated beating of pacemaker cells, or diffusion-based coupling. These are dividing nuclei in an embryo. And so all of these examples, among others, helped to inspire what's called the Kuramota model, which has become a really Kuramoto model, which has become a really classic model to model coupled phase oscillators. So, if you go through this, it's a pretty simple model and it's just written out here, but what's kind of fascinated people is that it yields a lot of complex dynamics and has also been able to really accurately model a lot of these coupled oscillating systems across engineering and biology. And so, we're modeling each oscillator as a phase oscillator. A phase oscillator. And so its phase velocity here is described by: if it was in isolation, it would just be running at its natural frequency. And as we add more oscillators into the system, we get this coupling term, which is basically saying that, you know, this is the effect of the jth oscillator on i. So we're looking at how all of the oscillators are pulling each other towards their phase. And this, and, you know, and this would allow us to model a whole population of interacting oscillators that. Of interacting oscillators that could spontaneously synchronize. And so here we're going to be taking this model and modifying a bit, modifying it a bit towards our system. So we're going to be modeling the cell cycle in Ashbia as phase oscillators. And the reason that we're doing it this way is we don't, you know, if you look at some of these models of the cell cycle, you know, they can get extremely complicated. So many different feedback loops and things interacting. And we at this point don't. And we at this point don't know what the key regulators are for ASHBIA. So it would be a little bit difficult to create a very, very detailed mechanistic model like that. So we're just going to start here by kind of removing all of those details and just saying everything about the cell cycle stage is going to be represented by this one phase variable theta. And then the nuclei are going to be modeled as this growing population of oscillators in one dimension. And here are And here are some of the modifications to the Kuramoto model that we're making. So, as I mentioned, the number of oscillators is increasing with time. So, here's an example where we start with one oscillator, and when this oscillator completes a period, that equation, that ODE, is removed from the system, and then sort of two daughter equations are born to kind of simulate cell division. And now we've got two, and you know, and maybe this one completes its period, and now we've got three, and so on. Period, and now we've got three, and so on. So we have this growing system of ODEs that are all interacting with each other through this coupling term. And if you noticed in that earlier movie I showed of growing ashbia, the nuclei are very mobile. So what's nice in terms of the like mechanical, the mathematical modeling aspect of this system is they are fairly one-dimensional, which is pretty handy, but they're also, you know, they're moving a lot and they're permutating. They're moving a lot and they're permuting their order. They're oscillating back and forth. They definitely repel their neighbors and maintain a very non-random spacing. So we're interested in adding a lot of these motion aspects into the model. And just to start with, the simplest thing is really just having this adjacency matrix be a function of time and just have them permute their order and swap back and forth with some rate. And the exact way that we're going to do this and kind of these parameters. We're going to do this and kind of these parameters of swapping we're going to be getting from experimental time series data. And so, in terms of what the interaction, the coupling function should be for this model, I mean, we're going to start with sign just because that's really the simplest thing that we can start with. It's sort of the traditional thing to use in terms of all the previous Kuramoto modeling that's been done. And here's just a really simple example of the output of the model. So, here on Y, you can see the oscillator's spatial. You can see the oscillator's spatial location. And then on X is time. And then the heat map shows the phase of each oscillator. And so all of the oscillators in the system or their frequencies are just drawn from this normal distribution. And right now, the adjacency matrix is constant. So nobody is moving around in time. And you can see here, I'm starting with one. And as soon as that first one completes a period, it divides, it's removed from the system, and then we get two. Removed from the system, and then we get two daughter equations. And you can see it's growing, growing, growing. And this is a fairly synchronous, not completely synchronous example with a coupling constant of one. You can see if I decrease that by an order of magnitude, we get a much more asynchronous system, which is what we would expect. And so, some possible things that we could add on top of this to test some of those mechanisms that I discussed a few slides back. A few slides back, might be putting physical regions of space that speed up the cell cycle for oscillators that move onto that grid point. We could also add this inhibition from mitotic nuclei. And this we could do just as simply as instead of having this orange nucleus try to pull the green nucleus towards its phase, we could just switch it and have it push it away. And then, as I mentioned, we want to do some modeling of the mobility of these. Of the mobility of these oscillators. So, to start with, you know, we'll do, we'll keep everything on a fixed lattice, have it be just nearest neighbor coupling, and then, you know, permute the order in some way that makes sense based on the experimental data. But we're also interested in maybe a more complicated model of mobility because they are doing a lot more than just staying on a fixed grid and switching positions. And we do wonder if their ability to repel their neighbors and To repel their neighbors and keep a certain distance away. You know, if we're thinking about sharing cell cycle regulators and maybe if they're trying to keep a region of cytosol kind of around each nucleus, it might be really important to keep a good distance from your neighbor for that to work out. So we might make a more detailed model of motion. And then finally, something we don't have this in right now, but we would like to in the future is change the way that. In the future, is change the way the coupling is being done. So instead of having it be either nearest neighbor coupling, or here it would probably be some function of distance, we think it would be really interesting to make it a little bit more realistic and have some sort of diffusible signal emanating from each nucleus that would be sort of left behind as they're moving around and then have coupling be mediated through that. And so at this point, what we really need is experimental data to be able to. Experimental data to be able to compare to the model, to be able to make sense of what the output of the model means. Because, you know, we need to kind of define what does asynchrony really mean in terms of time series data in these cells. And so this is a collaboration with Jay, and we're working on making a nuclear tracking pipeline to be able to handle this data. And so this has largely three parts to it. So the first is going to be, you know, actually Going to be, you know, actually collecting the data, imaging these nuclei through time. And then we need to, you know, localize them and then group them, segment them into their hyphae, and then link the nuclei through time and figure out where the division events are happening in order to build the lineages. So I'll kind of just step through these and talk about where we are with all of these. So at this point, we've got it, we have all the imaging parameters figured out and we're, you know, Figured out, and we're, you know, I'm actively taking data, which is pretty exciting. This is all just being done on our lab's confocal microscope. And there's a few, there's a few tricky things here. The time scales, so the time scales of nuclear movement and the time scales of the cell cycle are pretty different. And that's been the biggest challenge with imaging. So the nuclei move at about a micron per minute, but sometimes they'll jump much faster in these little bursts that are some sort of, you know, That are some sort of molecular motor-based movement. And then the cell cycle itself is closer to 120 minutes on average. So we need many, many hours of movie in order to be able to, you know, get multiple generations here. But that's in a little bit of a conflict with the fact that we need to also be able to track these things over that amount of time. So it's been a bit tricky to figure out the balancing of not hitting the cells with too much light that everything bleaches. Cells with too much light that everything bleaches and the cells die, but also be able to get, you know, a long enough movie. But I think we have that straightened out at this point. The next step is a challenge in its own. So localizing these nuclei has not been too difficult just because, you know, they're big, they're bright, that's not a problem. Segmentation though has been really challenging because I think you've been able to see these are strange shaped cells. You know, they're very variable in just in the ways that they overlap. In just in the ways that they overlap and how they grow. And there's just no one image is going to look anything like, you know, a second image. But the basic problem here is: so, all of these X's are localizations, the location of these nuclei. And then the color coding here is based on the hypha, the hypha that each nucleus is in. And so, what we, in an ideal world, we would like to find some sort of algorithm that could kind of linearly group all of these points. Of linearly group all of these points together, that's proved to be a challenge. So, I'm just doing this by hand very tediously for now. But if anybody has any, you know, thoughts or ideas or would want to talk about this further, it's definitely something that I'd be very interested in. And then finally, so linking and identifying division events. So, this has a few challenges of its own. One example here, so this top row is showing a bypassing event, basically, two nuclear. Bypassing event, basically two nuclei that are switching locations. And then this bottom is showing up your division. And so you can see here these last three frames, if you compare them, they look pretty similar. Like I don't think you'd be able to look at these and tell which one was a bypassing and which one was a division. So this concept of having past, like the past information, the past sort of state of these objects is really, really critical to be Really, really critical to be able to tell them apart. So, this is where Jay is coming in. And I'm not going to talk about the details here, but he's working on a Bayesian-based approach towards linking and identifying these events and then creating these lineages. And so we're pretty excited about that. And so, once we get all of this experimental data, you know, there's going to be a ton that we can do with it. One thing that we're interested in trying to do is can we interested in trying to do is can we take this experimental time series data and go backwards to the model and potentially learn some of the structure of the model what it should look like based on the real data and so this is a collaboration with Veronica and Lauren and they previously along with a few other people developed a method of doing this of reconstructing the Kuramoto model from time series data and I'm just going to really briefly go over how they figured out how to do this. Over how they figured out how to do this. So, you see the current moda model on the top. And so, what they did is they approximated the coupling function gamma as a truncated Fourier series. And then the problem here really is given a bunch of time series data, what are the best fitting parameters of this model that would have fit the time series data best? And the parameters being basically the whole model, the frequencies, the coupling strength, the underlying. The coupling strength, the underlying network itself, so all of the adjacency matrix, and then the coupling function, which now has these Fourier coefficients as its parameters. So this is a challenging non-linear optimization problem, but they were able to use machine learning tools to solve it pretty efficiently. And basically, they represented the coupling function, the structure of the coupling function as a convolutional neural network. And then it became something that TensorFlow, which is. Something that TensorFlow, which is Google's machine learning library, could work with. And then they were able to solve that optimization problem to learn the best fitting parameters. And this worked pretty well. They did this for a variety of different coupling function structures. And so what we want to try to do is see if we can take this method that they developed and apply it to the model that I've been talking about in this talk, where we have a growing system of current modem oscillators instead of a fixed number. And so that's ongoing work. And so that's ongoing work. And then finally, kind of just to go back to the biology here. Once I have a bunch of this time series data, there are a ton of just interesting biological questions that I want to ask. So the first couple here would be like, are all of these cells equally asynchronous? And even within an individual cell, like, is that cell asynchronous 100% of the time? Asynchronous 100% of the time, or does it potentially kind of go through different phases? And then looking also within a single cell, I'll be really interested to see, you know, are every hypha equally asynchronous? Or is there variability there? And potentially, are the motion of the nuclei in any way correlated with asynchrony? Potentially, so you can see here, like this hypha, the nuclei are much more evenly spaced. Nuclei are much more evenly spaced. They're not really going near their neighbors. They're maintaining a pretty good distance. Whereas, like this Haifa, they're doing a lot more rearranging. They're in, you know, kind of in each other's business, in each other's space a lot more frequently. So I'd be interested to see, like, is this Haifa more, are the nuclei dividing more synchronously compared to this one? And then also, I want to look on a bit more of a global level. So, like, even though these, even though these nuclei divide. These, uh, even though these nuclei divide you know at different times from their immediate neighbors, I think it'll be really interesting to see if there is any form of global regulation with the cell as a whole. Because we do know that the cell is actively regulating its nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio on a global level. So, there is there has to be some amount of global context here, but really getting at the question of how much are these nuclei independent agents versus how much. Agents versus how much are they all working together as part of a whole. And then just in summary here and kind of the kind of where I see this project progressing. So we're, you know, so initially, you know, I'm going to be continuing to take this data set of these wild type movies. We're going to process them through this tracking pipeline. And then we're going to use the data that comes out of this tracking pipeline to, you know, answer some of these initial questions. And then hopefully. Initial questions, and then hopefully determine some optimal parameters for the model. And then, once we have this model figured out, and then we're going to, you know, add all of those possible mechanisms that I talked about for asynchrony and analyze that. And then, based on the conclusions that we get there, we're going to go back to the experiment. And ideally, we're going to either do drug treatments or create mutants that we're then going to image again and reprocess through the tracking pipeline to try to test the results of the model. To try to test the results of the model. And so, thank you for listening. You know, this is a very interdisciplinary project, and a lot of people have been helping me along the way. So I'm very grateful to everybody. So I guess, any questions? Great. Thanks very much, Grace, for a really, really fascinating talk. I see that there's a question in the chat, but Arthur had his hand up first, so I'll let him ask his question and then we can. Hand up first, so I'll let him ask his question, and then we can let Fred ask his from the chat. Hi, Grace. That was a very nice talk. I just a couple of quick questions about the biology. Is it only division that is asynchronous? What about the rest of the self-cycle? Like if you look at when the S phase happen, is it all asynchronous? It's all asynchronous? Okay. And quick one also, do you have a sense of the probability? Sense of the probability of going through a nuclear division. Does it change with the position along the Eiffel, like being closer to the tip or closer to the base? So yeah, the thing that try to find the best image here. So it seems to be divisions happen everywhere for sure. There's not like locations that they only happen. But near branch points where the hyphae split, they seem to be more frequent there. Frequent there. So we're definitely interested in looking at the role of geometry and trying to figure out, you know, what might exactly be happening at those locations. Okay. And if you want to stay online for the coffee break, I might have one or two suggestions for you. Yeah, that would be great. Okay, cool. See ya. Thanks. Okay, Fred, you had a question in the chat. Do you want to just unmute yourself and ask it? Sure. Fantastic talk, Grace. I really enjoyed it. So I was wondering. So I was wondering: are the lengths of each individual nuclear cycle or cell cycle, are they approximately the same? They're just asynchronous, or do some have very short cycles and others have much longer ones? They're pretty variable. So on average, they're 120 minutes on average, and the standard deviation is about 40 minutes. So there's a good range. Okay. And also, are your nuclei growing? I was wondering whether growing in size. Like growing in size, yeah. So, wondering whether they need to reach a certain size before they divide, right? Kind of like how we're thinking about cell size regulations, but now just on the nuclei. Well, I don't know. I will say that like the nuclei right before they divide do seem a bit bigger than their neighbors. But at the same time, if you kind of look at the whole hypha, you know, they all look pretty similar in size. Um, right after the divide, there must be. Once it's right after the divide, it must be smaller, right? Yeah, and we haven't quantified that super well. Um, I'm just kind of thinking like based on what I've seen from movies. So yeah, I've definitely seen examples in the movies where like they're bigger and then they divide and then they're smaller, but at the but at the same time, like if I just look at a high fee, like they all really most of the time look pretty similar in size. One thing though, I'm kind of getting like a cell size is a really interesting thing to think about. Really interesting thing to think about in the context of these cells. We do know that, as like throughout the cell cycle, the amount of space in between a nucleus and its neighbors increases as they approach mitosis. So somehow they're, you know, they're sensing that distance away from their neighbors and they're actively pushing them away to kind of give more space in some way. So we have observed that. Sasha, you have a question. Yeah. Hi. I missed the very beginning of your talk. So maybe I missed this, but I was very interested. So you're applying the Kuromoto model and the number of oscillators is increasing, right, as the cells divide. But you're modeling asynchrony, I would expect as the number of oscillators increases, you keep adding, you'll get synchrony, right? As you go add more and more. Go add more and more. Shouldn't the system synchronize? So maybe you're looking at this plot. So you're kind of thinking about what's going to happen within one of these. Yeah, you can increase the coupling strength. You can. So you're changing the coupling strength, but you also change the number of oscillators. I would expect. Number of oscillators, I would expect if a number of oscillators, like if k was constant, the number of oscillators went up, you would synchronize, right? If for the current motor model, it's not increasing. Yeah, I mean, here it's changing dynamically with time, so I don't know what would happen, but if you just increase n, wouldn't you get synchrony in the current motor model as you just increase n? I think it would depend on all the parameter values. All the parameter values and like what the distribution of the frequencies are and all of those kinds of details. I think just in the classical one, I think it would increase, it would lead to synchrony. I think anything for certain parameter values, it does. And it's hard to, yeah, I mean, we'll have to think about how to like kind of quantify synchrony as the number is changing. Because I think some of like the classical some of like the classical um like what order parameters are not going to work super well just as n is changing um so we'll definitely have to think a lot more about you know how to quantify that as the number is changing wouldn't you need the coupling strength to like increase or something with the number to get that uh sash or is there a scaling of k with the n that would be necessary I'd have to think about it more. I thought if you just kept K constant and increased N, you would get synchrony. And that might be the case. Are there questions from Mountain Land? Yeah. First of all, congratulations on a fantastic talk. Thank you. Also beautiful visually. Also, beautiful visually, and I love fungi. My main question is: Is the tip growth of the hyphae also organized by the nuclei or by another organelle in these systems? I think it's by another, and I don't know all of the details, but there is, and I don't think you can see it super well. In general, there's a, there's a, the nuclei are not like right up at the tip, there's sort of Are not like right up at the tip. There's sort of a, you can see it maybe right here. There's a region where there are no nuclei from the tip here. Isn't it organized by a zone of active CDC42, at least in some synthetic fungi? I thought it was something very similar to what controls, you know, cell wall growth in, you know, fission yeast and budding yeast. I think it's very, very similar. I mean, because ashby is, even though it's not found in yeast form, it's very, very genetically. form is very very genetically um like a genetically conserved um yeast which is one of the reason we have you know so many genetic tools available but i do think it is pretty similar although i don't know 100 of the details thank you spitz incorporate there it is arthur do you have another question yeah just um have you ever thought about comparing z-level Thought about comparing the level of asynchrony in between those nuclei with the asynchrony in a like fission yeast cell population or a budding yeast cell population. Like, are they more synchronous than just random cells on a plate or less synchronous? Just to get a sense of. I think that's a really good idea. We haven't thought about that, but I definitely will now. I mean, I have a fundamental question, which is how confident are you that the How confident are you that the behavior of individual nuclei, the cell cycle for individual nuclei, is well described by an oscillator as compared to, say, excitable behavior where you have some, you know, you stall at some phase of the cell cycle, waiting for some signal to trigger advance through the rest of the cell cycle, and then you come back around again. And do you think the Kirimoto model would capitalize? The Kirimoto model would capture, would allow, what do you think would allow you to distinguish in your data between a model based on locally excitable dynamics and some kind of stochastic or other input that determines when you go through another cycle and some kind of synchrony across coupled oscillators. So I think that's an interesting question. So in terms of, so if it was some And so, in terms of, so if it was some sort of excitable system, I think we would need to sort of rethink, you know, I think the Kuramoto model is very much phased off specific. Right. We could make the Kuramoto behave that way by putting in a potential that will require some kind of thermal activation to get over. But the questions you're asking are really good. And I'm not sure we. And I don't know. I mean, in terms of like, how would we get that from the experimental data? I'm not sure. Yeah, I think that's the question to ask. Yeah, I think that's the question to ask. I think: is how would you distinguish just from the time series? I mean, we might give those two as a better model. I feel like we'd need more than just, you know, these nuclear time series movies, maybe. But I'd have to think about that more. But it is something we could play around with just from the models to see if you could, in theory, distinguish that. Or if you could use fluorescent markers for different cell cycle phases and ask, is there a particular cell? And ask: Is there a particular cell cycle phase at which nuclei arrest for variable durations? And does that account for a lot of the variability in the overall time between successive nuclear divisions? That would be another way to look at it. That requires good tracking, but I think you're going to get to the good tracking before too long. There's two other questions here, so maybe I'll shut up and let. Let Jay and Joel have their hands up. I think Joel went first. Can I start? Okay. Does it mean that you ruled out already any inheritance that could happen between one nuclei and the next generation? Like one going fast and so all the one going, you know what I mean? And so locally, you will have differences in the cell. So we've looked at that a bit. And so sister nuclei. So, sister nuclei definitely divide at very different times from each other, but they're a little bit more similar than if you compared to them, like than if you compared those two to the whole population. Does that make sense? Like there is a genetic piece and we should add that into the model, definitely. It's something we want to add in. But it's also not, like, there are clearly other factors that are, you know, these two genetically, you know, identical sister nuclei are being. Know identical sister nuclei are being influenced in some way that they divide at very different times. Okay, thank you. Okay. Yeah. Do you have any observations that tell you that they can synchronize under any circumstances? Do they have any? I mean, they definitely know they have that ability. So, I mean, not, I don't think we've seen that in wild-type cells. I mean, we have some mutants. Wild type cells. I mean, we have some mutants that are more synchronous. So we know that we have a collection of a few things that we know that we can mess with that will lead to. But in terms, I mean, that would be an interesting thing to try to see, like, you know, are there different environmental conditions? Because we usually, I mean, we keep these guys in a very sort of systematic laboratory setting where we always grow them the same way at the same temperature. Same temperature, and they're always exposed to the same media. So, at least under those conditions, they seem to always be asynchronous. If we stress them out or something enough, we'd see some different behavior. So, I smell the far-off smell of coffee brewing somewhere in Banff. I think that those of you who have access to that coffee should go and get it. And I would encourage those of you who are. And I would encourage those of you who are on Zoom land to stick around and talk if there's more questions for the speakers. And let's just thank everybody for a really fantastic session. So I think we're back in half an hour, right? Grace, that really was a fabulous, fabulous talk. I mean, it's just a really beautiful job of articulating.
