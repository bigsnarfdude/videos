President Sao Pablo, and thank you and welcome. Okay, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much for this opportunity to present this work, which is in progress, joined with Daciver. Okay. And in particular, I present a relationship. A relationship okay between Borsugulan theory okay and sectional category. Okay, because here this conference is specific for topological complexity planning and sessional category, I will pay attention in the borderstuk Ulam theory. Okay, then I will use all the basic results of sessional category to prove or to Or to recover some results in Borsu Culan. Okay. Okay. Okay. The motivation okay consists in we have this okay X and tau okay and Y Okay, and why okay we have this where tau is an involution over this space, okay? We have this Cauchy map, okay, and this any half door space, okay, and the varsugulum property, okay. Okay, we will denote by this satisfy this Borsu Gulam property by definition if for any continuous map if F from X to Y, okay, there exists a point X here such that f tau X equals F X. Okay, this satisfy this property if Satisfy this property if happen this. Okay, this is a theory, okay. Borsugulan property, we generalize the classical of mult Borsugulan. Okay, there exists a lot a reference which study this property, okay, so generalization, okay, and the motivation of this work is to use sessional category, okay, to find a Find examples of this which satisfy the port property. Okay, this is a motivation. Okay, okay. In particularly, okay, we are interested to note this sessional category of this question map and the sessional category of this. Of this here, fy2 denotes the order configuration space of two points in y, and we have this question map. This is the an order configuration space. We have these question maps. In particular, we use These two sectional categories to find spaces which satisfy this voice property. Okay, this is the motivation. Okay. In particularly, in this theory, interesting problem is to study a notion which is called the index of a CW complex. Okay, I will present about this. Okay, about this in more detail. Well, I will recall some basic results of sessional category. Okay, this is standard in this meeting. The first is this, we have this vibration. We know that there exists a lower estimate, okay, in terms of the homology. Another property is this. If we have this triangle, P prime and P is a vibration. It is known that this sectional category satisfies these inequalities. And also, if we have this pullback, it is well known that the sessional category of the pullback is less or equal than the sessional category of P. Category of P. Okay, this is a standard inequalities which hold in this theory of sessional category. Okay, another is this. Okay, the sessional category has a natural upper bound in terms of the Lister Shiriman category, and this has an upper bound in terms of the dimension, okay, the amotopical dimension of this here in particular. This here, in particular, we suppose that B is a CW complex. Okay, for example, it's easy to show that, okay, the result, okay, using the comology, the setadois, homology, okay, it's easy to show that in this situation, the sessional category coincides with the category of the project space and this coincide with the nil potentially indices of the kernel in. Indices of the kernel inducing homology. Okay, this happens when n is at least two. In that case, when n is equal to one, you can show that this coincide with two. Okay? Concise with the category of LP1. Okay? Good. That example is important to apply it to obtain new examples with this proper. Obtain new examples with this property of the Borsuk-Ulam property. Okay. This notation I will present in the initial my thought. Okay. The order configuration space. Here we are interesting in to note that a two-order configuration space and a two-unorder configuration space and the natural Cauchy map between them. Okay. I will denote in note in particularly this quotient map okay by key app y okay for this quotient map okay and using okay and the ideas okay which appear in Borsum lamp property we can recover this a well-known statement which is proved in this paper of Roman Which is proved in this paper of Rod, okay, which he presents this equality that the sessional category in the case of a configuration space for the clearing space is this, happen this equality, okay, for any n. We prove this, okay, using another technique. The technique is this to show that these two squares are pulled back. Okay, are pullback okay, and in particularly, you have that sessional category of k is equal to the sessional category of k erg1. Okay. In a similar way, you can find the sessional category for the configuration of the sphere, okay, coincides with the sessional category of the Category of this question, okay, this standard Causion here. Okay, that's okay. This yes, okay. This in general, if you have a covering here, which the total space are path connected, and here is two coverings. Here is two covering maps here and two covering maps here. Okay, the total space per connected. Any diagram is a pullback. Now, I will pay attention in the porsugulan property. Again, that is the definition of the porsugulant property for this triple. This triple, okay. That generalizes the famous Borsubulan theory, okay, for the particular case of when X is the sphere and the involution is the antipodal, okay, and Y is the Euclidean space, okay. The classical theory of Vorsugulan established this, okay, that satisfies the Vorsugulan process. Satisfies the vortex-lamp property for any n between one and n. Okay. There exists natural generalizations of this property. Okay. For example, when X you maintains the sphere with antipodal involution and you replacing the Euclidean space with any hydro. The clearing space with any outdoor space. Okay, the interesting problem is to find out this triple satisfies the Borsukulan property. A second generalization is when you maintain here the cleaning space, but you replace this for any. You replace this for any CW complex with a free cellular involution over N. Okay? And here I will show it. Okay. Then that here appears the theory of index of for a CW complex. Okay. All results. Okay. The key results. The key results is this topological criterion for the volcanic land property. We can show that this triple does not satisfy the Borsu-Lam property if only if there exists a set of dose equivalent maps here, okay, such as this square, okay, commute, okay. Commute. Okay. This is a standard result. Okay. For example, to check this, okay. To check this, okay. By definition, okay, of the abort property means that there exists a Property means that there exists a match such that all for all points for all x here, this inequality that doesn't, okay? So you can choose a map from x to y, okay, such that it satisfies this, okay, f tau x. f tau x not equal to f x for all x here okay so you can define this equivalent okay from x to y two in a natural way f here and f of x X. Okay. Now, for the other implication, okay. I'm sorry. This F exists because we suppose that Borso Gulan property does not happen. Okay. Okay, it's easy to see to check that this is a setado sequibario, okay, which satisfies this commutative year. So now if we suppose that there exists this map, Cetados equivalent map, okay, we know that they have two coordinates, phi1 and phi2. one and phi two okay so you take f equal phi one that satisfies okay that f tau x is not equal to f x for any x okay recall that this is setados equivariance this is hypothesis okay for that reason if you take this that satisfies that That satisfies that not satisfies this equality for any x. Okay, good. Okay, this is the key result to use sessional category. Okay. Okay, this remap, okay, again. Okay, again, if you have these two covering maps, okay, and this total space are path connected, you can show that this any diagram here, any square here is a pullback. Okay, so our principal results, okay. Principal results using a direct application of sessional category is this. If this triple does not satisfy the vortexual property, and we have this inequality in terms of sessional category. That is equivalent to say that if the sessional category of k is more K is more than sessional category of Ky, then this triplet satisfies the abort property. Okay? The proof is natural, okay, because we know what happens when we apply sessional category for a pullback. Okay. For the topological characterization, okay, we have that x. Now why does not satisfy equivalent property? Okay, we know that this is equivalent to exist this okay to exist this pullback okay and Okay, and obviously, we suppose here the condition that this is path connected. Okay, this configuration space is connected. So we can apply, okay, this is a pullback, we can apply this sessional category, okay, and we obtain this result. This result. Okay? With this result, we can recover and prove some results in this area of portugula property. Okay. I will see some examples. Okay. For example, in this situation. Okay. Here, Okay, here we have this covering of the spheres over the projected of the real projective space, and we have this for any y. Here we suppose that this configuration is path connected, okay. And if we recall that sessional category of this is n plus one, okay. This is n plus one, okay. By our principal theorem, we have this. If n plus one is more than sessional category of this, then this triple satisfies the vortex-lamb property. Okay, that is easy to obtain of this principle theory. And we have also these propositions, okay. Propositions okay, and here we suppose that n is more equal is at least four because we have this inequality. Okay, sorry, okay. After the principal result that we showed, only we'll use sessional category to obtain new examples of Vorsugulan property. We can use all the standard inequalities which happen in sessional category. For example, to prove this proposition, I will use standard inequalities of the sessional category. Of the accessional category. Okay. The hypothesis for this proposition is that the dimension to here, we suppose that Y is a path-connected topological manifold with dimension at least two. It is not that configuration space for two points is path-connected. Okay. Moreover, if the dimension of y is less or is less or equal n half two okay and sorry n over two okay this triple satisfied our succulent property okay to prove this okay we all need to estimate the sessional category for the this okay quotient map for the configuration space okay we only follows the standard inequality Follows the standard inequality. Okay, this is at least, I'm sorry, this is less or equal the category of the contra domain. This is a more the configuration space. Okay, because this is this have the as a covering an open manifold, because this is the order configuration space, which is an open manifold. Open manifold, okay, the dimension, the amotopical dimension of this is two times dimension y minus one, okay, plus this one, okay. And we know that this, okay, is less or equal n plus one that implies, okay, this inequality, street inequality, okay. Equality, okay, and we do this proposition. Okay, in particularly, we have these examples. Okay, for example, when we have surfaces, a surface in this, we can prove that this satisfies the Portuguese property for any n more or equal. More or equal four. The case for n equal three, okay, we can improve, but using another technique. Really, we can use some techniques of vortexulantior when n equals three. Okay, but depends of the orientation of this surface. Okay, when this is orientable, it is possible to. It is possible to improve this, okay? N more or equal to three, okay? In general, okay, we have this property, okay. And for the non-orientable case, okay, we can use some techniques of varsival property, okay, to improve this. Okay, in general, we have for any surface, okay, we have this estimate, okay. The estimate. Okay. And so, in particular, we can recover the famous Borsugulan property using the result. Because we need to recall the accessional category of this projection is N. So, if we have this, we can obtain that the Vorsugulan property satisfies. Borsugulan property satisfies this triple. This triple satisfies the Borsoulam property. This is the classical Borsugulan theory. Also, we can obtain for this situation. Okay, it is now that the sectional category for this is infinity. Then, if we consider here any finite dimensional path-connected manifesto. Path-connected manifold with dimensional is two. Again, we can use the standard inequality occessional category. We obtain that these triples satisfy the Vorsugulan property. Okay? More examples when here we consider a configuration space, okay, with the antipodal action, okay, given by the symmetry. Given by the symmetry two-letter groups, okay, the standard involution here, okay. We can obtain some estimates when this triple satisfy this Borsugulam property, okay. Again, we can recover when here this is a surfaces, okay, and this is a configuration space, okay. And instead of the cleaning space, we can consider the sphere, okay. Okay, and in a similar way, we can obtain here for a surface. Okay, now I will present about the index of this theory. Okay. In this paper, okay, the author shows, okay, that for this case, okay. For this case, okay, when n is more than m, the dimension of this manifold, and the vortex-length property does not hold. Okay. So an interesting problem is to find the grid is n here. You fix a CW complex of dimension n, okay, with a free fixed point cellular involution. A involution. The problem is to find the grides n such that these triple satisfy the Porcelain property. Such number is called the index of this W complex, okay? With respect with this involution. Okay. A new result which using this sessional category is that we can give A lower bound for the index of any okay, CW complex. Okay, here we suppose that n is between this and this additional category minus one, then this triple satisfy the Vorsugulan property. Okay, that this result is follows easily from the principal theory. Okay, in particularly, we have that index of. We have that the index of this manifold of this CW complex is at least sectional category minus one. Okay. And this estimate in general is not improved because here this example show that sessional category for this, okay, we can find Find examples with this sessional category for some CW complex is n plus one. For example, the projection of the spheres over the projective space, that is an example when the sectional category is n plus one. Okay, in that situation, okay, and using this general estimate, okay, the index is n. Is n. Okay, the sessional category minus one. Okay, and I will show more another example which this estimate, okay, this estimate also is not possible to improve. Okay, another example. For that, I need to note the accessional category of a covering map coincide with the category. Covering map coincide with the category of the classifying map for that covering caution map. Okay. For that, I will consider this. Okay. This is a setado bundle for this caution. We write this for the classifying map. Okay. We take this generator. We can take this with this pullback. Okay. This is gamma. Okay. And this is standard. This is standard, okay, because this pullback is not trivial. Okay, with this, we can show this proposition. Okay, if this is the characteristic class of this principal bundle, if this gamma at n is not zero, then that this triple satisfy the Borsugulan property. Okay, I'm sorry, we can. I'm sorry, we can obtain this using the fact that sectional category of the covering of the quotient map coincide with the category of the classifying map. Okay, thus it's easy to obtain this proposition. Okay, the another implication, okay, was proved partially in this when only When only n is equal to n. Okay? In that paper, the author showed that this triple satisfies, note here, the dimension is the same, this satisfies the port singular property if and only if this happen. Okay. Okay. Using this remark, okay, we have this example. If the sessional category of this The sessional category of this covering map is n, we can prove that the index of this CW complex is n minus one. Okay. Okay. This is all many sense. Any questions here in the lecture room, or perhaps over Zoom? Yeah, um, okay, so I'll just model them by the form. So the first part, when you consider maps from sphere to Sphere to a complex. Yes, the previous theorem. If you map into a complex that embeds in R, I mean, you have an n-dimensional sphere. If you map it in a complex that embeds in R to the N, then essentially you have a map into R to the N and you have both equivalent, right? Yes. So, I mean, but So, I mean, but only any half-dimensional manifold embeds in RTDM. Okay. So, my question would be, do you get examples which are not of that kind? I mean, you have a manifold, five-dimensional, so I mean, that does not invest in RTDM. Okay, well now I don't know. Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know what happened in that situation. Okay. As a comment, okay, this technique to use sessional This technique to use sessional category to obtain new examples of orsegulant property. In some cases, we need to use maybe some limitation is that when we have the pullback, we have that inequality. We are interested to obtain that under certain. That under certain conditions, we obtain for a pullback a street inequality to improve sound results. In general, we have an equality. That's maybe is a sound restriction to obtain a new or improved sound estimate. Okay, yes, okay, but for For a special situation, that depends, okay, to know in particular the sessional category for these covering maps. Okay. Okay, any other questions? I have a question, if I can ask one. In the classical situation of the Borsa-Coulomb theorem, the Borsa-Coulomb theorem is equivalent. Equulemant theorem is equivalent to the Listernich-Schurlmann theorem, which says that if you take the n-sphere and cover it by n plus one closed sets, then one of the closed sets has to have antipodal points. Is there any such analog for more general Borsak Ulam properties? I don't see okay some work we generalize for another action for example okay um in particular the siver will speak when consider another more general action over these first okay but really i don't know if there exists some version Exists some versions related with Listerne Schirman theory. Yes, okay. Okay, thank you. Yes, sense. Well, if you don't have any other questions, I think we can thank the speaker. Thank you, Cesar.
