Okay, our next speaker is Shotanimoto, who's going to talk about sections of final vibrations over curves. All right, thank you for the invitation. I'd like to thank the organizer for the invitation. It's fast time for me to be in India. It's great. I love Indian food, so I enjoy it a lot. So, today I'm going to talk about sections of fund fibrillations over calves. And then, this is going to be joint work with Brian. Is going to be joint work with Brian Lemma and Derek Rieder. So, many talks in this conference about rational points on the number field, but here instead of looking at a rational point of a number field, we like to look at like a rational point of a function field of curves. So, that's what I'm gonna do. So so in this talk we mainly work overseas. Over C, and then I'm gonna fix smooth projective curve. B is a smooth projective curve over C, and then we look at the function field B, K B the function fields. Function field or B and then so we are I'm gonna look at our favorite variety smoothest one variety over function field KB so I mean this is smooth for the field variety such For the huge variety such that so minus kx is a minus kx is ample. Okay, and then so we are interested in rational points. So in this case, we are interested in set KB like this. So for number So, for number fields, even for like a Dirpetzo, existence of rational point is unclear in general, like where so it's controllable has the principle around your structure and so on and so on. But it's kind of open problem. But in the case of functional fields, first of all, like this is always going to be no empathy. This is the Graver-Harris-Stars theorem. So, we know this is no empathy. So, more what we like to do is like, so but the global Is like so about the global function field, then we like to count like a number of points over function fields and so on, so and then here I like to head it to that direction. But then, so, I mean, good thing about case of function field is that by variable criterions, these rational points correspond to sections. So, I'm gonna define the kind of model. Kind of model. So now one vibration is a morphism is a morphism pi from x to b such that such that Such that so first of all, one carry X is a smooth projective variety over C and then two pi is a flat so that. So that means dominant and with connected to fibers with connected to fibers okay and then three the most important are the genetic fiber Generic fiber uh eta is a funnel vari. So, I mean, this is a kind of integral model of a final variety, and then I mean, over C, we always can find such a model, you know, like so you can always find such if you have like a particular variety. If you have like a projective variety of a function field, then by taking closure, flat closure inside a projective space, you can get some internal model. But in general, this doesn't need to be smooth, but over C, you can apply smooth resolution while not affecting. Okay, I should say this is smooth. Smooth funnel. Yeah, so I mean, generic fiber is smooth, so you can deserve the singularity while not affecting. Deserves the singularity while not affecting genetic fiber so that you can always find such a model over C or in Kashik zero. But of course, I mean, I mean, over global function field, okay, we don't know the disregard of singularity, so we cannot guarantee that we can find such a model, but anyway, yeah. So we can always find such a model. So now all right, so now suppose we have model fun vibration pi pi x to v is a fun vibration Okay. Then, so originally, we are interested in set of rational points over the function field, which is like, so now we are looking at generic fiber and then looking at like a set of rational points on that generic fiber. But then by evaluative criterion, this corresponds to the, so considering rational points. Considering rational point is equivalent to considering sections of fun vibrations. So we are naturally leaded to this space, space of sections, the space of sections. So this is the open set of a Hilbert scheme of cardiac X. So it's a scheme. So it's a scheme, but it doesn't need to be netarian. I mean, it's locally netarian, but it's coming with counter-many components. And then, so, yeah, it's coming with a counter-many component, and then, but it's only counterly many. And then, so here's a remark. So, one remark I like to make is: so, when one of five ratio is trivial, which means that Which means that when pi x to b is trivial, so that means that carry X is just product of a funnel variety of a C and a carb B. And then map pi is given by projection. This is accepting of Tolibier family. Of Tolibier family. In this case, by universal property, space of sections correspond to morphism scheme of B to X. So we have our main theorem is about these space of sections, but our main theorem have implications to orthomorphism scheme when it's a trivial family. When it's a two-year family. So this is a form system scheme is like a parameterizing parameterizing map from B to X. Okay, so those are like a setup, and we are mainly interested in the space of sections. But I'd like to take questions if you have some right now. Okay. All right. So, before going to details of our results and so on, I'd like to. I'd like to recall some deformation theory of space of sections. So, yeah. So, deformation theory. Deformation theory of sections. Okay. Now, so I'm going to take a component, irregular component. So whenever I say component, I mean like a irregular component. Component of X over V. Okay, so this is like a Okay, so this is like a scheme of finite type of a C and so on. Then, I mean, one can think of a dimension, and then your general defensive theory tells you that this is always greater than or equal to the following value. So, I'm gonna write down the kind of number. So, x over b dot c plus Plus dimension x minus 1 1 minus g b okay where so I should explain what are those where minus k 5 x over b this is a reactive anti kind of graph. And the C is a carb section parameterized by M and then GB is a genus or B okay, so this is always lower bound for dimension, and then this is so. And then this is so-called like expected dimension. So this number is called like a expected dimension. Okay? And then so sometimes dimension component coincides with expect dimensions, but in general doesn't need to be. So this is already lower boundary in general. And then so we also have upper bound which is given by H0 H0 of C TX over V. So this is the deductive tangent boundary restricted C. Okay, and then by the man log, this is equal to expected dimension dot C plus expect dimension plus H Expect dimension plus H1 of C. This is the active tangent vandal over C. Okay? So this is always like a rho-bound. And also it's true that Darshki tangent space at C is given by this homology, H0. And then so H1 plays a lot of structure group. So in particular, in In particular when H1 is vanishing is equal to zero, then we have equality. We have dimension is equal to expected. Expected. And also, you know, it's coincided with also the dimension of the hitangent space. So you can say that that point is smooth and so on and so on. So when obstruction group vanishes, it's kind of very nice and it's easy to understand. So then how we are gonna guarantee We are going to guarantee such a condition, H1 is vanishing. And one way to see this by saying that section is free. So I'm going to, I think some of you have heard of free rational curves, like a free rational curve, very free rational curves, and so on and so on. I like to define notion, such a notion, even for these sections of higher genus curves. And then so. And then, so I'm gonna define pretty nest. So, definition now, suppose we have one vibration. Okay, good job. One vibration and then section C over pi is so okay three if T X over B this is a C is grow by To see is global generated, globally very generated. So, this is like a local free C vector boundary. And H1 C T X over B, this is C is zero. Okay, so these are two conditions. That's the definition of freedness in. That's the definition of Linus in the setting of higher genus cap. And then, so in the case of rational caps, once you have globally genetic, then this condition is automatic. H1 is vanishing. It's automatic. But in the case of hyogeneous cap, even this is globally genetic, it doesn't mean that H1 is vanishing. So this is more involved. So instead of the, so we kind of impose those two. So, we kind of impose those two conditions. All right. And then, component. So, first of all, if you have a component which contains free section, suddenly you can conclude a general section, parametric that component is free. Because so, freeness is open condition for sections. And then, so once you have component which parameters the free. Component which parameters the three sections, then by the formation theory, you can say that dimension of that component is given by expect dimension, and then point correspond to free section is smooth point of modular space. And then these properties are very nice. You know, you can kind of try to understand dimensions and so on by parameterizing free sections. But then, the problem is like a component. Problem is like a component parameter only non-free section. All the sections are non-free. This is possible. And in that case, it's harder to understand. We don't know what dimension is. Scheme could be non-reduced everywhere, and so on and so on. So this is very subtle. So my question is question I'd like to address in this talk is the following. Is a foreign solution Question How to control A non-free component component with only parameter non-free section. And then what for money in the conjecture, how to bound them? This is a question I like to address. Okay? Okay? And then, so we can use Manage conjecture to address this type of questions. So now, so this invariant already appear in the talk, I think, like a dance talk and so on. But anyway, I'm going to decode it again. So that's the Fuji invariant. Fujita invariants. So this is Takao Hujita. Actually, I did my undergrad in Japan and Takao Hujita was actually my advisor at that time. So I'm happy that I can name his name. Yeah, anyway. All right. All right. And then, so Fujita studied this invariant under the name of Kodai energy. And then, so his motivation was to use that invariant to study the classification of polarized algebraic varieties. But this is also very important for Manning's conjecture. So I'm going to define it. So F is a field of characteristics zero. And then suppose we have X is a smooth projective variety over F and then R is a big and nef Q Currently a divisor on X. So let me briefly recall what we mean by big and f. The big means sometimes called like almost ample. So big means that it energy is nearly equivalent to the sum of ample divisor and the effective divisor. So it's almost like ample. So and an F means that any intersection against the curve is non-negative. So, I mean, if you So, I mean, if you anticipate, you can just replace this by ample, okay? That's no harm. But anyway, so I'm going to define this invariant for Bconnect device. And then, so invariance or invariance right now X is the most ah, later I'll actually find this for singular. Yeah, okay, yeah. Yeah. A xr is equal to minimum of tr and then tr plus kx is pseudo-factor. Okay, so pseudo-factor means that it's expressed as an means that it's expressed as a limit of effective divisors. And then when L is not big, we formally set XL to be infinity. So this reflects the fact that when it's not big, then no score property kind of fails. So we kind of impose this condition. So this is So, this is the definition of an invariant. But now, so far, I define this invariant for smooth vertical variety. But actually, I like to define this even when x is singular. So, that's the next thing I want to do. Uh, so when X is singular, then we take a resolution smooth then I define a Then I define invariant to be that using pullback to smooth resolution. And then, so one can prove that this is well defined. It doesn't depend on the choice of resolution because this is the bias invariant. Well defined. Okay, so uh yeah so that's it and then so let And then, so let so is it? Yeah, so in the case of a B Kunf, yeah, that's a good question. So, this is the case of B Kune F, then this is going to be rational number, but this is hiding on trivia. This is followed from a BCHN, Abiduka Kashini, Eko Makana. I mean, that's like an MMP paper. You need that to show that this is the actual rational number. Okay. And then, so in particular, this division still makes sense when. Division still makes sense when we drop the condition of nef, only big. But in that case, this could be rational. So, so this number doesn't need to be rational in general. All right, so let me give you an example. So, x is a funnel and L is an unchannel class, then X L is equal to one. Is equal to one. Okay? Because it just, because by definition, tl plus kx is zero when t is one. So this is one, one. Right. Okay. So then we kind of go into the world of money conjecture from now on, but maybe I'll take questions now. Right. So now I'm going to state geometric. I'm going to state geometric Manning's conjecture. So, as you know, Manning's conjecture predicts a symptomula for the counting function rational points on final varieties. And then this is originally over number field, but you can formulate the same thing of a global function field. And then now, Butterf in 1988, Baterev gave a lecture series in Berlin. Gave a lecture series in Berlin. And then, in the lecture series, he gave the heuristic of a marine connection of a global function field, assuming some properties of moduli space of sections. And then, and this up, I mean, originally, his assumptions are not correct, but kind of we kind of upgrade his assumptions and they formulate conjecture predicting properties of modularized physical. Are predicting properties of modularized physical section as a geometric Manning's conjecture. So, I'm gonna introduce this geometric Manning's conjecture. So, maybe so, this is due to, of course, the butterf and then defined by us, Lehman and myself. Okay, so uh, so you remember? Uh so demanding the connection consists of three components, three predictions about the modularized space of sections. And then so first thing is external set so which predicts that No free components of sections are controlled by register invariant. Okay, so I'm gonna in our main theorem, so this is the imprecise form, and our main theorem proves this prediction for fully generality over C. So I'm gonna come back to this statement later. But basically, you can understand no fully component using Fuchsia invariant. That's the first statement, and then so. Second statement is uniqueness. So there exists unique pre-component Pre-component of RFI is algebraic class subsection, which should be counted in minute conjecture. For PC entry positive sections RGB class section So, as we cross alpha of section and we call this unique component add As the mining component density ah so stability Exhibit mining component, exhibit homological or motivated stability. And then, so first statement we sort of influenced over C. And the second statement, so basically, this is saying that this space is you can interpret this part of conjecture as a kind of. Part of conjecture at the kind of irreducibility claim about irreducibility of this section. So, we don't know in full generality, but we have tons of examples. We know this conjecture is true. A second prediction, like, so you know, toric varieties, flag varieties, and then funnel hyper surface, general funnel hyper surface or a low-degree hyper surface using circle method. And also, like a funnel three-folds and deputy vibrations. Final three for the episode of fibrillations, and so on and so on. So, this two is not known in general, but there are tons of examples supporting this conjecture. And then, three, we have a kind of sporadic examples like so fantastic work by him and Sawin on fun hyper services and then maybe build the result on vector group motivator build result on and Shabatra and Rosaire and Biru and so on so on study like motivate stability for some Study the most micro stability for some vector equivalent modification vector groups. All right. So this is the geometric management conjecture. Otherwise, algebraic class of sections. So like so new I mean          We have like a evaluation map to X. So this is the evaluation map. Then I draw my pet. Reversion map is not dominant. So, first case is the reversion map is not dominant. Then the subvariety why uh sweep to out Out by sections parameterized by M satisfies A Y eta. It's greater than A x eta minus k x eta r for b okay. So, I mean, so I've been studying like experimental set to magnitude conjecture using like a higher dimensional geometry. And so, basically, we have a technology to understand like a sub variety with this. To understand like a sub-variety with this property, you can bound them and then you can kind of classify them and so on. So it's nice that no free sections are coming non-dominant of a non-dominant family are coming from sub-variety of this type because we can compute those y. And you can analyze sections on y. Okay? So when this is a statement where evaluation map is not dominant, and then And then two is a variation map is dominant in this case. In this case, let f y to x be the sign factorization, finite part, the finite part of the stein factorization of evaluation map. Then we have We have A y eta minus f star k x over p y eta is equal to a x eta minus k x over p. So, this is by the way this is just one, okay? I mean, this is the unchannel cross. But, okay, so first of all, I guess if you take a strain factorization and a finite path, y has the same invariant. But this is not so interesting because it Not so interesting because it is possible that a bulky map has a connection to fiber. In many cases, a barium map has a connected fiber. In this case, it is just identity. So, this is not so interesting, actually. But the next statement is more important. Pudamora, there exists rational map dominant rational map phi maybe I should say B rational map B rational map phi from Y to Z so actually rational map so such Such that C is a general section on Y parameterized by M and then W is a distribution distribution. The deduction of pi inverse phi c. So basically, on the level of generic fiber, I'm just taking like a fiber of this section, rational point corresponding to this section. So I'm looking at the fiber. Then A. So invariant Is equal to invariant minus kx over b okay and equal to one and then b uh eta dimension over a minus f star k x over b. Kx over B plus K Y over B, this is the Y eta is zero. So sometimes this is called an adjoint to digit condition that adjoint to digit. And then in Dan's talk, this corresponds to like a fairness of a BG and then. And then, ah, right, and then maybe right. See the three transform Of C in W is free in W and the D so I'm gonna stay I kind of she moves she moves a lot in W okay so this is a So, this is a. I'm not going to say it's precise statement. This involves T I introduced, but I did say. But anyway, so, but so the point is this. So, these like a W with same invariant and then eternal dimension zero, these are nice because it's close to final variety. And using like a result of Beduka, BAB conjecture, you can actually bound those like a W. You can say that. W. You can say that these w is actually primarily defined in many families. And then all the non-free components, this is saying that all the dominant non-free components are essentially coming from this bounded family of W, such that in W, those sections are free. Okay? So, maybe, so, yeah. Okay, I don't have much time. So, let me. Much time. So let me give you two applications. So, could we use like a foriation theories in the slope stability? Like, uh, so we use like a hard analysis point filter, you know, and then so on and so on to kind of prove this kind of sediment. And the point of constructing this rational map is coming from the result of Kampana-Pang. Like, Kampanapang showed that if you have a correlation with a positive minimal slope, then that is induced by rational. Then that is induced by rational map. So, this is essentially this construction rational map is coming from the company-upon theory of variations. And then, so let me give an example of this theorem. So, suppose we have a hygiene scale and suppose we have a cubic hyper surface of dimension greater than equal to five, then you can show that there's no, like a, there's no. there's no y from y to x such that a y uh x star h is greater than equal to a x h you can prove this okay there's no such a thing doesn't exist for cubic hyper surface cubic hyper surface and then so in particular uh uh You can show that in this case, by this main setting, you can show that section of sufficient large degree, general section of sufficient large degree, actually free, order-free. Once the degree is high enough, you can conclude that it's free for using, like analyzing these like sort of accumulating maps. So, this is like one application, and another application I'm gonna say in the And another application I'm going to say in the world. So we prove kind of approximation of weak management connection in full regionality in the following sense. So suppose we have found vibration of a number field. And then take the reduction mode P, and then you like to count sections over curves of finite field. And then, okay, okay, usually when you Okay, okay, usually when you analyze weak money connection, that is proved by letting degree goes to infinity. But we can prove weak mining connection by first letting P goes to infinity. The cascade P goes to infinity, then D goes to infinity. Then we can put a sort of weak mining condition in for the generality. All right, maybe I'll stop here. Thank you. Right. No, I cannot prove it. You know, I mean, my our proof of a sincere sinness of a transaction user resolutions, MMP, BAB, none of them are available. So it's very hard. I mean, even like a I mean, even like also like a one thing in Cask P, which is very complicated, is like if you have, in Cask zero, if you have like a dominant generic finite kappa, then you can always conclude by this thing, invariant is always decreases, only never jumps up for dominant genetical finite map. But in KCP, it is possible this is inseparable. In that case, this can go. In that case, this can go up. So you can have a cover such that imbalance high up stair. This is possible. And then we could have such a counter example in the even dimension too. So, I mean, I don't know how to control kind of this kind of inseparable Kappa and prove boundedness and so on. And calculate zero, this is already true because of ramification formula. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, so basically like so by lamification formula, you can write like Ky is equal to Kx plus R, R is effective, and then that proves like this inequality in cash 0. So this is already true in Casq 0, but in Cascade P, this can go like this for Dobin and Geneva finite map. And then when this is inseparable, and I don't know how to control such a thing. So even assuming this relation, assuming. So even take assuming this relation assuming maybe assuming BAP, I don't know how to prove it. Yeah. Right, right, right. And then you can also say something prove something similar for Clotic. So Cortic. So actually, we try a lot trying to prove like a take like a general function hypersurface X such that I guess like a degree is less than or n over two. We expect there's no accumulating map, but we cannot prove. This is very hard. So we can only prove this kind of statement for cubic and then quote. We can prove for quote. But for so this is the kind of our conjecture that when degrees Conjecture that when degree is like less than like a dimension of half, then there's no accumulating map. Once you prove that, then you can prove a sort of fullness using our theorem. But yeah, it's hard. All right.
