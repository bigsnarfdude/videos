Okay, welcome back. Our next speaker is Palomi Nandi. She's going to talk about complexity and VMS. Palomi, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me? Hello? Yes, please. Okay, okay. Okay. Good morning, everyone. Okay, good morning everyone. And today I'm going to talk about complexity and DNS. I would like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to present my work in this wonderful workshop. And this work is based on this paper that came out recently with Alpan Bhattacharya, who is also sitting in the audience from IIT Bangan. So let's start. So the entropy of the black hole. So, the entropy of the black hole is proportional to its area of its agent horizon and it's not its volume. So, with this simple yet elegant idea, we saw the birth of this notion of this holographic principle, which basically says that if you have a theory of quantum gravity in the bulk, then you can study it by looking into the field by looking into a field theory without gravity, which lives on its boundary one-dimensional. And so far, its most prominent example has been. Most prominent example has been this ADS CFT correspondence, which is basically has been cited for more than 22,000 times and it has been victorious across diverse areas of physics, for example, like quantities matter physics, quantum information, hydrodynamics, etc. But in spite of all this huge success, our world is clearly not ADS. And for most, many astro. For most astrophysical purposes, the universe is well approximated by flat space time. So, today I am going to shed some light on this question of the status of holography for asymptotically flat space-time unlike this flat space holography. So, this is going to be the outline for my talk. So, first, I'll start with the idea of quantum computational complexity. It's general. Complexity, it's a general notion. Then I will be revisiting complexity in the most famous example, the ADS CFT correspondence, specifically for 2D CFT. After that, I'll be explaining the role of this DMS, this DMST group in the context of flat space holography. And then I will come to our work, which is this complexity in flat holography, by specifically by two approaches. One is the limiting approach, where I'll start from Approach where I'll start from the CFT results discussed here and I'll reach to DMS and then I'll be talking about the intrinsic analysis where I'll be entirely focusing on DMS without depending anything on the limiting approach. So please stop me whenever you have any question. So first I'll be discussing this complexity in the ADA CFT holography. So the notion of quantum computational complexity is borrowed from quantum information. Borrowed from quantum information, which basically describes the minimum number of operations or gates to reach from one reference state psi R to a target state psi t. And for discrete system, it basically gives an XTM circuit consisting of quantum gates connecting psi R and Psi T. And for continuous field theories, it keeps a geodesic distance in the manifold of unitary group operators. Now, complexity has been used over. Has been used over across diverse areas in physics as well. For example, it also characterizes quantum chaos and it grows linearly with time in chaotic systems and it corresponds to perturbations distinctly. So a nice review was recent, I mean, just presented by Dimaski in the previous talk. And also see the later talks today. And the complexity has also a familiar behavior with the volume behind raven current. With the volume behind the event horizon of a blackboard. So, the idea of complexity in the context of holography has been conjectured primarily in the context of ADS CFT. So, it has been a new addition to the holographic dictionary through ADS CFT, which connects basically several aspects of black hole physics. For example, the interior and information processing inside the black hole. So far, there has been two or three major directions. Major directions that complexity has shown us in this context of holography. So, these two, three proposals are known as the first one is called the complexity difficulty volume proposal. And then we have the complexity difficulty action proposal. And today we will be mainly focusing on this third proposal, which is the complexity difficulty geometric action proposal, which was given by Pakuta Maghan and then Edwin Garetal recently. You so, there, apart from this notion of complexity in holographic complexity, there has been different notions of other types of complexity also, and it has been successful across many directions, like in condensed matter physics and quantum field theories. But very little progress has been done in extending the computation of holographic complexity for non-Lorentz ingredient field theories. So, today we are going to be interested in this last sentence that I. It on this last sentence that I said, we are going to look into the formulation of complexity for a non-Lorentz ingredient field theory, for example, a BMS ingredient field theory. So before going to the complexity for a BMS ingredient field theory, I will start with the results that we already have in our hand, which is the complexity for 2D CFT. It's going to be a review. And for that, I'll start with the famous Virasoro algebra, which basically the symmetry. Basically, the symmetry generators for 2D CFPs give two copies of the Virasura algebra, and this curly L's and this curly L bar ends is span this algebra, where this C and C bar, these are the two central charges. Now, the group elements for Vyasovo are given by this F of sigma, which basically are the dicheomorphism on the cycle S1. And this highly small F, this belongs to R, which basically This belongs to R, which basically comes from the due to the contribution from this central extension C. So, for this, the authors considered only one copy of the Virasora algebra, only the holomorphic part. But let's go forward and then I'll also introduce the anti-holomorphic part later. So, this, if you consider this sigma to be the light-bound coordinate belonging to S1, then sigma goes to F sigma basically gives this conformal transformation into D. This conformal transformation in 3D. Now, the geometric notion of Nielsen's complexity defines an extremized path or a geodesic in the manifold of the group transformation from a chosen reference state, which is the Shi L, to a target state Shi D. And these infinitesimal symmetry transformations act as gates in the computation of this complexity, circuit complexity for this 2D CFT, where this targets. CFT, where this target state and this reference state are related in this way, and the group elements are related by instantaneous group velocity, which is this object epsilon t sigma. So, this f t plus d t sigma is equal to e to the power epsilon dot f t sigma, where this dot represents the group multiplication operator. And the authors, the authors Kaputa Magadha and Edmund Gar. They showed that this circuit complexity functional resembles the geometric action for Virasoro coadjoint orbit. And this is also true for the Kashmir debate. So this was one of their central claims in these papers. And next I'll be showing a little bit of this claim in detail, the calculational details. So please stop me if you have any question. If you have any question, so the target state and this reference state are related by this unitary representation of the group elements uf, and this capital T is the time to reach from psi r to psi t. So next we decompose these unitary representations in terms of infinitesimal transformation, where this initial state is the reference state. So here at u a fact equal to 0, it's 1. Now for 2D CFT. Now for 2D CFT, the concept energy momentum tensor T sigma is used to write the gates which are given by this Q and its given as 1 by 2 pi T sigma epsilon T sigma. So this epsilon is the describes that it is the time dependent group velocity. It describes the infinite symmetry transformations applying at a given time. And while you are writing this gate, this is already path ordered, means the earlier Already path-ordered, means the earlier operations are applied at first. Now, the authors chose this one-numbered cost function for this calculation, which is given as trace of rho t qt, where this rho t is the density matrix obtained from an initial density matrix. And the cost function looks like this in terms of the gain gates and the reference gates. So, the complexity functional, which we see F. Which we see F, it basically gives the total cost of a constructed path from psi R to psi t in the group manifold in terms of this group element F t. So this is the form of this complexity functional, where this is the group velocity epsilon. These are the reference states and this u dagon t ut this is the transformed current. So it's written in terms of the inverse diffeomorphism. Diplomorphism. So, for example, yeah, for example, like for every F, the small F, the Dickeyomorphism F, there exists an inverse element which basically is a pullback, which brings back the small F to sigma. And this transformation of this energy momentum tensor looks like the usual CFT result where this F sigma is the Schwartzian. Schwartzian and then the group velocity epsilon t sigma is calculated in terms of this inverse hydromorphism which takes this form minus f dot by f time. Interestingly, this group velocity also resembles the model pattern form for Virasoda. Now the choice, there is a choice for this reference state, Shaya. So the authors chose this to be CFT primaries given by H and H bar where this H and H bar are the ideas. This H and H bar are the eigenvalues of L0 and L0 bar for CFTs. And due to the, so for example, for Virasoro, we have a central extension. So for that, the contribution due to the central extension also need to be considered. And for that, Admengar et al., they considered this cost function, modified this factor, this C beta t, where this C is the central extension, and this beta t is actually the central extension. t is actually the central extension of this theta. It is the central extension for the model curtain form for Virasor. So putting everything here, this transformed parent and then evaluating this, putting the, I did not mention the form of beta here, but putting everything here, we can write the complexity functional for Virasolo and it looks like this. So interestingly, this is this complexity functional also looks like geometric action. Looks like geometric action for Villasovo. Now it's time to minimize the Cf in terms of the group path, the normal diffeomorphism F T sigma and solve the equations of motion. The solution gives the optimal circuit, which when put back to this complexity functional gives the complexity value. So I have mentioned only here the simplest solution that Saputamagani wrote in their paper, which is f dot by f time given Which is f dot by f prime equal to constant. And if we use this simplest solution, then this complexity functional grows linearly with time. And this H is the eigenvalue for the L0 generator, and this C is the central extension. So please stop me if you have any questions so far. So this was up to here, I just revisited the saltic complexity guide. Revisited the sarcom complexity calculation for Vira Solo. Now, I'll be talking about this DMS and its relation with the flat space orography. So, this image is a very important thing. I have a quick question. Yeah, yeah. So, is there a verification of this? Is there an analogous computation in ADS3 holography? ADS3 holography, you're talking ADS3 CFT2. ADS3 CFT2. Yeah, this is called. Yeah, this is called CFT2. No, yeah, this complexity calculation is for CFT2. Right, is there a holographic check or is there a check against a holographic proposal or anything one can compute? So the authors looked into various aspects like very phases and etc. But the central one of the central claims was that this complexity functional is resembling the geometric action. That you may take action for Vida Sur and also for Kachmodi. So, yeah. So, next I'll be talking about, I'll be just giving some details of this BMS and its relation with flat space odography. So, the symmetries at the boundary of the space-time are given by the asymptotic symmetry groups. And Brown and Hannah India's seminar analysis showed that the asymptotic symmetry. Showed that the asymptotic symmetry of ABSG is enhanced to two copies of the infinite-dimensional Bida-Solar algebra. Now, for asymptotically flat spacetime at the null boundaries chri plus minus, this asymptotic symmetry group is given not by the usual a conqueror group, by this infinite dimensional bonding etchna subs group. And for Minkowski system in bulk dimension d equal to 3, the dual field theory will feel deep on its null boundary. Field live on its null boundary at t equal to 2, and the asymptotic symmetry group is which is DMS3 is also declared to be the symmetry of the dual field theory. So, so far there has been all the advantage, most of the advancement in the direction of flat space holography has been concerning the asymptotic symmetry group, which is declared to be also the symmetry of the dual field theory. Now, apart from this also, BMS group is also important for software with analysis. Important for software with our asymptotic symmetry correspondence, symmetries on the black hole horizon, etc. Hi, no, it was just if I can comment on the previous question, that maybe you didn't notice that the action, the geometric action that she was explaining is equivalent to the polymer action of two-dimensional gravity, which is what if the action of the duality. Of if the dual to the gravity action in three dimensions. So that's really the verification, let's say, the connection to gravity. I just wanted to comment on that. Actually, I could not hear you. Can you be a little bit louder? It's no, no, do you hear me now? Like this? Yeah, yeah, no, it's better. We just wanted to comment a little bit on the. comment a little bit on the on the question before that they were asking that what is the connection to AGSP and to gravity and I was just saying that maybe it was not noticed from your comment that this action, the geometric action, is actually the clarificational action in ADS3, because it's it can be written as a as the product of function of two-dimensional value. It would just a comment for clarification function. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, thank you, thank you so much, okay. So, BMS group is infinite dimensional in bulk dimension equal to 3 and 4. For example, if you consider this 3D bulk flat space-time, the BMS3 algebra is given by this ln and ms and this C L and seeing, these are the central extension corresponding to the L L bracket and the Corresponding to the ALL bracket and the ALIM bracket. And as we are, we are mentioning the BMS tree algebra. So the structure for the null boundary at stripe plus, this is going to be R cross S1. And this MNs, they generate the super translation, which is basically the angle-dependent translations on the null direction, strike plus. And these LNs generate super rotation, which is basically the diffeomorphism on S1, the circle at null boundary. One, the circle at null boundary. And Barney and Compari through their intrinsic analysis, they showed that for Einstein gravity, the Cl equals to zero and Cm comes to be three by G, which is the Newton constant. And we are calling this DMS3 invariant field theory, which lives on the 2D boundary on scry plus minus as DMSFP. So there is a way to reach the flat space holography starting from Flat space holography starting from ADS CFT. For that, we are again writing the, I mean, two copies of the Virasoro algebra, which is the asymptotic symmetry algebra for ADS3. And this LNs and LN, Carly Lns and Carly L bar dens, these are the Virasoro generators. And the central terms C and C bar, they are given by 3L by 2G, where L is the ABS radius and G is the Newton's constant. Next, we take this limit such that we can. Limit such that we contract these Viraso generators in this way that this epsilon is the inverse of the ADS radius, which when taken to zero gives basically this L the algebra spanned by L capital L and capital L, which is basically the BMS3 algebra. And if you also look into the central terms of B, central terms for BMS3, then this Cl goes to C minus C bar from here, which comes to B 0, and C M goes to 0 and Cm goes to epsilon C plus C 1 which is 3 by G which also confirms the analysis by Barnick and company. Now this epsilon tends to 0 which is the inverse ADS radius tends to 0 limit corresponds to the flat space limit on bulk ADS space time and the bulk flat space limit in the sorry the flat space limit in the bulk corresponds to taking the ultra-relativistic limit also known as the Carilion limit on the boundary field theory. So, this here I will just mention in a little bit that this Carolian field theories, this Carolian limit means this in terms of the space-time contraction, you are contracting only the time direction and you are leaving this XI direction as it is. And then basically, this is the C tends to zero limit where the light phone closes up, basically. So, if you consider this. Basically. So, if you consider this diagram, you will see that in the Caribbean limit, the light cone closes down. And there exists another type of limit, which is called the Gravity limit, where the light cone closes up. Sorry, opens up, which is basically the C tends to infinity limit. So, this is a diagrammatical explanation only. And now I'll be talking about the saddle complexity for BMS3. So, first, I'll be talking about the limiting analysis. The limiting analysis where we start from the results for CFT2 and reach BMS3. So, the BMS3 is the semi-direct product of group of this sticheomorphism at S1, which is the super rotation, and this super translation, a vector of S1. So, the elements are given by F and C1, which were also present in the Virasolo. F is the diffeomorphism, and this alpha is the super dotation, which also have a central extension C2, and they have this. Tension C2 and they have this periodicity condition that f of sigma plus 2 phi, z sigma plus 2 phi, and this alpha sigma plus 2 phi is alpha sigma. Now here we will, when doing the limiting analysis, starting from the complexity functional for 2D CFT, we are considering the both the holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic components. So earlier, I only showed this T. Now we have this T plus T bar, and here we are using the limit. Here we are using the limit, one of the limit that I showed you here, like this limit, where the Galilean limit, where basically the light phone opens up. Because in 2D, I mean, when you are in 2D, it doesn't matter which of the direction you are contracting. In the Galilean limit, you are basically contracting the spatial direction and in the cavilian limit, you are contracting the time direction. But for our purpose here, we have to take the Galilean limit only because in that only the In that only the CFT primary, which were chosen to be the reference state for the CFT calculation, in the NI limit that goes to the BMS primaries, which is given by this condition that L0 acting on this BMS primary delta psi gives this delta and this M0 gives this psi. And for all other values of n greater than 0, this is 0. So when you take this limit here and you get that only And you get that only this T1, which is one part of the BMS stress tensor. So, T1, T2 are both BMS3 stress tensors, but only T1 will contribute, which in terms of the modes on the cylinder can be represented this way. So, if you see here, the condition for the primary is that only L0, I mean for only N equal to 0, they will give this non-zero value for this delta xi. So, if you put that in here. you put that in here all the limit and everything you will see only this l0 modes contribute while taking this phase over here and this epsilon is the this epsilon is the group velocity which takes the similar form as the virus polo case and then this dms3 generators these lns and mms can also be represented in terms of the concept pattern which is this j sigma and p sigma but for the limiting case the p sigma Or the limiting case, the P sigma, which is corresponding to the super translation, it does not contribute. So, only L0 contribute, and the transformation of this J sigma, it's necessary. So, here, if you look into this term, this C2 by 24 pi del Fq alpha F, this is actually, this term is actually the, I mean, the BMS was here, this one here. So, now if you include everything in this complexity functional here. In this complexity functional here. So basically, you are using only this expression for this J tilde F, and also you add the contribution due to the model curtain extension for BMS3, which is this C2 here. Then you find the total complexity functional given here in this bracket. And it is from the limiting analysis, it is shown that this complexity functional for DMST is equal to the, it resembles the geometric coadjunction. The geometric co-adjoint orbit action for BMSG. But here is a catch: that there was no contribution from the super translation because while taking this trace only by the condition of the BMS primary, only this L0 were contributing. So there was no contribution from this M0, which is a bit weird because while calculating the complexity functional, you have to take basically all the symmetry generators and not only one part of it. So that's why we. Of it. So that's why we refined this analysis intrinsically where we took the contribution from both the super translation and the super rotation. So we modified our complexity function, basically our cost function in this way here. And we used two kinds of this. Earlier, we were using only one. I mean, in the limiting analysis, there was only one of this epsilon, the blue velocity. But now we are taking two different blue velocities, one for. Two different group velocities, one for the super translation and one for the super rotation. And now we are using this both of this transformation for this BMS concept current J and P. And this epsilon L, this basically takes the form of the group velocity for the BMS, sorry, the Virasoro. But this epsilon M that looks slightly different. So for that, we use the finite BMS tree transformation rule where this sigma and rule that the sigma and t change a thing this way and we took that if you are suppose you are taking two consecutive finite transformations from sigma t to sigma 2 t2 and then one one transformation directly from sigma t to this final state to I mean f1 dot f2 if you are taking to be f3 then you can find that using this this expression here for the group velocity Here for the group velocity, both in terms of epsilon L and epsilon N, you can find both of them. So the epsilon L looks like this, which is the usual Gira Soro kind of thing, but this epsilon L is significantly different. And then if you add the contribution due to the monocuron extension from BMS3, like we did in the case for Virasoro, also, we can find that the complexity functional for BMS3 basically looks like this. Basically, it looks like this: this expression here. So, the first term here looks like the geometric action, but the second term does not. And we found that basically for some, I mean, the semi-direct product groups, generally this proposal that the complexity functional becomes the geometric action is not true. It was shown by us in this for the BMS3 case, and then earlier it was also shown for this one. Shown for this conformal symmetry group by Bhattacharya et al. And after XMISISIZING this complexity functional with the periodicity condition for this F and alpha, we found that the simplest optimal path is given by this, where F sigma t is given by sigma plus A1T and alpha is A3T. So this A1 and A3, these are some constant which remains undetermined. Which remains undetermined, and for sorry, and for the complexity, when integrated out, it gives a form like this one, where this J0, this is delta minus C1 by 24 pi, where this delta is the L0 weight basically of the BMS primary, and this psi is basically the M0 wave. So yeah. Yeah, so these are basically the dilatation and the boost weight of this DMS panel, and the complexity looks like this. So, yeah. To summarize, we have shown that for direct product groups, for example, Virasoro and Kachmodi, this complexity functional equal to geometric action, this one holds, and it was given by Kaputa Mangan and Edmender, all these authors. All these authors. And starting from Virasoro algebra, it is possible to reach the BMSG algebra, which is also the asymptotic symmetry algebra for 3D asymptotically flat space-times using the Carelian limit, which is the limit where the light forms closes up. And from the limiting perspective, the complexity functional resembles a geometric action for the BMSG group when we use the limit. When we use the limit, the scalion limit on the result for the Virasoro group. However, the limit fails to capture contributions from super translation while deriving the BMS complexity from its relativistic Virasoro counterpart. So for that, we defined our analysis, which is the, which we call the intrinsic analysis, where we use the symmetry, all the symmetry transformations, DMS symmetry transformation as the gates. And we found that the proposal in general, complexity. Proposal in general complexity functional equal to geometric action is not true specifically for semi-directed approaches like DMS3. And it was also shown for work confirmer symmetry group by Bhattacharya. So, so far concerning the complexity functional mentioned here, we have found that. Sorry, you have a minute. Yeah. You have like one or two minutes. I have yeah, can you hear me? You have like two minutes? Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. I'll just finish right now. Yeah, so I mean, just two comments regarding this complexity functional that I showed here. So this does not look like the geometric action, that's true. But we have found that, I mean, if we set the group velocity epsilon in, which was the group velocity corresponding. Which was the group velocity corresponding to the super translation to be zero. Then we get some kind of deformed geometric action, which was by addition of some Hamiltonian for DMST, which was given by Martis and Reidner in 2019. And the interesting thing that we found that the simplest solution of our complexity functional, which gives the optimal path for DMS complexity, matches the solutions to gravitational saddle points with Gravitational saddle points with constant orbit representations, which were also given in their paper, and some flat space cosmologies. Basically, this flat space cosmology is the flat space analog of the BTC black hole, basically. So, we found some, I mean, regarding this validity of this complexity functional and the optimal solution, we found these matches with this literature over here. So, just So, just to mention some of the future direction, this is our work that we did is a very baby step in the direction of this, I mean, studying this complexity in the context of flat space holography. So, there are loads of things that we can do in this non-Lorentian field theory. For example, the Kugini-story construction and the other notions of complexity, higher-dimensional general dilution. So, these are only some of the things that I mentioned. These are only some of the things that I mentioned here, but there is obviously a lot of things to do. And thank you for your attention. We have time for one quick question. I have one quick question. It's just quantification. So when you started the two copies of the Virat algebra and went to embed the BMS algebra. Way to get the BMS algebra. You need to define linear combinations of the variance of the generators. Define the L and M. But in your expression for N, there is an X one that needs to take the link to zero. So why? Because M is not zero. So. Oh, here? Oh, so basically, this is only a contraction. So this contracted generators, these MNs and this LNs, they both give this. I mean, when you take this combination and put this in the Virasura. Put you put this in the Viratola algebra, you will see that there will be epsilon on both sides. Like, for example, you see this algebra here. So, these L's are basically uncontracted. So, it gives that L. Now, when this L and M's are concerned, then you get M here because this M is contracted. So, if you consider epsilon here and if you consider epsilon here, it basically goes off. But here, the order will be of epsilon squared. So, it goes. Will be of epsilon square, so it goes to zero. So it's just a way to show that the limit can also be taken on the Abira Soro generators to get the BMS algebra in this way. Okay. So that's why it's not zero. Thank you. Okay, let's thank all you. Thank you so much. Okay. we should share the screen.
