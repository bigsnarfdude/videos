to to get done but uh now that it's done I'm uh I'm trying to think of what it uh means uh more broadly and uh and that's why I sort of wanted to talk about it here. So I'll start with the Ilya and Martin who did all the work and all the other collaborators and funding and okay then I'll go to Stutt about Stutt. Then I'll go to Stutteval. Stutvant with the pipe. So he says in 1937, it is true that favorable mutations must be credited with being the only raw material for evolution. But of course, we have a lot more mechanisms for generating genetic variation and even more mechanisms for phenotypic variation, heritable phenotypic variations. Variations. So we have point mutations like he suggested, but also insertions, inversions, rearrangement, all these mechanisms. I didn't list all of them because I don't know all of them. And I'm going to focus here on an employee, but I think it doesn't really matter which one I focus. I'm just going to tell a specific story, but I think it's a general story too. A general story, too. So, one thing that I think is important is that these different mechanisms have different formation rates. So, like the mutation rate is the formation rate of point mutations usually, but sometimes we say mutation rate would mean something else. So, let's get rid of the mutation rate too and let's say what we mean. But yeah, and I think that these different formation rates and fitness effect, which connects to the previous. Effect, which connects to the previous talk, these different distribution fitness effects and different formation rates can have sometimes different evolutionary outcomes. And it might surprise us if we're mostly thinking about rare mutations with small effects, like features miniature mutations. I don't know. Something like that. I don't know, something like that, right? He had this idea, which is the basis of Fischer's geometric model. Every imitation changes everything by a little bit. But maybe it's not the case. So I'm going to focus on Anaploid and ask a question that only came sort of at the last leg of the research. So it's one of those things where you do research like this and then you tell the story like that. But is it fair? But is it fast adaptation? Does it give you fast adaptation, or is it really something else which I would call evolution diversion? I don't know how you would feel about this sector. So aneploidy, extra chromosome, right? Maybe sometimes missing chromosome. Imbalancing the number of chromosomes. So usually it decreases fitness both in unicellular organisms. Organisms, so there's a lot of work from Wong Lee's lab about that. Multicellular organisms too, I mean things like all these syndromes and stuff like that. So basically having an extra chromosome is usually bad for the organism. However, there's lots of studies in Servicia and East that if you put cells under some stress, they'll get Stress, they'll get another chromosome and be adapted to the stress more or less. And it's not just in cervicia, there's a lot of work on this in Candida and also in cancer cells, tumors. So unaploidy is bad, but it's also good sometimes. I'm going to focus on a specific evolutionary experiment, so sort of I'm going to build a model for. If I'm going to build a model for a very specific case, but again, I think it's general, I don't know, general, precise, realistic, it's probably only precise, maybe not even that. But the specific experiment was done, it was published 12 years ago. It's from the Pilpeller, the Treitzmann. They grew yeast in heat stress, 39 degrees. After 450 generations, Treason we fixed. This is one of those serial dilution experiments. Move them every day to new media and keep going using, yeah, not a very sophisticated thing, no just put them in new bottles every day. So, treason we fixed after 450 generations, maybe earlier. After 450, they checked and it fixed. Now, what do we mean? And it's fixed. Now, what do we mean fixed? They looked at the chromosomes and say, well, most of the population has an extra chromosome, right? Using float cytometry, something like that. And for some reason they decided to keep the experiment going and after about two thousand generations the trizomy was lost. But the cells were growing fine. The cells were growing fine, 39 degrees. Okay, so this is 2,000 generations, seven generations per day. So this is a long experiment, and the trizomy was eliminated. So what happens here, you start with wild type, and as you climb the mountain, you get more fit, just like if we hike here. So you start with 2n with some rate delta, you get. Rate delta, you get to 2n plus 1, you get to isomin. And what they supposed to happen is that after some time they caught a mutation, one or more mutations, that gave them resistance to heat. So that would break new. And then you just need to lose the chromosome because the chromosome carries a cost. We started with the Dilutius effect. So then you get to the top of the highest mountain in terms of fitness, whatever fitness. In terms of fitness, whatever frequency is. Yeah? So that's sort of the idea: fast, transient, adaptive solution. Maybe you can call it a stepping stone, but it's not the dispersal stepping stone, it's evolutionary trajectory stepping stone. So transient adaptive solution, and it's fast because delta is much faster than mu. Getting a chromosome is much faster than getting a point mutation. Much, much faster, like thousand times faster. Thousand times faster. Right. But there's also the possibility to just get a mutation, to get a heat resistance mutation. I mean, that possibility is in the background. Okay, so why is it fast transit? Sort of to sum up, what's the deal with fast transit adaptive solution and sort of to compare it maybe to other processes. Unemployed rate is much faster than mutation rate. Mutation rate, so that just occurs more often. Unemployed effects are on average larger than mutation effects, so it's not this distribution concentrated around zero with some plus and some minus, but rather most unemployed are bad and some of them are good. Clear-cut, much nicer. The number of charotypes is much lower than the number of genotypes, obviously, just in combinatorics of it. Of it, there's 16 chromosomes, I think it is, but millions and billions or whatever of base pairs. So the search space is smaller, you can find whatever you're looking for faster, supposedly. Another thing we need to remember is that it's reversible, both because there's a high rate of losing the chromosome and there's a cost to the chromosome. So these are all things that differentiate unemployment. All things that differentiate unemployed from standard point mutations. And we can think that these differences are negligible, that there's, like we say, spice, but maybe sometimes there are, maybe they're not. So we looked at a little bit of empirical data that we have from this experiment. They started with four populations. After four hundred fifty generations, all of the populations had their trisomy. The populations had the trisomy. They only continued with two of these populations. After 1700 generations, trisomy was lost in one population, and after 230 generations, lost in the second population. So that's the data I have to work with. Not a lot of data, but we built a simple evolutionary model. Again, this is the graphic. Graphic representation of the model. It contains everything. I just now convert it to equations in a Wright-Fischer scheme. So the parameters are the uneploidy rate, the mutation rate, the fitness values of the genotypes. So I have four genotypes, so three fitness values, because I can it's all relative. Fitness is the a relative contribution to the next generation, so it's a made up. To the next generation, so it's a made-up thing, I know. But yeah, this is all effective, right? It's effective. I know the effective population size because it's an actual experiment. So these are all effective parameters. This is standard, nothing interesting here. And then area set out to fit this to the data that we have. We used the approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo. With sequential Monte Carlo, which we got from a paper by Mantanaka, and it's implemented in a really nice Python package, relatively easy to use, very well documented, very strong capabilities to the package. Basically, you propose some parameters, you use it to simulate data, you then compare the data, the simulated data to the real data, and if the The data to the real data, and if that comparison was good, if it's similar enough, you accept the parameter proposal, then you propose new parameters, and so on and so on. At the end of the deal, you have parameters that are good estimates of the posterior distribution over the model parameters. So, that's sort of the scheme. There are many other schemes to do this. This works really well in this case. So, just to make sure we got something that makes sense, if we take the parameters that we got, like we got a posterior distribution, but if we choose the maximum or a posterior estimates, and we run lots of simulations, then we get what we expect. So, this is percent of simulations and generations to eliminate visomy. So, you can see in 49 of the simulations that visomy was eliminated by 1700 generations. By 1700 generations and 92 by 2350, those are the sort of numbers we have to work with. So the predictive check works. We tried a bunch of different variations of the model, and this one worked best. So we sort of compared models, right? I wouldn't call it model selection, but we did model comparison and compared model using this and a couple other ways. So what sort of the estimated model parameters are. Sort of the estimated model parameters. I won't go over this a lot because it's more interesting to yeast genetics than to evolutionary theory. But you can see a mutation rate is much lower than the chromosome gang rate, like orders of magnitude. And the fitness values are not the big fitness jump is from 1 to 1022, but then the other fitness jumps are less than 1%. Less than 1%. So the main advantage is to initially get the unemployed that increases the relative fitness by over 2%, but then going forward is less than half a percent, like getting the heat resistance mutation and getting rid of the extra chromosome. So then Martin set out to actually use this model to make predictions. So he sampled from the posterior distribution, runs a From the posterior distribution, runs a simulation, and these are 50 simulations, example simulations, the stochasticity is both from the model and from the posterior distribution, right? That's the variance, the variance that we see. So, wild type goes down, that's 2N, it goes down very quickly in frequency over time, right? So, wild type in orange goes down very quickly, and unemployed it goes up very quickly. But you'll notice that it doesn't. But you'll notice that it doesn't hit the scene. And then it goes down and it's replaced by the green, which is 2n star, that's the mutant, aoploid mutant. That's the evolved best fit in this system. And the 2n plus 1 star, the anaploid with a mutation, with a beneficial mutation, is barely increasing in frequency. The reason is that once, I mean, according to this transient According to this transient model, transient adaptive solution model, whitepe is replaced by 2N by adaploid, and the mutant appears and it's quickly replaced by 2N because it's not because it loses the chromosome very quickly. But then we sort of wanted to ask: is this really fast, transient, adaptive solution, or could something else be going on? Something else we're going on. So Martin rebuilt the model with five types. Now we have two N star coming from unemployed and two N star coming directly from Turin. So these are evolved from an ancestry of unemployed and evolved directly from the white. And this is what was surprising to us is that the unemployed descendants are actually kind of Evidence are actually kind of rare at the end of the experiment, and only about 10% of evolved strains are descended from animples, whereas about 90% are descendants directly from the wild type. And this is, again, despite the fact that you can see that unemployed almost took over the population. They reached over 95% in every simulation we do with these setups. Do with these sets of parameters. So, I mean, what's going on here? So, I showed this slide to Daniel Bratzmann when he was visiting and he said, let's look at it at log-log scale. And that made a big difference to sort of trying to understand what's going on here. So, this is the same plot, log-log scale. Plot log log state. Okay, so this is 2n going down, 2n plus 1 going up. This is the 2n style. In gray, 2n plus 1 style. And then we have the two types of 2n star. We have in purple, these are descendants of phynoploidy, and in green, that's descendants of direct descendants of wild type. And the dashed line is actually the same model without stochasticity. Same model without stochasticity. So eliminating the sampling, eliminating grief. So what's going on? At the beginning, we have the unemployed going up at the rate that it's approximately the unemployed rate multiplied by the frequency of wild time plus the unemployed frequency multiplied by its fitness. But the unemployed frequency at the beginning. But the unemployed frequency at the beginning is low. So the main thing driving up the frequency is the unemployed rate multiplied by the wild type frequency, which is high. Now the mutants are generated with mu times wild type frequency, but that's much lower than delta is much lower than mu. So at the beginning, you have fast flow of unapplied and slow flow of Unaployed and slow flow of mutants. But of course, this is like in a predator plane system, the unapproached, sorry, the wild types are going down in frequency because they're converted to mutants and unemployed mainly unemployed. And then at some point, you don't have enough wild type. So the balance moves from the rate of formation to fitness. At this point, we can see that sort of the We can see that sort of the direct mutants start to go up faster because they have a fitness benefit. And the uneploids are starting to generate the unemployed mutant in gray. There's a lot of stochasticity, but it doesn't matter at the end because they generate the unemployed mutant, which converts to just a Converts to just a Loid mutant, that's the purple. But by this time that they generate the mutant descendant from Anakloid, that's it, right? No more fitness difference. So the system is then stuck. They just take over, they slide to taking over, but whatever relative frequency the two types of helploid mutants have, they stick to that relative frequency. And it's all done. So the deterministic equation. So the deterministic equation sort of in this parameter regime, the deterministic equation does everything. So yeah, so sorry, so it seems like in this case, in this specific case, unemployed is a diversion. It's not a shortcut, it's not a w whatever there are other ways, like if we open the map to look at trails. Map to look at trails. It's a diversion in two ways. In one way, for the individual, it's a diversion because if you take the unemployed route, you're not leaving that many descendants at the end. So it's a diversion. You shouldn't do it. You should do. And at the population level, it's also a diversion. Because here I show you the population mean fitness over time. Over time, the solid line is a population with unemployed, and the dashed line is a population without unemployed. So you can see that the population would get to the highest fitness faster, much faster without unemployed, if unemployed did not exist. And this is because when unemployed does exist, the mutant has a smaller advantage over unemployed compared to over Wiretax, so if it To other white tax, so fixation time, if that's a real thing, it takes a lot of time or longer time. So it's a diversion even for the population. And one prediction that the model makes is that if you reduce the mutational supply, so either the mutation rate, say, by doing drugs instead of heat, not doing drugs, giving drugs to the yeast instead. Giving drugs to the yeast instead of heat. So maybe the target size is much smaller, so instead of a thousand base per thousand genes, you just need one mutation in one gene. Or if you do the whole experiment in a smaller media, then the frequency of descendants of anaploids that they have population would actually grow if we have orientation supply. Orientation supply, and that would mean that it's like a faster adaptation accelerator or amplifier. I'm not sure, right? Probably both in this case. But in this, the experiment for some reason fell right here. Well, yeah, well, runeploid is a divergence. So, some things that I'm wondering about, right? So how often How often will we see this kind of dynamics where fixation is not really fixation and they become so frequent and still fail, which is, I guess, very surprising to me. And it all starts because the population size is large enough to have mutants from the beginning. So the unemployed never had a real chance to fix it. How often will we see? How often will we see this kind of dynamics? Is this like a weird pathological case, or is this actually something that happens quite often and we can't see it because we're not looking at our employees, we're not doing 2000 rings? How often do we actually have competition between adaptive strategies? Adaptive strategies I mean mechanisms for generating adaptations or generating valuations. How often do we actually have competition between different strategies? Between different strategies that have really different properties, like fast versus slow, frequency-dependent versus frequency-independent. I don't know, like these are the spices we're talking about, but how often does this happen and how is it affected by ecology, evolutionary history, blah blah blah. And the last one: when will we have this thing? One, when will we have this thing where mutation supply is much more stronger than selection? Which is what's driving the difference here. And when should we expect this kind of stuff to happen? Yeah, exactly. One or two questions. No, it's not the reference. I feel like I missed this at the beginning, but you have a diploid that's becoming enduploid. And in the model, did that increase your mutational target, the probability of mutation increased because you can't do that? That's a good point. I skipped over it. We tested, when I said we checked different models, one of the models we tested is that if you have an extra chromosome, then your mutation rate is higher. But it's just like But it's it's just like fifty percent higher mutation, right? Being fifty percent higher is a small, small difference. So it we couldn't decide between the models. So it sort of assumes like she's linear with the size of the genome and so. Yeah, you can assume it and you can not assume it doesn't make a difference because it's such a small difference to mutation rate. No, that's good. Being a little bit more abstract about this, it's in line with a lot of early experiments. In line with a lot of early experiments in use that showed leapfrogging, that they would have, when they were trying to estimate how many beneficial sweeps had occurred, they got the wrong number because those weren't sequential sweeps, but one happened and then the next leapfrog from before. And I think that that's very common when selection, when there's multiple single mutations.
