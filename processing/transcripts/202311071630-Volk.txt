Okay, um so yeah, I guess bitter bittersweet because class gave such a great kind of prequel to this but then on the other hand people tend to not care for the sequels so but at least this one's short. So kind of just reviewing what class went over. Basically you have the smooth model Basically, you have the smooth Mange optimal transport problem, and you can basically just look at this kind of bundle picture where you're looking at the diffeomorphism group for the total space, and then in the base of the densities. And so there's this kind of contrasting thing that Class brought up, which was that you have, in the case for the diffeomorphism group and the densities, they're both n-dimensional. However, you have sitting in them as kind of a finite model, G-O-N. Finite model, GON, and the normal distributions. Okay? And moreover, these are totally geodesic specific. Okay? And so basically, yeah, so you can basically introduce this principal bundle, picture, and class went over all this. You give a struct, remaining structure on the total space, like the diffeomorphism group and GLN. And then the result is that you can just basically. And the result is that you can just basically treat your submersion here, pi, as a remaining submersion, which subduces a metric in the base. And then basically you get the Wasserstein metric on the densities in the infinite dimensional case, and then suitable restriction for the normal densities. So you can basically take this picture and you can try to force it at all different situations. It all different situations, and like we already saw, like you could force it in the case for groupoids. And so, similarly, I tried to do this with various things. And so, it was actually already done by FX and his colleagues in a case for unbalanced optimal transport. So, the idea here is unlike with usual optimal transport, where the volume of the The volume of the piles of dirt that you're pushing around don't change. It's always going to be the same. Unbalanced optimal transport, it can change. So the total volume can change as you kind of take your route. And so what they did was they considered for the total space a semi-direct product of the diffeimorphism group with these positive functions on M, and then the base is the The base is the unnormalized densities, okay, denoted here by volume. And so the what do you call it? The submersion here is just the push forward of the scaled density, okay, scaled by the function. And so what we did was, so with Boris and Klass, we considered this situation, which is quite a bit. Which is quite a bit smaller. So it's a conical extension of the diffeomorphism group. So instead of considering the semi-direct product with quite a large function space, we're considering just the cone of the diffeomorphism group. And so the push-forward action is the same, basically, except this time the constant can, of course, slip out front. And so it's basically our setup for our paper that we did. Our paper that we did, and so then our metric we chose was the conical metric. Okay, and so if it doesn't look very conical in this expression, you can just replace m with r squared and then it'll just look much more naturally cone-like. And so this metric, it projects to the volumes with this metric expression. With this metric expression here. And yeah, that's, I guess, there's nothing much more to say. The picture is very much like pictures that you've seen already in classes presentation, except this one, it's a comb. And so I guess that's really just the kind of visual take-home here: is that it's the same picture, except this time it's kind of a cup. Kind of a code. And so now the idea is that we can consider the dynamics of this, I guess, the metric and the base for the purpose of optimal transport. And so to do this, what we did is we looked at the Hamiltonian on the cotangent bundle. And so just dualizing the metric, we just get our Hamiltonian. And then we get our corresponding geodesic equations in their Hamiltonian form. It's worth mentioning. Hamiltonian form. It's worth mentioning that you can get like Lagrangian geodesic equations just using pretty basic methods. But yeah, so those are your geodesic equations. In particular, you can show that the variables m and so remember m is the kind of total volume, right? And see here, they have these, this is their value. These are their dynamical behavior. And in particular, you can combine these two equations to get this expression, n double dot is equal to the Hamiltonian. And so the idea here is that the total volume evolves with constant acceleration, only depending on the energy level of the initial conditions. Okay, and so in particular, it's quadratic in H, or M is quadratic in H. And so this basically gives you this idea that, as expected, with quantum geometry, As expected with plummet geometry, your volume along a geodesic could drop as you go along. And so, yeah. And yeah, so, and it's also worth mentioning as a side point here that the problem can also be phrased as a convex problem with affine constraints using these variables. At the end, okay? And how much time do I have? About five minutes. Okay, and so then we considered. Okay, and so then we considered kind of finite dimensional pictures. So, again, because kind of the context here is that we have, in our original case with GLN, we have it's a finite dimensional model sitting within an infinite dimensional one. And so we can do the similar case here, except it's a little bit weird because we have to kind of split in the base. So here, SPD is the symmetric positive definite. Or yeah, symmetric positive definite matrices, we have to kind of split it up into two parameters. We can't absorb the total volume somehow into the covariance matrix that corresponds to the normal distribution there. And so everything here is going to get kind of, there will be more equations just as a result of that. But the idea is that you just kind of trace the same path as auto-data. Auto did, and you get this. The projection is given as before. So, in the first part, this is probably, if you remember Class's presentation, it's the same in the very first component, and in the second, it's just the volume. So, it's kind of already you can see this is probably going to just turn out as a cone in the base, and so indeed, so it's a lot to look at, but So it's a lot to look at, but you basically get for your metric in the base. So yeah, for your metric in the base, you get just a metric, and it basically appears very much like the case with just GON that Klaus had presented. You get that the solution here for S is just a symmetric solution here to this equation, which is the Lyapunov. This equation, which is the Lyapunov equation. And yeah, then we can compute the geodesics as we did in the general case. And yeah, that's it. And then just a few remarks on the finite model. So the idea is that you can also kind of repeat the kind of game with GLN, except with the affine group. Acting on the kind of normal distributions with any mean. And so then this gives you also the same extension here with kind of unbalanced case. And then yeah, I guess the last thing here that I kind of want to mention before I move on to the last slide is just that. Slide is just that as opposed to the so this finite model does kind of sit as a finite model for the case that I mentioned before with the semi-direct product. However, it's still like a I guess in a way it's like Occam's razor kind of thing. It's a lot of extra stuff just to admit the same finite model. To admit the same finite model. And so there's considered possible kind of large finite models. And so just kind of a natural guess would be if you took the semi-direct product with an additive group, the symmetric matrices here, then does it work as a finite model? And it turns out it doesn't because if you kind of do the calculation, it ends up being. Population, it ends up being: well, you wouldn't necessarily have that the projection is always going to be a positive definite. And so as a result, you have to restrict to a closed orbit of the action on the scaled normal distributions. And so it's just kind of, it doesn't seem like there's an obvious larger finite model to consider for the semi-direct case. Case. And so just, yeah, this is just a little bit about the kind of the large case. We did do kind of the similar analysis of the Hamiltonian for that case. But yeah, so just in closing, so the what you got, the metric here, which I should mention, is the Wasserstein-Fischer-Brown metric because it kind of interpolates between them. Of interpolates between them. So there's a question of if our case is kind of a restriction of that except to just the cone. But we check that, and if you lift it to the cone, it's a different metric and it's a little bit tricky to work with. And also we consider another extension which has this kind of divergence term here. And this also kind of looks like a kind of combination of Wasserstein and Fischer-Rau, except And Fischer Rau, except in kind of the Lagrangian setting. But yeah, and then just as a final remark, what I'm kind of working towards is potentially using kind of the large extension. So kind of moving away from the simple extension, but using the large extension, but towards vector or matrix valued densities. Okay, and then, yeah, that's all. Question. You mentioned the volume can diff in between geodisks are between the points that are far away, right? Yeah. Is it possible, does it ever happen that the most efficient thing is to go down to the cone point and then come back up? You can just sell everything and then buy it all back at the end? Exactly. We see this sometimes in conical matters. I guess it's possible. I guess it's possible. I didn't actually do any numerics to see if this is a reasonable expectation to have this happen, but it's definitely possible. But yeah, I should look into that. So how different is the solution from standard optimal transport? What I mean with this is take your densities, project them to miles one, solve standard optimal transport, compare this to your scaled solution. Is this genuinely different dynamic on the Dynamic on the just like unbalanced compared to like normalized? No, unbalanced to a normal, yes, but your model to standard one. So you take your model and you take your solution and project it down to far small densities. Do you get a genuinely different dynamic than for I'm not sure? I didn't quite look at yeah, I didn't look at that, but I guess that's a consideration. You're basically saying just normalize it and then compare the geodesics input. Compare the geodesics input cases and see if they yeah, I guess that is an interesting question to consider, but yeah, I didn't look at that now. If you think of geodesics in the call, you don't get the closest parts by moving on the circle, right? So it's not going to be interpolated to these points. Project on the sphere, it's a coin. Project on the sphere, it's a code. Project on the sphere is where you can measure the project. Well maybe I I would think also more. There is a textbook I need to I need to like check out the college. I is projecting that special initial in the space of quality measures because it's also a code. So there are many papers, so there are many papers who are looking at uh convex function models, the space of quantum measures. And I was wondering if in this setting you look at convex uh function models. Complex uh functional. Because in fact in fact what is uh what is super disappointing is that there are there are also many complex functional. So in your case have you looked at entropy or because Maybe we can defer discussion, further discussion to our next talk.
