To tell us about Indian modern concepts, Gary's floor is yours. Thank you for your talk. All right. Can you hear me? Yes, loud and clear. All right. So thank you very much for having me here. I'm sorry that I cannot come in person. As I told the organizers, I have fond memories of the many family trips I took with my parents and sisters to Ben and also Jasper. It would have been nice to make this trip, especially that I haven't seen my sister. Especially that I haven't seen my sister for three years due to the pandemic. Unfortunately, the timing does not work out, but hopefully, there are opportunities in the future. So, I will be talking about Euclidean wormholes and string theory. Let me start with some motivations. Now, this is a workshop on quantum information theory in quantum field theory and cosmology. So, I don't have to preach to the choir that wormholes play a crucial role in holography, especially from the quantum. Especially from the quantum information perspective. For example, they are used in producing the page curve in the context of black holes. Now, these interesting results, which I believe will be reviewed by Jeff on Friday, were obtained mostly in two-dimensional gravity where explicit calculations can be done. It's natural to ask whether Euclidean wormholes play a similar role in higher dimensions where gravity is dynamical. Namely, do they arise as Euclidean worms? Namely, do they arise as Euclidean saddles of UV complete theories such as string theory? Now, this question has two parts. First of all, are they genuine saddle points? Questions have been raised in the past quarter of a century as to whether the well-studied Euclidean axion wormholes known as the Gidding-Strominger wormholes are perturbatively stable. In the sense that quadratic fluctuations around the wormhole solution may contain negative modes. May contain negative modes that lower the action. And secondly, can we construct Euclidean worm pose from string theory? So these are the questions that we address in this pair of papers. In our paper last year, we showed that when gauge invariance and correct boundary conditions are simultaneously taken into account, the homogeneous modes around the wormholes. modes around the wormhole solutions are pure gauge, whereas the inhomogeneous modes always increase the Euclidean action. So therefore our conclusion is that the Gilling strong engineer wormholes are perturbatively stable. Actually we have done more. We have studied the Lorentzian path integral using Picard-Lischiff's theory, which allows us to treat Lorentzian, Euclidean, and complex saddles democratically. But this is a subject. But this is the subject of a different talk. Now, in our recent papers, which appear in March, we construct Euclidean wormholes, Euclidean axion wormholes explicitly from string theory. So both in flat space and in ADS space. And our explicit solutions for wormholes in ADS space allows us to test some positivity bounds in the dual conformal field theory. So let me start with. So, let me start with the Gidding-Stronginger wormhole, which are solutions to the Euclidean equation of motions for axion gravity. So, we consider the following Euclidean action, where the set of scalars that I call phi of i here includes the number of axions and dilatons. And in Euclidean gravity, axions come with a wrong sign kinetic term, a feature that allows us to distinguish them from the dilaton. us to distinguish them from the dilettantes. So some of these scalars would have neck with a would have a one wrong side kinetic terms, some of them would have the standard side for the kinetic terms. Those with the wrong size are the axions, wrong signs are the axions. A simple set of solutions with an O D symmetry takes the following form. So H here is a harmonic function of the radial coordinates, which plays the role of an affine parameter along the geodesic on the scalar management. The geodesic on the scalar manifold. And in this set of solutions, the scalars have a constant geodesic speed, which I denoted by C, and this constant geodesic speed, C enters into the metric. Now, there are three classes of Euclidean solutions distinguished by whether the geodesic is space-like, light-like, or time-light. So, what is usually referred to as the core. Is usually referred to as the core instantant solutions that corresponds to space-like geodesic. The solution has a curvature singularity. Extremal instantons corresponds to null geodesic. An example of an extremal instanton is the D-instanton in string theory. The solution does not have curvature singularity, but the scalar field diverges at the origin. Euclidean wormholes, on the other hand, are described by time-like geodesic. Are described by time-light geodesic. And if there are only axions and no dilatons, the geodesic is always time-light, and the solution is smooth. Now, in the presence of dilatons, all three cases can be realized, but the longest time-light geodesic has a length set by the dilaton coupling. So, depending on what is this dilaton coupling, we will be able to find out what is the longest time-light geodesic in. The longest timeline geodesic in this for this wormhole solutions. Now, there's a regularity condition for the wormhole. The required geodesic length has to fit inside the scalar manifold. Otherwise, the solution is singular. The geodesic length of the wormhose depends on the wormhole size, which is set in this case of axion. In this case, of axion Euclidean wormhole by the axion charge. So the regularity condition is a condition on the diletton couplings. So in order for the required geodesic length to fit inside the scalar manifold, this condition that I list over here would have to be satisfied. And in four dimensions, this means that the sum of the dilaton coupling Coupling, the sum of the dilettant coupling, actually, the sum of the inverse coupling square is required to be bigger than three-quarters. And in our recent paper, we constructed Euclidean axiom worm pose explicitly from compactification of string theory. There are three classes of examples that we study. Each of these constructions taught us a new lesson. And we constructed Euclidean. Constructed Euclidean axion wormholes in flat space by compactifying the type IIA string theory on a torus. The wormhole is of the Gidding Strominger type, as we'll see. And the way the regularity condition is satisfied is to have enough axial dilettante pairs. Each axion is coupled to, in a sense, each axion coupled to a different brains, and these brains intersect. And it turns out there's no wick rotation that turns this intersect. No wick rotation that turns this intersecting brain configuration into Lorentzian brains, and this gets around the problem that the wormholes are, in some sense, over-extremal. Now, we have also constructed Euclidean axion wormholes in ADS spaces by compactifying type 2B string theory on the coset space T11, which has a topology of S2 cross S3. The axions come from the reduction on the S2. This background is supersymmetric with a known. Background is supersymmetric with a known conformal field theory dual. And by computing one-point functions in the wormhole solutions, we see we could see, check whether the positivity bounds in the CFT are satisfied or not. And turns out in these constructions, the scalars, you may call them dilettants, have a potential. And so the wormhole that we construct is not what you would call the Gidding strong magnitude wormhole because of the potential. Because of the potentials for the scalars. So, and precisely for this reason, the solutions are harder to find. We cannot write down analytic solutions. We can only resort to numerical solutions. Nonetheless, the numerical solutions is sufficiently clear for us to test the positivity bounds that I mentioned earlier. We have also constructed Euclidean wormholes for massive 2A supergravity. And this background is non-supersymmetric and there's no known CFT dual. Super symmetric, and there's no known CFT dual. So, I will not say much about these solutions. So, the question that we ultimately want to address is, are these wormholes compatible with quantum gravity? So, wormholes lead to a breakdown of locality. And Sydney Coleman, a long time ago, taught us how to bring the wormhole action, which Which looks a priority non-local into a local form by introducing a set of so-called alpha parameters. While this fixed the problem naively, the problem of locality naively, the coupling constants in nature depends on the alpha vacuum. And so we can only make statistical predictions. Now, Euclidean wormholes are even more puzzling if they are embedded into ADS compactification of string theory, because they could apologize. String theory because they could a priori jeopardize factorization in ADICFT. So I would say that wormholes have a bit of a love-hate relationship with quantum gravity. On the one hand, wormholes break global symmetries, which have long been conjectured to be inexact in quantum gravity. They also play a role in the so-called axionic weak gravity. Uh, so-called axionic weak gravity conjecture by setting the extremality bound. So the weak gravity conjecture tells us that there should be a state in the case of the usual zero-form weak gravity conjecture, we would say that the charge to mass ratio of a state has to be bigger than that of an extreme of black hole. But it is less clear how to do that for the axion version of the weak gravity conjecture, because the object that is coupled to the axiom. Because the object that is coupled to the axions are instantons, which has no clear notion of extremality and decay. Nonetheless, it seems like the half-wormhole is possibly the one that sets the extremality bound, which turns into a constraint on the product of the axiom decay constant and the instanton action. So, this seems to suggest that wormholes should be compatible with quantum gravity. They do what we expect quantum gravity to do. On the other hand, and after On the other hand, an alpha parameter interpretation of wormholes leads to a minus one form global symmetries, which, just like other global symmetries, should be forbidden in quantum gravity. Wormholes also lead to some conceptual issues, such as factorization in ADSEFT that I mentioned earlier, and an apparent violation of the positivity of some positivity bounds in the dual-conformal field theory. Few theory. So, you know, the situation is rather confusing, and it would be useful to be able to say something more definitively about whether wormholes and quantum gravity are compatible with each other. So I will start with our work, describing our work on wormhole stability. And for those who have been following this subject, questions have been raised in the past quarter of a century. Quarter of a century as to whether Euclidean axiom wormholes of the Giddings rammit type are perturbatively stable in the sense that quadratic fluctuations around the wormhole solutions may contain negative modes that lower the action. And if this is the case, then these wormholes are not genuine set of points that contribute to the path integral. So in the paper last year, we showed that when gauge invariance and correct Engage invariance and correct boundary conditions are imposed, which have not been previously accounted for simultaneously. There are no negative modes. In other words, the Gidding-stromagic wormhole is perturbatively stable. Now, in four dimension, which is the context in which we analyze the wormhole stability, an axion is due to a three-form. So, what we did is to analyze the wormhole stability in the three-form picture. Stability in the three-form picture for reasons that I would explain. But shortly after our work, the Belgians revisited the calculation earlier and came to the same conclusion in the axion picture. Now, in analyzing the perturbations around a wormhole solution, the boundary conditions in the three-form picture are more transparent. That's the reason why we. Transparent. That's the reason why we carry out our analysis in the three-form picture. And this is because, under diffomorphism, metric perturbations and the three-form perturbations are mixed. So by themselves, they are not gauge invariant. The metric perturbations clearly vanish at infinity away from the wormhole neck, but it is also the case for the three-form perturbations. So the gauge invariant perturbations, which makes metric perturbation to the three-form perturbations, Makes metric perturbations and streamform perturbations satisfies the Richlet boundary conditions. In the axion picture, fixing the axion charge amounts to setting the axion derivative to zero. So the gauge invariant perturbations in the axion picture mix the Richlet boundary conditions and Neumann boundary conditions. It's not the end of the world. It's more complicated to handle mixed boundary conditions, but this can be done. So So, to assess the wormhole stability, we carry out the following steps. The first thing we should do is to identify the physical degrees of freedom. Now, not all perturbations around the wormhole solutions are physical. Some can be gauged away by diffeomorphism. The physical degrees of freedom are the gauge invariant combinations. We can then expand the actions to quadratic order. The actions to quadratic order in this gauge in varying degrees of freedom and analyze the spectrums to see what they do to the action. You can see whether the action increases or decreases upon these perturbations. Now, this step should be very familiar to those who have analyzed gauge invariant perturbations in inflationary cosmology. What is different, as we found, is that the on-shell value of the wormhole action and not just the spectrum of perturbation. And not just the spectrum of perturbations, is important for determining the wormhole stability. So we do have to analyze the spectrum of perturbations, but turns out the on-shell value of the Euclidean action is also important in determining whether the wormhole is stable or not. So we will remain in Lorentzian signatures for as long as we could until it's absolutely necessary to wick rotate. And so you could parameterize And so you could parametrize the perturbations around the wormhole solutions, both the perturbations to the metric and the perturbations of the three form as follows. If you do the counting very quickly, you'll find that there are six scalar perturbations labeled, parameterized by this field, phi, b, psi, e, s, and w. So these are the six perturbations around the wormhole solutions. And all these perturbations should vanish far away from the neck of the wormhole. The neck of the wormhole, as I argued before, so the boundary conditions that they satisfy are the Richlet boundary conditions. So, what makes the problem more complicated is that by themselves, they are not gauge invariant. Under diffimorphism, the various perturbations transform, and physically meaningful statements can only be made about linear combinations of the perturbations that are gauge invariant. So, in our case, it turns out that there's only one gauge invariant. It turns out that there's only one gauge invariant physical mode that I call S over here. It's a combination of some of the perturbations that I mentioned before. So now that we have identified the age-invariant perturbation, it's straightforward to expand the action to quadratic order in perturbations. And notice that some perturbations are not dynamical because the time derivative of some The time derivative of some of these perturbations do not appear in the action. And if you look at this quadratic action that I show on the slide, these non-dynamical fields include what I call phi, b, and w. These fields do not have the time derivative appearing in the quadratic action. So integrating out this non-dynamical field imposes constraints. And so in order to analyze the stability, it is useful to reduce this problem. It is useful to reduce this problem to a one-dimensional problem by expanding all the fields that I mentioned in terms of the angular momentum eigenstates. And we'll do this mode by mode for each of the eigenstates to see what the mode does to the action. Now, the first thing we will consider is the homogeneous mode, which corresponds to j equal to zero, the zero angular momentum eigenstate. As you can see, As you can see, the quadratic action contains only two of the perturbations. The action contains only two of the perturbations, even though there are six of them to start with. The perturbations that appear are phi and psi. One of them is non-dynamical. Phi naught is non-dynamical. And when we integrate out that field, we impose a constraint, a gauge invariant constraints. And after you do that, the resulting action turns out. Resulting action turns out is a total derivative. So that means that the homogeneous mode is not physical, it's a pure gauge. Therefore, we do not have the conformal factor problem. And similarly, if you were to analyze the J equals to one mode around the wormhole solutions for the Gidding strong major wormhole, you find that this is also a pure gauge. Now, for J bigger than or equal to Now, for j bigger than or equal to 2, there are infinitely many of them. There is only for each j, there's only one physical degrees of freedom, as we have already argued. This is the gauge invariant physical degrees of freedom. And so if you will have to trust me that this is the quadratic action after all the modes have been integrated out, all the non-gauge invariant modes have been integrated out. So at this point, we're still in Lorentzian signature, and there's no reason why we cannot make rotate now. And there's no reason why we cannot big rotate now. At this point, we can big rotate. The unperturbed action, which I have not shown here, describes the Gidding Strominger wormhole. And in this coordinate that I have chosen, r equals to zero is the neck of the wormhole. And the two asymptotically flat regions are at r equals to plus or minus infinity. Now, this is a big mess. And when we canonically normalize the gauge invariant perturbation. Normalize the gauge invariant perturbations that I've been calling SJ to some rescale perturbations that I call Q, and using integration by parts to get rid of this nasty cross terms at the expense of introducing a boundary terms. This is the quadratic actions that we find. Now, the expressions for the potential and the boundary terms are given in our paper. I'm not going to show you here. But one point that I would like to draw your attention to is that the quadratic action, the EFD. Is that the quadratic action naively looks positive definite? So, why is that difficult to even show that there are no negative modes? Well, it turns out that the boundary terms that was generated by this integration by parts is crucial, as we will see. So, without taking into the account the boundary terms, we do not know the full contributions to the quadratic action. So, finding the spectrum of scalar perturbations. Finding the spectrum of scalar perturbations amounts to solving this Schrodinger-like problem. So, this is like one-dimensional quantum mechanics problem where the radio, where we have only the radio coordinates. And as we have argued, our physical perturbations vanish at infinity. This is a mixture of the metric and the three-form perturbations. The gauge-invariant perturbations vanish far away from the neck of the wormhole. But because of the normalized But because of the normalization, the rescale perturbations that I call Q actually vanish faster than e to the minus r. So in other words, we are not only solving this problem, but we are looking for bound states with energy that is strictly less than minus one. And turns out for each j, there are only two such bound states with energy strictly less than minus one. One of them is odd and one of them. Is odd and one of them is even in the radial coordinate out. So let me show you a few figures. The figure on the left shows the bound state eigenfunctions for j equals to 2 and j equals to infinity, the two extreme cases just to illustrate. And from the figure, you can see that both the odd and the even eigenfunctions do not change much as we change j. So going from different So, going from different angular momentum bound states, you don't see much change in the eigenfunctions. Now, the figure on the right shows the boundary term that I mentioned earlier for the even and for the odd j equals to two bound states. For the even bound states, you see that the boundary term diverges at the origin. And so that means that the Euclidean action goes to plus infinity. So the even So, the even bound states give vanishing contributions to the path integral and can be discarded. In contrast, the odd bound states survive as finite action perturbations. You can see that the boundary term is everywhere finite and in fact integrates to zero. Now, this is for j equals to two. In general, we solve for the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions numerically. Our conclusion is that Conclusion is that the Euclidean action only ever increases under scalar perturbations, the ones that are not pure gauge. We find that the perturbations only increase the Euclidean action. In other words, the Gidding strong engineer bubble is perturbatively stable. So I will be brief with the string theory embeddings, the results of our recent paper, tell you about the results of our recent paper because my time is up. Up. So let's first consider Euclidean axiom wormholes in flat space as a warm-up. And so this reduction onsets from type 2A compactifying on a six-dimensional torus is motivated by the extremal intersecting brain solutions. And so if we were to consider extremal solutions instead of wormholes, this would be a set of brains that intersect. Each of the axions that we consider coupled. Each of the axions that we consider coupled to our brains. And so these are the brain configurations that lead to extremal intersecting brain solutions. But the same answers lead to four-dimensional Euclidean axion wormholes that we found. These are axion wormholes in flat space. And you see how the wormholes can fit. You know how these regularity conditions can be satisfied if you were to look at this answer and reduce the corresponding four-dimensional theory has a dilatant. Corresponding four-dimensional theory has a dilaton coupling that is too large. Beta, which is our dilaton coupling, is two, and is too large to satisfy the regularity condition for each dilaton. But with four of them, we could satisfy the regularity conditions. And precisely, because we need at least four axial dilaton pairs to get around the regularity condition, we cannot wait-rotate these brain configurations to only Lorentzian brains. Brains. So we have also constructed Euclidean wormholes in ADS space by compactifying type 2B string theory on the coset space T11, which has a topology of S2 cross S3. So the axions that support the wormhole solutions come from reduction on the S2. And so this is again the reduction answers, and this is the background solutions. Background solutions, which is ABS5 cross D11. Now, by consistently reducing the theory to five dimensions, we see that the wormhole solutions that we are after are not of the Gidding-Strawm integral type. And this is because the scalars that I call U and B, these are the dilettantes, if you wish, have a potential. Also, to make things worse, the Make things worse, the axions sources this dilettante fuse. So you could imagine that this system is very challenging to solve. But my former student, Gregory Logis, is superb both in generating ideas and in solving very hard, doing very hard calculations. So it's not really a piece of cake, but it's manageable. So I would not. I would not show you the explicit solutions. Details can be found in our paper, but with the explicit solutions we find, we can turn this positivity bound in the dual CFT that we want to check into a comparison of one-point functions in the gravity solutions. Now, we find that the positivity bounds are always violated. And this seems to suggest that a wormhole connecting two asymptotic regions is due to an. Symptotic regions is due to an unusual CFT state. So, this is just a graphical representation of this combination of the one-point functions. Nowhere do you find that this inequality is satisfied. On the other hand, we argue that the single boundary wormhole obtained by gluing the two asymptotic regions of the wormholes together satisfies the dual positivity bounds. And this is because the wormhole acts as a dipole source for. Acts as a dipole source for the Ramon-Ramon fields. So when you glue these two asymptotic regions together, the one-point functions from the Ramon-Ramon field vanish. And so, in other words, what we wanted to say is that the Ramon-Ram axions, they are there to help support the volume solutions without contributing to the positivity bias. So, let me summarize. In the paper last year, we established that the Giddings. Last year, we established that the Gidding-Strominger wormhole is perturbatively stable after the calculations that I've sketched for you. Now, this conclusion of stability may carry over to ADS wormholes since the perturbations are localized to the wormhole neck, whose size is much smaller than the ADS radius. And now, in the recent paper, we constructed explicit Euclidean wormholes from string theory. Some of these wormholes are wormholes in flat space, some of them are wormholes in ADS space. Some of them are wormholes in ADS space. The one in ADS space allows us to use holography to check some of the positivity bounds that I briefly mentioned to you. Of course, many other conceptual issues remain, such as the meaning of the other parameters, maybe universes, and all that. But without a doubt, I would say that we have learned a great deal about quantum gravity through explicit constructions of black holes in string theory. Black holes in string theory, it's likely that we could learn similarly valuable lessons from explicit wormhole solutions from string theory. So, let me stop there. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Ellie, for interesting talk. We have time for a couple of questions. So, please, please go ahead. Yes? So, I have a question. In what kind of Euclidean partnership? In what kind of Euclidean path integrals do you expect what is one of us to do? Are they just Euclidean path integrals properly in space in the CFP, for instance? So this is Euclidean path integral for axion gravity. So the path integral includes integral over the matrix and of the axions. Right, right. But the boundary conditions in ABS, they are fixed or they are normalizable boundary conditions. Or do you input some sources in the body? Is the action a normalizable field, asymptotically? If they are not normalizable, they are not contributing to, I mean, it depends on whether they contribute to, if the action is infinite, then you cannot contribute. It doesn't keep a vanishing contribution. Well, you can pre-normalize the action as what we do in ADSF signal. You can add sources from the bottom. You can add sources from the bottom and that's a different observable, yeah. Yeah, so so here we are we have no uh additional sources at infinity, so that's what you're asking. Other questions, Gary?
