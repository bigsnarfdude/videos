Let me start with this motivation. So we have limited under despite kind of the many genetic discoveries we identified in GWAS, we have limited understanding of the context of a genome by phenotype association, like when, timing, and where the context, the genetic variants had the strongest effect. And we know, for example, that many human uh diseases are age related and so many genetic associations are also age dependent. Associations are also age-dependent. The other aspect is that there are gene-by-environment interactions. We know from modern organisms that they have to be very common, but they are difficult to identify in human studies. And so all these kind of underlying kind of context dependencies and interactions, they lead to heterogeneity of genetic effects across different parts of the phenobike distribution. Parts of the phenobike distribution. And so, a quantite regression model allows us to basically identify these genetic variants that have heterogeneous effects across different parts of the distribution of those different fungus. So, you know, in one approach that's Approach that's commonly used to identify variants that might be involved in gene by environment interactions is this variance QTL type of method. And so the idea is basically that you have this example here where you have this variance QTL. If you look at the mean effect, there is no effect. Effect, there is no effect of this QTL on the mean trait value. But then when you look at, you know, there is an effect on the variance, and what happens is that there is underlying, you have three different environments, the red, blue, and green, and the effect differs depending on the environment. And so you can detect this type of effect using You can detect this type of effect using a variance-based method, but not using some kind of the mean-based regression and using GWAS. And so, quantum regression is trying to basically go beyond this variance of facts and kind of is a generalization of these variance-based tests. So, I'm going to talk about two parts. One is about using quanta regression for Using quanta regression for genetic discoveries, the second part is about phenotype prediction. Right, so in GUS we pretty much use this simple mean-based model. So we model the conditional mean of y given the genotypes and covariates. And if there is no effect on the mean, this is taken to imply that there is no effect whatsoever of this genetic variant. Whatsoever of this genetic variant was a trait. And so I just mentioned this, you know, alternative variance-based tests where you can detect effects on phenotypic variants. After all, these tests are commonly used to follow up gene by environmental proaction studies. So quantoregression is a is a type of methodology that was introduced in epollometrics many years ago. Um, many years ago. And it basically extends linear regression by looking at associations at different quantile levels, right? So instead of testing for association with a conditional mean of white, we test for association with different quantum solar. So these are kind of some examples of distribution of But distributional differences you could have between genotype groups. And so the first column corresponds to this location shift model. So if you have two genotype groups, there is a difference in means here. If you look at the quantile effects, if you look at the quantile specific effect, it doesn't vary across quantum. So this is where the linear regression mean. You know, the linear regression mean-based model is optimal. The second column corresponds to a scale shift model, so you have a difference between the groups, only the variance, not with the means. And you can see that the quantal treatment, like the quanta-specific effect for the variant, varies across quanta levels. And in particular, right here in the median, it's zero, so the It's zero, so you cannot detect this type of detect with a linear regression approach. And then the third one is location and scale shift. They have differences between the two groups, both in mean and variance. And then you can see again that there is heterogeneity cross-quantal. And you know so bottom line is that quantum regression will be most power more powerful than linear regression is this kind of Or was the linear regression in these kind of areas where you have the same effect equals quantum levels? Right, so this is a kind of a basic introduction to the quanta regression. So as I mentioned, you model now the conditional quantum of y or given genotype and covariance as a linear function of genotype and covariance. Of chemotherapy covariates, and what changes now is that these coefficients are dependent on the quantile level tau. They can vary across quantals. And you can estimate these coefficients by minimizing this loss function, which in quanta regression is basically called the inboard loss function, it has this form. form and you can write this optimization problem as a linear program and use methods like interior point methods to solve it. So this is sort of more explicitly what that optimization problem looks like. For example, when you look at median regression, so when tau is 0.5, you're trying to minimize this expected absolute deviation. Absolute deviation criterion. And then, you know, for any quantile level tau, you have a weighted combination of this. You minimize this weighted combination of absolute devices. So just for estimation, you can do hypothesis testing. And one possible test is this quantile rank score test. Quantile rank score test, and test at any fixed quantile level tau you can test as a beta tau is equal to zero. And then the good thing about this test is actually that it's distribution free in the sense that the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic doesn't depend on the particle distribution of the phenotype. So you know you don't need to actually transform your phenotype and worry about what What the effect of the transformation has on type 1 and power. So if you analyze quantitative traits and biomarkers, very useful feature. And it's also a ranked score test. It's very fast. Now, so this testing is done at different content levels. So now we're going to consider. Levels, so now we're going to consider a grid of quantile levels between 0 and 1, and then you can combine these in different ways. So, what we did with Auschi combination method to combine correlated values. So, there's, you know, the main, I don't know how many of you actually are familiar with quantum regression, but the main challenge. The main challenge is applying this type of techniques to bug and scale data is that they are very computational intensive. So what we've been working on is basically techniques to make them applicable to large-scale studies and also when you have correlated individuals, like related individuals. And a post-doc of mine is here, Fan Wang, so you should talk about this part tomorrow. So we should talk about this part tomorrow, how to biogression is related to cycles. So this is an application to UK Biobank, so we looked at a number of continuous traits. So what's shown here is to each of these parts corresponds to one trait. So we have the green part. So we have the green part is the common the loss sites that are discovered by both linear and one directression, because there is a large overda. Blue part is what is discovered just by linear regression, but means by one dire regression. And then the red part is what is what is discovered only by one regression. So you can see that in this you know, in the equivalent and got this straight but linear regression isn't it more powerful? Isn't it more powerful? But yeah, so maybe you know, looking back as much as most of the third genius, as I said, out there. So you can then, as I said, you can, one thing you can do, like one of the reasons for this underlying heterogeneity VC is maybe due to interactions that we don't model, for example, gene environmental interactions. Model, for example, gene by environment disruption. So, we actually did some small follow-up gene-by-environment testing of those variants that we identify in quanta regression using a small number of environmental variables like sex, age, physical activity, pedentary behavior, and smoking. And we identify a number of significant interactions, especially with sex and age. So let me just show a more specific example of this interaction. So this is an interaction between age and genotype for this plate called platelet distribution waste. So this same variant was detected to have a dominant effect in paper from Benyon's group where they left where Group where they left, where they did some scans for dominance effects in UK violence. Right, so this is the result on the left. We have the results of this logos for quanta regression and linear regression. So you can see on the top strong signal for quanta regression, which is missed by linear regression. When you look on survival, what happens? When you look on the right, what happens, so this is on the right is basically the estimated effect across different quantiles. And you can see there is substantial heterogeneity, and in particular here in the middle, kind of it's median, there is basically no effect of the variant quantum phenomena. So that's the reason we miss it using linear regression. So that's an example where quantum regression actually detects something new beyond linear regression. But as I said, there is a lot of overlap with linear regression, so you can actually, even for those associations that are identified by linear regression, as well as this example, both PCSK9 and LDL, we can still look at the heterogeneity. Look at the heterogeneity of effect across one halogo, and you can see in particular for this variant that there is a productive effect, and the productive effect is more pronounced as you go towards the upper panels. So, where when the LPL is kind of into higher 1 mass. So, that's kind of the first part on genetic discovery. The second Genetic discovery. The second part is on polygenic risk for prediction. So I want to kind of mention what briefly what counteraggression can contribute to this prediction problem. So in PRS, in usual PRS analysis, we aim to predict the conditional mean of y given gene. So in other words, we want to write them to basically given a particular genotype profile gene. Genotype profile gene, we want to predict what is a typical outcome for an individual with a genotype profile. And so what quantion allows you to do is basically allows you to generalize this genotype prediction to the entire distribution. So now for any quantile level tau, I can predict the close quantile of y given g, right? So I can predict basically the entirety of my distribution. Argential type distribution. And so, you know, the PRS, in the PRS construction, right, you have this, you know, linear predictor, terminal predictor of the trait. And we can do something similar at each quantum tau, we can basically have this similar linear predictor. And so, this, what this allows us basically is to estimate the Basically, just estimate prediction intervals, right? So you can look at low quantity levels, equal to 0, 5, and the high quantity level, and then have an interval. And so the idea is that, you know, right, so I think this is kind of related to some words that was mentioned is, you know, yesterday, I think. Lastly, I think from Bogdan Pasani's group where they looked at uncertainty quantification for TRS. So the whole goal of this is basically we want to identify individuals that are in a high-risk group. And so instead of just basing it on the point estimate, we want to take a separate Estimate, we want to take concept quantum. So quantum regression is actually quite well can naturally basically produce this prediction infragas. Right, so that study from you know Ding and Dao they showed. They showed that once you take an subject into account, very few individuals are actually in the high-risk group. And so I think one reason for that result, which I think is conservative, is that the type of confidence interval or prediction interval that you get from these conventional methods tend to be symmetric. Symmetric, and they also tend to be of similar lengths across individuals. So, you know, it's examples for BMI actually. It's not the right approach. So, I'll talk about these different category risk categories, but there is a category called certain above team, like kind of, you know, the certain high-risk individuals. And this sort of conventional method didn't assign any individuals that high-risk food. Individuals is at high-risk food. So, let me just explain what that risk ratification is, right? So, we have this prediction of the phenotypes at different quantals, tau1 to tau n. And let's say we have a high-risk threshold T. So, we're going to divide individuals into first two groups, high-risk and low-risk. And within each group, we're going to further assign them to. Going to further assign them to like certain above t, which means that all predictive phenotypic quantiles are above t. Uncertain above t means that the median is above t, but not all quantiles are above t, and the same for the low-risk group. So you have a certain below t, where all predicted phenotypic quantiles are below t and then uncertain below t, the median is below t, but not all quantiles are below t. This is an example of that. So these are four separate individuals. So for each individual, I basically get these predictions of the phenotypes and different quantas. And so the first individual is in this certain about p group because all the quantas are above this apparent threshold. The second individual, if you look at the median, Median, the median is above the high risk threshold, but then you have some quantum that are below. And then this is for the low risk group, so you have similar partition, right? So you have this individual is certainly below T, because all quantiles, but the quantals are below T. And for this guy, you don't know the median is below T, but then um you know some of the quantals are about that that um highly threshold. the highest threshold. And so if you use this prediction interval from quanta regression and you're doing this partition of individuals into the four risk groups, what we see is that we can, first of all, compared with the conventional approach based on linear regression, we can identify a meaningful number of individuals. A meaningful number of individuals in this high-risk group. The other thing that you can see is that those intervals in the top, they are actually asymmetric and they are of varying lengths. So even for individuals that have similar PRS at the median, like or the mid-base PRS the same, their intervals can be quite different. And we can discuss why that happens. Where that happens. And so, right, so when we look at kind of like numerical results, you know, based on assigning individuals in these high-risk groups or low-risk group. So, this is for our method based on the quanta regression prediction in her balance. This is for the linear regression approach. You can see that if you just look at See that if you just look at how it's first row, there that we still like, you know, there is a lot of uncertainty only like a small number of percentage of the individual pass that high risk threshold, like you know, being assigned to this certain above t. But you know, it's better than the linear regression-based approach. Similarly, for the certain below t, we assign a much higher proportion of individual in that category compared with the compression. So conventional approach. So this is sort of across 55 traits. Yeah, so it's kind of the percentage of individuals that are assigned to the different risk groups. So you can see that kind of in the middle there is a lot of uncertainty rates, so a large proportion of individuals cannot be assigned to either. Cannot be assigned to these are certain below key, certain about key, like the blue stream. But can we cover more individuals in these extreme categories by having this prediction interval as comparison? And then you can do I mean you can kind of make this uh restratification even more um more generous. More general, so you can what you can do is basically you can compute these same probabilities, right? What is probability that the values about certain spectrum because we have the whole distribution, right? And so depending on the study, you can prioritize like with the cost-benefit of the particular study you're interested in. You can basically have this parent or ski and Basically, have these parameters T and epsilon as tuning parameters and identifying the virus you want to kind of prioritize for interventions based on these properties. So, just to conclude, so quanta regression can be used both for genetic discovery and phenotype prediction. It can be a It can be a very useful tool for biomarker data and molecular phenotype data. And I think it can provide more realistic prediction info bias and so it can help with prioritization of different vehicles into the middle of the case.
