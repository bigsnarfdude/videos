So our next speaker, or I should say it gives me no pleasure to introduce our next speaker, because she's going to talk about how we made mistakes, something with Adriana, but she left, you see. So it gives me great pleasure to introduce Elise and she'll be talking about stuff. Thank you for the introduction and thank you to all three of you for the organization of the conference. I'm very happy to be here. And I'm very happy to ask you this question. Can quasi-static evolutions of perfect plasticity be derived from brittle domain evolutions? So I'm first going to introduce briefly the general context of brittle damage. After that, I will try After that, I will try to convince you that this question is of interest by explaining an analysis that has been made in the static setting. And then, finally, we'll try to investigate the unfortunate question. Okay. Where is it's the watermelon? It's the bottom arrow. What? The lower arrow. Lower? The bottom. No, no, it doesn't work. Both arrows don't work? Or maybe you should do it here. Oh, sure, sure. Okay. So, um okay, so in written image, uh you consider an elastic material whose reference configuration is uh omega. Configuration is OMIA, not the bounded set of RN, and you make the assumption that the material can exist only into two states, a state of weak material, which is damaged, and a state of sound material, which is undamaged. And of course, the elasticity properties of the weak and strong zones are ordered, and they are represented by the hook nodes, so fourth-order symmetric tensors, which satisfy. Symmetric tensors, which satisfy this inequality in terms of quadratic forms acting on symmetric matrices of order n. Okay, since your material exists only in two states, it's natural to consider, for instance, the characteristic function of the damaged zones. Okay, and so this is seen as an internal variable for this damaged phenomena. And thanks to chi, you can express the hook law. you can express the hook law of the whole material like this, so chi times the elasticity of the weak zone plus y minus chi times elasticity of the strong zone. Okay, and then you apply a vector field displacement U to your elastic material so that the deformed material you obtain is identity plus u of R. And in this talk we follow a model introduced by Fran√ßois and Margot which consists in defining In defining the total energy associated to such a couple mu and pi as a sum of two competitive terms. So here you have the elastic energy stored in the medium. E of u is the linearized elastic strain, so it's a three-tribute of u. And here you have a dissipative term which analyzes the existence of the width zone by paying its volume, the integral of chi, times gamma, which is. Times kettle, which is the toughness of the matrix. It's a positive power rate. Okay, so this is the typical energy in bridge open age. The next thing I'm going to explain you is an analysis that was led by the organizers of the conference in the static setting where they sorry, oh it works, where they um modified a bit these brittle uh damage energies by adding a parameter epsilon epsilon that goes to zero. That goes to zero. And by doing so, they are forcing the elasticity properties of the weak zone to degenerate. So to do so, they multiply the hookloop of the weak zone by epsilon. And they force the weak zones to concentrate onto vanishingly small sets by dividing the definitions by epsilon. So for sequences u epsidine, calexide and Sequences u epsilon, chi epsilon with uniformly bounded energies, of course you must have that chi epsilon convert is strongly to zero if you want. Okay, so we're in a static setting here. There is no evolution in it. And what they've shown is that this family of brittle damage energies can converge to an energy of perfect plasticity. Hanky perfect plasticity because we're in a static setting. So this energy It associates to displacement U, which has a bounded deformation, to ten terms in competition again. So here you have the elastic energy stored in the medium. And again, here a dissipative term. So maybe just a word. So this is a convex conjugate of the indicator function of some explicitly defined convex set. It's a set of plasticity. And I do not detail it. I do not detect its expression, but it's explicitly given with the hash and strickman bound. Okay, and of course I forget to say that to write this we used an additive decomposition of the symmetric gradient of U, decomposing it as the sum of a part which accounts for the reversible part. Reversible part of the damage, so the elastic part. So this is the elastic strain, and here it accounts for the part of the damage which is permanent, irreversible. So this is a plastic strain. Okay, so actually problems of the material mechanics are rather described through evolution processes. For instance, the simplest setting is one of quasi-static evolution. Is one of quasi-static evolution where you assume that the loading is slow enough so that you can neglect inertia. And so we can naturally ask the same question. We can try to do the same analysis, but in a quadrastatic setting. So the idea, or if you're related, is the following. Can we take existing results of quasi-static evolution of brittle dimension? I will explain. Of brittle damage, I will explain the result of Honfo and Gavin in just after. Can we take the result and couple it with the same, with the scaling law of Babagerian and Origin Laura I introduced before? And what happens when we go, when we let epsilon goes to zero? Do we recover what is static evolution of perfect plasticity as defined in the paper of that method? Okay, so before to couple the two, let me just explain. Explain how the proof of this quasi-static brittle image evolution is obtained. Okay, so in quasi-static evolution, it's classical to consider subdivision of your time interval. And since all time your moral trial seeks to reach an equilibrium state, it seeks to minimize. Equilibrium state, it seeks to minimize a given energy. So the idea is to look at time-parametrized minimization problems. But you want these minimization problems to be linked because you want to take into account the history of the loading, the irreversible character of the damage. The history of the damage. Okay, so let's start with the completely sound material. Sound material, and at the initial time, the energy they want to minimize is the same I introduced in the first slide: brittle energy. So you look at all possible brittle configurations of the material between the phases which are weak and strong. This is the initial time. And it's quite easy when you fix U or minimize first with respect to chi, actually the chi Actually, the chi disappears and you recover a density, but this one is not convex. So you must relax your energy. And by doing so, you have to compute the symmetric quasi-convex envelope of your density. And this makes use of the hash-inch treatment now. Actually, when you relax your energy, you are acknowledging the sets of competitors. You're not considering only materials which are purely internal. Which are purely in two states, but you are allowing to consider any fine mixtures contained with the weak and strong material. So now characteristic functions become volume fractions. So theta here is the volume fraction of sound material. It can take any values between 0 and 1. So you lose track of the brutal character of the dimension. Brital character of the damage, but it's really the relaxation of the brittle damage model. Okay, so this is relaxed energy, so you recover minimizers, so the displacement, the volume fraction of sound material, and the elasticity of the homogeneous material you obtain at the initial time. Okay, and then you want to iterate. That you want to take into account, as I said, the human To take into account, as I say, the history of the damage. So at time tiers 1, what happens is that you have already damaged this fraction of this bottom fraction of your material at the previous time. So you pay that, and what you want to minimize is transitory energy between time ti and ti plus 1. So here you do not have the strong phase anymore because what you have at Because what you have at your disposal is the material at time ti. So you are mixing the width zone and the elasticity of the material you had at the previous time. And here, you do not damage what is already damaged. So you damage only what remains to be damaged. So you multiply chi, where you put damage, by the volume fraction of what remains of sound material. Again, you Again, this is not convex, so you need to relax the energy. It makes use of the Hashen-Strickman bound. E-recovery minimizes a displacement, a volume fraction of some material, and the elasticity of the homogenized material. And by doing so in this procedure, you ensure that the volume fraction of some material is decreasing and the elasticities as well. The elasticities as well. And after the idea is just to let the time step go to zero and use the monotonicity actually of your functions to use Pelley's theorem so you have the right compactness results and you obtain for the static evolution of Blue Village. Okay, so the volume fraction of some material and the elasticity are not decreasing in time and this is Are non-decreasing in time, and this is the elastic energy storing the material plus a disinvictive cost for having damaged this proportion of the material. Okay, so the idea is to couple the result, Fontalangalni's result, with the scaling law of Babaji, Ion and Lo Linga. So we apply their result to for each epsilon, but for the weak hook low, method. Cook low multiplied by epsilon, and for the toughness divided by epsilon. So you have a sequence of a family of quasi-static bridge of the matrix functions. Okay, so I wanted to study this in the lectorial setting, actually. I failed, because the computation of the hash in Strickman bound is something where we lack explicit formulas. Whereas in the one-dimensional set, Whereas in the one-dimensional setting, you know explicitly how to define it. So this slide is reformulating what I said, but in the one-dimensional setting. Okay, so just summary. So now the reference configuration of your material is an interval. The hooklows are scalars, and you apply Frankfurt-Gaboni's theorem to this setting. I didn't mention it, but it I didn't mention it, but it allows to take into account directly boundary conditions. So we give us, we want to do something to our material. There is no volume force load, but there is a directly boundary condition. Okay, so we have for O epsilon this ritual dimension. Here, as I said, since we're in the one-dimensional setting, we know explicitly how to write the elasticity in terms of the volume fraction of some. Terms of the volume fraction of sound and dimension material. Okay, this evolution satisfies these items. So at each time your displacement satisfies exactly the prescribed deviary condition. At each time the current state of the microstructure of your evolution is satisfies with one-sided minimality. This says that the energy This says that the energy here is the smallest compared to all energies where you perturb a bit of the state with adding damage. So for all displacements and all volume fraction theta of what you will damage, this energy is smaller than. And of course there is the energy balance which tells you. There is the energy balance, which tells you that the energy at time t, which is the elastic energy, plus the dissipative cost for having the MHPS proportion, must be equal to the inertial energy plus the work of the force. Okay, so now what we want to do is make epsilon goes to zero, find the right compactness results, and in that identify what will play the role of the plastic strain and elastic. And elastic strain, but at the scale epsilon. To do so, a main use of the wind-serving minimality, where you set brutality zero, tells you actually that the stress at k epsilon here is satisfying this minimality, so it is constant in space. Okay, so actually this is due to the 1D setting, okay? The stress is a function homogeneous in space. Homogeneous in space. And in particular, since you know how to express the inverse of the stiffness, you get this additive decomposition for the derivative of the displacement. And so we see naturally here a suggestion for what plays the role of the elastic and plastic strain at scale epsilon. Because here you have what contributes Contributes for the elastic proportion, the strong proportion of material, and here you have the volume fraction of weak material. Okay, but actually this use of the one-second minimality is very naive. What it tells you is that, uh, since we're in the one-dimensional setting, it is uh not just to any irreversibility on theta? Yes, it's decreasing, sorry. Yes, it's decreasing, sorry. It's the result of the actually here I we just take the existence result of the bridge of the magic pollution. Okay. I have done nothing for now. Okay. Yeah. So actually one thing in minimality, since in 1D you can commute the infinite over theta and the integral, it tells you that the density interval, it tells you that the elastic density here must be equal almost everywhere to this minimization formula. And here you recognize, again, because we're in dimension one, the Hatching-frequent bound, which is the convex envelope, because we're in dimension one, of this density here, which is the minimum between two quadratic forms, quadratic functions. Forms, quadratic functions, but one is translated vertically. Okay, what we win in dimension one is that we can explicitly compute the convex sample of this function. So that this equality gives us some information we are able to use in the one-dimensional setting. Okay, and you can actually also prove that you have plenty of uniform bounds with respect to the dimension. Bounds with respect to epsilon and time. So the energies are bounded, the stress are bounded, and the displacements are bounded. And okay, so in particular, that will lead us to the right compactness results, because when you look at the energy balance, the first thing we get is that these radomages, which are non-negative, they are uniformly bounded. And they're also increasing in time because theta is decreasing in time. So you see that you will be able to apply Henry's theorem here. And since these mergers are bounded, in particular you get that the volume fraction of sound material must converge strongly to 1 in L1 for all exact, when exactly goes to 0 for all time. Okay. And the second ingredient is to The second ingredient is to link the uniform bounding N infinity of 0t of your stress, which is homogeneous in space, together with, I don't give much ideas, but together with the information we get with this equality. And thanks to these two ingredients, we can show that there exists a subsequence in x ion which is independent of time, and among which, for all time, you have the following convergences. The following convergences. So, for all time, the stress at scale epsilon converges to a limit stress, and we can show that this limit stress indeed believes in a convex set of plasticity, which is infinite here. So, A0 is A weak. It's a weak material. Elasticity is a weak material. Okay, and as I say, thanks to Hedy, you can also show that these tunnel mergers, weakly start converging on Converge on the segments zero L, the boundary included, to a non-decreasing and non-negative limit measure, mu. And actually, thanks to these two items, you deduce the three following. Because you have this writing on the plastic strain at sk epsilon. Sigma epsilon converges and is a homogeneous in space. You have reconvergence of nu epsilon. So you have reconvergence to what we Convergence to what we identify as the plastic strain. And here you have a strong convergence in L2 of the elastic strains to the limit elastic strain. And, and this one is interesting, you also have a convergence of the derivatives in space of the displacements, and because you know that each one of these two paths to the limit, and this convergence is for all. And this convergence is for all t along the same subsequence in epsilon. This is strong because even though you have a uniform bound in Vv for your displacements, if you had only this information, that only gives you that at all time, you can exhibit a sub-sequence in sign that depends on the time for which you have compactness. But when you, since we know that, actually, we can prove that we have the convergence along the same sub-sequence in exile. So, okay, we So, okay, we identify all our good candidates. So, why do I say that they are good candidates? I make no proof, I'm sorry. But what's very strong with these candidates is that even though we do not know if it's quadrastatic plasticity or not yet, we can already say that all these functions are absolutely continuous at the time interval. And actually, it's usually something. And actually, it's usually something you get once you know the type of your evolution, because you have an energy balance. Okay, so they are very nice. And they satisfy these five items. So the additive decomposition, as I said, this is what we can interpret as the relaxed clear boundary condition. The trace is not continuous for a weak start convergence. A weak convergence will be D, so your limit displacement might Your limit displacement might not satisfy the different condition you prescribed. So, P, the plastic strain on the boundary, is somehow measuring, analyzing how far your limit displacement is from your direct position. You have the constitutive equation, this is directly the consequence of the definition of the elastic strain. You have the equilibrium equation because sigma is how much. Because sigma is homogeneous in space, as I've already said, that we can prove that sigma is in the fact K, convex K, the segment K. So in order to show that this is a quasi-static plastic evolution, the only thing that remains to be proved is this energy balance. So here you have the elastic energy at time T and here you have the cumulative, dissipative Dissipative cost due to the damage induced since the initial time. And so you want this energy to be equal to the elastic initial energy plus the work of the force. Okay. Actually, what we get is that thanks to these two items, we always have this inequality. So I think you are very interested. I think you are very enthusiastic. Do you say that, okay, since we also have the hint of the static analysis, we believe that the reverse inequality is also true. Okay, so let's try to show it. And for this, let's reformulate what this energy balance is equivalent to. So everyone is absolutely continuous, so we can really prove that, and I do not prove it, but we can prove that the energy balance That we can prove that the energy balance is equivalent to the flow rule, which says, in particular, that whenever the stress doesn't saturate the constraint, and it's strictly in the convex, then the plastic strain must be constant. Okay. And actually, we can say that the flow is equivalent to this situation. So let me explain it. You define independently of the rest, you define. independently of the rest to define T0 which is the maximal time before which mu is zero. Mu I recall is a non-decreasing non-negative Reynolds. So before T0 it's always zero and so the plasticity is always zero and after T0 it's new in strictly qualities. Okay so this is outside of the equivalence. This is the definition Of the equivalence, this is the definition, what you can prove is that at T0, sigma must saturate the constraint. Okay, so these are facts. And now, what we say is that the flow rule is equivalent to the fact that sigma must saturate the constraint until the end of the timing travel. So, why is this so? Okay, let's assume. Assume, okay, so, sorry, this is a sufficient condition. I do not detail it, it's not the difficult part. Why is it necessary? So, assume by contradiction that there is a time, a subsequent time, for which sigma doesn't saturate the constraint. Sigma is continuous, even absolutely continuous, so you can consider the largest, the maximal time interval on which it doesn't saturate the constraint here. Here. Okay, what you can also prove is that as long as sigma doesn't saturate the constraint, whenever sigma doesn't saturate the constraint, actually the measure of mu is constant in time. This is something we can prove. Okay, so it means that on this interval, sigma never saturates the constraints. Saturates the constraint is actually if it continues, but because it starts from a state where it's indeed saturated constraint, it means that you must have a set of times here which is non-negligible and on which the derivative in time of sigma is non-zero. Otherwise, sigma would be constant and that wouldn't be possible. So, okay, but altogether, during this time interval, new is During this time interval, is constant. So, on this subset of times where the derivative of sigma is non-zero, you get that the derivative of p, which is sigma dot mu, is also non-zero. But you are not saturating the constraint. So, this equality cannot be true. Okay, so this is a necessary condition. So, actually, okay, the energy balance is equivalent to this situation, but I'm not satisfied. Situation, but I'm not satisfied yet because this condition is not expressed in terms of data of the problem. So maybe it's always true. I don't know. Actually, I do not prove it, but we can reformulate once more this sufficient and necessary notation and prove that the energy balance is equivalent to this situation, which is expressed only in terms of the data of the problem, the DLQ condition and the data. Okay, so what is this? Okay, so what is this condition? I made a draw rather than a formulation or formula. This means that as long as this function remains below a given constant, well it's absolutely completely free. But as soon as it's uh strictly uh it's strictly greater than this constant, then it has no choice. It must be increasing in non-decreasing in time. Non-decreasing in time. So these are the admissible Dirac Le-Manner conditions. We are disappointed because of course we have examples of such good Diracle Mandarin conditions, but we also have counterexamples for which we know that the energy balance is never satisfied. So the evolution, the quasi-static evolution we get is not one of perfect plasticity. Okay, but maybe it's because Okay, but maybe it's because we didn't understood well the limit evolution, the limit model. Actually, when you change your point of view and you read the evolution with this variable as internal variable, which we can interpret as the inverse of the effective rigidity, what you got is the system of correlations. So, first you have the constituency equation. Constituent P equation. This is just the additive decomposition expressing the definitions of the strain, elastic strain and the plastic strain. Okay, and you have a graphic strength evolution though, which says you that whenever sigma doesn't saturate the constraint, well, the inverse effective rigidity must be constant in time. Okay, so actually, we can interpret this more like This is more like a damaged evolution, resistive damage evolution. And when we have a good dynamic condition, actually, it's just a particular case of damaged evolution, quasi-static evolution. So to conclude, we can see this study maybe as an illustration of how sometimes how that can be the interplay between. How that can be the interplay between time evolutions, even in the quasi-static setting, which is the simplest one, and relaxation and homogeneization. Thank you very much. So we have plenty of time for questions, but I should be at that. So I have two questions. One is about what you said at the beginning that since you don't have a stream bounds you go to the one-dimensional model. So it's really that, or because we use much more than that of the one-dimensional structure, for instance, it's called stress. You don't have it if you have. If you have loads instead of boundary conditions, so first we tried I tried with loads and actually I couldn't even get a uniform balance on the energy. Because also in 1D also with loads you have explicit expression, but you don't have constant stress. Yeah. So I do not know how to deal with loads, only loads. Deal with loads, volume loads. But actually, when you do not have an explicit link between the homogenized elasticity and the volume fraction of stone or the rich material, I wasn't able to prove that the limit of those stresses is in the right convex set. That might be because in higher gases. Be because in higher dimensions. I'm just saying that. There's no uniqueness of the microstructure. There's no uniqueness of the stress. Although you get the same energy, you get different stresses. But that's the reason why I'm asking the one-dimensional. No, because in that case we have a one-time stress. It's different but it's just it's not as ni as nice as uh the case of battery location, but uh you have an uh integrity that you have to So it's probably true, no matter what. No, so in 1D you still solve the equations and you find an expression for the stress and the strain in terms of the rolling. You have a formula for the damage as in the case of CMD. Before going to the Sorry. I think the first step is loads in one D. You don't sort of whether you have a content sample because that the problem is kind of actually honestly I didn't try to add a load source. Okay. Because since I'm filling the vector setting, I need to think so. Because I think that the higher dimensional case is really. Case is tricky because you never have an explicit formula. But in 1D, you don't have as nice as the boundary condition, but at least you have some sort of a formula for. Because not having the actual statement in principle, uh I mean if you are able to to prove something that is not related with the explicit formula you have or with the explicit thesis. the S is constant, then maybe you can go also with the general you can prove that the stress is is constant in in this case. In a higher dimension. Not even in the case of loads. But yes, but in the one-dimensional setting you would have explicit uh expression I guess. I also think if you can I asked something if you can hear me. Of course you can, whoever you are. And I was going to ask about the structure of the Mega Mu. Do you know anything about that? I mean, is it? I'm guessing it's pretty wild in general, because it's more constructed. But like where the plastic screen actually lives in response is the question is about the dynamics? No, but the infrastructure of new. So the infrastructure was asking the question. So the question was asking the question. I didn't understand your question, but check it out. Go ahead, Tom. So, yeah, basically, so on this library, you've got mu and p, and they're related to each other. So, do you know anything about where they live? Where they live. You said you have to worry about whether they live on the boundary, but do you know if they are like point measures? Are they atomistic? Are they diffuse? I mean, that's a good question. I don't know. They live until the boundary, that's for sure, because you know that the mass at the boundary is given by the The distance between you and the genetic condition. And you know that it's also there is something in the open interval because there you can link it to the derivative of the displacement. Because here you have d of u. Uh but no, I do not know about the structure, I didn't look for it. Uh I I don't know if it's continuous measure uh or an atomistic one. Or an atomistic one. You have information, for instance, you know that but as long as sigma doesn't saturate the constraint, which is an open set. Yeah, it's zero. But uh so it's concentrated on the set of points. Yeah, but you meant in, I think you meant in space. No, you meant in yeah, because it could be like a horrible canto measure, right? It could be in space, I've been to the wrong side, so in space I do not. Um in space I do not know about the structure. Okay. In time, yes, we can say that there is a threshold uh before which you are completely uh zero and after that you are increasing in time and non-negative positive. But I didn't look at the spatial nature of temperature. I don't know. Yeah. Okay. Any more questions? Yeah, go ahead. So your result that brittle damage results in sorry, brittle fracture or whatever you call it in the microscopic level goes to a damage evolution and not plasticity. That seems reasonable to me. Reems reasonable to me. One reason that if it was otherwise, one of the things is with the plasticity model, however what you did, plasticity models can produce internal stress without loads. This is a fundamental separation between fracture, damage, and plasticity. Whereas damage or a fracture model will never do that. Will never do that. Unless you, if you don't put loads, it cannot produce stress in your body. So, you said this cannot be bitterage? No, I'm saying what you have makes more sense to me. Than a plastic evolution? Yeah, than a plastic evolution, because this is probably true, right? Certainly, if it were fractures, fractures. If it were fractures and you don't load it, it's not going to produce stress. Yeah, but damage is not only for fract. I mean it's larger than fracture. Yes, but it's damaging the elastic modules. Right? Damage corresponds to you're doing something to the elastic modules. And whether you're doing it in a diffuse way or not, that's the difference between fracture and damage. Such a model. Such a model, you know, if you don't put loads, you're not going to generate stress. Whereas in a plasticity model, without loads also, you can, depending upon your plastic distortion distribution, you can always have internal stress. So that's a very fundamental way of distinguishing between damage fracture and if I had to guess even with what TT I don't know with what I think in the interest of time we should postpone any further discussions. Thank you, Alice. Then the next talk.
