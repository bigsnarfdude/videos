Welcome to this second session of topological complex function planning. The first speaker this morning is Mark Grant, who is going to talk about relative and equivariant homologic dimensions. Mark, when you want. Okay, thank you very much for the introduction. Okay, thank you very much for the introduction and thank you for the organisers for giving me the chance to talk here. Is it all working okay? Can you see the screen and hear me? Yes. Okay, wonderful. So this is going to be a kind of mostly a survey talk on notions of relative and equivariant kermological dimension and comparisons between them. And the very last part will be. And the very last part will be reporting on joint work in progress with colleagues in Aberdeen, Ehud Meir and Irakli Pachkouria. I'm a late adopter of this technology, so my handwriting is also a work in progress. I apologise for that, but I hope you'll be able to discern what I'm saying and interrupt me if not. So the first part is essentially a history lesson about relative group colonology. Group cohomology. And the setup is: we're going to have a discrete group G with a subgroup H. And we want to define the relative group cohomology, and it will have coefficients in, say, a G module. Okay. Perhaps it's to do with the connection. Can you hear me okay now? Yes, yeah. Yeah, when Jose was doing the introduction, it was coming in and out. So, well, okay, ask me to repeat if you missed something. So I'm going to assume that we're familiar with the ordinary group columnology and just dive right in. I'm not really going to give definitions here. I'm just going to kind of give a bird's eye view. Kind of give a bird's eye view of what's gone on. So going way back to the 50s, Maurice Alslander in his thesis and also William Massey in his problems list of problems to do with fibre bundles defined the relative group homology of the pair. Of the pair algebraically using an algebraic mapping cylinder construction. So essentially, you take resolutions of the trivial module over the groups G and H, and there's a map between them, and you take an algebraic mapping cylinder. Massey laid down the challenge to sort of Down the challenge to sort of prove results about this relative group chromology analogous to the ordinary group chromology. And this challenge was taken up by Takasu in a pair of papers also from the 50s who defined, well, he defined relative homology and proved various things about relative homology and cohomology, one of which was that this algebraic definition Agrees up to isomorphism with a topological definition. So you can find classifying spaces for H and G such that BH is a subcomplex of BG and take the associated local system and then you get, well, Takasu relative cohomology is the singular cohomology of the pair. Singular cohomology of the pair. Now, also in 1954, Adamson defined a different type of relative group comology. And luckily, he used a different notation. Sort of looks like the notation for the index, and it does have. For the index, and it does have to do with that in some sense. So he looked at a particular resolution built out of the coset space G mod H. And well, it's kind of built analogously to the standard bar resolution for the group G, but just using the coset. So it's a resolution of G modules built out of G modules built out of these coset spaces, which isn't necessarily a group, but it's a G set. And then a couple years later, Hockshield and others gave an interpretation. Of Adamson cohomology of the pair as a relative X group. So I'll just write some notation and then tell you what it means. You, what it means. So we know that the ordinary group cohomology can be defined using homological algebra in the category of G modules. You take a projective resolution of Z and you map it into your coefficient module and take cohomology. So in the relative setting, what you do is you replace the notion of projective module with those G modules which are relatively G modules which are relatively projective relative to H, which means that not that maps out of them lift through any epimorphism, but maps out of them lift through any H split epimorphism. So you replace epimorphisms in the definition of projective with G module maps, which are which split when considered as H module maps. And then you take And then you take relative projective resolutions, which have an extra condition that they split into short exact sequences when you restrict to H modules, when you restrict the action to H. So there's this whole theory of relative homological algebra, which I won't say anything more on for the moment. And then a decade or so later, for unrelated reasons. For unrelated reasons, Glenn Bradon revolutionized equivariant topology by considering an equivariant cohomology theory with coefficients in modules over the orbit category. So he defines modules over the orbit category. OG. So this is the category whose objects are like G orbits, orbits for the G action. So homogeneous spaces G mod H, where H is a subgroup of G. And the maps in this category are just G equivariant maps between such orbits. And a module over the orbit category or a module over a category might. Category or a module over a category more generally is a functor from that category into abelian groups. I'll be talking about contravariant functors, so write modules here, not that it really matters. But the thing to observe is that modules over a category generalize ordinary G modules because you can view a group G as a category with one object. And then a G module is just a functor from that category into a group. From that category into abelian groups. So he defined these modules over the orbit category in order to define a notion of equivariant cohomology of a G space. And then in the ensuing decades, various people, I'm going to mention Tom Deek and Wolfgang Luke. Notice that this definition of modules over the orbit category can be generalized to modules over restricted orbit categories where you take just the orbits with isotropy in a given family. So if we take curly F, a family of subgroups of Of G, and by family here, we mean it's going to be a non-empty collection of subgroups, which is closed under taking subgroups and conjugation. So we can consider Using modules over the orbit category OFG, where now I take as objects G mod H, where H is in the family F. And then we can define the Bradon cohomology of the group G relative to the family F with coefficients in a module over this. With coefficients in a module over this orbit category. The thing is, modules over a category enjoy much of the nice properties of ordinary modules. They form an abelian category with enough projectives. So you can do homological algebra, you can take projective resolutions and so on. So I can write here X over the orbit category. And then I've got like a constant. And then I've got like a constant functor, which takes the value z on every orbit, which plays the role of the trivial G module. And I'm telling you this because if you have a fixed subgroup H of your group G and you let curly H be the family generated by that subgroup, which it contains. Which it contains H and everything else it must contain. So, in other words, it contains every subgroup of G which is contained in a conjugate of H then we can interpret the Bradon cohomology of the. Homology of the group G relative to this family generated by H as another as a third type of relative group chromology. Okay, so the upshot of that is that we have three types of relative group chromology. Relative group harmology, and we also have two three types of or three definitions of relative chromological dimension. So for each of these definitions, the Takasu, the Adamson, and the Bradon, we can take, define the chromological dimension to be the largest k such that if I replace this star with a k, there is some module of coefficients for which this cohomology group is non-vanishing. So I won't write that. All these definitions. All these definitions, but suffice to say that we have three notions: the Takasu relative dimension, the Adamson relative dimension, and the Bradon dimension. Dimension. And as we shall see, the Adamson and the Bradon dimensions are closely related. Whereas the Takasu and Adamson dimensions are apparently Unrelated unrelated although work is ongoing to compare the two. In fact, the first line of the MapSignet review of Tikasu's 59 paper, the reviewer says this theory is apparently unrelated to the relative homological algebra of modules due to Adamson and Hochschield. Modules due to Adamson and Hopshield. So back then, it wasn't believed that they were related, and still it's kind of hard to see how they're related. So why should we care about this? So the next section is motivation, perhaps for this crowd. I mean, there are applications of relative group collomology in algebraic number theory and in the theory of hyperbolic three-manifolds, but I know nothing about these things. Manifolds. I know nothing about these things, so I'm going to kind of come at this from the viewpoint of numerical invariance of Lustenick-Schneerman type, such as topological complexity. So one of the motivating problems in the field, which was stated by Michael Faber in a survey article near to the conception of this topic, was to describe the topological complexity of a description. The topological complexity of a discrete group, which is defined to be the topological complexity of a classifying space of that group, so a connected complex with pi one equal to g and higher homotopy groups, all trivial, completely algebraically. So, this is well defined because, given a group G, B G is unique up to homotopy type, and so. And so perhaps there are algebraic invariants of the group which can be used to describe this topological invariant of the classifying space. And since we know, although I'm not sure it's been mentioned at this conference yet, that topological complexity is bounded above and below by Lustinich-Schneerman category. We have algebraic bounds for this given by the coherent dimension of G and the cohomological dimension of G times G. Because, well, if you define the Lustenick-Schnerman category of G to be the Lusternik-Schnermann category of the classifying space, then results due to Eilenberg, Guinea, Stallings, Swan, and Dronishnikov, Rudyak say that the category Say that the category of G is always equal to its homological dimension. Okay, but examples show that it can be equality, either of these bounds can be an equality. And then progress on this general question was made a few years back by Farber, myself, Greg Lupton. Myself, Greta Lupton, and John O'Prea. I'm writing here the publication dates, so I don't have to worry about when these things were first done. If you let curly D be the family of subgroups of G times G generated by the diagonal subgroup, then we have bound. Then we have bounds for Tc of G. An upper bound is given by the Bradon relative dimension of the pair, G cross G relative to the diagonal. And there's also a lower bound which I'll write as C D of the inclusion of the trivial family into D. G times g and what this is is the largest k such that there's some non-trivial class in Bradon chromology in degree k which restricts to non-trivially interordinary group cohomology of G times G. So it's kind of like a relative relative dimension, if you wish, or it's rather the image of relative in absolute cohomology. Cohomology and the dimension of that. But we weren't able to prove that this upper bound is an equality. And well, nor that the lower bound is. But following on from this work, Wojcik Karaskel Vera and Espinosa Barrow published 2022 generalized the methods in that paper from topological complexity. Topological complexity of groups, which can be thought of as the sectional category of the diagonal inclusion to the sectional category of an arbitrary subgroup inclusion. So, I mean, if you have a subgroup H of G, you get a covering space BH of BG. BH of BG corresponding to this inclusion, you can ask about the sectional category of that covering. And those authors also kind of speculated or asked about the relationship between Tc of G and the Adamson dimension of the pair G cross G relative to its diagonal. Cross G relative to its diagonal subgroup. I should mention that when you generalize this problem of trying to characterize TC of G to trying to characterize sectional category of a subgroup inclusion, then you can find examples where each of these bounds, the upper bound coming from the Bradon dimension and the lower bound coming from the image of the Bradon comogy, are a strict. Are strict. So if you generalize from the diagonal subgroup to arbitrary subgroups, you don't expect either of these bounds to be equality. But I mean, all of this points to a kind of general question, which is that is Tc of groups some form of relative cohomological dimension? Of the pair, we actually can see fairly easily that it's not the Tecasu dimension because the Tecasu dimension is usually the same as the dimension of G times G. We don't know that it's not either the Adamson or the Bradon dimension. Okay, maybe I should pause. Okay, maybe I should pause and ask if there are any questions at this point, and if you can still hear me okay. Okay, good. So the other motivation for wanting to compare these different versions of relative C D comes from the theory of equivariant group homology. Hermology. So here the setup is G is still a discrete group, but it is acted on by another group, gamma. And I'll call that a gamma group. So you can think of like a homomorphism from gamma into the automorphism group of G. We want to define equivariant group homology. So, what are the coefficients? You take a gamma equivariant G module. So, M is a G module, but it's also a gamma module. And the gamma action has to interact with the gamma action on G. So, I won't write down the obvious equation, but you quickly. But you quickly realize that this is the same thing as a module over the semi-direct product of G acted on by gamma. Or rather, the authors of the paper I'm just about to cite quickly realized. And I'm very happy that one of these authors introduced my talk. So in 2002, Segara, Cafinez, Otega defined the equivariant group homology. Well, they gave several equivalent definitions, and one of which is the Takasu comology of the pair consisting of the semi-direct. Consisting of the semi-direct product with the base copy of gamma. And they succeeded in showing that improving results about this. For example, the second equivariant group, Kermar G, classifies gamma equivariant extensions of G by M. And then a few years later, Inasaribzi, Sarizzi decided that he wanted something which classified gamma split, gamma equivariant extensions. So he said, in that case, we should define it to be the Adamson cohomology of the same pair. And then, much later still, still not quite published. We said, why not go the whole hog and consider the Radon dimension. So let me let curly G be the family generated by the base of the semi-direct product. And take as coefficients a module over the corresponding orbit category and then define the equivariant group Comology with coefficients in that module to be the Bradon Comology of the semi-direct product relative to the family generated. Product relative to the family generated by the base. And our main motivation for doing that was to prove a kind of equivariant Eilenberg-Ghanea result. So if you define in a suitable way the equivariant Lustenik-Snierman category of the gamma group G, and that takes a little bit of thought because sort of a random B. A random BG won't admit a nice action of gamma, and you kind of want the gamma fixed points or well, the various fixed points subcomplexes of the BG to be classifying spaces for the various fixed subgroups. But if you define this correctly, then it's just equal to the Bradon dimension of the pair. Don dimension of the pair. So, I mean, it's observing that the techniques in the Faber-Grant-Lupton-O-Preyer paper give actually an exact equality with chromological dimension in this setup. Okay, so all of which is to say that there are three definitions of equivalent. Equivariant C D the Takasu dimension of the pair, which is the original one, the Adamson dimension of the pair, which is innocuridzis, and then the Bradon dimension. And the authors of the original papers weren't really focusing on the cohomological dimension. So it might be interesting to see how these different dimensions compare. And just to tie these two things back together, notice that the diagonal map for a group G admits a retraction. Admits a retraction. Well, it admits several possible retractions. But I mean, if I look at projection onto the second factor, this is a retraction of the diagonal map, and its kernel is the inclusion of the first factor. I'm going to say G1 and G2. Whenever you have Whenever you have an extension of groups which splits like this, then this is isomorphic to a semi-direct product. And in this case, the action here is given by conjugation of G on itself. And I say this to emphasize that the relative chromological dimensions you might consider in relation to T C of groups are actually equivariant chromological dimensions with respect to this action of G on itself by conjugation. So, for example, Adamson dimension of this pair is the Is the Adamson dimension of this pair, where here we have the inclusion of the base of the semi-direct product. Okay, so what can we say in general about the comparison of these different dimensions? Different dimensions. So, general inequalities. So, it's a proposition which I think was first proved by Britainousinkis, and then in the finite case. In the finite case by Pamuk and Yalcin. That the Adamson cohology of a general pair with coefficients in a G module M is isomorphic. Is isomorphic to the Bradon cohomology relative to the family of subgroups of G generated by H with coefficients in a module, a Bridon module, which I'll denote like this, where the value of this on a coset space G mod K Coset space G mod K, where K is in the family, is just the K fixed submodule of M. So there is a functor from G modules to OH G modules called the fixed point functor. And that's what this is doing. It's also a form of co-induction. Which might be helpful to know because that makes it into a right adjoint where we're co-inducing along a functor between orbit categories from the trivial family to the family generated by H. But the point is that the Adamson cohomology is a special case of the Bradon cohomology where we take coefficients in co-induced Bradon modules and as a Modules. And as a corollary of that, the Adamson dimension is always less than or equal to the Bradon dimension. Because we're simply allowing ourselves more general coefficients when we look at Bradon module coefficients. Okay, so what about the relationship between Adamson and Tecasu? Well, Adamson himself proved that if the subgroup H is normal in G, then the Adamson comology Just agrees with the ordinary group homology of the quotient group. But here now I need a module over the quotient, so and this was a G module, so I take the H fixed submodule. And as a crollery of this, we can produce. We can produce examples where the Adamson dimension exceeds the Tecasu dimension. In fact, if ever G has finite chromological dimension and H is a normal subgroup of G of finite index, then we have that the That the Tecasu dimension is strictly smaller than the Adamson dimension. And the proof of that is just observing that because of this previous proposition, the Adamson dimension is at least as big as the chromological dimension of the quotient group. Because if you take an arbitrary module over the quotient and then regard it as a G module, then the H fixed submodule will just be the module you started with. So you'll get something in, if you add something in the cohomology of the quotient, you'll get something in the same degree in the Adamson cohomology. But for a finite group, we know that the chromological dimension is always infinite. On the other hand, if the chromological dimension of G is finite, then the relative Then the relative to Casu dimension of the pair will also be finite because of the fact that we have a long exact sequence where I'll suppress the coefficients, but containing the relative groups along with the absolute groups for g and h. And if these both vanish above a fixed dimension, then so must this. Okay, and on the other hand, so there are examples where Takasu is strictly less than Adamson. Adamson. But on the other hand, there are examples where Tecasu dimension is strictly larger than even the Bradon dimension, which is at least as big as the Adamson dimension. As the Adamson dimension. But note that in this corollary here, where we assumed G had finite C D and H was a finite index normal subgroup, we definitely don't have a retraction from G onto H. If we did, then G would be isomorphic to a semi-direct product of H acting on G mod H, and in particular. H and in particular, G would contain G mod H as a subgroup and therefore have torsion and would have infinite C D. So we can still ask, and I think this is an interesting problem, if the subgroup inclusion of H and G is a split monomorphism, so it has a retraction, is the Tecasu dimension always? Takasu dimension always greater than or equal to the well the Bradon dimension or the Adamson dimension. Because in the examples I'm going to look at now, which come from Equivalent. Which comes from equivariant group homology. Well, at least when the group G is free, we can see that this is always the case. So I speculate that with this extra splitting assumption, there may be a general inequality like this. Now, I should mention here, although in the interest of time, I won't write it, that some authors from the part of the world Authors from the part of the world where you are, Arthinega, Navares, Cisneros, Molina, and Saldania, have studied a comparison map from Adamson to Tecasu cohomology and it gave necessary and sufficient conditions for this map to induce an isomorphism. But they don't work under this splitting assumption, and they're not really interested in this chromological dimension, just whether a certain map induces an isomorphism. Certain map induces an isomorphism. Okay, so now I come to the next part, which is equivariant cohomology of free groups. And I have to write a bit quicker because I think I've only got about 10 minutes left. So it's well. So it's a well-known theorem due to Stallings and Swan from the 60s that a group has chromological dimension one if and only if it's free. We gave a generalization of this to the setting of gamma groups. Setting of gamma groups. So if G is a gamma group, and for this part of the talk, I will assume that gamma is always a finite group, then the equivariant homological dimension Alabradon is equal to one if and only if, well, the group G is free. Well, the group G is free and it has a free basis permuted by gamma. So you have a generating set which is permuted by the action of the group. So I mean a non-example here would be if you take an infinite cyclic group acted on by cyclic group of order two by By just the sine representation. In fact, in this case, the equivariant C D will be infinite. Okay, and our working result, because we haven't written down the full details of the proof, is under the same assumptions. Under the same assumptions, the characterization of Takasu equivariant dimension one is that G is free with basis A Basis a free gamma set. The point is that for gamma groups, there are two competing definitions of what it means to be a gamma-free gamma group. So we think of like free groups as being left adjoint to a forgetful functor, to sets. And there are two forgetful functors. And there are two forgetful functors here. If you have a gamma group, you can forget that you're a gamma group, forget that you're a group and take the underlying gamma set, or you can forget that you're a gamma group and take the underlying set. And both of these forgetful functors have left adjoints for which you get the corresponding notion of free. And these are detected by these equivariant cohomological dimensions. Chromological dimensions. So the proof of this second result is kind of similar to the proof of the first result, but it uses in an essential way a result due to Alonso. I should credit Kevin Lee, who hopefully is in the audience, or I can't see who's in the online audience, who pointed out this paper to us. So the Takasu dimension is one if and only if the large group acts what Appalonzo calls zero unfreely on a tree with vertex stabilizers. Vertex stabilizers in the family generated by gamma, which I was calling curly G. What does zero and freely mean? It means free on the complement of the vertices. So free away from the So, free away from the zero skeleton. Alonso actually proved something much more general, which characterizes relative C D N as acting zero and freely on an n-dimensional acyclic complex, the stabilizers in the smaller group. And this gives plenty of examples where the Bradon dimension. The Bradon dimension is strictly smaller than the Takasu dimension. Because, for example, if we take trivial actions on a free group, this will equal one and this. And this will not equal one because, in particular, there isn't a free basis, but I think it will actually equal infinity in this case. Right, I'm going to have to skip some stuff, but I mean, the The real interesting examples, I think, are examples where the Adamson equivariant dimension is strictly smaller than the Bradon dimension. Now, I was going to write a sequence of lemmas here, but Here, but I'm probably not going to have time now to write them out. But let me just say the main ingredient here is the well, the two main ingredients are an algebraic lemma, which says that for a finite group gamma, a map of gamma modules. A map of gamma modules splits if and only if it splits as a map of p modules for all p subgroups of gamma. Of gamma. And then the other main ingredient, so that's used to compare the kind of Adamson dimension with the Broudon dimension, together with the previous results I just mentioned. And then the other main result is a proposition of Leary and Nasinkis. So if you ever want weird examples of groups, you kind of always reach for the best Vena Brady. Always reach for the Bestwiena-Brady construction. And that does it for us here. So they prove that if L is a finite flag complex with an action of gamma, so let me say finite gamma flag complex. And HL is the associated Westwina-Brady group. Then for every k subgroup of gamma, if the k fixed points of L are empty, then the first cohomology of k with coefficients in this group, so this is non-abelian cohomology now, is non-trivial. And if the k-fixed points are non-empty, then the same thing is trivial. The non-abelian cohomology is actually detecting subgroups of the semi-direct product which are not conjugate into the base, so are not in the family that we're interested in. And then the examples come from considering not just finite, but actually discrete flag complexes, because there's no Because there's no requirement that L be connected here in this result. So if you take five points with an action of the cyclic group of order six with an orbit of length three and an orbit of length two, so that there are C three fixed points and C two fixed points, but no C6 fixed points, then the Bradon dimension. Bradon dimension of the Bespina Brady group acted on by C6 is greater than one, but the Adamson dimension is equal to one. So just to conclude, I mean, here we have finite groups and kind of the methods, which I didn't have time to fully explain, are kind of transfer arguments. New kind of transfer arguments. It would be interesting to know if you can get examples of this phenomenon with a torsion-free group G acting on itself by conjugation. So whether the Adamson can be smaller than the Bradon dimension in that case. I'm sorry for going two minutes over. I'll stop there. Thank you. Thank you very much for your Thank you very much for your talk, Mark. So, are there any questions? Comments, suggestions? Okay, I have a question, Mark. From the three kind of comological dimensions that you have explained, you have a special preference. You have a special preference from one of them. I mean, are there anyone which is more compatible or are they difficult on the same? I think that the one that you were involved in defining is probably the most computable because it fits into a long exact sequence. A long exact sequence with the kind of ordinary group homologies of the two groups. On the other hand, this Bradon dimension, this Bradon equivariant homological dimension, it kind of captures exactly the equivariant category of the group. So, in some sense, it seems sort of closer to the topology. To the topology or the kind of topology that we're interested in studying. So these kind of Lustenichnum and categorical invariants. And with regards to the question of Tc of a group, I mean the Takasu dimension, as I said, is not equal to the Tc of the group, because it's usually equal to the coherent dimension of G times G. Yeah, the Adamson may be smaller than the Bradon. So maybe, I mean, I guess it's not known whether the Adamson dimension is an upper bound for Tc of the group, but I mean, it may be a possibly a better conjecture would, well, I'm not going to say that, but the Adamson is less than or equal to the Bradon, so perhaps 15. If Tc is not equal to the Bradon dimension, then you could ask whether it could be equal to the Adamson dimension. So, yeah, I mean, none of these things are particularly computable. You have to work quite hard to get examples. But yeah. Okay, another question I have. You can set the question of the monoidal topological complexity. Monoidal topological complexity of a group. Have you thought about this? Because among CW complexes, I think it's well defined. In general, it's not a homotopy invariant, but among CW complex it is. So I think it has sense. Have you thought about it? Yeah, briefly. I mean, I was kind of thinking that, so certainly. So, certainly the cup length of the pair x cross x relative to the diagonal of x is a lower bound for the monoidal topological complexity of x. Right? Well, that's true. I mean, in order for that to be anything useful, you have to use twisted coefficients. And then, like, how does anyone compute cut products in relative cohomology with twisted coefficients? But, I mean, perhaps. But I mean, perhaps for a group, the Tecasu dimension of the group of G times G relative to the diagonal could be a lower bound for the monoidal TC of the group. That's just pure speculation at this stage. And then you might say, well, maybe you can find an example where this Takasu dimension, now that I say this, it sounds like nonsense. Say this, it sounds like nonsense. Ah, yeah, okay. I did figure out that that was nonsense. Um, but I mean, you could try and find. I mean, I don't believe that this Ivase-Sakai conjecture is true, so I'm more on the lookout for counterexamples. Um, but it's it, I think I convinced myself that you can find counterexamples among aspherical spaces, or at least so we know that if the T C The Tc of a space is at least as big as the dimension, then it satisfies the Avase-Sakai conjecture or something like that, maybe. I think I convinced myself that if you're going to find a counterexample, it would have to be a group G such that Tc of G is equal to the chromological dimension of G, but G is not abelian. Abelian, and I don't think we currently know any examples of such groups. So, where Tc is the smallest possible, but not because the group is abelian. So, yeah, I did think a bit about it in this context, but didn't get very far. But yeah, it's a good question. Okay, thank you. So, any other questions? No? So, let's thank the speaker. So let's thank the speaker.
