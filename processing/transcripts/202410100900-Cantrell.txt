Sorry, I'm not there in person, but thankfully everything is fine down this far south. So, this, as I said, this is about recent developments in the theory and application of the ideal free distribution. And this is going to, various things that I'm going to say are going to reflect or ping off of things that people have, I've heard people talk about already this week. Week. And I'm going to start with just sort of just a little bit recap about the ideal free distribution, how it came about. You're going to hear more about this, I think, in more detail from Adrian tomorrow. The ideal free distribution goes back to the work of Fretwell and Lucas in the journal Actobiotheoretica in 1969, and it grew out of observations they made about large raptor birds. They made about large raptor birds, which have among the strongest abilities among all species to sense the landscape they inhabit and to move freely within that landscape. And their notion is that when organisms can assess the environment perfectly, that is the ideal, and can move freely, they will distribute themselves so as to maximize reproductive fitness. What they describe is basically verbal ecological theory. And Chris, in collaboration with biologist Mishesh Kshatriya, who was a PhD student in biology at UM at the time, was among the first to formulate the ideal free distribution mathematically in a PDE context. And a key thing to remember here is that an ideal free distribution does not. That an ideal free distribution does not necessarily involve population dynamics. I'll come back to that point toward the end of the lecture. But what it does require is that fitness is equal throughout all occupied locales within a habitat. If not, some individual would move to improve fitness. This would allow individuals to exchange places, but no net movement. And so And so, if one takes population dynamics into consideration, the equal fitness should be zero. And this is a picture that indicates this. This is a picture of fish in an aquarium where they've got feeds of Daphnia coming in on one side and where it's being dropped in at a high rate on the other. High rate on the left-hand side, and a much lower rate on the right. And then the fish occupy themselves so they get the equal benefit on average here. And so, where I want to pick up in this particular story is where this whole notion that grew up. This whole notion that grew out of the similar work of Allen in 1983 about that when you were talking about, say, random dispersal, that the slower disperser is going to prevail, is that, and this goes up that this first part right here was work with Chris and Yuan, where found that medium level. Where we found that medium levels of invection up a resource gradient, combined with faster diffusion, can serve as a dispersal strategy that would exclude a purely random strategy with a slower rate of diffusion. But that if you pressed your luck, if the rate of infection is sufficiently large, a species utilizing this strategy concentrates so heavily at the most. Concentrates so heavily at the most favorable locations relative to resource availability that it creates a spatial segregation that can facilitate coexistence. And we call this phenomenon infection-mediated coexistence. So the idea to get something like an ideal free distribution, you're going to need something more than just advection of a resource gradient. And this was in the timeframe of something like 2003 to 2007 or so. And Chris's work on the idea of free distribution caught the attention of our colleague Don DeAngelis, which is always a nice thing to do. And then the three of us, along with Victor Perdron, published a paper in the Journal of Biological. The Journal of Biological Dynamics, in a patch model context, in both continuous and discrete time, in which we identify a modeling strategy wherein an equilibrium for the no-movement kinetic model can be viewed as an eigenfunction corresponding to a zero eigenvalue for the linear operator defining inner patch movement. That is, at the equilibrium, we've got no. That is at the equilibrium, we've got no net move, but and then we show that such strategies are, in fact, ESS, and that any strategy which is not such can be invaded. And this segues into the reduction principle, which we learned about somewhat later. And this is the statement from Lee Altenberg's well-known 2012 PNAS. 2012 PNAS paper where the spectral bound of a combination of a resolvent positive linear operator, the A in there, and an operator of multiplication V was been shown by Cato to be convex in B. And Cato's result is shown here to imply through an elementary dual convexity lemma. Convexity lemma that the spectral bound for a combination of them is also combination in the scalar on A, what I've called here a C, and that the partial derivative of the spectral bound with respect to C is less than S of A. Diffusions typically have S of A less than or equal to zero, meaning that Equal to zero, meaning that movement by itself does not create growth, so that for diffusions with spatially heterogeneous growth or decay rates, greater mixing reduces growth. Models of the evolution of dispersal in particular found this result when A is a Laplacian or second-order elliptic operator or a non-local diffusion operator, implying selection for reduced dispersal. These cases are shown here to be part of a Are shown here to be part of a single broadly general reduction phenomenon. Explicitly, he shows that for all fixed D greater than zero, then the spectral bound, we've got C plus D multiplying A and B multiplying V is either strictly less than the spectral bound when C multiplies A plus B multiplies V plus D times S of C. D times S of C A, or it's equal for all choices of D. If S of C A is less than or equal to zero, this first alternative is the reduction principle, and then the second one says that the rate of mixing doesn't matter. And so, for models of the form three here, u sub t is c times a u. is C times Au plus U times F of X U for appropriate dispersal operators and fitness operators V equals F of X U. The alternative of the reduction principle wherein greater mixing can be advantageous occurs if there is a U star greater than zero so that Au is equal to zero and F of X U star is equal to zero. And here the And here the equilibrium exactly matches the resource distribution, and there's no net movement. So that is, u star is an equilibrium of the equation ut equal uf of x u, and u star is an eigenfunction corresponding to zero for the dispersal operator A. And both of these, four and five, pertain. These four and five pertain in the 2000 paper for patch models in discrete or continuous time. More generally, both the ecological notion of ideal free distributions and notions borrowed from adaptive dynamics are important to understanding how movement that leads to an ideal free distribution equilibrium is evolutionary advantageous. Advantageous. But, and so this goes back to sort of what we understood around 2007 or so, but what we had not yet said is that under what conditions this condition A U star equal to zero is going to happen, we had seen that if We had seen that if you were just affecting up the gradient of a resource, then you could reverse the slower disperser winds, but if you magnify the advection enough, you're going to create a spatial segregation and create coexistence. So you get a, so that's not going to be the kind of thing that's going to give you. That's going to give you the kind of advantage that we were looking for. And so, what is the condition in terms of a PDE kind of model? And as I said here, the advice to all of my junior colleagues: always work with smart people if you can. So, in the reaction infection diffusion context. Diffusion context. Chris made the key observation that if you combine random movement and advection, not up the gradient of the resource, but up its logarithm, assuming, of course, that the resource is everywhere positive. And that's something I will comment on this afternoon. One gets an ideal free strategy. And moreover, in a paper in Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering, Chris, and you. Sciences and Engineering, Chris and Yuan, and I showed that such a strategy would exclude any non-ideal free strategy. However, in the patch context, Yuan noted that the condition for no-net movement is line-sum symmetry and that this is equivalent to a very powerful inequality that powers the analysis needed to get the evolutionary advantage. Moreover, the condition for ideal free. Moreover, the condition for ideal-free in the reaction at vection diffusion context can be viewed as line-sum symmetry in a generalized functional analytic setting of appropriate composition of dispersal and resource availability. So consequently, results from ecology, adaptive dynamics, and mathematics combine to show how dispersal that leads to matching resources at equilibrium can be selected. Can be selected robustly across a range of modeling contexts when the environment is spatially heterogeneous but temporally constant. And next, I just list here just a few examples. This is by no means comprehensive, just what I wrote down when I was putting together a talk. But some morals of this story are that the key The key commonality in all the frameworks is that it's evolutionarily advantageous to adopt a movement strategy that leads to stable equilibria that can be viewed as ideal free distributions, wherein reproductive fitness cannot be improved by net movement. Such an evolutionary advantage can be seen through competition between ecologically identical species differing only in dispersal. Differing only in dispersal strategy. Typically, here the equilibrium of the dominant competitor can be viewed as a positive eigenfunction of the linear dispersal operator corresponding to a zero eigenvalue and as an equilibrium at every point in the habitat of the corresponding kinetic equation. So this satisfies the second alternative, the reduction principle, and then the no-net movement. The no-net movement corresponds to a generalized line-sum symmetry property, which is equivalent mathematically to inequalities which facilitate the relevant invasibility analyses via monotone dynamical systems theory. In reaction infection diffusion models, which are spatially heterogeneous but temporally constant. Temporally constant, the cues that lead to no-net movement dispersal are purely local, even though the impact of no-net movement is at the scale of the entire habitat patch, so that there is scale transition. In the reaction infusion defection context, the conditional component of dispersal harkens to the Weber-Fechner law from psychophysics. This scale transition effect also can be seen. Effect also can be seen in some integral differential models. So that you only have to cue on local information to pick up this effect. However, in the recent examination of the integral difference case that Chris and Yingzhou at Lafayette College and myself, the only conditions we've been able to identify are non-local in nature. And our modeling can accommodate two C. Can accommodate two seasonal migration, which can be viewed as temporarily varying. So perhaps this is non-coincidental. I'll talk about this more in just a moment. So that's the story up through gives a fairly robust across a number of modeling frameworks that if you can go to a Go to a have an equilibrium that can be viewed as an ideal free distribution, then this is going to allow evolutionary advantage. And again, that you're bringing both ecology, adaptive dynamics, and math together and that this can be done across the whole range of modeling formats. Of modeling formats. Of course, there's a strong expectation that there's temporal as well as spatial heterogeneity in most ecological communities. But often it's going to be the case that we can view this temporal variation as seasonal, as in migration. And so we learned, I think, a lot from what we had done in the case where we had spatial heterogeneity. Where we had spatial heterogeneity, but temporally constant environments, but particularly since we got a robust answer across modeling formats. But we wanted to move on to having both explicit spatial and temporal heterogeneity in this problem. And as I said, in the case of integral difference models, Of integral difference models, we can incorporate discrete time migration models, which are implicitly temporarily different dependent. And the cases of ideal-free dispersal that we get require non-local information. And so the natural question is, can we extend the notion of ideal-free to seasonal continuous time models such as pyrebolic? Such as periodic parabolic logistic problems. So, first example, this was a paper that Chris and I had in 2018, where we, I'll describe it in one spatial dimension, where we're going to have a the Resource as both spatially and temporally varying and periodic in time. And then we want to then have m of x t in front of ux, and then we're going to have an invection. An advection term p of x t here, and then we want this to think of this on an interval subject to a no flux boundary condition. And we're going to require m to be positive, p and m to be smooth and t periodic in time. And we're going to want that then. That then the M to be a eigenfunction corresponding to a zero eigenvalue in terms of the dispersal. That's what's given in equation eight. And then we also need the M to meet the boundary conditions in order for this to work. Conditions in order for this to work. And so the point here is that can we pick a choice of P so that then we would get that M of X T matches U and where we have the no net movement that we need given by eight and nine. By eight and nine. And from equation eight, it is not too difficult to calculate that the candidate for the vection term that you need is given as in equation 10, where the integral of omega of x m t y t dy, that's the integral from 0 to x along the line. And so And so, what we see here is that this candidate is going to depend on non-local as well as local information about resource distribution. And it will satisfy the conditions so long as the integral over the entirety of the integral is going to be a constant. Is going to be a constant as a function of time, meaning that the total amount of resource in the habitat is constant. That's imaginable but restrictive. And notice here that if m sub t is identically zero, then this is exactly the same result that we had. That is, in vecting up the logarithm of the gradient of M. And this is, we did this. And this is, we did this in one space dimension at first, but we were able to extend it to higher space dimensions. But I did it, I told you about it in one space dimension just for hopefully make it a little clearer. So the previous example establishes that a meaningful but limited notion of ideal free dispersal in seasonal continuous time models, but one would want the notion to at least to hold. Notion to at least to hold for habitats where the total resource is periodic in time. And to this end, we worked with Adrian to examine how to extend the idea of individual fitness associated with a specific location in space to account for the full path that an individual takes in space and time over a periodic cycle. So, doing we So, doing, we can extend the mathematical formulation of ideal free distribution to general time periodic problems. We again found that populations using dispersal strategies that can produce a generalized ideal free distribution can exclude populations that do not. Moreover, this allows the total amount of resource to vary periodically in time. Again, ordered to really. Again, important to realize that non-local information over time is a key to achieving an ideal free dispersal mechanism. I want to mention that a related example in terms of this non-local information in time is in a paper that appeared in Theoretical Ecology in 2022 by Thegesson and Mazuran on free flows of optimal On free flows of optimal foragers. And in this paper, they are thinking in terms of differential gains of mean field types. And Adrian's going to be talking about our work towards doing that in terms of PDE models for dispersal evolution tomorrow, I think. So, and as the really great talk that Bill gave yesterday, this leads naturally to questions having to To questions having to do with cognition, perception, learning, and memory. And here I'll note just a few papers. I want to particularly commend Hound, this very nice, very paper about open problems and PDE models. It got the ultimate thing here, the ultimate Bill Fagan compliment of calling it a tome. Of calling it a tome. So, any rate, but now I'd like to, and then I think there's also this work of Fagan and Lewis here that I think Bill referred to yesterday. And what I'd like to take the last few minutes here to briefly speak about is some work that Chris and I have done very recently with Ying Zhou. Ying Zhou having to do with evolution of dispersal by memory and integral difference equation models. So let me go that. So the idea here, and this is sort of in some sense following up on Bill's suggestion about biological inspiration for mathematical work. So the key idea here is we're going to assume that members of a migratory population migrate according to a dispersal Migrate according to a dispersal kernel and then reproduce. In the next year, some fraction of the population starting in any given location uses the same dispersal kernel as in the previous year, but the remainder of the individuals all return to where they bred or were born. In a heterogeneous population that starts with, say, a uniform kernel, so that density on arrival is uniform, the environmental The environmental heterogeneity will cause more offspring to be produced in more favorable locations, leading to a non-uniform distribution. Then, in the next year, some fraction of the individuals remember where they were born and return there, leading to a kernel that is a multiple of a non-uniform distribution. The remainder use the same kernel that they used in the previous year. As the process continues from year to year, a large Used from year to year, a larger fraction of the population uses updated kernels, and this process leads to a fixed point where the dispersal kernel produces an ideal free distribution. So this is going to be using the mechanism of partial phylloprotein or site fidelity, where some fraction of individuals breeding are born at a given location, remember that location, and return in. That location and return in future years. And we put in a parameter, delta, that represents the fraction that does not learn from experience in a given year, and one minus delta, the fraction that does. And interpretation of delta is that when delta is large, the population tends to rely more on long-term memory of past migration patterns, while when it's small, it relies more on short-term memory. So let me illustrate. Term memory. So let me illustrate just a little bit. So this is, we did this in a number of situations, including migration and then where we had some stochastic variation. But this is in the, if we've got the case of a static environment, then we're going to track both the next generation of the population and of the dispersal kernel here where the Where the dispersal kernel is going to be delta times the kernel in the previous step, plus then a queuing off of a growth rate kind of term that's been normalized across the environment. And so we take this weighted mean of two components to produce the mean of two components to produce the new kernel and so um the the experience of population the risk recent time step is quantified in terms of population growth rescaled so that the resulting kernel can satisfy the the condition of uh not losing uh not increasing population that is that the the integral of the kernel is less than or equal to one and so um One. And so by quantifying the population's experience in such a way, we're using population growth to approximate the likelihood of individuals who are bred or born at a location to return to the same location to breed. And if greater reproductive success, and hence more population growth was experienced at location X in the recent past, more individuals are expected to return to. Individuals are expected to return to the same location the next time, vice versa. So we can think of the first term as how much of the population remembers and repeats the previous kernel, and the second term as how much of it it has learned from its previous success. And again, the parameters between zero and one. And so if we do it over t time steps, you get a decomposition of the kernel into. Composition of the kernel into components from different preceding time steps. And the terms represent from left to right, most distant memory to most recent experience. And so the decomposition shows how much the initial kernel and past experience are retained in each time step. So since delta is between zero and one, delta t decreases with time. For larger values, the decline is. For larger values, the decline is slower. Distant memory has relatively more influence than the kernel curve. So, larger delta corresponds to a population that considers a fair amount of their experiences from the distant past when deciding how to move, whereas smaller means the population assigns relatively more weight to recent experience and forgets distance experience more readily. We can also think of a larger delta as an indicator of structure. The larger delta is an indication of stronger long-term memory and smaller, more reliance on short-term memory. So, our numerical results suggest that in static environments, solutions to the system converge to an ideal free distribution at a rate which increases as delta decreases. Smaller delta meaning faster learning. And we can show analytically that this is asymptotically stable under appropriate relationship. Under appropriate relations between delta and the maximum of the partial of f with respect to n in that formula there. And so you should wrap up. Okay, okay. So let me go here. Okay, let's see if there's anything. So we get that this is, we get this analytic. Analytic stability here. And as I say, in all of these examples, we get that our numerical results will converge to an ideal free distribution. We can do this in terms of both models for migration, and then there's more to say. Then there's more to say, but I will stop here to wind up. Thank you very much. Thank you, Steve. So is there any question for our speaker? So, Steve, this is Alan. I've got a quick question, sort of a general one. When you talk about, from a biological standpoint, about the importance of non-local. The importance of non-local information. And this actually goes beyond what you talked about to other earlier things, that it seems that at times, and some of the matching of resources, that the idea was that individuals would have very good knowledge of the environment outside where they are and limited knowledge of where they are. Knowledge of where they are. So, I mean, how do individuals really have non-local information? And this is sort of like from a biological standpoint. What's going on there? And how would you incorporate limited views of non-local information in models eventually? Well, if you go back and look at what we did with Ying there, the non-local The non-local there would be comes in from the fact that you would, it would bring the integral of n, n would be divided by its integral. So that's not, and this is basically fundamentally a very good question in terms of to what extent do you have to be omniscient? Do you have to be omniscient to answer the, to be able to know what to do? And in the case where the environment is constant in time, it really is only, it is a scale transition kind of thing where you really are only picking up, you only really need to. Up, you only really need to know what you have there locally. And you do get this information globally, but that's there. The answer to some sense is that what you're sensing on is not the moving coordinate, is not the gradient of the resource, but the gradient of its logarithm so that you are. So that you are, what you're doing is causing you to move relatively more slowly when things are good and moving relatively faster when things are not so good. That's there. And then some of the things here that we got in the first paper with Chris. With Chris, you could require, it would work in situations where the, say, you had a good part of the habitat that would move sort of periodically back and forth in time so that it stayed constant. But it brings in, I mean, the. But it brings in, I mean, one of the challenging questions here is how you figure out exactly the fact that you're not necessarily going to know nothing, no one, knowing no organisms entirely omniscient here. So Chris may want to chime in. There's one more question from the audience. So you could incorporate. You could incorporate information, radius where you can get information. And Bill Fagan talked about that, where you have some sensory radius in which you can tell what's going on to some extent. But if you incorporate that in models, you probably won't be able to get good enough information to exactly achieve an ideal free distribution. However, you might be able to do better than you would if you moved randomly. So that's Random. So that information limitation can be incorporated by looking at sensory radius, integrating, etc. We work on white irises and never believes. They can approach the ideal free distribution through sampling. They sample different patches in daily foraging and they use Q for them. So it's very simple. So the incorporation of partial information, right? Of partial information from experiential learning. They can follow cues of where other waiting birds are going and they do their sampling. So, or after? Can you repeat that I did here? There's a question from the audience. Sorry. So, I see, thanks for your talk. This is also about these non-local conditions. It's about the
