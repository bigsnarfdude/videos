But please feel free to ask questions throughout or afterwards, or feel free to send me an email if there's further discussion. I would really like to engage as much as I can. So what I wanted to talk about today is two topics that have to do with guidance of cell migration. And one of them is at the collective level for cell clusters, and the other one is at the single cell level. And so the two types of guidance. And so the two types of guidances that I want to talk about are both mechanical, and one is cell guidance by gradients in substrate stiffness, that's known as durataxis, and the other type of guidance is by gradients in friction, and that's what we're calling friction taxis. All right, so let me start with the collective mode of cell guidance. And so, here what I want to show you is that clusters of cells, like the ones you see here, perform neurotaxis cohesively, and they can do it. Cohesively, and they can do it at an optimal speed by exploiting the physics of active wetting. So, by exploiting the properties, the wetting properties of these cells against a substrate. And so, this is actually work that is a collaboration between theory and experiments. And so, the experiments were done by Macia Pallares and supervised by Raymond Sonier in the lab of Xavier Trapat. And the theory was done by Ivina Pijoma and supervised by Jean-Macasadamunt and myself in Barcelona. Myself in Barcelona, you know, in the group in Barcelona, and myself in Dresden. So the story that I want to tell you starts with this experiment back in the year 2000, which was the first observation of durotaxis in single cells. And so this was in the group of Yuli Wang. And so they saw this cell that migrates from the soft side of the substrate here on the left to the stiff side of the substrate. Okay, so this was the first ever observation of durotaxis. Durotaxis. And after the initial excitement, actually, the excitement decayed a bit because it was clearly apparent that this type of single-cell durotaxis was rather inefficient compared to chemotaxis. But then the excitement came back a few years later when the collective type of durotaxis was discovered in the lab of Xavier Trapat. And so what they saw is a cell monolayer like the one you see here that spreads a One you see here that spreads asymmetrically and it spreads faster on the stiffer side of the substrate. And so, collectively, it performs durotaxis in a situation even when single cells wouldn't do it. So, this brought back the excitement and this type of collective durotaxis can now compete in efficiency with chemotaxis. The problem, though, is that what you saw is really asymmetric expansion of this monolayer rather than a cohesive translation of the entire. Than a cohesive translation of the entire tissue towards high stiffnesses. But it turns out that this type of cohesive motion towards stiffer areas is what's seen in vivo. And so this is work by Roberto Mayor and Adam Shallard. And what they were doing is to study a population of cells known as the neurocrest, which is involved in the development of frog embryos. And so what happens is that this population of cells starts at the back of the head of the embryo, and then it moves towards the front. Embryo and then it moves towards the front of the head to give rise to many of the cell populations that will build the skull and the face of the animal. And this motion is guided by a gradient in the stiffness of the underlying tissue, which is the head mesoderm. And that's what you see here in color. You see a map of the stiffness. And so here, what you see is essentially the motion of this population of cells from the back to the front. And now we know that this is guided durotactically. So the population. So, the population of cells avoids the eyeball. That's what's marked here with this E. And then, what they could also do was to take the narrow crest population ex vivo and take it, put it on substrates that they could pattern either with a uniform stiffness or with a stiffness gradient. And you can see that these clusters migrate only when they're plated on a gradient of substrate stiffness. Okay, so that's Durataxis X vivo now. And so, this is interesting because this time the Interesting because this time the migration of these clusters is coherent. The entire cluster moves towards stiffer substrates. And the clusters are 3D. They are no longer cell monolayers, but 3D. And so we started thinking about what would be the physical principles to understand this kind of cohesive and 3D migration of cell clusters guided by stiffness gradients. And so to address this question, the lab of Chavitrapat did the following experiment. We started from something simple in which We started from something simple in which we just plated clusters of cells on substrates of different stiffnesses. And so, what you see here is that on soft substrates on the left, the cluster remains rather spherical and it doesn't spread on the substrate, so it doesn't wet the substrate, we would say. Whereas as you go to higher stiffnesses, the clusters progressively spread more and more. And these ones on the right-hand side clearly spread as much as they can until they form a cell monolayer. Okay? Now you can. Now, you can quantify this in different ways. So, you can first visualize actin, and this gives rise to these 3D profiles that I was already showing at the beginning. You see the increasing spreading towards higher stiffnesses. You can also quantify the contact angle, and then you see that the contact angle decreases. Let me maybe minimize this, maybe like so. So, you can see that the contact angle decreases with increasing substrate stiffness. Okay, so now Okay, so now the question is: sorry, is that you know, the point is that in these experiments, they can also measure the traction forces that cells exert on the substrate. And these revealed two key pieces of information. Here, what we're doing is comparing the tractions exerted by a cluster on a soft substrate of one kilopascal versus a stiffer one of six kilopascals. And what you can see here is two things. First, that the forces on the stiffer substrate are Forces on the stiffer substrate are stronger, so there are higher attraction forces. And second, you can also see these vertical projections of the forces that are marked in red. And what I want to point out is that if you look at the edges of the cluster, there are vertical pointing forces that suggest to us that the cluster is exerting a surface tension that pulls at the edge of the cluster. And then the inner side of the cluster exerts a downward pushing force on the substrate. And to us, this was. The substrate. And to us, this was suggestive of the internal Laplace pressure that you would have in a fluid droplet because precisely of the surface tension. And so this is an image that suggests to us treating these as a liquid droplet, essentially. So that's two important pieces that will be key then for the modeling. What I want to show you next is what happens if you now put these clusters not in uniform stiffness, but in a gradient of stiffness. And what you see is Gradient of stiffness. And what you see is something like this, and this looks very noisy, but if you measure it on average, there's clear durotactic behavior. And so clusters move on average from the soft to the stiffer area of the substrate. And so you can quantify this motion. And here's the first surprise. If you quantify this motion, what you measure is the velocity along the gradient of these clusters, so from soft to stiff, and as a function of stiffness. And the surprise is that this is non-monotonic. Clusters move faster. Clusters move faster as they go to higher stiffnesses, but then they slow down. And so that's the first puzzle that we wanted to understand. And so we started from the theory that we had developed a few years ago for active wetting, for the wetting of active fluid droplets to model these tissues. And what we did was to generalize it to 3D. And so before we go to full 3D, let's start with the two-dimensional theory of active wetting that I actually developed during my PhD. And so it's based on a competition between And so it's based on a competition between two types of active forces: one that is the active traction forces that cells exert on the substrate to migrate, and the other one is what I call contractility, by which I mean cell-cell active forces. And so contractile stress is transmitted between cells through cell-cell junctions. And so the idea of the model is to treat just the basal monolayer of a whole cluster of cells and then include these different forces. And so the forces are then included. And so the forces are then included into a force balance that looks like this. On the left-hand side, what we have is internal forces in the cell monolayer that come from the divergence of a stress tensor. And then on the right-hand side, what we have is external forces that are exchanged between the cells and the substrate. And these come in two terms. One is friction proportional to the velocity V at which cells move on top of the substrate. So that's just passive friction of cells moving on the substrate. And then there's an active... And then there's an active traction force that is proportional to a polarity P. And the idea is that cells at the edge of the cell layer polarize outwards, and then they exert these polarized traction forces to migrate out. And this is what drives the spreading of the tissue. And so this is the first active forces that we encounter. Now, the other thing I have to do is to specify what is this internal stress tensor that has to do with transmission of forces across the cell layer. Transmission of forces across the cell layer. And so, for this, we also have a constitutive equation with two components, with two PCs. The first one is viscous stresses due to cell cell friction. And then the second one is the second active forces, which is this active contractility. And so these are forces that cells exert onto one another, generated by a myosin and transmitted through cell cell junctions. Okay. Now, because of this competition between the active traction that takes to make the Active traction that takes to make the tissue spread and the contractility which tends to make it retract, there's a two-dimensional wetting transition that distinguishes between spreading and retraction. And so now, if we want to understand how this might lead to durotaxis, what we have to do is to make some parameters depend on the stiffness of a substrate. And so what we did was to take the parameters that have to do with cell-substrate interactions, which are friction and active traction, and take them to depend. Distraction and take them to depend on the stiffness of the substrate. And so we took expressions that look like this, which essentially correspond to an increase of the forces with stiffness and then an eventual saturation. And so the plot would be something like this. So both friction and active traction first increase linearly and then eventually saturate with stiffness because cells cannot generate any amount of force, right? They only have a limited amount of force that they can generate. Of force that they can generate. All right, so with this, you can actually explain collective Durat axis, but not the coherent translation that we found in these experiments. And also, this is just 2D. And so to make it 3D, what we did was to just say that the top part of the cluster is passive, except that it provides surface tension. And so we added this vertical, you know, if you want, green arrows with a vertical component that depends on the contact angle. That depends on the contact angle of the tissue and accounts for surface tension. And so, if you do that, the prediction of the model, by the way, yeah, the way we include surface tension is just through a boundary condition in which we say that the stress at the edge of the cluster provided by the stress tensor that I defined before. So, this is the stress here at the contact line, has an in-plane contribution coming from the horizontal projection of. Horizontal projection of surface tension. Okay. And so this is essentially a generalization of the Young Dupre condition for wetting for this scenario of active wetting. All right. And so the predictions of this model then are the following. The question is, can we reproduce this non-monotonic behavior of durativexis as a function of stiffness? And so, yes, we can. But because this is a model, we can also understand it. And so that's what I wanted to guide you through. That's what I wanted to guide you through. So, what we have to do is to explain it in two steps. First, why does the duratactic velocity increase with stiffness first? And then, why does it decrease at higher stiffnesses? And so let's start here in the first region. So, the first thing that happens as you increase stiffness is that traction forces increase and they make the tissue spread. And so, as you move to higher stiffnesses, the tissue spreads higher, you know, farther. Higher and you know, farther and farther. And so, this means that because the tissue is more spread, there's a higher difference between the stiffness on one side and the stiffness on the other side of the tissue. And therefore, there's a higher difference in traction between the two edges of the tissue. And this difference in traction is the driving force for durotaxis. And so, because the driving force for durotaxis is bigger, then the speed of the rotaxis is also bigger. And so, that's what happens here on the initial increase of the The initial increase of the velocity with stiffness. Okay, now, why does it then decrease at higher stiffnesses? So, what about this second regime? And so, here it's actually the combination of two effects that account for this decrease in velocity at high stiffnesses. The first effect is that friction keeps increasing and it never ceases to increase. And so this slows down the tissue as you go to higher frictions, sorry, to higher stiffnesses. But there's a second effect, which is that tractions also. Which is the tractions also increase but saturate, right? Because cells eventually reach such high stiffnesses that they can no longer exert more attraction. And so at some point at high stiffnesses, you see that the tissue is very well spread, but the difference in traction between the two ends is now practically zero because the attractions have saturated. And so that's what then drives this decrease in velocity at high stiffnesses. And so this captures this first experimental observation. Now, there's a second. Now, there's a second key experimental observation that's quite surprising and that we don't know how to understand yet. And this comes in this plot. So what we're plotting here is the probability of finding a displacement of the cluster of a certain size over a window of 10 minutes. And so what you see is that this probability distribution decays exponentially at short displacements. And that's not surprising because it's what's known for single cells. What's known for single cells, and so somehow the cluster behaves as a persistent random walk for small displacements, as single cells do. But then the surprise is that there are these rare long hops that are not as rare as we would expect, right? So instead of keeping this exponential decrease of probability, you have this heavy tail that shows you that these very long displacements are more frequent than we would expect. And so if Expect. And so, if you look at the events that populate this heavy tail of the distribution, what you see is that they correspond to sudden detachments of cells. So, you see this cell that hangs onto the substrate, but eventually it gives in and it detaches, and this leads to a massive displacement of the cluster. And so, these kinds of events are what end up populating this heavy tail of the distribution. And so, what we think is that probably we need to use some model with stick-slip dynamics that accounts for this sudden detection. Dynamics that accounts for these sudden detachments to explain this heavy tail, but we haven't managed to do this yet. So that remains as an open question. Okay, so I just wanted to summarize this first part by saying that what we found is in in vitro experiments, coherent tissue durotaxis in which the entire cell cluster moves towards higher stiffnesses. And that we think that this can be explained from, you know, using ideas from wetting. And in particular, one feature that we could explain is this non-monotonic. Could explain is this non-monotonic dependence of the retaxis, the speed of the retaxis, with substrate stiffness. To do this, we develop this three-dimensional theory of active wetting that accounts for the shape of the cell cluster. And finally, there's this funny observation of these long hops that are more frequent than we would expect, and that they correspond to these sudden detachments. And how to explain this remains still as an open question. And I'm happy to hear your ideas if you have any. Okay. Any. Okay, so now what I want to do is to move on to another type of durotaxis that happens in cells that do not attach, that do not adhere to their substrate. And so this is what we're calling a vision-independent durotaxis. And what I want to show you is that actually what we think happens in this case is that cells follow gradients in friction, and that's what we're calling friction taxis. Okay? And so this was another collaboration between theory and experiment. So, this was another collaboration between theory and experiments. And so, this time, the experiments were done in the lab of Roberto Majior at UCL in London, and they were done by Adam Schellard and Kai Weisenbruk. And then, the theory we did together with Peter Hamscher, who is a PhD student in my group here at PKIS Interesting. So, the idea of what I told you so far for durotaxis in the presence of adhesion with a substrate is consistent with this idea here that cells Consistent with this idea here that cells at the edge of a cluster or even a single cell elongate and then they attach very strongly to the substrate through focal adhesions that allow them to exert traction forces. And in fact, focal adhesions were thought to be crucial for durataxis, not just because they allow cells to exert traction, but also because they are supposed to be the mechanosensors that allow cells to sense the stiffness of the substrate. And so, how would they even perform duratexis if they cannot sense? Perform durate is if they cannot sense the stiffness of the substrate, right? So that's precisely the notion that I want to challenge today: the fact that focal adhesions are necessary for direct axis. Now, if they are, if in the case of adhesion with the substrate, the picture that I presented you so far was something like this, in which cells at higher stiffness exert higher attraction, and therefore they can outcome, you know, they can out-compete the cells at lower stiffness. outcompete the cells at lower stiffnesses that exert lower tractions. And this produces collective durativexis. Now, what I want to show you today is what happens in the experiments that Adam did, in which he puts cells into channels. The channels are along the x-axis. They are very long. You don't see them, you know, you just see a section of them. And what you see here is a marker for cell substrate additions, for focal adhesions. Addisons for focal adhesions. And so these are in channels that were coated with fibronectin. And this is a protein of the extracellular matrix to which cells attach. And so what you see here is precisely the attachment points. And what you see on the bottom in blue is the nucleus of the cell. And so what then Adam did was to use the same channels, but now coat them with PEG instead of fibronectin. So polyethylene glycol. And in this case, what happens is that cells do not adhere to these channels. This is a non-adhesive coating. These channels. This is a non-adhesive coating. And so, what you see here on the right is precisely the point. You see nothing because there are no focal adhesions. And just to show you that the cell is still there, you still see the nucleus down below, but there's simply no signal for the focal adhesion staining. Now, despite there being no focal additions, these cells still migrate. They perform a type of migration known as amoeboid migration, which is very well known. And it happens without addition, and it's known to be fast. Adhesion, and it's known to be fast, faster than in the presence of adhesion, and based on BLETS as the main type of protrusion rather than lamellipothia. And so, we see both of these features in the experiments. In Adam's experiments, you see in the presence of PEG, so without adhesion, migration is faster than in the presence of fibronectin, and it becomes black-based instead of lamellipolium-based. And so, what is the mechanism for this type of amygdala migration? So, this was actually figured out. So, this was actually figured out a few years ago. And so, here I'm presenting just the key physical mechanism that was summarized in these reviews, for example. And so, the idea is that we consider first an unpolarized state of a cell in which the cortex, the cellular cortex, is distributed uniformly along the cell periphery. And so, now this cortex is a network of actomyosin, and myosin exerts contractile stresses on actin. And so, this contractile And so, this contractile, you know, this cortical network is actually a contractile active gel. And so, what can happen is that if the contractility is high enough, then the cortex experiences an instability whereby it accumulates on one side of the cell, something like this, and then this side is very contractile and it can pull material from the rest of the cortex and make it flow to the left. And now, this flow of the cortical material to the left generates a friction. Material to the left generates a friction against the substrate, and that friction then propels the cell forwards. Okay, it's a big like a tank thread. And so now, in this case, I showed, you know, I broke the symmetry in this way so that the cortex is accumulated on the left, and therefore the cell moves towards the right. But you can imagine that this can also happen in the opposite way, and then the cell would move to the left. And so, this is a classical scenario of a spontaneous symmetry breaking process. Okay, now, um Now, what I want to show you now is what happens if you now put cells that migrate through this mechanism in the presence of a substrate stiffness gradient. Would they perform durataxis? And so this is what Adam showed in his experiments. So here are cells that Adam puts in a channel with a uniform stiffness as a control. And what you can see here in these traces, color is time. And so what you see in these traces is the cell goes back and forth. Okay, you also see this in the chymograph down below. You also see this in the chymograph down below. The cell switches from going forwards to backwards, forwards, backwards. And this is consistent with this idea that there are two bistable states in the absence of any gradients. But then Adam creates channels with a stiffness gradient. And when he puts cells in those channels, then the cells just zip through and they hardly ever reverse. You see this very persistent time trace of the cell and also the chymograph, right? So we have statistics of that, and there's indeed Have statistics of that, and there's indeed much fewer traversals. And the cells move persistently up the stiffness gradient. And so, the question is: then, how do they do it, right? Because if they lack focal adhesions, how do they even know where to go, how to feel the stiffness? And so, what we thought is actually maybe they just don't feel the stiffness. What they feel instead is friction. And so, we came up with this idea of friction taxis, right? And so, let's now forget for a second about stiffness. Forget for a second about stiffness, and let's consider that cells migrate on a friction gradient. What would happen in this case? Well, what would happen is that the cortex is still a contractile material, and so it would tend to make the cell contract, but now the contraction is asymmetric, because the cell can contract faster here on soft, sorry, on lower friction than here on higher friction. And so, this region of the cell will contract faster and therefore. Contract faster and therefore cortical material will accumulate faster here on the left. And therefore, the cell now breaks symmetry always in the same way with the accumulation on the left side. And therefore, the cell migrates always up the friction gradient. And so this is friction taxis. And this is the key idea that we then want to test in the experiments. And so to try to see whether this idea makes sense, we have to somehow relate friction to stiffness. And so to do this, And so, to do this, what Adam did, yeah, and this would be an example of external symmetry breaking. It's clear, I think, from this picture. So, to try to, well, let me first, actually, let me first show you that friction taxis can also happen in a specific model, okay? Not just in this conceptual model that I was telling you about, but in a specific model, and then I'll show you what happens in the experiment. So, the model is actually something that we took from work from Piafa Shaw and collaborators back in 2013. And collaborators back in 2013. And it's based on modeling the cortex via two fields. One is the concentration field of myosin, shown in red, and then the other field is the velocity field of the cortex itself. And so then what they did was to write down equations. One of them is a force balance for the cortex. And what it includes is friction with the substrate. And so this is this viscous friction proportional to the velocity at which the cortex moves. velocity at which the cortex moves against the substrate and then internal forces generated inside the cell and in the same way as before they come from a stress tensor and so this stress tensor also has two contributions similar to before the first one is a viscous contribution because the cortex is a viscous material on the time scales of migration and then an active contribution that comes from the contractility and so this contribution is proportional to the concentration of myosin okay the more myosin Of myosin. Okay, the more myosin, the more contractile stress. And so now the other thing they need to specify is what happens to myosin. And so they assume that it's just transported over the timescales of cell motility. And so the idea is that it's advected by the flow of the cortex, and then it diffuses. And then we have to specify boundary conditions. And so the boundary conditions are at these edges of the cell that I'm calling L minus and L plus. These edges are mobile. These edges are mobile, so the cell can deform. And what we specify there is that there's no flux of myosin across the edges, so myosin doesn't escape. Then we also make the edges move at the same velocity as the cortex, like this. And then what we also specify is that there's a reference cell length, LR. And then if the two edges become more distant than the reference cell length, then there's a stress that tries to pull them back. And if they become closer than the reference... And if they become closer than the reference cell length, then there's a stress that pushes them farther away again. Okay, and so this is the model that we then used to interrogate this idea of friction taxis. And so what we can do first is simulate this model under a uniform friction condition. And so what happens in this case is that we start with this uniform concentration of myosin over the cell length. And then the cell initially contracts symmetrically. And then after a while, noise breaks symmetry and allows the cell. Breaks symmetry and allows the cell to polarize, generate this gradient in myosin concentration that drives forwards motion, in this case, towards the right. Okay. Now, in the other half of simulations that we performed, of course, something similar happened, but the noise led to a symmetry breaking in the opposite direction, and the cell ended up moving towards the left, okay? And that's 50-50. Now, the interesting thing is what happens now if we place a friction gradient like this. So, friction is higher on the right, and what happens in this case. On the right, and what happens in this case, and this is now a slowed-down simulation so that you can see what happens at the very beginning, is that the contraction is already asymmetric. And the region on lower friction contracts faster, as I was describing before, and so the symmetry is broken directly from the outset, even in the absence of noise, and you get this migration up the friction gradient, which is a demonstration numerically of friction taxis. Okay, so now what happens in the experiments? So, now what happens in the experiments? So, what happens in the experiments is that first we need to establish a relationship between friction and stiffness. And so, this was done through an experiment that Adam performed with a technique called lateral force microscopy. And so, the idea is that you take an AFM cantilever and you drag it along the substrate. And by dragging it along the substrate, you can measure the torsion of the cantilever. And from the torsion, you can measure a friction coefficient. And so, you can see here on And so you can see here in the middle that the friction coefficient that Adam measures increases with increasing stiffness of the substrate. And so this means that friction and stiffness are correlated. And whenever we have higher stiffness, we also have higher friction. And therefore, the idea that cells perform durataxis indirectly through friction makes sense. Now, we can also try to test friction taxis directly because we can engineer channels with different frictions. And so this is what I'm showing here. And so, this is what I'm showing here. We can coat the channel with PEG, and in this case, we have a certain friction coefficient as we had before. But now we can also coat it with a different substance, BSA, which is also non-adhesive for the cells, but it just provides a different friction coefficient. And so when you mix these two substances, you can generate channels with a friction gradient. And here's what happens. If you mix the two substances uniformly, then you have a uniform friction. And then what happens to the cells is that they undergo this. happens to the cells is that they undergo these often, you know, these frequent reversals. And so you can see this here, and here's an example of a chymograph. And again, we have statistics about that. But then if you mix the two substances non-uniformly, you can engineer these friction gradients. And in this case, the cells zip through the channel again, and they hardly ever reverse. And so we again have statistics about that that show that indeed these cells perform friction taxes in experiments as well. Okay. And so that's all I wanted to say. And so that's all I wanted to say. So let me just conclude. Here, what I showed you in the second part is that durataxis can happen even in the absence of focal esotions. And what we think happens in this case is actually a new type of guided cell migration, which is friction taxis. And so cells can actually sense and follow in a purely physical way gradients in substrate friction. And I think this is important because it shows that cells that perform this type of amoeboid migration, and there are many Amiboid migration, and there are many cell types that do so. For example, immune cells and cancer cells as they move through the small interstices in our tissues. But actually, any cell upon confinement has the potential to move in this way. And so all these cells were often just assumed to be guided mostly through chemicals, so via chemotaxis. And what we're showing here is that mechanical guidance is also possible for amyboid migration and maybe it's mediated by friction. It's mediated by friction. And so, with this, I finish. I thank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to your questions.
