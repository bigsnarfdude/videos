Specifically, looking at multi-phase flow modeling of a long-shelf current-supported turbidity currents. Okay, Emre, floor is yours. Thank you, Mayank, for the invitation and letting me talk in front of this distinguished audience. And in fact, you know, when I was, you know, writing this, when I was preparing this slides, especially. This slides, especially the cover slide that I'm presenting. I just, you know, joked myself because it writes here: m to the power five, saying that mathematics of multi-phase, multi-scale, multi-physics models, which gives me the impression that this, you know, workshop requires excellence to the fifth order. M stands for the degree of or the degree of. The degree of excellence. And I just, you know, said, okay, can I fulfill at least the first two? Maybe. So what I'm going to talk about today is just a continuation of what my PhD student did in his, you know, in her dissertation. And in fact, this was a, you know, a small piece of the, you know, the work that's ongoing. And therefore, I just, you know, let Let graduate students run these simulations for in a course entitled High Performance Computing Applications in Environmental Flows. Here is the list of those students who took this class, who analyzed and ran the simulations. So in fact, let me try to convince you that sediment transport is a multi-physics problem and it's a multi-scale problem. And it's a multi-scale problem, and in fact, it can be tackled by multi-phase models. Here, what you see is you know, this can be illustrated in an exemplary or you know, illustrative sketch that you see over here. There are several layers in which the concentration of the sediment particles changing and it is decreasing as we move in the vertical direction. And you can also see that the velocity is changing as. That the velocity is changing as well, meaning that the sediment mobility is also changing as you move in the vertical direction. Of course, with the sediment concentration changing and the energy of the flow is changing, different physical processes came into play. Now, for the, you know, the bottommost layer, the sediment bed, is immobile. And then what you see here is a slight new. Slight Newtonian motion of, or kind of a Newtonian-like motion of the particles, in which the driving force or you know the resisting force is the inter-particle attraction and partially collision. And if you move a little bit, you know, further in the vertical direction, what you see here, what you see is the bed load sediment transport. Concentration is a little bit relaxed, but the motion is going to be. But the motion is going to be quite energetic. Particle collision, as well as settling, plays a dominant role here. And when you move even further, then the suspended sediments becomes mostly affected by the fluid flow, namely turbulence. Now, to capture these physical phenomena, you need to use different, you can apply different various multi-phase flow. Multi-phase flow models, and if you increase your spatial scale, you can use the Euler and Euler method. And this is particularly applicable for fine sediment transport. And if you just move a little bit down, you are going to see that point particle simulations or Eulerian-Eulerian models can be used, including the genetic theory, etc. Etc. But you know, this Euler-Euler model must be a little bit sophisticated and must capture the particle-particle interactions. Now, when you, but if you, and with the increased decrease in this energy, then you can just apply the particle result simulations. And these, you know, the particle result simulations can extend further in the Stokes number parameter Stokes. Stokes number space. Now, this, you know, the figure is also adapted from my colleague Gerhard Wo-Winkau, in which he just, you know, revealed the sediment multi-phase flow modeling of sediment transport. Now, giving you the idea on the sediment transport or the grain scale processes here, we still end up having this outstanding challenge. And the outstanding challenge. And the outstanding challenge is we cannot connect these particle or grain scale, if you will, processes to geomorphically relevant scales. So meaning that what happens in the landscape, geological landscape, which is on the order of kilometers and tens of kilometers, it cannot be resolved at the grain site. At the grain size. Then, what you need to do, you need to properly extend the findings we have in the grain scale to this, you know, the geomorphological scales. Now, one way to do it is to develop scanning models for the sediment transport. And the other thing can be just, you know, they capture the physics in low-order models because. Order models because the models that are being utilized to capture the landscape scale is not going to, you know, even resolve the hydrodynamic scales very well. And therefore, you need to, you know, use these, you know, the processes by using the law order models. Now, to exemplify is what I'm going to mainly talk about, is the wave and current supported turbine. Wave and current supported turbidity currents. And these currents mainly occur in the continental shelf. And what you and the delivery mechanisms is from the river, of course, and these sediment delivered by the rivers is going to have a lower density against the selling water. And either they are going to stay at the surface and precipitate to the shelf floor, or sometimes. or sometimes, especially in the Yangtze rivers, the density can exceed the selling water density and there is going to be a turbidity current, but this is going to be short-lived because the slope is not going to be sufficient as you move along the shelf. Now, these, you know, after the precipitation or the gravity currents at the river mouth, these particles can be suspended by the Can be suspended by the wave action as well as the alongshore currents. Okay, now this, you know, this process is a boundary layer process because most of the time, the very boundary layer is not going to exceed the decimeter scale. So, what you see here on the right is just a 10 centimeter of fluid mud layer. Okay, and at the interface, there are fluctuations due. Interface, there are fluctuations due to waves, and this, you know, the fluctuation with this, you know, the gravity force, the sediment layer moves across the shelf, which is exemplified by this, you know, light colored, light brown colored current here. Now, the signatures of these currents, okay, can also be observed in the sedimentary rock records. So, here, for example, a decimeter scale fluid muddler. Fluid mudlayer is going to be compacted and it's going to, you know, form a sedimentary fabric on the order of half a millimeter or a millimeter. Okay, and that can be observed in the ancient rock records. Now, another significant aspect of these flows is their transition to self-driven turbidity currents. Now, the recent observations in the Philippines or the Malayale Bay. Philippines or the Malay Le Bay Canyon is just showing us that the significant wave height on the X axis and the current speed on the Y axis. And if the monsoon is strong enough in the monsoon season, if the typhoon is strong enough, it can resuspend the sediment. They slowly move, come to the shelf break, which is the end of the continental shelf. The continental shelf and then starts a self-driven gravity current or turbidity current to be precise. Okay, now this is pretty much showing us a triggering mechanism, or this is just, you know, manifest, this is just, you know, showing us there is a triggering mechanism, or the wave and the current support, the turbidity currents can act as a triggering mechanism for the turbidity currents. Okay, having Currency. Okay, having said that, there are several things that need to be understood. First of all, I would like to talk about the wave and current supported turbidity currents and its conceptual framework that is available to us from the literature. Now, what I'm going to show here is a descriptive sketch on the left. There are alongshore currents, okay? There are waves. These, you know, waves and alongshore currents suspend the cell. And alongshore currents suspend the sediment, and this suspension is going to create a downslope buoyant force, and that creates a gravity flow or a turbidity current. Okay, and this, you know, the turbidity currents slowly moves. Then, how are we going to formulate it? They just, you know, the available literature shows us that this flow is in equilibrium, meaning that it's going to be long-lived. So, there starts an equilibrium. Lived. So there starts an equilibrium establishment, and then there is no variation in time. You can just, you know, simplify to that. Therefore, the shear stress at the bottom must be equal to, or the attractive force per unit area at the bottom, across shelf direction, must be equal to the Booyant force. And this, you know, the Force. And this, you know, the tractive force is quantified by using this equation over here, where Cd is the drag coefficient and Ug is the depth average velocity. And the term in the square root is going to quantify the maximum velocity, wherein Ug is again the velocity of the gravity current, UW is the wave. Uw is the wave, the root mean square wave velocity, and v is going to be the alongshore current. Okay, now two things with this equation, what you see here is that you may know UG, okay, you may know the wave velocity, yes, and you may know the velocity of the along shelf current. But what you don't know is the suspended sediment constant. Is the suspended sediment concentration and the value of the drag coefficient. So, to close this equation, okay, the literature suggests that the drag coefficient ranges between 0.003 to 0.006, and the concentration is controlled by the sediment-induced density stratification. So, meaning that there is no role of erosion or the erodibility of the sediment. Or the erodibility of the sediment bed on the amount of suspended sediment concentration. Okay, of course, a lot of questions can be questions that can be asked because this, you know, because density stratification controls the amount of sediment suspension and the stratification is quantified by a Bach quantity known as the Bach-Richardson number here. As the Bulk-Richardson number here, which uses this depth average concentration and the total velocity squared, okay, and that needs to be equal to 0.25. Now, of course, at first, this seems logical, perhaps plausible to be exact, but the assumptions for the drag coefficient and the Bulk-Richardson number is rather strong. And the recent observations in the field shows us that. In the field, show us that the Bark-Richardson number can reduce up to 0.01, which is two orders of magnitude, one order of magnitude smaller than that proposed in the literature. The second thing that I just, that just, you know, that just remains as a question, is there a role of erosion on the suspended city? Erosion on the suspended sediment load. It must be. Because we know from the sediment transport literature that the erosion must be controlled by the tractive forces. And there must be an equilibrium between the sediment suspension mobilized from the bed and that settling to the bed. So this raises questions in my mind. Questions in my mind, and therefore, these you know, the assumptions must be, you know, tested. Okay. And another thing that I also would like to mention is that the Richardson number proposed herein uses bulk quantities. Okay, in that regard, the gradients of sediment concentration is not involved in this Park-Richardson number. In that regard, I also want In that regard, I also would like to say Barkuchitson number could be a and likely be a loose metric for the density stratification. Now, moving on, to test these, you know, the, to, you know, the test or check this, you know, these, um, these, these, these assumptions, okay, I just, you know, simplify the problem a little bit. Okay, the reason being a lot of A lot of hydrodynamic drivers are, you know, here, okay, and therefore, the interaction between the alongshore currents and the waves is a quite a bit of challenge. It creates a challenge for us to evaluate the density stratification. So that's why I just eliminated, we just eliminated waves from the picture so that we can just have a better understanding of the dense stratification. Of the density stratification. Now, to do that, we used a simplified Eulerian-Eulerian model, in which we just solved the momentum equation for the fluid phase. And because we make a dilute sediment concentration assumption, the fluid phase also approximately satisfies the continuity. And the sediment velocity is the superposition of the fluid velocity and the settling velocity. Fluid velocity and the settling velocity. And of course, the settling is going to occur in the bad normal direction as well as in the cross-shelf direction. Okay. In this equation, the friction velocity is going to be used, and that friction velocity is specified to be 3.6 millimeter per second and gives us a Reynolds number of 360. The settling velocity. The settling velocity of particles are varied, okay, and an order of magnitude variation, as you can see here. And because these particles are small, we assume that the settling velocity is stoxian. And the Schumid number is, as you see here in the diffusion term here, is going is specified as one. For the bottom boundary, the For the bottom boundary, we allow sediments to be suspended, but the bed remains non-deformable. So, this assumption is kind of, it may seem a little bit, you know, inappropriate at first, but you know, it is so thin and the erosion is so surficial that there is not going to be much of a change at the surface. Okay. And we use a classical erosion formula for this. formula for this you know the for the bottom boundary uh which is you know uh part anyaris and autotrain and this you know uh this you know uh formulation utilizes a bed uh the batch shear stress of 0.013 pascals so this you know the uh the the critical uh this you know erosion i mean the bad shear stress is quite low but cannot be avoided if you would like to run these Avoided if you would like to run these, run a direct numerical simulation. So, for the fluid phase, we use direct numerical simulation. And for the particle phase, we use advection and diffusion equation. And therefore, the Schmidt number is going to be equal to the molecular diffusivity of the fluid. Okay, having said that, let's take a look at this drag coefficient. A look at this drag coefficient at first. Okay, so to do to evaluate the drag coefficient, we should understand the effect of density stratification on the velocity. And most of the time, the change in the, you can see this, you know, here, in this, you know, the graphical sketch here, okay. With the density stratification, there is going to be a reduction in the Reynolds shear stress, which is shown as the dashed curve over here. Okay. Curve over here. Okay. And therefore, the velocity is also going to change, and there is going to be an increase because the vertical mixing is going to be relaxed. And as you can see, the reduction in or increase in the velocity is going to occur at the outer layer. But near the boundary, there is not going to be much of a change. And therefore, the effect. And therefore, the effect of tensive stratification can be better realized, can be realized in the outer layer. So, in the overlap layer, the flow tries to adjust the turbulent and the decaying turbulent phases, and therefore there is going to be a change in the von-Karman constant. Namely, there is going to be a reduction in the von-Karman constant, so the vendosity gradient increases. Velocity gradient increases. Okay, now this, you know, this, you know, the change in the velocity gradient can be, you know, estimated by the Monion-Obukov's cell similarity function as shown here. Okay. And with this, you know, in fact, you know, this has a long history. I think, you know, the experiments and the theory was developed at 1940s, late 1940s. And there is a very for. And there is a very for the atmospheric stratified atmospheric boundary layers. And the parameters that you see here is determined based on the experiments conducted over the steps of Kazakhstan. And here, what you see is you can quantify the velocity gradient as a function of a length scale called Monion-Obukov length scale. And this length scale, pretty much the increasing length scale. Pretty much the increasing length scale or the reduction in the inverse of this length scale is going to quantify the turbulent suspension to the inertia in a way, or to the turbulent fluctuations you can think of, or the turbulent suspension you can say. With this, you can quantify the velocity and you can also quantify. And you can also quantify the change in the drag coefficient because the drag coefficient is nothing but the ratio between the bed shear stress and the velocity squared. Now, what you see here is the integral of the velocity, okay, or the depth are the integral depth average, you know, velocity, and the left two terms on the left. two terms on the left pretty much you know quantify is what can be quantified through the the logarithmic friction law and this is going to be an addition and therefore the friction coefficient obtained from the logarithmic friction law can be further expanded can be further extended by including additional parameter here okay now to after doing this math you are going to also one thing to mention here is that One thing to mention here is that the turbulent suspension is pretty much counted by the settling flux. Because for equilibrium, you know, cases, for the equilibrium case, whatever is suspended to reach an equilibrium, for the concentration profile to reach the equilibrium, whatever is suspended needs to be balanced by whatever is going to settle. Okay? And what you see here is that this friction coefficient. This friction coefficient can be obtained as a function of Richardson number, which is quantified by using the friction velocity here, okay, and the settling velocity. Now, here, I also would like to mention that why settling velocity plays a role here. Because in classical stratified fluid theory, Uh, stratified fluid theory, okay, pretty much you know, the stratification is kind of quantified a little bit differently. But, you know, in the settling, you know, the cases, when the stratification is caused by the suspended sediment, settling, you know, velocity becomes important. Now, to illustrate this, let's think about two cases wherein you have a stratified fluid and particles try to fluctuate, okay? And the density. Fluctuate, okay? And the density difference is going to, you know, damp these fluctuations. On the other hand, when you have stratification due to settling, you know, particle suspension, those particles are going to, you know, settle down. Because they are going to settle down, those layers of different densities are going to also move downwards, creating a negative flux and a negative momentum flux. Negative momentum flux. And therefore, then the stratification in sediment stratified flows should also contain the settling velocity. Now, moving on to the figure here, our simulations suggest that the strengthening stratification with the strengthening stratification, the drag coefficient or the friction coefficient is reduced and with the reduction in And with the reduction in the concentration, the friction coefficient comes close to the curve here. And in this curve, it represents the friction coefficient obtained from the logarithmic skin friction law. And on top of that, we check further the applicability of this, you know, the relation that we show here for the friction coefficient. Show here for the friction coefficient and the observed friction coefficient pretty much well, you know, well aligns with the estimated friction coefficient. Now, we can here say that we can comfortably quantify the friction coefficients by using suspended sediment concentration and the settling velocity as a parameter. So, the drag coefficient proposed in the literature can be literature can be can be uh can be improved now moving on the bulk and the gradient richardson numbers are shown here okay because the bulk richardson number was used to quantify the density stratification with various uh with various uh settling velocities okay we observe different parkricherson numbers with the lower settling velocity giving us the maximum Settling velocity giving us the maximum Bach-Richardson number, and therefore, a number. And with the increasing sediment size, the Bach-Richardson number reduces. This, as you know, this tells us the Bach-Richardson number does not reach to a universally constant value. And on top of that, I also would like to mention that you need to quantify the gradients here. And we also check the Richards gradient Richardson. The Richards gradient Richardson number for this case. And we can see that there is an order of almost threefold magnitude difference in the gradient Richardson number and the bulk Richardson number. Okay, now another important thing here is that the gradient Richardson number for different settling velocities gives us Give me that, you know, let me conclude that these flows are not in critically stratified conditions. In fact, critical density stratification was proposed in the literature and is assumed in the literature, but it seems this is not the case here. Okay, now we just further would like to evaluate this. And to do that, okay. Okay, we need to, you know, come up with some formulation, and you know, the and to end I said to myself, maybe, you know, if I just, you know, write down the sediment depth integrity, write a depth integrated sediment invection model, maybe we can get something and indeed, you know, parameterizing that would give us a lot of information. Now, Lot of information. Now, the left-hand side is just, you know, the advective terms and the time rate of change, okay, as you see here. And because there is equilibrium, the two-dimensional dimensionality is lost as well. And what you see here, what we end up having is the erosion flux must be equal to the settling flux. Okay, now two things that we have here that, you know, we have that we need to do here is. We need to do here is because we just evaluate a depth integrated or depth average model. In which we just average the velocity, we average the concentration, my apologies. And here, to calculate the settling, we need to use this depth average concentration, and we can convert this button concentration to that. The button concentration to that average concentration by using a shape factor. And the shape factor here, shape factor here, is going to account for the anomalies associated with the skewness of the sediment concentration. And most of the time, especially if the settling velocity is high, this skewness is going to get higher as well. Okay, then there's also a short normal turbidity curve. A short normal turbidity current, which also you know changes the suspended sediment concentration, okay, and that can be evaluated by using the tractive force per unit area here, okay. And I would like to isolate the nonlinear term. So, in short, what I would like to get is additional terms, nonlinear terms, for Terms for sediment concentration, depth-average sediment concentration, to account for the non-linearities associated with density stratification, as well as the additional shear stress added by the cross-shelf motion. Now, first, to do that, just you know, we just did some mathematical manipulations. Mathematical manipulations. These are straightforward manipulations. And I just would like to isolate this, you know, the delta tau term, which is the, you know, the shear shear stress added by the cross-shell silenced transport, okay, cross-shell turbidity current. And if I expand this term here in square root in binomial as a binomial series sum and cut it at you know the second order term, I'm just getting a quadratic equation. Quadratic equation. I mean, I obtained the shear stress added by the cross-shelf gravity flow as a function of the depth average concentration, which is a quadratic function. And further, we check the additional shear stress with respect to the term inside the brackets. And we see that there's a very good match. Match and this, you know, the approximation is good enough. Now, moving on, we also calculated the shape factor, and this shape factor must be a nonlinear function of nonlinear function of the sediment concentration. And again, we use the Mononobukov theory here, in which the turbulent eddy viscosity is quantified as Is quantified as a function of Moninobukov length scale as well as friction velocity and the Karman constant. And if there is no density stratification or the term here is omitted, you obtain the Rawse profile. And if you include this term, you are going to get a modified Rawls profile. Okay, wherein the Rawse number is nothing but the ratio between the friction velocity and The friction velocity and the settling velocity and the friction velocity. We also further here you see that there is a Moni-Obaco parameter, okay, and you see it is the product of the normalized settling velocity and the Richardson number, and the Schimid number quantifies the ratio between this eddy viscosity and the eddy diffusivity. Okay, so far so good. Now, Now, we just you know, I just you know mentioned here that the shape factor is going to be a function of both the Rho's number and the monopoly parameters, or namely settling velocity and the constant depth average concentration. And I would like to end with this, you are going to end this, you know, the shape factor for the Rawls profile is going to be affected by only the Rawls number or the settling value. Rawls number or the settling velocity. As a result, with the modified Rawls profile, sediment concentration comes to the picture and you can obtain a non-linear function here. And I specifically look for an equation in the form of this, because I would like to make my equations easy to solve. Now, to do that, the loss profile integration is performed. is performed by using the binomial series. And again, what we obtain for the depth average concentration is going to be a result of the hypergeometric series. And we just obtain a relation for the Rauss profile, which is a function of the Rawls number and also the reference height from the bed, or which is very close to the bed itself. Very close to the bed itself. Okay, now we also perform the same analysis for the modified RAS profile and we obtain the shape factor, this time as a function of both Rose number and the monological parameter. And if I just evaluate the ratio between the shape factors, I obtain a function here, okay. Here, okay, and I also, you know, approximated to this one to one, okay. But you need to be careful when approximating this because this, you know, first, Z naught is very small, and second, these numbers are not, you know, excessively or excessively high. And therefore, this, you know, approximation is valid for the simulations as well as for a certain parametric range. Range. Okay. And this equation can further be approximated for this number that you, for this expression, for this expression here. When this expression goes to zero, and you can obtain an additive form like this. You can obtain a more convenient mathematical form here. Okay. With this, we just, you know, I just. We just, you know, I just rewrite this equation and then we just, you know, tease apart all the linear and the non-linear components. And the right-hand side of this equation becomes a quadratic relation. Okay. If this, you know, the relation on the right-hand side has a root, then this, you know, then there is going to be an equilibriation. And if not, there is not, there is no, and the stability is no longer. The and the stability is no longer a possibility, okay. And also, depending on the value of a, which is the non-linear term term here, okay, you can have the if you have a negative a by a, then it's always stable. And by the way, I also would like to mention that for convenience, I non-dimensionalize all the terms in the equation and obtain this relation. And to check the status. And to check the stability, I just take the discriminant of this equation and what you can see here is a relation for the stability. Okay, by stability here, we just also obtain an interesting physical insights because first we can quantify by the shape factor here, we can get the information on the settling alone. On the settling alone. The second term that you see here is associated with the density stratification. Because it's going to be the amount of sediment concentration is reduced by the density stratification here. Now, the third term here is going to be associated with the ease of suspension due to a positive feedback loop between the batteries. Between the bad shear stress and the cross-shelf gravity current. Okay, so with that, okay, we just evaluated the stability conditions for a range of settling velocity. And all our, you know, the simulations fall into the stable region, but also most of our simulations fall into the stable region. And we had two cases with settling velocity 0.01. Point O1 which never reached equilibrium and the concentration accelerated continuously. Okay, so this in a way tells us this, you know, you know, confirms this, you know, the relation that we obtained. The second important thing, the second takeaway is going to be the ratio between this term one, which is the blue term here, SR squared, and the second term. From this, you know, the relation. Term from this unrelation, we can just quantify the role of tensile stratification. And we see that with this increase in the settling velocity, we see an emphasized role on the density stratification. Okay, so with that, we also can calculate the amount of sediment concentration suspended. Sediment concentration, suspended sediment concentration, and the concentration. And of course, there are two unodures here, okay, which is obtained from the relations that we have. And these are the simulation results. And we see that there's a good match. Now, takeaways from these simulations is that data stratification governs Stratification governs the sediment amount of sediment suspension, but critical density stratification is not warranted. And the sediment entrainment from the bed is a governing parameter as well as the settling velocity to quantify the density stratification. And with this, I think, you know, I'm pretty much out of time here. And here is my Time here, and here is my conclusion. We just tested the available hypotheses in the literature, and we just concluded that critical density stratification cannot be used for the closure for the amount of sediment suspension. And the density stratification is especially important and is a function of settling velocity and it governs the amount of sediment. And it governs the amount of sediment suspension. We can also determined critical conditions for self-sustaining turbidity currents from a long shelf current supported turbidity currents can be determined analytically by using the non-linear interactions between the density strategy. Density stratification and due to density stratification and due to bed shear stress enhancement due to cross-shelf turbidity curved. I thank you for your attention and I will be more than happy to take questions. Let's thank Professor Amre Ozdemir for an interesting talk on the sediment transport and the outer continental shelf. Thanks, Amre. Anyway, I think our lunchtime has started over here. So we'll take maybe one quick comment or a question from here, from the audience there.
