Hi everyone, my name is Matt Young and this story that I'm going to tell you today starts seven years ago. It starts here. I mean probably you figured out this is not from today, this photo. Maybe you can tell where I am in the picture. This is 2015 in September. You can tell where I am right. Yeah, extreme left. My hair was progressing and my beard is also progressing. Progressing in my beard and also progressing. And this was: I was in the last year of grad school at the University of Washington. I got invited to come up, I guess, early to this PIMS postdoctoral retreat, so Castics. Probably spot some other probabilists that you recognize in that photo. And I spoke at that conference about some fragmentation process. And after my talk, it was, I think, around seven o'clock and it was in the I think around seven o'clock, and it was in the dormitory that we were staying in. I was approached by Omer Angel in the stairwell. Probably he spotted Omer also in the blue. And I remember he said to me, Matt, it seems like you like cute problems, is what we told me. And like, I think that's the strongest and weakest part of my research program, but I do like problems like that. So it helped me where you asked me: have you heard of the bullet problem? Heard of the bullet problem. No, I'm not. And in that stairwell somewhere on his campus, he proceeded to tell me this problem did change the course of my trajectory with my research career. So here it is. I'll tell you. He told it to me verbally in a stereo, so I'll just tell it to you also. So in this process, you have the positive real line, and at the origin is a gun. And it's firing the bullets every second, just towards infinity along the line. Along the line. And it's a defective gun or old ammunition because every bullet has a different speed. And it's sampled, let's say, uniformly from zero. Firing bullets every second with IAE uniform speeds. And inevitably, there's going to be faster bullets that catch up with a slower bullet. When that happens, they mutually annihilate and disappear in the process. You can picture this happening, bullets flying down the rail line, and that is the bullet process. Bullet process. What's the bullet problem? The bullet problem is: is there a positive probability that the first bullet is never caught? That makes sense. So the first bullet has some speed, it's cruising along. Inevitably, there are faster bullets. But there's possibly some bullets that are slower in between. And does the interference of those make it so this first bullet gets further and further ahead and just never comes? I'm still an open problem. I'm still an open problem. Open problem. Its origins are kind of interesting. I don't, maybe I shouldn't. I'll quickly go into it. This was just a quick. So this was posed as a riddle by an engineer named David Wilson at IBM. It's not the Microsoft David Wilson. And it was put online and people had all these solutions. Then they realized they were wrong for this. It was popular on Reddit for a little bit. But then this problem did make its way into Microsoft research. Think it's why the end of Microsoft research and those researchers they ever started advertising this is a more serious found problem because there's these devilish long-range dependencies in this model. If you know that a fast bullet caught a slower bullet, that tells you something about what happened behind it that kind of cascades down. And this is even more interesting because they think that the survival of the first bullet depends on its speed, whether it has a positive probability or not. The probability, and I've told from firing billions of bullets, simulated bullets, that we've conjecture for how fast the first bullet has to be to have a positive probability. I'm going to ask you several questions that you really have no reason to be able to guess, but you want to guess where they think the transition is. So there is a critical value. A critical value. It's monotonics and the speed of the first hole, is probably. You want to guess where the transition is? Transition is 103. 103. Okay, no. We don't have that level of precision because it's not far to sign up, but somewhere around 0.9. That's going to be pretty fast to have a chance. And Omer also warned me at the time that this is an addictive problem, so be careful. Yeah, can you show that if it travels at speed 0.1, that it has no chance of surviving? Has no chance of surviving open off so you can yeah, prove that for sufficiently slow it doesn't survive. No, to my knowledge. So as more disseminative, it is. I'm still talking about it seven years later as a problem as a sign. And I thought about it quite vigorously at the time, this time here. And realized it was difficult. I'm also quite willing as a mathematician to retreat and work on something. To retreat and work on something that seems easier. And so, a couple months in, I was talking to Eric Slifkin, a friend of mine, and we thought of a simpler version where, okay, the uniform 0-1 speeds are pretty complicated. What if the speeds are from a discrete set? So consider the same ball process, but I sample uniformly some finite discrete set of speeds. And we were able to prove something. So, first off, if the So, first off, if the first bullet has the fastest speed, it's out of question it's going to survive because it's out of front and nothing can catch it. Our theorem is that if it has the second fastest speed and there's at least three speeds, then it survives with positive probability. Which it's a start. And to Chris's question, we also proved if it has the slowest speed, it is almost really a matter. And to give you an idea that even that is non-trivial. idea that even that is non-trivial we don't have a proof that the third fastest bullet survives the positive probability so if you have 100 speeds one to 100 the speed 98 it's an open problem to prove that survives the positive probability likely does but long range dependence becomes more significant in that case okay there's a two-part or well several part story um and we proved this result and then i asked alex for And then I asked Alex for a picture of this. I later that year, or about nine months later, I went to England to talk about this, to the University of Bath, to a conference that Alex and Vladisius were organizing. I forget the name of it exactly, but the interactive particle system conference. And I spoke about this. And after my talk, I was approached by Gladys. This is a good time to kill them anyway. So I was approached by Lattice and he said, I enjoyed your talk, and I have a very similar problem that I've been thinking about. And I'm going to proceed to tell me it. I think I'll use the board again because this is where I introduce holistic annihilation. Yes, I still remember this was in some big conference room and just at the Blackboard. There's a vital interaction applies. Also, you told me the following, some version of the following. At the time, you didn't call it ballistic annihilation, but here's the process. But here's the process. So take the real line and put particles according to the Poisson processor, just within the IIE spacings. I think you told me the sound process, place particles. And there are three speeds in play for this model. So the probability P. Probability D. A little harder to know, but the particle is what I'll call a blockade and it doesn't move. So stationary is probability P. And then with the rest of the probability, it's either left or right moving. So independently assign either speed zero and left and right moving particles have unit speed. Something like that could happen. And after the particles are placed and the speeds are assigned, it's deterministic. So particles move at their assigned speed and And origins result in mutual annihilation. So it looks like in this realization that I drew here, these are going to mutually annihilate. These are going to annihilate this one still. Okay, so this is the process. What are some basic things you could measure about it? Fundamental quantity is Fundamental quantity is theta of p, and this is the probability that a given basic object. So, if you have a blockade, what's the probability that it's never annihilated? Imped where the usual particle are placed machines according to a Poisson process. Okay. So, and even that sounds so important, just with IID spaces between them. This quantity clearly. I'll say it right from the start. One of the reasons why this is interesting, this has come up a lot already today, theta is not, there's no direct proof that theta is monotone with D. This monotone would be. If you start, it seems like if you increase the blockade density, that should help blockade survival. But the collision order is yet messed up. I mean, at least I'm not aware of a coupling argument that gets this. But now I've got to ask, is there a phase transition here? C is the smallest value of p, such that theta is theta p is possible. Is possible. So, this is the smallest blockade density at which blockades are surviving with positive product mode. And because of this lack of monogenicity, if I use the supremum definition, that's not clearly the same one, but more or less the same. Okay, before we get to Okay, before we get to the question that I just asked, let's just get a slight grip on this PC. Does anyone have an obvious bound for PC? One quarter is not an obvious bound. That just from what you already discovered, is it? If you can't make any blockades, it's going to survive. Sure, yeah. So if the blockade density is more than a half. Density is more than a half, you can't get rid of all in the random lock right here. So, DC is definitely smaller than and it was nice that I was talking about the bullet problem. We had done this discrete bullet problem. So, the theorem that we proved could actually be realized as a ballistic annihilation. So, if you have three bullet speeds and they correspond to these speeds, you can translate the speed. speeds you can translate to speed so it looks like everything's moving our theorem says that and we're doing uniform uniformly sampling speeds so the vc is less than or equals to 13 speeds yeah just when they heat both of them are okay yeah half the idea is that on the say on the right there are more uh If there are more blockades than anything else, then the blockades will always some survival. There's always more blockades in there. Just track it with a random blockade plus one here. So you can have all the other food going your direction. Even worst case, you can't get any. And then I didn't credit foods on this. This is what they included some undergraduates for part of this project. So bring me down here myself. So Brittany, Dinegir, myself, Christophe Kinzel, Andy Raymond, Eric Slipking, Jeffrey, M6, 16, a lot of us. Okay, there's another question. Let's just get a little drip on what VC is. So survival of the second fastest folder is like survival of a blockade in a one-sided process. Say those things together. The question that Vladis was interested, and he was circulating at the time, first, wasn't he wasn't so interested in upper bounds. He was interested in is VC greater than zero. And this is also, this intrigued me quite a bit. So this is saying blockade density is taking arbitrary low, or very low, and you show that they don't survive. And while that seems obvious, it's because there's less blockades present, but the less blockade. But the less blockades you have, the more arrow-arrow collisions are going to happen, and so they're taking themselves out of the model faster. So it's not super clear how to prove something like this. Is it clear if B is zero, the safe only ones be zero at the others, then all the others will get speaked when it gets cleared then? But through a similar random mark, you can get you get infinitely many visits. Some recurrence of random walk. Some recurrence of random model. I would guess. Okay, so I left that with this problem. This seems easier than the bullet one, at least, and it's a valid open question. So it is challenging. I thought about this for some time and was only able to prove better upper bounds. Like we developed some machinery to think about this differently, but just improved the upper bound. But just improved the upper bound. And Vladis, working with Laurent Fernier, also approved an upper bound eight months after this workshop. And they proved that PC is less than 0.3280. So it's just in turn A, 17. And we prove that PC is less than or equal to 0.2871. This is also this is with pretty. This is also this is with Radinsky, Gupta, and myself in 17. But I should say that our argument is for unit spaces. And the real contributions of both of these results was not so much these improved upper bounds, but they were a different way of thinking about holistic annotation. So it was more the theoretical framework. Like they weren't really trying to optimize this, they just improved it. To optimize this, they just improved it a bit. Okay, but also when LaRont and Vladis were writing up their results, they realized that, as I said, Vladis did not tell me this was called ballistic annihilation, so this is an interesting interacting particle system. They discovered that physicists had been talking about exactly this model in the 80s and 90s, and they called it ballistic annihilation. And, you know, a good and bad thing, they had some. You know, a good and bad thing, they had solved it to their satisfaction. So they didn't know what PC is, they knew what critical exponents were, etc. So at least that goes as a target, but it was not fully rigorous. And it was spoiled the result a little bit, but they conjecture that VC is a form. And it's not too hard to see through a heuristic argument if you. Argument. If you assume everything is mean field, then arrows are removed at three times the rate that blockades are removed. And so if you take PC equals a fourth, there's three times more arrows we think. This is something you can feel. So I thought about this. I was a postdoc at this point. I was thinking about it pretty intensely. And it was a And it was a great breakthrough. I just got one of those moments where I just looked on the archive and someone has solved it. And that is what happened. So who solved it? It was John Castlegrave and then Siderish Attorney. And they did it in great style because not only did they In great style because not only did they compute PC, they found an explicit formula for data for B. They found a physicist also found this formula, but they confirmed it from a holistic argument. And nobody says this immediately implies that DC is important. And this is their main theorem, but they also, I think, there are several versions of this paper, and in a later version on the archive, they also computed critical exponents. What is this? Oh, it's not my best two, it's about two instead of square square root of P minus two. And having thought about this, there was a clear approach to doing to solving this problem, which I was stuck on, you know, and stared at for hours and hours. And they had this just beautiful way of dealing with it. Now I just can't unsee it. Um, now I just can't unsee it, but it's it's in so I'm going to tell you like one of the main ideas for the group. Okay, so there's all these symmetries that you consider the one-sided process. And we'll let B be the event that zero is visited by something, and this is on the process with only particles on zero. With only particles on zero infinity. All right, so just only say this is zero, ignore everything over here, ask if something visits from the right. That's good enough. If nothing's visiting from the left, then piece that together. And will the Q be the probability of this one? Okay, so if you're going to partition on something, or if you're going to If you're going to partition on something, or if you're going to solve this exactly, you need some sort of exact solution. And it's incredibly natural to partition on the speed of the first particle to the right of the stroke. So that's what we can do. You can write Q as the probability of B and the first particle is left moving, and the first particle is stationary. Two of these terms immediately or immediately can be computed. The first term truly immediately can be computed. First particle is left moving, zero is being visited. So this is one minus p over two. Give me some opportunities to be clever. I'll give you some opportunities to be clever. What is this middle term? I'll draw a picture. You square Q. Yeah, that sounds good. So if this is zero and this is our first particle, it's a block Q. Someone said Q squared, right? Yeah, great. So this has to get annihilated by something. Has to get annihilated by something and that happens with probability q because you start the process from here. But then, because there's only these one speed of left-moving particles, what happens to the right of this particle is independent of the cement. And so now we just need something that is appear that I'm adding a problem over here as well in the pattern and second. And technically, not a 100% answer because we need this to be blocked. So it's P times P squared. This suggests that there's a nice renewal property in this model. These first two terms fall easily, but then this term is complicated. Or more complicated. Complicated. Why is that? So imagine that the first particle is right moving and then it is ultimately destroyed by a blockade. This is complicated because if this is able to destroy that blockade, that says something about what happened to the right of that block gate. There's some dependence in between this. Only in some internal is like. And only inside interval is the same size as this, but we get information. And I stared at this particular picture quite a bit in 2017. And now that, as I said, I can't kind of see the solution. So my consideration is just turning me, thought of a wonderful way to handle this case. And what I was unable to see in a year, I will give you 20 seconds. 20 seconds. But to make it more concrete, try to give you this probability. The probability of zero is isn't it? And the first particle is right moving and it's blocking, as I've drawn up here. This is the whole genesis of the next slide. So sorry, what's the other one? So the next one is it locking? This is right moving and it's ultimately there could be some other particles in here, but it's destroyed by a blockade. But it's destroyed by the blockade. The others destroy themselves. Yeah, they have to destroy themselves. So these are not so relevant, but there is a very simple expression to this. It's late in the day, so I don't know. I imagine you're all just pretending you're like thinking like you're thinking, but contrary, contributor infer it from the formula we move on together. I don't know about that perception here. I asked Laurent this, or not quite that, but he said that they were doubting the physicist derivations at one point. And so they were not using that as a company. And so they were not using that as a compass until arriving here, even the one towards the okay, it's one of these beautiful things where, so the issue, as I said, is there's some dependence going on right here. The wonderful idea that they had was, or insight, is take what happens here and reverse the configuration. Reverse the configurations. What's it look like then? So now we have a block A here. We have some arrow hitting it. And then we have later another arrow arrives. And the symmetries in this model make it so is it clear that if I reflect here, reflect across the line of symmetry and then change the orientation of all the particles. Symmetry and then change the orientation of all the particles. It's a sort of a configuration reversal. And because of the symmetries of the model, after doing this reversal, that is measured preserving and it preserves the order of collisions. So the same collisions are, if you reverse this, you still know this is going to hit that particle. And this new configuration has the same probabilities, the old one. So we so you reverse the order and you reverse the errors, but this one is now that particle and this one is that every particle that was in between everything gets reversed and has a different the opposite orientation and And now in this picture, it looks a lot like we're asking a particle, or it looks a lot like this case. Like we're asking for a stationary particle being the first particle, and then it gets visited twice. And if you sum over all configurations, the only extra thing you get is that if this is D1 and this is D2, this space has to be smaller than that space. The dependence kind of gets wrapped into there because they're asking that this one not destroyed out before this one does. Not destroy that before it is one that can just jobs a little further. And other than that, you have true independence between these two arrivals. And so we're actually just comparing two independent arrival times that are IID identically distributed. So this term ends up being Q squared or P Q squared times this probability, which is that. And it seems simple, but if you're not handed, this is, you know, I never saw it. And that's not the entire story with this term, but if you use that same idea and some nice partitioning, you can fully expand this term. And what are they? You got this recursion in Q, and if you simplify everything, you get zero is one minus. One minus two. You get the Q has to be a root of this equation, right? Drop this. You can explicitly find such like this is the d-axis, this is the q-axis. q either has to be equal to one or it has to solve this equation right here. And in particular, if you want, for theta is one minus q squared, if you have a formula for q, you get theta. And they prove that it has to follow. This part of that, these bubble sets would be zero solutions to that. It's not so simple because we don't know a priori that Q or theta are continuous, you can't rule out the possibility that, and there's no monotonicity, they can't rule out the possibility that it stays on this group longer and jumps down, or that it's jumping between these two as peak changes. So the story is not over with this region. So, the story is not over with this recursion. You have to do some regularity arguments, which are also, I think, quite inspired. And they use some machinery from this paper to make them work. But this gets things started, and it gives us this equation here. So, I think the model is quite interesting. It's quite innovative, this argument. And I still want to hit. And I still wanted in on the action. I've been thinking about this quite a bit. And so, what have I been doing the past almost five years now, four years? Not the only thing I'm doing, but I've been curious in how far can you push this idea? So what are some variants of ballistic annihilation and does this idea still work? And where does it start failing? And I think I have time. I'll tell you just quickly three variants and then maybe five, the places where it breaks for these variants. Work breaks for these variants. I've got a bunch of different simple questions to share with you today. So I'm guessing we should probably just use this much more to all. Any questions so far? Everybody yourself in my shoes and ask what variant would you look at? So they did this totally symmetric case. If any, I mean, there's obvious things you could change about this, right? Or one thing I'll say, four speeds? No, or open, nothing is known for four speeds. Continuous speeds, nothing is known. So I didn't go that direction. I don't want more speeds. Just one type of arrow is in triple arrow? Just one type of arrow? So only blockade scenarios? Yeah, but one type. So just. Yeah, so two speeds. Is that what you're asking? Two speeds is worked out. Yeah. I have our physicists work that out. I don't know if you saw my hairstyle in that photo, but it was asymmetric. And example, that's what happens if you break the symmetry with a zone. There's two things you can make asymmetric. Right moving particles can have speed one. Left moving particles can have speed B. You have some scaling and translation invariance for the speed, so it's enough to just have speed one, zero, and negative V. And you can change their probabilities, so you can make two parameters, you could have. Parameters you could have left moving a curve and some parameter and then right moving with the best of the probability. Okay, so this is asymmetric three-speed holistic analysis. And if you want a nice open problem, or at least an open problem, is defining DC just like before. Now it depends on lambda and v We don't have the value of this for anything except b equals one, lambda equals f, which is the symmetric case. So asymmetry introduces some problems. Every variance, I do have a theorem with some co-authors about it. So, what were we able to prove this mean? So, with convex blue, We introduced this model, and while we don't prove what GC is, we prove something about the base data. Okay, it's a little weird to look at, but what we show is that if you take a given value of lambda, then there is a phase transition. So if you micro question. This original question, which is gone now, is: Is there a phase transition in standard symmetric list of pen RS? We proved that there is a phase, nothing the most means of tracking people say. There is a phase transition in every asymmetric model. And we give these are explicit curves that we give for where the phase transition has to occur. And because of strangeness of holistic annihilation, we can't draw out that there's multiple phase transitions in this area. And the only result that we have is from HST, which proved that there is a phase transition distance one-fourth on lambda equals a half and b equals one. And probably it's a little harder to process in real time, but these bounds hold for any. So this region is valid. So there's like a third dimension for space that I'm going to What became more difficult with the asymmetric case? First off, this reversal that we did or that HSC introduced that is no longer measure preserving or preserving the orders of collisions. So you can't do the reversal anymore. Probably one of our better contributions or more significant contributions from that paper is we realized that the mass transport principle can be part of That the mass transport principle can do part of the work. So we can get some equations using the mass transport principle. Where HST had one equation and one unknown, we have two equations and six unknowns. Another difficulty in the asymmetric setting that's not present with the symmetric setting is in the symmetric model, you know that a moving particle due to symmetry is going to get annihilated by something. You can't have moving particles surviving. You can't have moving particles surviving because then the other speed would be surviving prevent each other, or that would be contradictory. Is that somewhat clear? But in the asymmetric setting, it's totally possible that a moving particle, because there's no symmetry, is the dominant one that survives. So we can't say for sure that moving particles yet distinguished. And that will make life much more challenging to get anywhere to get to these curves and some other results that we prove. And then there's also got erased that there was this one half that appeared, this nice one half. We don't get that. And it seems like we can probably find a formula for PC if we had a relatively simple quantity. So I'll just tell you it real quick. Another question, I would love to know what this is. What is the probability that I'll explain the notation in a second. What is the probability that the first particle to visit zero is right moving, given that it's visited by particles from both sides? Symmetric second is a path. But here it's like it's totally complete. But here it's like it's totally unclear. And this we get some set-line equation for what PC should be, and it involves this quantity. But strangely, we cannot compute this. Although we're not sure, but likely this is a simple formula, but we don't know what to guess for it or how to derive it. That's all I have to say about the eccentric case. We did some more work, but trying to stay on the theme of this PC stuff. Before you move on, so your guess would be that the critical curve in between should be something that you can give a formula about. Yeah, I suspect. Yeah, I suspect there is a nice closed form. Although I will say that there is a physics paper about the or that mentions the asymmetric case, but they don't give a conjecture for it. So that's discouraging. I don't know how seriously they thought about it. It's mainly about symmetry because I don't want to go too long. I've been talking for 30 to 40 minutes or so. 40 minutes. I've been talking for 40 minutes. I've been talking for 40 minutes. Okay. Okay. Quickly say two other nerds. This is also considered this case where when particles meet, they don't necessarily mutually annihilate, but sometimes one survives, or sometimes they even generate a new particle. The original mystic annihilation. The original mystic annihilation is very sensitive to changing configurations. And so it's interesting to ask: if you allow for collision types to be more general, can you say anything about the phase transition? And yeah, we actually can. So if you, I'll just, I'll give you a simplified version of the cases we consider. If arrow arrow reactions, say that sometimes the left arrow survives. Left arrow survives, sometimes the right arrow survives. Sometimes they spontaneously generate a blockade. The rest of the time, they mutually none of it. So you independently decide at each collision. You mean they generate and they disappear? Yeah, this is what's left over. Okay, we consider a few other coalescing cases, but this is a A few other coalescing cases, but this is a theory I'm with. And it says myself, Lily Reeves, and Max Redner. This is from 20. They're still under review, but one. First did it. And we give an explicit formula for BC. For these cases, we can write it down. And it requires, we use the mass transport principle as well. It helps us keep track of what's going on. And I mentioned there are some regularity arguments for the original paper. Those become more complicated. But the recurrence method, it's messed up. Recursion, it's messier, but we can say something about it. And the speed is uh, it's not a symmetric. No, this is this is symmetric. Okay. Sorry, symmetric. I've chosen these probabilities to be symmetric. Make any of this coalescing symmetry, nothing. Could be said. Okay, promised to question. We can sort of handle the reaction where blockades survived collisions, but one reaction that we cannot be. But one reaction that we cannot do anything about is where arrows are passing through each other. I don't know how to do all that, but if the arrows pass through each other, then the fundamental mechanism of that recursion I showed you seems to break down. So sorry, so this does no longer depend on the initial parameters of the configuration. Well, does not depend on this PC. Well, this P C oh, sorry, so P is always present for the so P C in this setting is the critical death block K density at which they stop surviving. Yeah, okay, one last case will take an equal amount of time as this one, so this is the last thing I have to say. Kenneth is kind of on the end for today, also. Natural to ask how universal ballistic violation is. So I kind of download like this, but something remarkable about HST's argument is they don't care on the law of the spacings between particles. That one-fourth falls for any continuous spacing law. If it's atomic, then there's some issues that come up, but continuous and it's like What I'm working on this summer, actually, I just started thinking about this maybe a month ago, is how universal is this for the initial placements of particles? So instead of placing one particle at each site where there's a particle, what if you put a random number of particles? Does the phase transition universal under that type of perturbation? To make that concrete, say that you put X blockade. X blockades the probability. So, anywhere where you had a blockade, instead of putting one, you put some random variable x. And let's just consider that. Then arrows as before. So this is a preliminary. Oh, actually, I will say that when I thought to do this, my guess was that PC won't be universal. Be universal because it seems to me if you start clustering blockades more densely, then you're going to see more arrow-arrow collisions. And I would expect it to be better for blockade survival. That's probably a stretch to explain right now, but my guess is that it's not universal with respect to changing the volatility of the number of blockades at each site. But it seems like it is. So this is with myself. Myself, Ortiz, Lily Reeves, and Rivera. Unclear when we will write this, but we show that for this model with X, I think we can choose this right down. So you can get a similar returning. Or Q, which is the probability that zero is visited. So ages, I've erased it, but I had a relatively simple recursion written down. And what can we show that if the partials of this second function right here are negative on the square? So you'd be your. So it would give you the arguments of the specific function generally. Then this implies that dc is one out of one plus three times the expected value of x. In particular, if you're putting mean one block eights at every site, the one fourth is eight percent. And of course, I'm not going to, this function involves a generating function. This function involves the generating function of f or sorry of x. So I'm not going to write it down. I'll just end with two last questions. Oh, and then we can explicit, so we have this criteria here, right? We need these negative partials. This is so that we know the picture looks like what I drew before. We need to guarantee that there's just one possible route that you can follow. And we can then verify. And we can then verify this for a few special cases, but it's really not that robust. It actually is quite hard to verify things about a general polynomial. So it'd be fantastic to find some other route that does not have this hypothesis. Something that is true universality statement. And to give you a sense of Sense of how this is right on the edge of what is possible. Last question is not visible, I'll just say it. So I was, it probably clearly is not visible, but like if we were very, we were saying take a random number of blockades at each site. If you do the other natural thing of a random number of arrows at each site, to me, it seems Each site, to me, it seems completely hopeless. Getting a recursion started seems immediately impossible. Even if you just take zero or two arrows at every site, I was unable. I think I'm pretty good at writing this recursion at this point. I was unable to get that started. So some new approach is needed just to handle that. Okay, in closing, this entire research trajectory, it also got me into just general. It also got me into just general annihilating systems. This all started with a conversation in a stairwell, just like a couple buildings down. And, you know, I've worked with almost 20 students, like a lot of them undergrads on this stuff, and several grad students. And it's just like, I saw that it's an example of the power of these things. Like it really matters coming together and talking to each other. So thanks for your attention. So this explicit formula was for this completely semantic case like the blockage and left and right plus minus one, there was this explicit solution of this data. Did I understand correctly that physicists showed that this is actually also the formula you get from a certain mean field calculation? From a certain mean field calculation? No, it was a little vague. So the one-fourth comes from a mean field calculation. They do something more nuanced to get these equations. Okay, so this delta is not really a mean field. No, it's not a mean field source. Is there anything more? Are there any more cases where mean fields gives the right prediction? And what do you mean by cases? So it's one false. What do you mean by cases? So, it's one false is one case that the mean field gives you a model is not. Yeah, are there other similar models? If you know this whole is how I'm not sure. Do you understand why it works? The same field approach? Yeah. And as I said, Mon told me that they were doubting. It's both. Yeah, but now that you know the solution, do you really have three times more? The solution doesn't really reveal that it's one of these exactly solvable. So if it's actually the critical point and not the data function, it's probably very hard for them. You said that in the Philippines paper, there was also the data, they had the formula. They had the formula for data and precise exponents at PC. So in each. Sort of in rich type of things because if it's not media midfield, they just got some matching. I'm not an expert in that in their approaches. Has anyone tried to do something in, let's say, two dimensions? It's particles moving. There's the asteroid problem, which Benjamini was circulating for the while. Put a two-dimensional Paton point process down and make an epsilon circle around everyone of those points. Those are asteroids. They get a uniform direction 025. And then they start moving at unit speed. Is that clear? If they fly and they annihilate, prove that zero is almost surely visible. Etai was circulating that pretty widely that five years. In that, pretty widely, like five years ago. So, yes. So, is all of those percent based on doing these recursions? That's the starting point for these three kind of positions here. Yeah. This mass transport principle becomes needed. We're not reversing. And this result for the GAN process with the Elite, is it based on some case the one that you yeah it's based on a similar rule and then a couple into a random one but is it is it based on a sort of a closed formula like with a function like that or it's it's based on a lower bounding closed formula. Bounding closed formula for copy. Thanks, everyone. Good first day of talk.
