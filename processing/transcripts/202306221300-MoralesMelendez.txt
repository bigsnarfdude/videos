Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, and the organizers. Also will be giving an apology. Maybe today will be the day of apologies because the subjects are not as closed as the other ones. These are general results on group actions. General results on group actions. It's just a generalization of group actions and what happens in that case. So I'll explain a little bit. Yes. Well, I'll give some of the definitions of these binary actions, which are a generalization of usual actions. And one can think about. didn't think about well generalize everything about usual actions to these binary actions and and so uh in order to to make that it it will be good to understand the orbits and the and to have classifying spaces uh but i will be speaking about well the title is classifying spaces because usually one says says that but um i will be speaking about universal spaces because Speaking about universal spaces because it's we don't have what is the orbit space in this case. So, well, so a binary action, we take instead of instead of acting only, no, acting by multiply, well, by usual transformations, we use binary operations. We use binary operations in the space. So we take, well, x is any topological space. Actually, the results are for general topology, but are actually algebra and suitable conditions. So it will hold for general topological spaces. So we consider a G acting by binary. A G acting by binary operations. And well, if you think about addition and subtraction of numbers, so usually one says that they are inverse with each other, and that means to begin with addition and then subtraction, and they cancel. And they cancel on the left, for example. So this is the condition. So this is the condition on the multiplication. We fix this, the first parameter, and then we multiply. And the identity is the projection on the right side. So, and so this should be a category. So, we have a map between topological spaces, between binary G spaces. Well, that's a binary G space. Well, that's a binary G space. A map between binary G spaces is the equivariant if we have this commit step diagram. So we need some sort of parametrized actions? Yeah, it happens that they're like that, that X is a parameter, but one, well, it becomes more. It becomes more complicated if one wants to have a universal space that is better suit for computations. So in general, yeah, one can think as parameterized spaces, but in order to construct, for example, a cohomology of groups, one needs some more concrete model. So. So, well, let's take, well, these actions actually exist. We take a topological space and a continuous map, a binary operation, and we denote the set of all such maps as C2X. And we have this operation, with the natural operation that And then the same if we take this space with that operation and the neutral element as the projection on the right side, and we have a topological monoid. So one only takes one just takes all the invertible binary operations on x and Operations on X, and this would be the biggest group acting on the space. So, to define an binary group action is to take just a continuous homomorphism on this space with the compact open topology. For example. Okay. Relations with usual group actions. With usual group actions, if the binary action does not depend on the first coordinate, we obtain a usual group action. So usual or binary action are a natural generalization. And if we fix the first coordinate, we obtain a usual group action. Therefore, what's it Bernardo? This a binary group. This binary group action gives a continuous family of usual group actions that is parameterized by the space x. Well, so the question, how to construct a universal space for binary group actions? For usual actions, there are a lot of constructions. Some very general. My colleague wanted to construct a universal space for Lindelof spaces. For Lindelof spaces, because he had a well, he wanted to use a classical result of debris on that. But we made a construction that works whenever you have a universal space for usual reactions. For usual reactions. So, a simple observation. Well, what I said, the notion is not symmetric. The first coordinate is a parameter, and the second belongs to the ambient space. So, we have this proposition. We have this example. So, we take any G space. So, a usual action and a continuous map from the And a continuous map from the space to the group and we can just just conjugate on the we can define this binary binary action just by conjugating an element G by the by the image of F. So one can check the conditions. So that is an example. Medicine an example. And when we wanted to consider to conserve the universal space, one thing that happens is that we don't have any control on the homeomorphism we are dealing with. So the first thing is to make an analogy with bond. An analogy with bundles when you start to use structure groups. So we consider... Sorry, what happened here? Sorry, I did something strange. I was holding the big budget and I closed the presentation, I think. Presentation, I think. Okay, full screen. Okay, thank you. Sorry. Yeah, we take two groups now, G and G and with tilde, and we take the continuous homebore system from G. The continuous one more system from G to this group. And with the compact open topology, well, in particular, if they coincide, we have just endomorphism of the group, continuous endomorphisms. So we can define binary group action by taking this, well, it's like the same. So it's like the same as in okay, it's like this. Ah, I try now. Okay, thank you. It's like this, the same idea of this example. We had this continuous function and we could conjugate, but in this case, we just have a homomorphism. just have a homomorphism from from the from g to g tilde and then we can do the same thing so this generalizes the the previous idea and we have a binary group action okay so we take um a locally compact and locally connected topological space um oh well we First, we need to show that for every binary action, we have this tilde G tilde. Yes? So we want to show existence of this G tilde for any binary group action, which is no, with binary action defined by the previous formula. So we take We take some element of the group, and for each element of the group, we have this homeomorphism that is left multiplication by g and x. Yes? And we take the, well, well, they have inverse, we know what are the inverses because we have a binary group action, and we take the whole homomorphism. Group of X and with the compact open topology, and we have that this is a topological group because X is locally compact and locally connected. And so we take the group generated by these left multiplications. So that's the world expected thing. And we have this natural action. This group of homeomorphism on X. So the map from X to this continuous homeomorphism group is just the expected. Well, and so to construct a universal space, what happened is that the We said the right heart and the left side, they play a different role. The left hand side is a parameter. So it's like, yeah, it's just a parameter. We don't have any restriction. And the right-hand side is the space. So we need to change the. Well, we need to change the role of the x in the first coordinate. So, this is why we need to generalize to have something else, not x in here. So, this is a generalized action or a generalized isotopy in other papers. This was This was done by Pavel Georgian. But we took it for these results. So it's about the same, but we have T and X. So it's the usual multiplication and the usual condition on the neutral element. So, well, and this changed the well, we gained more flexibility on the equivariance. So the equivariance on these generalized actions allows to change the map on the left-hand side. That's the only difference. So we can take a more algebraic version in the left-hand side and more topological in the right-hand side. So we have, well, this is these categories. We have topological spaces, usual topological spaces with group actions, these new binary group actions. And the new category that we use to extend. So we will concentrate on constructing universal spaces for this category, but the space actually will belong to the other category, to this one. Okay. Okay. So we take some class of topological spaces, and CG will be the corresponding class for the same type of topological spaces with group action, with continuous group action, and C by G, the case of with binary group actions. Yes. Okay. So the class of ah, yeah, also we have the. Oh, okay. I missed the underlying space. So I will go back here. Yes, I didn't set. Let me see. Let me see. Okay, I forgot one definition. Well, if we have the conditions for the previous example, this one. Well, if we have this G tilde and this map from this map from the from f to from x to to the to to the continuous homomorphism from g to g tilde and our binary action is defined by this formula we said that we say that g is the underlying uh the underlying group of the of the action or that g that this g tilde x is the underlying um the underlying The underlying G-space of the binary action. Yes? Okay, so I go back to where we were. So we have these classes. And the last one is the one of spaces with underlying G tilde space. G tilde space with underlying g tilde space. So, okay. Well, maybe you all know that this, but a G space is called universal for the class C G. If every G space can be equivariantly embedded in this space, and a generalized G space is called universal with respect to the closed. Universal with respect to the class of the binary G spaces with underlying G tilde spaces if one if the space if each space of the class can be embedded equivariantly both in this in this category so y is not necessarily an object of the initial of the initial class well no no Well, no, that's a mistake. That's not necessarily an object in the class C B C B G G tilde, but the corresponding class in the category G G of generalized G space. So we have this the expected theorem for universal spaces. Universal spaces. We take ah, okay. If this class of G tilde spaces has a universal object, then the corresponding class of binary G spaces with underlying G tilde space also will have a universal object. Why? Okay, we take we take the We take the universal G space for this class and we define a generalized action on G over this continuous homomorphism group by this formula. So we take any, we will take, so you see this continuous homomorphism space will play the role of T. Of t so that's we why we needed to change the space because in the in the right-hand side we we need to have y so we take we define a generalized g action on on y over this space by just evaluating yeah just we take g on f and y On f and y is just evaluating f on g and multiplying by y. So now we show that this is universal. We take any binary G space with underlying space G tilde. And well, we already showed that there We showed that there was a continuous map from X to this continuous homomorphism space with this definition of the binary action. So, well, we already have an equivariant embedding of X on Y. On y, which is equivariant with the usual notion of equivariance. And well, we know that if we take this pair f, i, this define an equivalent embedding of x into y in the category g, gen g top, or in these generalized g spaces. spaces so we we just we just check uh e using the i using the the definition of the binary action we have equivariance and then well every everything was defined properly so we have this uh this embedding uh well this equivariance for the for the embedding so this shows that the generalized uh g space y over the over this space over the over this space so not not y itself but the this this other space with this with the action well with the action we we define it here sorry i was taking the some captures of the of the articles um well here is the oh sorry here is the the definition oh okay Okay, and well, this shows that we have a universal object for this class of binary G spaces. But, well, as I said, this result is not very satisfactory because we went out from the initial category. And well, one thing that one uses one... One thing that one uses when one does a group cohomology is to have a theory of homogeneous spaces and then we take we take this the category of homogeneous spaces and one makes a minimal construction and then one has something that to compute things or to try to translate to some algebraic To some algebraic, um, some algebraic notions, yeah. Well, that's why this was interesting for me because I'm not a general topologist. So, okay, okay. So, uh the thing to have a theory of homogeneous spaces, one one needs to know, to study the orbits of this new binary. These new binary G spaces. So for that, we need to, well, we define this subset of the space. We take just the expected. You just take the initial set and you multiply by all the elements of the group and elements in that set, all the pairs of elements in that set. Well, and in the case of the usual notions, and the orbits will be something like this, like G of a pair of points of what initially one point set. Or one, that will be the first thing one would think of. So. So what means to be invariant? Well, being variant is we take the well the whole G and the set and we should remain in the initial set, yes? So if X is a binary G space and we take a point, then the minimal B invariant subset of X containing that point, that will be the orbit. In one will denote by this x with the how do you call this parenthesis? I forgot brackets with brackets. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. So what happens is that if we take g here and x and repeat x, we don't get the same thing. Usually we don't get the minimal, the invariant subset. So. So, definition: a binary D action of the group G on the space X is called transitive if we have that the whole space, it's a notion of homogeneous spaces. If this set is parametrized by the elements of G, that coincides with X, yes? With X, yes? For any X or. So X is made of precisely one orbit and it does not depend on the point we choose. In this case, it is called a transitive binary space. Well, usually when one has transitive actions and homogeneous spaces and they are the same, but this doesn't happen. But this doesn't have to be here. So we have a proposition that, well, it says, well, it explains how our transitive spaces are made. So we take, well, for compact group, we take a compact group and a closed normal subgroup. Then we take the cosette space and we define a binary action by the, well, you already. By the, well, you already noticed that we can use conjugation. So we just conjugate by the by the by g on the on the left-hand side, or and that give us the binary action. Well, there are so a property that is distributivity. Well, you know distributivity from multiple You know, distributivity for multiplication and addition, for example. This is something like that, but it holds where we can interchange operations. And that holds for any points. So it's like, it's not the same as usual distributivity. Oh, yes. Well, I didn't check. Okay. So let GBA call. Let G be a compact group. So any transitive distributive binary G space is bio echimorphic to this binary space we just defined. So we have this characterization. And what we see is that, or maybe transitive spaces will not be the same as, well, spaces with transitivity will not. With transitivity will not be the same as all the homogeneous spaces for these actions. I won't show this. It's very straightforward. Just need to, well, it's not that difficult. So what is a more homogeneous spaces for homogeneous space for these actions? Space for these actions. Well, this is uh, we take um, well, it will be that this space is the same as the as the orbit of one point, yes? So if the orbit of one point is x, uh, and if that point, well, if that if there is a point in the space such that uh the orbit of that that space is the whole space, uh, the space is. Space, the space is called homogeneous. What X is called a stabilization point of X. And what happens is that the stabilization, not every point is a stabilization point. So we may have other points in the same space which orbits are smaller. Orbits don't partition. Don't partition. They intersect. So we have to check. We have to take care of that. Yeah, so this is an example. We take the group Z, X the same Z, and we take just the binary action is just, we multiply for the left-hand side and add with the second. Well, we will show that this is homogeneous for x equal to one. For x equals one, well, that is a stabilization point because we just take, well, just take anything. Well, we just, well, we take x equal to one, we have some n here, and we have all the old integer numbers. So, but if we take But if we take x equal to zero, zero, well, we have zero, zero here. And well, in here, in the right-hand side, we already had zero. So we have zero, and that's not the whole space. Yeah? Okay. So So we have that any any homogeneous distributive binary space, any homogeneous distributive binary G space is transitive. We can show that, but that's not the case. The other way around is not true. Okay, so well. Well, I will speak about this result that homogeneous binary G spaces are topologically homogeneous spaces in the sense that there is a homomorphism joining every two points. Just to show some notations and the things one, well, how one builds the orbits of these spaces. So for the well, we begin with what point. So, one will expect that that point, if we take the orbit, the orbit of that point would be the whole space. But how to construct the orbit? So, we take this set, it will be the first step. And then, by induction, we have we take. We take the all the orbit of that set, well, not the orbit, but all the translates of the initial set. So we have this sequence of sets in, well, the first one notices is that the orbit is just the union. The union, the orbit of the point is just the union of this set. So one, by assumption, what we know for some X is that X is this union. So I didn't put the other part of the proof. So one The proof. So one just assumes by induction that one can connect this GN with the previous one. And well, because, but they are all translates, so they, well, we just take two maps to connect them, and we have this, the, well, by induction, we have the homeomorphism joining the two points. Sorry for. The two points. Sorry for I didn't put it in here. So we have now to describe the orbits, we consider this sequence of sets. And well, we would have, well, we have that in the distributive transitive case, well, this sequence stopped at the first step. So we define what when the sequence stops stabilizes at one step, we will have that the space has the stabilization property of that at that step at the at the given point. Yes, sorry. So that's what is written here. A binary G space says to have the stabilization property at the end state. The end step at the end step at the point x, or that this space stabilizes at that point of at the end step, if we have the g n is the whole space, but the previous one didn't coincide with the space. With, well, this G N is just, sorry, it's just this. This this uh this set okay no sorry it's not that set is this one ah it was really the mutation sorry okay so we have we know this homogeneous distributive binary spaces have this stabilization property at step one Property at step one. That's what it's just a translation of the previous result. But let's see some examples. Well, that was a question. Are there all the steps covered? We can find examples of all the steps, or we can find examples of spaces that not stabilize at any step. Stabilize at any step. So, well, they think that's all we have. We have just examples. Yeah. So, this is an example of stabilization at the step? Ah, steps one and two. So, we consider, for example, the cyclic group on five elements, and we can take well. And we can take uh well we can take uh well with this additive group and we take uh we take also that as the group and we take uh powers of of of the of elements and we check what happens, yes. Uh so for example the orbit of the of one is the whole the whole space, yeah, we can. Yeah, we can take, well, you can check it. Therefore, the binary G space stabilizes at step one at this point. But in the other hands, we can compute the same for the second point. And we have that this translates, but are only two points. Yes? And we take the second one. we take the the second one and we have we have the the whole step so the binary space uh stabilizes at the at point at step two at the point two so well that's the an example of the what what you asked yeah so the orbits are these strange things okay well we we have this stabilization We have the stabilization at step three. We take a six-element symmetric group. Well, with this presentation generated by two elements of order two and the multiplication has order three. This is a finite group. So we can check that this is the whole group in this case. And that the last this last element is the same that, well, that's that the generators multiplied in the other way. So we consider this the group generated by the first generator of and we define this binary action by conjugating but wrong. Wrong, wrongly conjugated, not with the inverse on the right, but in the left. Yeah, so one can compute that the first translates are, well, this set to just to two points, the second is four points, and the third will be the whole space. So we have stabilization at step three. three so well this is a way of of well one can take other symmetric groups with similar presentations and just to to to hope to to find new examples of of stabilization at other points but one could ask well they stabilize because your your space is finite Your space is finite. Yeah? So they will stabilize at some point. So that raises another question. So we have stabilization for non-finite spaces. Yeah. Well, this example was done by Georgian with his colleague, I forgot the name, Iliad. I forgot the name, Iliadis. So this is stabilization at step at, oh, well, that is not stabilization or what? Well, this is not stabilization. We take an infinite group and we assume that we have two elements. Actually, this was shown before, and I took that idea in a finite group. In a finite group to construct the previous example. So, well, we want, yes, order two for the elements, but the product of infinite order. So it's similar. They construct this with matrices, but it is not needed to do it with matrices. not needed to to do it with matrices you just can take these conditions and show that that this this space does not that does not stabilize but what this is uh well it's like the same the same sample it's discrete yeah so so one would like to have a non-discrete example so and what kind of oh So, and what kind of, well, I was trying to make like general models for the for this stabilization, like to take just copies of G and then to check how the group could act there. But I didn't get anything from that. Maybe it can be done, but I couldn't get. But, well, actually, the example is just of stabilization. Of stabilization at the end step for non-discrete spaces for any n, it was already there. So one just need to check usual construction and the construction is spherical coordinates. It's the way I think historically that that might be the way they constructed spherical coordinates. constructed spherical coordinates in the in the first place. You would like to take to cover the whole space by rotations. So for translations and rotations. So you take one point. Yeah. Oh, this is the formula I'll show. Well, I work in a pedagogical university. And pedagogical university, so I use some tools, some extra tools. So I'll show you. This is the well, this is the the group is R, is the real numbers, and then we take X, Rn, and the binary action will be defined by this formula. Yes, we take the group, just a real number, and then we take, well, well like the well any well the crossing of the of the of the first coordinate of the of the left hand side and then y the first coordinate of the second and well we continue in the same way as as spherical coordinates yeah so why does does this this uh stabilizes for For ah, this stabilizes for the point for the origin. This example has a stabilization property at the end step at the origin. So how we will begin with the origin and we well the first the first part is just if you check we are just translating by by a real a real number and the other the other And the other the other coordinate, well, the angle it doesn't matter. We are in a line. So for the first step, we have the line, and then we take the line, we rotate an angle of p, of pi. Yeah, we rotate by the... We rotate by this first coordinate. So we cover the whole plane. And we have the plane now. So again, we rotate. We have the space and so on. So that's it. You can just take spherical coordinates and you have stabilization at any point. But the question. The question about all the orbits and the theory of homogeneous spaces is not answered. So we cannot construct, use Milner construction to have a concrete model for the universal space. So thank you. Thank you so much for the next talk. Do we have questions from Zoom participants? Okay, are there any questions from Zoom participants? Okay, maybe no questions there. Do we have questions from? Do we have questions from this room? So I'm not sure I followed very closely, but these formulas for these binary actions kind of remind me of formulas one sees, well, I guess in quantum algebra. So I guess I'm wondering if there's some notion of like binary linear actions and maybe. And maybe, you know, if you assume the action is in some sense linear, I'm not quite sure what that would mean. Like, X is a vector space and G is on X times X. But I think I maybe even really want some special cases of that. But it seems like maybe this formalism would like. Well, the first examples are the example of an infinitely generated orbit was definite using matrices and Using mattresses and usual mattresses, okay. So maybe it's you that's what you would like, but I don't know. Somehow, I mean, it'd be hard to explain without showing you what I had in mind, I guess. But it like what is your formulas look similar to formulas I've seen where maybe the formulas I've seen in quantum algebra are like maybe examples of something like a projective linear binary action. Binary action of a finite group. But I don't know. Maybe we can talk more. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I have a commentary. I didn't, I haven't checked what, well, anything about manifolds, but of course, one could think of manifolds with binary actions. I don't know what that will that will be closer to this conference. Conference. No more questions. Then let's thank Kita again.
