The organizer for hosting this workshop. And I've been very much enjoying the talk. And it's my pleasure to join and present MTAR, a framework developed in our lab for the multi-trait analysis of rare variant association summary statistics. So a little bit of background here. The genetic association studies aim to identify association. Aim to identify association of genotype with a disease or trait of interest. In the traditional GWAS, people mostly apply single variant analysis to one common SNP at a time. But it's well known that this approach is underpower for analyzing sequencing data in a genome-wide analysis, where most of the variants are rare or have low minor allele frequency. The SNP set analysis on Set analysis, on the other hand, jointly analyze multiple variants in a group, for example, all the axon variants in the gene or all the SNPs in the biological pathway. So these methods are commonly used for association testing of rare variants in particular. And the SNP set analysis can increase the statistical power by aggregating the small and moderate effects across multiple variants. Across multiple variants. The burden test and the SCAD test are two representative methods for SNP set analysis. The burden test create a burden score for each individual SNP and then for each subject by collapsing those SNPs and then test the mean effects of the burden score. And the SCAD is a variance component test. Variance component test. It basically assumes the effects of multiple variance are random variables with a variance component parameter and tests if this variance component parameters is zero or not. The burden tests are more powerful when the association effects are in different variants are similar, whereas the scat is more powerful when the effects are in opposite direction or the number of In opposite direction, or the number of causal variants is small relative to the neutral variance. And the third method, the SCAD-O, is a unified test that combines this burden test and the SCAT test. I will mention more about that SCAT-O in a later slide. So, for the previous GWAS results, we learned that a single SNP or the gene can often influence. Or the gene can often influence multiple diseases and traits. And the multi-trait analysis that combines the association evidence across traits can increase the statistical power over the single trait analysis, especially if the associations are weak in the individual trait. In recent years, people have investigated genetic overlap for many pairs of complex traits and diseases and estimate a measure called genetic correlation. Correlation. So basically, this measured genetic correlation reflects the overall similarity of the genetic architecture between the traits. And this information could be useful to guide the development of the new multi-trade association test. And nowadays, these genetic correlation values for many trade pairs can be conveniently queried from the public databases. So there are many multi-trade associations. Multi-trade association analysis method available, but most of them are for testing one single variant at a time. So in more recent years, several multi-trait, multivariant methods have been developed, but none of the existing methods leverage this genetic correlation information, as far as we know. Also, the existing methods have several limitations that That hinder their application in large-scale sequencing studies. So, this table listed the multi-traded multivariate methods that we're aware of and also their features. So, the first features we investigate is whether the method is designed for rare variant analysis. So, you can see here that several methods, such as meta-SUP set, Meta-SUP set, Meta-CCA, MGAS. So these methods are designed for common variants and may not be suitable for analyzing the low frequency variant. And the second feature is whether the method uses summary statistics of association. So comparing with methods that require individual level phenotype genotype data using the summary statistics help us better protect the Help us better protect the study participant privacy, also reduce the logistic difficulties and computational burden. So we see here that many methods actually require the individual level data rather than utilizing the summary statistics. And the third feature we look at is whether these methods can adjust for arbitrary sample overlap across trades. So the sample overlap is quite prevalent in the multi-trade analysis. Multi-trade analysis, sometimes the overlap pattern is quite clear. Say, all the traits are measured in the same set of individuals, or the trades are like shared, the controls are shared by all the trades. But sometimes the sample overlap is quite elusive, like the public domain may only provide you with the summary statistics across studies for individual trait. So we don't know. So, we don't know how many samples may overlap in different traits because we don't have access to the individual level data. And most of these multi-trait methods cannot handle an arbitrary and possibly unknown sample overlap. And the last feature we look at is whether these methods can compute p-value fast. Some methods rely on permutation and Monte Carlo simulation, this intensive computational. Intensive computationally intensive approach to get the p-value, which is quite time-consuming for the genome-wide analysis. And NTAR has a unique combination of these good features, and it's desirable for practical use. So, I think the main challenge of multi-trade, multi-variant analysis is how to flexibly accommodate a wise. Flexibly accommodate a wide spectrum of genetic architecture among traits and among variants, such that your tests would achieve robust and high power. And the genetic architecture is unknown in priori and likely different from one gene to another across the genome and from one trait to another. So the effect structures among the rare variants within a gene have been well studied in those. Within a gene have been well studied in those SNP set association tests I mentioned before. The burden test and the SCAD, like I said, are the most popular rare variant SNP set association tests. They represent the two main patterns of genetic effects across the rare variants. So the burden test assumes the effects across the variants are largely homogeneous, whereas the SCAD assume they are heterogeneous. And the SCAD-O unifies this SCAD and the burden test and achieve robustness by considering different degrees of effect heterogeneity. So the SCAD-O in particular use a uniform correlation coefficient to model the degree of similarity among variants. The effects on multiple traits may also exhibit homogeneous and heterogeneous patterns. However, the degree of effects are not a very important thing. However, the degree of effect similarity are likely to be different from one trait pair to another. For example, for the pair of traits that are biologically more relevant, such as the triglyceride and HDL, we expect they share more causal variants and have higher level of genetic effect similarity than the trait pairs that are less relevant. So it's not adequate to just use a So, it's not adequate to just use a uniform correlation coefficient to model this degree of similarity for all the trait pairs, and this motivates us to consider using this genetic correlation and to guide us the specification of the effect similarity across traits. So, here's the overview of the effect structure we consider in the MTAR framework. So, MTAR. So, MTAR is built upon a random effect meta-analysis model that used different correlation structures of the genetic effects to represent a wide spectrum of association patterns across trait and across variants. And here, to model the genetic effects of cross-variants, MTAR employs this basically the same strategy. The same basic strategy as the SCAD O. So it assumes the effects are random variables with an exchangeable correlation, and different levels of heterogeneity can be considered by changing this correlation coefficient to note here as row one. And then to model the effect heterogeneity on multiple traits, the mTAR leveraged this genetic correlation. So here we propose two structures based on the genetic correlation. Structure based on the genetic correlation. The first structure allows the effect similarity to change from the genetic correlation to completely heterogeneous as the extreme case. So here, completely heterogeneous means the effects are completely random. It can be positive or negative and can have different magnitude. And we turn this test INTAR test. And the second structure allows And the second structure allows this between-trait effect similarity to change from the genetic correlation to completely homogeneous, as the extreme case. And we term this test CMTAR test. And in both structures, we have this parameter row two that controls the contribution from the genetic correlation. So by considering different values of row one and row two, we basically cover a wide spectrum of effects. Basically, we cover a wide spectrum of effect patterns across variants and across traits. And besides these effect patterns across traits, we also consider a pattern where only a small number of traits are associated with the variants. We call this sparse alternative. So, this association patterns naturally occur for the genes that have very specific biological functions, and in fact, very few trains. And in fact, very few traits in our list. And to accommodate this pattern, we basically construct another task called CCTP, which combines the single variant association test p-values. And finally, to achieve robustness and improve the overall power, we combine the p-values of IMTAR, CMTAR, and CCTP and get an omnibus test called MTAR-O. So, here I will briefly talk about the statistical model behind MTAR. So, suppose we have M, number of rare variants in the given gene, and BK is the number of traits, and we're interested in testing the association of variants with these traits. So, the beta one, beta two, to beta k here are the vectors of true genetic effects. True genetic effects on this K-trace. So each beta have a length of M for M SNP. And the beta hat are the corresponding effect estimates. And we are interested in testing the null hypothesis that these variants are not associated with any of the K traits. So all the effects across the traits are equal to zero under the null. And the multivariate test for this hypothesis have very large degrees of freedom and lead to low statistical power. Statistical power. We further assume that this true effect beta are random variables with covariance matrix sigma, small sigma times a matrix B, where this small sigma is the variance component parameters and B is a pre-specified matrix representing our speculated pattern of genetic effect among traits and variants. So the null hypothesis under this model become testing this single parameter, this very variant. Parameter, this variance component parameter, small sigma, equal to zero. So in this model, as you can see, we have two covariance matrices, this big sigma and this B matrix. So this big sigma is the covariance of these beta estimates, and the B matrix is the covariance of the true effect beta. And the big sigma reflects the correlation due to the positive. Due to the positive sample overlap among traits and linkage disequilibrium among variants. And we need to estimate this big sigma, and the accuracy of the estimate would affect the validity of the test. The matrix B, on the other hand, reflect the similarity of the true effects among traits and variants. This information is unknown in priori, so B needs to be pre-specified. If the specification reflects the true genetic architecture, Reflects the true genetic architecture, then the power of the test can be greatly improved. If not, it would reduce the power, but would not affect the validity of the test. So this is our model and the null hypothesis. Next, I will talk about how we get this beta hat, this effect estimate, how to estimate this big sigma, and how to specify the B matrix. So, for the red variance association study, the beta estimate is often constructed by using the score statistics and their covariance estimate. So, this is a pretty standard practice in analysis of sequencing data. And I won't go into the detail, but only pointing out that this summary statistics can be efficiently obtained by fitting a genotype-independent regression model once for all the genes in the genome, or they can. Or they can be easily constructed using the information routinely shared in the public domains. If different traits are measured on different sets of sample, then this beta hat, this beta estimator process traits are independent. So this big sigma matrix is essentially a block diagonal matrix. But if the different traits are measured on the fully or partially overlapping set of samples, then the beta estimate. Then the beta estimate across traits are not independent. And here we derived a formula to estimate their correlation. And all the ingredients in this formula can be obtained from the trace-specific summary statistics and not require accessing the individual level data. And finally, we need to specify this big matrix B. As we mentioned earlier, the test will have optimal power. The test will have optimal power if this specification reflects the true genetic architecture. Here, to separately model the genetic structure among traits and among variants, we propose to formulate B as the chronicle product of two matrices, B1 and B2. So B1 is the effect covariance among traits. I'm sorry, B1 is the effect covariance among variants, and B2 is the effect covariance among traits. Covariance among traits. So we describe here the structure of B1 and B2 using this diagram in the previous slide, and here are just their mathematical formula. So I just want to reiterate that in B1, we have a parameter, row one, that controls the effect similarity level across variants. And in B2, we have two structures, IMTAR and CMTAR, and both structure have this parameter row 2. Both structures have this parameter row two that controls the genetic correlation guided effect similarity across the traits. So, for a given value of row one and row two, if row one and row two were known, then the test statistics would take this form. So, it follows a mixture of chi-square distribution, and we can use Davis' methods to calculate its p-value analytically. Analytically. And because these optimal values of row one and row two are unknown, we propose to search a grid of different values and combine the corresponding test p-values using coaching methods. The prior research have shown that the coaching methods is a very fast approach to combine multiple correlated p-values without the need for using like the computational intensive approach to account for their correlation. Account for their correlation. And it's very accurate to get the combined p-value. So, in this method, each p-value, individual p-values, is converted into Cauchy statistics. Then these statistics were aggregated through direct summation and then converted to a single p-value on the basis of the Cauchy distribution. So, going back to this overview, we can combine the p-value of We can combine the p-value across different grid of values of row one and row two and produce the IMTAR and the CMTAR test p-value. And also to accommodate the situation where the SNPs are associated with the small number of traits, the sparse alternative, we combine the single trait p-value from SCAD and the burden test and produce this CCTP test p-value. Test p-value. And then we further aggregate this p-value from the IMTAR, CMTAR, and CCTP, and get an omnibus test. We call it NTAR-O. We have conducted extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of NTAR and compare them with the existing methods. But here I just want to focus on the real data analysis in the interest of time. Of time. So here we analyzed the summary statistics from the GLGC project on the three lipid traits, the LDL, HDL, and the triglyceride. So the data set includes about 300,000 individuals of primarily European ancestry from multiple cohorts. And the genotype data comes from a whole exome C. Data comes from whole axome sequencing. So, in our analysis, we considered rare variants with minor allele frequency less than 5%, and we ended up with 15, about 15,000 genes that contain at least two rare variants. So in the MTAR test, we used the previously reported genetic correlation estimates among these three lipid traits, HDL, LDL, and triglyceride. Specifically, the genetic Specifically, the genetic correlation is negative 0.6 for the trait pair HDL and triglyceride. That's a pretty strong negative correlation. And it's 0.35 for the pair LDL and triglyceride. That's a moderate positive correlation. And 0.09 for the LDL and HDL. And for comparison, we also performed a single trait-based analysis. Also, we performed a single trade-based analysis in which we basically combine the single trade p-values, single-trade analysis p-values using either the coaching methods denoted here as CCTP or the Bonferroni corrected minimum p-value methods denoted here as MIM-P. So, the M-TAR test identify 139 genes, and the single trait-based test identify 99 genes and 41 genes. Genes and 41 genes were exclusively identified by mTAR test. Here there's one gene missed by the mtar, but its mtar op value is actually quite close to the significance threshold. In addition, we apply an existing multi-trait methods called MTA-SPUSET methods. We apply these methods because it does not require individual level data. Require individual level data as we only have access to the summary statistics. So, this test identifies only 62 significant genes. Here we show the Manhattan plot of NTARO and the mean P test. The 41 genes highlighted in red are those exclusively discovered by NTAR tests. And it clearly shows that the multi-trait analysis is able to combine weak. Able to combine weak signals across traits and boost the discovery power. We also investigate how helpful it is to incorporate this genetic correlation information. So we first look into like those p-values across different correlation parameter row one and row two under CMTAR and IMTAR correlation structure. And we found that over 60% of the discovered gene Of the discovered gene have the smallest p-value when row 2 is large. So remember, row 2 reflects a contribution of the genetic correlation in this matrix, B matrix. So this observation suggests that the genetic correlation is informative to guide the effect similarity among traits. And we also try to not use this genetic correlation in our analysis. And if we were not using Analysis. And if we were not using this information in NTAR, we will miss 22 significant genes in this analysis. Here we highlight four example genes that represent different association patterns across traits and variants. So in each heat map, one row is for one trait and one column is for one SNP. And the value in the cell shows the negative log 10 p-value for testing the effects of the SNP. Effects of the SNP at the column with the trait at row. So the red and blue color represent the positive or negative z-score, and the darker the color represent more significant p-value. Let's first focus on this particular gene. So in this gene, the association patterns among traits are generally consistent with their genetic correlations. So remember that the genetic So remember that the genetic correlation between HDL and triglyceride is negative, and the genetic correlation between LDL and triglyceride is positive. So the degree of effect similarity across trade in this gene is really closely dictated by the genetic correlation value. So in this case, the CNTAR and INTAR test both produce quite similar. Both produce quite similar significant p-values. So, in this example, we can see that this between trait effects are largely homogeneous. So, in this case, the CMTAR test will give the smallest p-value. Here, when the effects of cross-trait are strongly heterogeneous and not dictated by the genetic correlation, Correlation, the IMTAR test will produce the smallest p-value. And finally, when the gene is only associated with one trait, the single trait-based analysis will give the smallest p-value. And the omnibus test, MTARO, has the p-values that's closest to the small, that's close to the smallest p-value among all the tests in this identified gene because it combines. By gene, because it combines this complementary test that covers all these association patterns. So, we also investigate the functions of these identified lipid-associated genes. And many of the NTAR-identified gene have an established role in the three lipid traits. And among the 41 genes exclusively identified by NTAR, 27 of them have previously reported evidence, association evidence. Association evidence with at least one of the three lipid traits, and 20 of them are associated with at least two lipid traits. And to replicate the association of the gene without any existing association evidence, we applied the MTARO test to an independent UK Biobank GWAS data. We analyzed 11 genes with a cumulative minority count greater than 10 in the UK Biobank data, and 7 out of 11 were successfully replicated. out of 11 were successfully replicated. And these seven validated MTAR discovered genes may have causal impact on the lipid traits. For example, this PNPLA2, which encode the enzyme APAS triglyceridelipus, ATGL, and this enzyme is involved in the breakdown of triglyceride. Although the variants associated with PNPLA2 have not been reported to directly link with any of the three lipid traits in humans, Three lipid traits in humans, the ATGL knocked out mice display altered LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels. So, in summary, yeah. Sorry, I was just going to say two minutes to wrap it up, but I'll speed up. In summary, we have developed this MTOM framework to perform multi-trait and multivariate association tests. The method leverages the genetic correlation and considers. Leverage the genetic correlation and consider a wide spectrum of architecture across the traits and across the variants to achieve robustness and high power. And there are many important features that make it desirable for practical use. For example, it can correct for arbitrary sample overlap across traits. It only requires summary statistics and have fast computation. And this method has been implemented in the MTAR-R package available on Crane.
