Geometry. So, I will fix an algebraically closed field, and in most examples, this field will have characteristic zero, and a scheme will be locally of a finite type over k. In particular, all my schemes are locally in Ethereum, and I have no problem defining coherent. Have no problem defining coherent sheaves. And I would like to start by referring to a lecture we had yesterday. Namely, yesterday we saw the problem of counting lines on a cubic surface. And we saw that the solution was as follows. First, we took the Grasmanian, I'll just write it G for the moment to be quicker later, the moduli space or parameter space of lines in P3. And then on this G, we can construct a rank for bar. A rank 4 bundle E, which basically over every line is the space of cubic forms on the line, and F induces a section of E over G, because at every point we get the restriction of F to that line, and then we can call F. And then we can call X the scheme theoretic zero locus. And this is the natural scheme structure, if you want. This is the moduli of lines on F equals zero. And since this so this G has is a smooth projective of dimension four. Dimension four. So locally, I have four coordinates and four equations because I have the zero locus of a section of a rank 4 bundle. So this means that we expect x has expected dimension 0, which is 4 minus 4. You start with a four-dimensional thing and you put four equations. Dimensional thing, and you put four equations, but of course, it needn't be. And what we were taught yesterday is that if dim x is zero, so the expected dimension, then the degree of x is twenty-seven. And basically, my whole course. Basically, my whole course will be devoted to the following question. What if it isn't? So, what if the dimension of X is not zero? And I will start with one example, just to give you a feeling. You could take F as the equation. As the equation, the cone over a smooth cubic curve. So this means that f is a degree three polynomial in three variables, not four. And so what is in this case, of course I am not good at drawing, but basically you get something like Something like this. Hope you have a good imagination. All these lines meet in a point. And this is the vertex. And so, set theoretically, what are the lines contained in here? Well, as a set, let me call C this curve. As a set, X is just C because for every C, because for every point I have the line. But the first thing you can do if you are a student and like to do calculation is to do an exercise and check that X has a double structure everywhere. And so by double structure. And so by double structure, I mean that et al locally or analytically locally, it looks like say K of UV modulo V squared. So it's a smooth curve, but with a double structure. And at the node, at the flexis, it has It has an embedded triple point and embedded. So, if you are at all familiar with a reduced line with an embedded double point at the origin, it's the same thing, but one higher. And so, what about in this case? So, it's a very rich structure. And the intersection theory, and by intersection theory, I mean the book of Fulton, which describes the theory produced by Fulton and MacPherson. You get that from because Because x is the zero locus of SF, there is a natural class an induced class in GCH zero of x of degree. Of degree 27. So that when you take the zero locus and the zero locus is bigger, it still carries a chow class of the dimension you want. Notice that this is more information saying that there is a canonical induced class. It's more than just having the degree because the chow group of a scheme is the same as the chow group of the reduced scheme. Same as the chow group of the reduced scheme, so in this case, it's a chow group of an elliptic curve, and the chow group of an elliptic curve in degree zero is non-trivial, because two points on an elliptic curve are not rationally equivalent. And in fact, it turns out that the cycle is three times the sum of the flexes. In case you wonder. So, the point is that what really contributes is this extra structure at the plexus. Okay, so this is so the question we want to address is what kind of, of course, this is a very explicit case. It's well known since the book is from the early 80s. So, our question, which we will study. Another question which we will study is: What are natural structures on moduli spaces that share such features that allow us similar results? And of course, this will require what first of all, we will have to exactly look what we mean at moduli spaces or parameter spaces. And then we the other very big thing is what natural structures are we talking about. Yes? That is zero cycle from X, not indigenous minimum X. No. That is a precise. That is precise. So, Fulton goes into very big pains to show that he really gets a cycle on X and not on the Grasmanian. Now, because when you're back on the Grasmanian, of course, all the information you have is a number, because the zero start group of the Grasmanian is Z, I hope, over an algebraically closed field. Thank you. But the difference is precisely that. The difference is precisely that we have it on the curve. And so, of course, all of this will have. In fact, the first thing I will do is I will not properly define moduli spaces. I will just hand wave about them and we'll focus on the case of moduli spaces of coherent sheaves. And I will tell you in a moment which ones. ones and then we will spend the possibly the end of today's lecture and certainly the next two to approximate what we mean by what is natural what structures are natural in what sense so let me start by discussing what is a modularized i think we have all seen the definition of the grassmannian given Grasmanian given explicity as a variety or as a manifold, depending where you studied what you studied first by charts, or you can view it directly as a projective variety by the Pluker embedding. But the other way to describe the Grasmanian, so example, if you take the Grasmanian of R-dimensional subspaces. Subspaces and V is a fixed finite dimensional vector space. We have a different way to define it, which is as follows. Well, first of all, there is, as was mentioned, there is a universal. Universal sub-bundle. So, this is a trivial bundle on the Grasmanian, I will still call it G. And this means over every point you take itself. And so, for any S scheme. S scheme and for every phi from S to G, you can pull back and you get answerable V of O S. And so you get the map from the morphisms from S to G to this. To the set of F inside P tensor OS rank R sub bundle, not subshiff, really sub bundle, so that the quotient is also a bundle of the complementary rank. And this map is bijective and functorial, so it behaves well under composition of maps. Composition of maps. So, what I like to do is, I like to see such a sub-bundle as this I view as a family of R-dimensional subspaces of G parametrized by S. And now what you can do is you Now, what you can do is you can use the word UNEDA lemma if you are familiar with it, or you can use the word functor of points if you are familiar with it, which means instead of looking at every scheme, you just look at affine schemes. But the final result is that this part of the blackboard describes the Grasmanian as much as the topological space with a sheaf of rings. Space with a sheaf of rings and the sheaf of K algebras. Yes, yes. Yeah, this is the kind of thing I do. This is going to happen again and again. And so, my idea of how to do modular spaces will be: there will be some. There will be something called the fine moduli space, which will mean that for every S scheme, I associate isomorphism classes or not isomorphism classes of families parametrized by By S. And with this pullback property, again, if you want, it's a contravariant functor, which is a sheaf in whatever Grotendieck topology you are interested in. But if you are not familiar with this, the easiest thing is to say, okay, I just look at all these families and either there is a universal one, so one which canonical induced. One which canonical induces every other, in which case I have a font moduli space and it's well defined up to you canonical isomorphism, or I don't, and then, but I still, as we shall see, we still get something we can study in appropriate sense. But anyway, in some cases, this will not work. And so instead, I will be able to work with a moduli stack. So, moduli stack is what happens when you notice that if you try this, you don't get a fine moduli space. And typically, the problem comes from these killing isomorphisms. For instance, if instead of producing sub-bundles of a given bundle, you just want to produce bundles. And you see, if you have a scheme with an option. A scheme with an open cover. To define a morphism, it's enough to define it on every open and check that's the same on the interception. But if you have bundles, even if you do a cover with two open sets and you have a bundle on one and the bundle on the other, it's not enough to say they're isomorphic intersection I can glue. It depends on your choice of the isomorphism, which means in this case, killing the isomorphisms means you can't do things right. Can't do things right, you have to remember, and so for some reason, the word you use to say, I don't want to forget isomorphisms, I will cherish them and honor them, is stack. And in French, it's shon. And in this case, it's the same thing, and it goes into families comma isomorphisms of family. Of families. So let me give you an example of this. If you fix X scheme, you can define families of coherent sheaves on X as follows: a family. Over parametrized by a scheme S is just a coherent sheaf on X times S, which is flat over S and there. And the fact that this is, and an isomorphism is an isomorphism as coherent sheets. And of course, if you have such a thing and you have a map from S1 to S, well, then you have an induced map from X times S1 to X times S. And you can pull back the family by just saying I pull back via alpha twiddle, and the flatness remains. The question why you want flatness is mysterious to me. I tend to do it in the case where x is projective, and then flatness basically just means that every fiber has the same Hilbert polynomial if the basis is reduced. If the basis is Is reduced if the basis is not as the same but locally, the Hilbert polynomial is locally constant. This is equivalent if the basis is reduced, otherwise you have to do something a little bit more, but not much more. And it turns out that if fact fact means something I will not attempt to prove, but hopefully I will manage to make some notes in which I ga give hints about it. In which I give hints about this, the fact is that if X is rejective, then a co X with families defined in this way is an algebraic stack in the sense of Arting. And it has it is the disjoint union over possible Hilbert polynomial, but also other invariants like generic rank and so on. So you get the So, you get by, I will not define what an algebraic stack is, but it just means you can do geometry. And we will go back to this. So, if this looks weird, it just means you are permitted to work with these families and do geometry with families. So, of course, the next question is: so, this is how notice that here I've talked to you about fine modular space. You about find moduli space, and you can ask what is that fine doing there. And in fact, there are a number of alternatives. For instance, there's a notion of coarse moduli space, and then there is something even weaker, which is a good moduli space or GIT quotient. It's basically the same thing. And we will hopefully go back to this, but not today and see how what we have, but for now. But for now, what I want to say is that in some sense, this is both a very natural approach, but also a very weird one, because we don't know anything. The only thing we know, so for me, by the way, a point in a scheme, when I don't say anything, a point will mean a k-valued point, or if you want a closed point, since everything is. Closed point since everything is of finite type, and so in particular, the points of my moduli are the families parametrized by a point, and they are just the coherent sheaves. So, at least as a set, I get the points, the coherent sheaves, and their isomorphism. And so, again, if one wants to be technical, one can throw in the word groupoid, which means. The word groupoid, which means that this is a groupoid, because it means I have something and then I consider isomorphisms among them, not just arbitrary maps. But basically, this is what we are saying. So, this was all very abstract. So, let's immediately go back to something more concrete. So, example, if you take X. X projective scheme and you take E coherent on X and you fix P here you fix O X of one ample on X at the P Hilbert polynomial then you can play a similar Can play a similar trick to what we have done here and define you want P X E to be given by the following families by saying that a family of Over S is an S subsheaf now of PX pullback of E where on X cross S, where of course Px is the projection. Action to X such that the quotient is flat over S with Hilbert polynomial P and the Grasmanian. And the Grasmanian, the what we did, GRV is the quad scheme of spec A of V. V is a finite dimensional vector space, so it's a coherent sheaf. And if you like these things, you can check what P is. P is. It's not very difficult. It's a number, and you can find out what it is. And notice that this condition, that what is flat is not the subshift, but the quotient, is exactly the mirror of the condition I had here, that this is not just a sub sheaf, but a sub-bundle, which means the quotient is a bundle. And for a coherent sheaf, And for a coherent sheaf to be flat over the base of the sheaf itself means that it's locally free. So that is the picture. And we have a particular case which is interesting, which is that the Hilber scheme of Of X is the quad of the structure sheet. And so it parametrizes closed subschemes with fixed Hilbert polynomial. And of course, for this, we have defined families, but we don't know that what we are doing is really a scheme. Just like if we define Just like if we define a topological space and put on it a sheaf of rings or a sheaf of k algebras, well, it either is a scheme or it's not. If it's a scheme, we have determined it, but we first have to prove it. But in this case, you don't have to prove it. It's a theorem. I usually think it's a theorem of Grottendig, but I certainly haven't read any of the original, which says that what? Whereby is means that there exists a projective scheme with a family of quotients which is universal. Any other family is obtained as pullback via a unique map, exactly as for Degasmania. For diagrams, meaning. And so this is extremely satisfactory in a sense. You have produced the schemes out of thin air just by, you know, evoking rotendik. It is also extremely disappointing because you don't know what anything about this. So, how about we try to, if you are the kind of person, some people are extremely happy with this, don't need to see any examples. But if you are the person that likes, But if you are the person that likes this example, okay. Who was it said it would take pictures? Yes, can you take the pictures now? So that because I will then erase the oh, took it already. You are super efficient. Thank you. Okay. Okay, so now we will go and work out some examples. Actually, we will not work out anything. I will just tell you what to expect. Well, the first example is you take any X. Any X projective scheme and E a locally free sheaf for X and then you take as you can show that what X E one one is a One, one is a polynomial, is just a projectivization of E or the projectivization of E dual, depending which convention you use for what is the projectivization of a vector boundary. Another thing you can check is that if X is a smooth projective curve and N is in N, then indeed the what the Hilbert N X is just Is just the symmetric power. And if this is too abstract, just do the case x is equal to p1. And then you just get polynomials of degree n, and this form up to scalar and this form a pn. And a bit higher in dimension. Higher in dimension, if you take the Hilbert scheme of two points in P2, you can embed it into P5 times P2. This is the projectivization of A T times T symmetric matrix. And this, of course, is a projectivization of Of K3. And what is this inclusion? This is just the set of pairs AV such that AV is equal to zero. Notice that, let me check, I get, okay, this is wrong, so don't worry, I must have. Ah, yeah, no, this is right. You see, these are actually three equations. Actually, three equations because it's a three by three matrix times a vector inside something of dimension seven. As we were told yesterday, miraculously, this is moves of dimension four. And in fact, we will, so this is there will be details about this in the notes. But what I want to say, just to give you where we are going. To give you where we are going. So, first of all, we will. It was mentioned that so a fact we will see that if E is locally free on a smooth curve C All quoth N C E are smooth. And you can figure out what the dimension is. The general element means you have n different points and at each point you have a one-dimensional quotient. And this is an open subset and it tells you what the dimension is. But if E is locally free, Is locally free on S, a smooth surface, and again projective, then in general part N E is not maybe singular, but a miracle occurs. And the Hilbanas is smooth and irreducible of dimension to n. And again, this goes away when you go in higher dimension. And what this is well known. For instance, all this part is very, very classical, is about as old as I am or older. But there are. But there are relatively more new things, and by relatively more new, I mean maybe as old as my children, so 20, which is so highlights We will find two natural structures. Lateral structures on Hilm and of S not one but two one of expected dimension zero and the other smooth of dimension to n. So the To end. So the miracle will have a very simple explanation. S, a smooth surface. Sorry. I have a tendency that when things are called C, they are curves, and when things are called S, they are surfaces. And I'm very grateful that the le beginning letter is the same as in Italian. Yeah, there is another structure. If you look at the original paper where Fogarty shows that the Hilbert scheme is smooth, he first tries to do a very simple deformation theory calculation, and he gets the tangent space has dimension 2n, and the abstraction space also has dimension 2n, which is kind of disappointing. And there is a different way to do the deformation. Different way to do the deformation theory so that you get a tangent space of dimension 2n and no abstractions. We will see, we will, we, but before I can do that, I have to tell you what these words mean. I mean, not you, but of course, but the others. And the other thing is that the Hilb, and this is really about any projective scheme. About any projective scheme, if X is a projective scheme, we will have a natural structure on Hilb P of X and a different one. So on what we x of OX. And what I'm leaving out here is that, in fact, as far as I know, this is not constructed over the whole Hilbert scheme, but just over the locus. Just over the locus of regularly embedded closed sub-schemes. So I'm pretty sure it exists everywhere, but I have never seen a construction. But I'm also terrible at reading the literature, so it's probably there. And the first time I found this out was that I was telling something, and there was Angelo Vistoli, and Angelo said, but Barbara, you must know this. And I was like, and so I will tell you so that if you meet Angelo, You so that if you meet Angelo, he doesn't tell you you must notice and I said as the as schemes, they are the same. But when we define this additional structure, just like here, we have two different structures on the same space. Also, here we will have that these two are the same, but if I look at this. But if I look it as Hilb, I will get one structure. We will see an explicit example. Don't worry. I'm not going to. But it's just to give you an idea of where we want to go. When you say natural structures, can I think of it as these are functors and we will find they're representable by. We will. That is what this course is about. So in fact, the direction, so let's. The direction, so let me it. I started 9:30, right? Okay, so the structure I have in mind, how we go on, is first of all, I will introduce a little bit of infinitesimal deformation theory. And I will introduce the notion of tangent space, obstruction space. Construction space in this context. Then, for any X scheme and point in X, I will introduce what is the first tangent space. So the first higher, you should think of the tangent space as T0, and this is just the first higher tangent space. And I will introduce the The NL of X, the naive cotangent complex. I never know how to write it because I, yeah. Anyway, the cotangent complex for babies, which is the one I understand. And this already will give us some idea. So, a first example of natural structure. The first example of natural structure is many moduli spaces will have the tension space, it is just the tangent space of the scheme. So you cannot play with that. We know schemes have a tangent space. But this obstruction space we will be free to choose. And already at this level, we will see the difference we are talking about. But the point is, this is called infinitesimal. This is called infinitesimal deformation theory because you are just looking at any neighborhood of the point in your scheme. And if you want, even any neighborhood in the etal topology, if you know what the et al topology is, or any neighborhood as analytic in the scheme viewed as an analytic space, if you like complex parameters. And so, what we will need is move on. Need is move on later to you know, so at one end we have this infinitesimal deformation theory with fixed expected dimension, which will be the dimension of the tangent minus the dimension of this obstruction space and we will want And we will want that it's a fixed at every point constant. At the other end, we have zero locus of a section of a vector bundle on a smooth variety. Of course, if we have this, then we will see that this is a special, in particular, implies this, that every point is given by so-and-so many equations in so-and-so. Given by so-and-so many equations in so-and-so many variables. And what we want is to find something in the middle, and something in the middle is a perfect abstraction theory. And it's a bit less than this, but it's more than this. And it has the advantage that it's enough to do intersection theory. And in fact, by now, this is a By now, this is an old story. There are, in fact, you don't even need the whole perfect abstraction theory, you can do it less. And there are a number of notions like almost perfect, quasi-perfect, and so on. A lot of weakening, which are still, you should think of as lying between here and here. And finally, the part I really would like to do is to. Is to so the philosophy is that again experimentally. So I told you that this implies this implies this, but Implies this, but in practice, in most cases where this is true, we can go back. So we can get a perfect obstruction theory or almost perfect for some version. So why is that? Experimentally, expect fits the expected dimension we can find. Perfect obstruction theory. And so the question is: why? Why is that? And the why is that this perfect obstruction theory is what we see in our classical world is the image in the classical world. In the classical world of a higher or derived structure. The principal obstruction theory, perfect obstruction theory. Sorry, it's this. Let me write P of T so that it's clear. Okay. Okay. And so the idea is that in the last 20 years, 20 something, there has been this strong development of these higher methods in algebraic geometry, which comes from a development of higher methods in all kinds of things. And of course, if you are the kind of person who is comfortable with the usual notion of spectra, this is not a problem for you. This is not a problem for you. If you are the kind of person who hears the word spectra and goes under the table and hopes they go away and don't see me, you have to find workarounds. So we will go back to this. I don't know how much time we will have. Maybe we'll be very sketchy. But the idea is that this is where we want to end up. And in particular, we will want to correlate this very modern thing with the very beginning of infinite. With the very beginning of infinitesimal deformation theory, which is, as far as I'm concerned, the thesis of ILUSI, which is a solid bunch of several hundred pages typewritten in French, in every sense of French. And it has already all the ideas. And I think all that was really missing was the corresponding categorical structure. Corresponding categorical structure. So, when I told you that there was a unit of lemma, there was a functor of points, it means you need a little bit of category theory. And to do higher geometry, category theory is not enough. You do need some version of infinity categories and so on. And for a long time, there were a number of models which, if you knew a lot of homotopy theory, were extremely clear, and if you didn't, were extremely confusing. And were extremely confusing, but now we are stabilizing in a language that classical Italian classical geometers can more or less understand. Okay, and since I have a few minutes left, let me start with the first step, which was we want to discuss some infinitesimal deformation theory. This is very classical. Very classical. And so we will look. First of all, we will say that A is in art. I should write a K, but I fixed a K at the beginning. If A is a local Artinian K algebra with residue field K. K and I this is over kill, but let me also write explicitly that the dimension over k as a vector space of A is finite. So this A has the form, has to be modulus some ideal, and this ideal maybe contains. Maybe contains x1 is, of course, is contained in here and contains some power. The way I think of this, I don't have, I'm not good at algebra. Geometrically, it means when I take the spectrum of this, it's a scheme whose reduced structure is a spec k. Specs k. A scheme in the sense of finitely generated, etc. It's affine because it's a spec. And I wanted a reduced structure is a point. So I tend to think of them as fat points, thickened points, but this is the traditional language. And there is a notion which is useful, which is that of square zero extension. Extension and this is a surjection in art such that the kernel of alpha squared is zero. So, what is special about, in fact, this has nothing to do with art and everything to do with square zero, that if you have That if you have an exert sequence where this is a surjective, this is a morphism of rings. Well, if I squared is equal to zero, then I is an A module. So in general, the kernel is an ideal, and an ideal is just a submodule of B. Is just a submodule of B as a B module. But the fact that I squared is equal to zero tells you that in some sense you're decomposing B into two parts and both these parts are I modules. And in fact, I will I could work with the square zero extensions, but because I fixed my algebraically closed field. Algebraically closed the field and everything is classical. I will, in fact, look at in particular A to B, sorry, B to A is small. Another word that is used is semi-small, but I will not need this and I will use. These and I will use them. I will just use more because it's easier to write. If the kernel of alpha times the maximal ideal of P is zero. So this means that this kernel is just a finite dimensional k-vector space. B module. Module structure on the kernel is induced by k vector space structure and b and then what I will look What I will look at is the following problem. So, let me start by saying that there is a theorem, which is that if you have a morphism of schemes, you have a point by which I always mean a close point, and you take the image. And you take the image, and you have that f is smooth, respectively, et al at x, if and only if for every small extension B to A and And for every diagram, spec A inside spec B, a surjection, remember, means a closed embedding. And so, in particular, here there is also spec K, because all these have a portion field, residue field K. And you have a diagram like this. Diagram like this, such that this is X, and you ask yourself, can I find such a map? The diagram has to be commutative, of course. Then you have that smoothness means it exists. Exists and etulness means it exists and is unique. And if you are at all familiar with the veritative criterion of properness, it's exactly the same diagram. What changes is this part. And in general, you can define something similar with square zero. You have a notion of formal smoothness, which is this, but under the assumption I'm But under the assumption I'm throwing it, the problem smoothness and performance smoothness are the same. And okay, so let me again give some concrete examples so that you can understand what's going on. So, in the examples, I will always take y is a spec k, which means this diagram, everything is over spec k anyway, so this lower part of the diagram isn't really there. And let me take x to be a nodal cubic. To be a nodal cubic. So x is a spec of k of xy modulo y squared minus x cubed plus x squared. And then what you can check is that first you go. First, you go spec A and you send it to the origin. And then you can choose if you take spec k of t modulo t squared. I hope you all know that to give such a map is the same as to give a tangent vector in the origin. vector in the origin to x. And so in particular always exists and there is a two-dimensional space of them. So you choose one. And now you go and Now you go one step higher. So, when you want to think of what is a small extension, the easier case you take spec k of t and you quotient by tn and tn plus one. And the difference is really one dimension. And you ask yourself, does this exist? And you can show, you draw your curve, and we all know. Curve. And we all know that the tangent space here has dimension two, but we also know that two tangent directions are more appropriate than the others, which are this and this. We have two special one-dimensional subspaces. And we have that this thing here exists if and only if v is tangent to one branch. One branch. And otherwise, it doesn't. And if it exists, then there is the set of possible errors is a principal homogeneous space over is zero x and you can do something similar with the caspidal cubic and what you get is that the only one which extends is zero none of the others extend and this would look very uh you know it's something you can sit down and do the computation if you are the kind of person And do the computation if you are the kind of person who likes to do computations which are not difficult. And so, what you can check. Okay, I think I'll stop here and instead tell you how we respond. Here and instead, tell you how we restart the next. This is exactly the language we want with obstruction. In that, we will show that whenever we have a diagram like this, we will want to have, and there will be in general, there will be an An associated element in T in some obstruction space at X to F tensor over K with I associated with the white diagram and this extension. And this extension will exist if and only if the obstruct and only if the obstruction is zero and in such a way that this is functial in a natural sense. Of course, you have what is a morphism of such surjection? It's a commutative diagram where all morphisms are morphism of local k algebras, local morphisms of local k algebras, and you get a huge commutative diagram. A huge commutative diagram. And so, this is where we will start the next time, and we will see how this gives us information about the very, very local et al. structure of the map x to y near the point x. Thank you. Thank you very much, Barbara, for the very nice lecture. Are there any questions in the Otherwise, are there any questions in the audience here in Haka? Is it possible to say a little more how the perfect obstruction theory is the image is something higher derived? Yes, the point is that what will happen is that when you do higher geometry in characteristic zero, you can also do it in. You can also do it in any characteristic or no characteristic, but I'm a little bit more quizzy about it. Then you start, you replace algebras over k with differential graded algebras in degree at most zero. And so if you have an algebra, then you have a module. A module of differentials. And if you have a differential graded algebra, you can still do the omega, but now this is a graded module, a differential graded module. Or if one prefers, it's a complex. Again, this smaller than equal to zero is the same. And so, what you do, and of course, the other thing you have to replace. Other thing you have to replace, you have to replace these things form a category and these things form an infinity category. And there are several decorations to this and several interpretations, but I don't know how much we will be able to say about that. And so when you have a derived moduli space X, let me call it. Me call it X to mean it's a higher thing, then it has its own omega, which is a complex, and it's usually called, this is a complex. But again, if you have a differential graded algebra, what you really like is to look at the H0, which is an algebra. And if you take A, this has a subject. A this has a surjection to h0 and this corresponds geometrically. This is now a Hornest algebra. So this corresponds to saying that you have a closed embedding in this direction. And so what happens is if you take omega x and you restrict it to x, to omega x, this is an abstraction theory, and then you can start this. And then you can start discussing whether it's perfect or not, what dimension it has, and so on. But this is where it's induced from. And the other thing I would like to stress is that just like with schemes, the topology, like properness, separatedness, only sees the reduced structure. Also, in this case, topologically, this closed embedding is an isomorphism. There are no other derived points anywhere else. Anywhere else. So that topological properties, you always go back to classical geometry. And all that this, I think of it as a non-reduced scheme, is a reduced scheme with a little cloud of infinitesimals. And the right scheme is something where this little cloud of infinitesimals is, you know, differential graded for some reason. And it's magical because it allows you to pretend. It allows you to pretend that every morphism is smooth and every pullback, every intersection is transversal, which, as we see, it's a very good thing. Sorry? That was a perfect answer to my question. Thank you. Yes, this is not a coincidence. But for me, it goes in the other way around: that I didn't understand model structure until somebody explained it to me, like a left lifting, right lifting, and so on. And I locally understood. So I know if they re-explain to me again, I will understand again. But it is exactly part of the point. And there is. And there is a non-trivial amount of model structure hidden in this story. In fact, one of the standard construction of this direct geometry is the Toin-Vezozi construction, which is based on a Boost field localization. So you really start with the model structure and then you do something to it so that it does what you want. And then there is the other version which is Other version, which is Luri's, and the two things are equivalent. But understanding exactly what each of them says and why they are equivalent is a bit above my pay grade. But it's done by people I really trust. And yeah, so there is certainly a similarity. And you may also recall that you get again the same with the value tip criteria, right? You have a diagram exactly like this. Like this, any more questions? Any questions from the audience in the world? No, and thanks, Barbara, again, for the very nice talk. If we resume at 11, we
