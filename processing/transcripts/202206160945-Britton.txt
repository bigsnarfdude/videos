Thank you very much for inviting me to this nice workshop. I'm very sorry that I couldn't come. The reason is that my daughter had her high school diploma this Monday and there are a lot of activities around that. So I would have loved to be there both for the workshop and for the location which seems very interesting. I've been to Banff but not to this new state, a new place. Anyway, I will talk about something slightly different compared to what I usually Slightly different compared to what I usually talk about, since there is no statistics and no probability involved here, actually. So, this is a completely deterministic model. It's joint work with a colleague from Finland, La Celeskile, who is also probably. So, we are out on virgin territory for us. Anyway, it is about how to intervene in an optimal way. Way in an epidemic, and we will not be considering sort of different types of interventions. We will just assume that there are some interventions which reduce the contact rate. But I will say more about that. So I'm sure that every one of you have seen this, maybe the most basic epidemic model with several names, just many people just call it the SIR epidemic. People just call it the SIR epidemic. It looks like this: so beta is the contact rate or the close contact rate, and gamma is the recovery rate. And everyone knows that R0 is the contact rate divided or multiplied by 1 over gamma, which is the mean infectious period. So, this model assumes make a lot of assumptions that you have homogeneous mixing, that all individuals are sort of In all individuals are sort of identical, and that there is no immunity waning and there is no seasonality. So, have this in mind because I will extend the model by including intervention, but the model still have these unrealistic features. So it is we're not claiming to be extremely close to reality, but we are hopefully interest starting an interesting question anyway. Studying an interesting question, anyway. Here is a curve of the prevalence over time. Some people call it the incidence, some call it the prevalence, but it's the number of infectious individuals, the current number of infectious individual, which of course is very close to the new number of infectious individuals as well. So maybe you can call it both incidence or prevalence. So now to this model, we add prevention in the We add prevention in the following way. So, suppose we are given a time-varying prevention strategy, which we call capital P, and it is described how much prevention that is put in place as a function of time. So, by this, we mean that the contact rate at time t is reduced by this fraction. By this fraction p of t. So this p of t lies always between zero and one. Maybe I should have written that. And then we have the corresponding epidemic model, which then of course depend on which particular prevention strategy we are considering. So I will attach this capital P label here. But the only difference in terms of the differential equation is that this contact rate This contact rate is deflated by P of T. So, this is the remaining amount of contact, one minus P of T. So, that's the only difference in the model. And of course, if you look at two different intervention strategies, the differential equations will look different, of course. Anyway, but suppose we are given an intervention strategy, so someone maybe says, okay. Someone maybe says, okay, put on 50% lockdown during two months, then starting from right away, then this P of T would be 0.5 the first two months and then drop down to zero. So the differential equation would have half the contact rate for the first two months and then go back to the normal contact rates. I mean, for most prevention strategies, there is no explicit solution to this. Solution to this set of differential equations, but at least numerically you can solve the differential equation, and the final size is then the fraction of recovered people at time infinity. We also introduce the cost of a preventive strategy. You can do that maybe in different ways, but one perhaps natural cost would be that. Cost would be that sort of the daily amount of prevention integrated over all days. So that is the definition. That's how we define cost. I will later talk about other possibilities, but this is the cost function that we will use. So it means that 50% prevention during two months has the same cost as 100%, sorry, 50% lockdown during two months. 50% lockdown during two months has the same cost as a 100% lockdown during one month. Maybe that's not possible, which in turn has the same cost as a 25% lockdown during four months. So the problem we have been studying or have studied is suppose that we are only allowed to study preventive costs that do not exceed some fixed value. not exceed some fixed value C1. So, but then among all preventive strategies with this bound on the total cost, which of these preventive strategies minimizes the final size? So that's the question we have addressed. A couple of comments related to this. Well, first of all, please note. Well, first of all, please note that the number of recovered individuals, since the rate of new recoveries come at this rate, so if you integrate this, you get the number of the fraction of recovered individuals. So if you want to minimize this, it's the same thing as minimizing this integral. That is something that's used in our proofs. So I said that this is what we have been studying: minimizing the integral of the prevalence. We call that the total incidence. Alternatively, you could maybe you want to minimize the peak prevalence. So that's a different sort of optimality criteria. So this one, why would you do this? Well, you want to minimize the total number of people getting affected. Total number of people getting affected, which is probably proportional to the total number of people getting seriously ill and requiring hospital care. That makes sense to minimize. On the other hand, minimizing peak prevalence also makes sense in the sense that this peak is probably the worst time for the hospitals, and maybe they only have some finite capacity. So, there are other people who have looked at this minimization criteria. I will come back. Minimization criteria. I will come back to that later. Also, in terms of costs, I think among these three cost functions, the middle one is most reasonable, but at the end, I will also mention a few other cost functions. But of course, you could introduce the cost as the time during which you have any prevention, or for some reason, you could say that the cost is the maximal prevention that we have over time. Have over time. But I would say this one is most reasonable, whereas which of these two, I don't really know which is more important, probably a bit of both. So we focus on minimizing the total incidence, whoops, the total incidence and keeping the cost below some fixed value. And please note that we have no vaccine available, nor do we expect. Available, nor do we expect to have one in the near future. So, if you have that in mind, maybe the optimality criteria would be different, but here we don't foresee any vaccine arriving in the near future. So, here is the incidence in the uncontrolled sorry, this is a prevalence in the standard SIR epidemic, and here I've listed Seven different possible preventions, all having the same integral. So, prevention one is this one here. It says that you should have a massive lockdown. Well, there is no time unit here, but maybe you should, this is one month. So, a massive lockdown for one month, starting right away. Prevention strategy two suggests to wait a little more than one month and then introduce a massive lockdown. Prevention strategy three says wait wait longer and the preventive strategy four says let's have a 50% lockdown during two months. Strategy seven says let's have a maximum lockdown and then reduce it gradually. And here is a 25% lockdown. And here is something lockdown sort of continuous in time, which looks a little bit like this unrestricted model. But please note. Unrestricted model. But please note: for whatever strategy you use here, this will no longer be the prevalence curve, of course. So this is the prevalence curve without restrictions. So as you can see, there is a large space of possible preventions. And the question is, which one is best? I will present the solution not at the end of the talk, but in the middle of the talk. But if you have any ideas, think about that, and I will ask if there are some suggestions. Ask if there are some suggestions. Maybe some of you read our paper, maybe then it's not as interesting, perhaps. But yeah, at least in your mind, maybe you can think what you think is the best strategy. We have also looked at the situation where it's not possible to have any amount of prevention. So, in some plots that I will show, we assume that it's not possible to have more than 75. To have more than 75% lockdown. So it's not possible to reduce the contact rate by more than 75%. You cannot sort of isolate individuals completely. Another optimality criteria would be the peak prevalence, which I just mentioned. Also, we are looking at infinite time horizon, but you could look at some fixed time horizons, and maybe you want to minimize the total number of people getting affected during the next three months. During the next three months, so then T would be three months. Maybe that is, you know, that we expect a vaccine to come after three months, so then you want to minimize the number of infected people up until then. Or you have some random time. Maybe you don't know exactly when the vaccine arrives, but you might be able to describe it through some random variable. So then you want to minimize this and And there are also some more reasonable cost functions, I would say. But in the results, we're using this linear cost function. But maybe it makes sense that there is a higher cost for high prevention. That would suggest maybe that you should square this so it will be the L2 norm or proportion to the L2 norm. You could also have an additional cost. Also, have an additional cost if you make many changes of your preventive strategy. In the strategies I have, there was very little changes, but you can imagine that you have a 50% lockdown for one week, no lockdown for one week, 50% lockdown for one week. Maybe that's more cost, maybe that's more expensive. So you might want to add some absolute value of the derivative or something else. So there are many different related problems, but we have only Problems, but we have only started this one. Let me, before I say our main result, let me present the main result when you want to minimize the peak prevalence instead. So, this has been studied by another group of authors. So, their aim was to subject to some total cost, just like we did. Like we did. So, the total cost of the preventive strategy is not allowed to exceed some fixed value C1. And then they addressed which is the best prevention strategy distributed over time if you want to minimize the peak prevalence. The solution to that problem is do nothing for some time, and there is a recipe to compute these time points, and then between T1. And then between T1, during this interval, you start at some level which is described like this, and then you slowly decay the prevention because S of T decreases over time, so one over S of T increases over time, so one minus one over R0 S T decreases over time. Decreases over time. Sorry, S of T decreases. So one over S of T increases. So minus makes a decrease. Yeah. So you start at a fairly high level, but it's not complete lockdown. And then gradually you relax and eventually you reach zero and then you stick to that. I will show a figure of that prevention strategy later. It will be the red curve in a figure appearing later. Hearing later. So soon I will tell you the result, but before that, we came up with this formula, which I think has been shown by others, at least La Seleskila has seen it. I have never seen this formula before, so for me, that was an interesting thing. It goes as follows. Suppose we look at preventive strategies consisting of complete lockdowns. Complete lockdowns, but not one maybe, but several complete lockdowns. Starting, these are the starting times of the lockdown and the durations we call the 2i. Then, so you have maybe four complete lockdowns. One is after one week, it lasts for one week, and then you wait two weeks, and then you have a two-week lockdown, and then you wait for three weeks, and let maybe. Then you wait for three weeks and let maybe have a three-week lockdown, and then you're done. Then T1 will be after one week, and the next one will probably be after four weeks, if I remember correctly. And these are the durations. Then the final size for that has a nice expression. It looks like this. And if you forget about this thing, you see the traditional final size equation, which is natural, because if you have no lockdown, Which is natural because if you have no lockdown, then this is the final size equation. But to that, you add this positive term. And it's easy to show that the smaller this quantity is. Sorry, what? Yeah, sorry. The final size ZP becomes smaller the larger. The larger this sum is. So, this somehow tells you a little bit. So, you want to be, if you want the small final size, which is the obvious goal with the prevention strategy, then you should make this sum large. And this thing here has only to do with the durations, so it sort of suggests that this quantity should be large. This quantity should be large. So it suggests that when you have these complete lockdowns, at the start of these times, you should have large prevalence. Okay, so here is this incidence for the unrestricted epidemic again. Epidemic again, the prevalence when there are no prevention. So, on the next slide, I will show what is the optimal prevention. So, is there any well I don't see any hands or anything. So, I will just present what it is. So, if you're allowed complete lockdowns, the optimal solution looks as follows. So, it's rather surprising, at least. So it's rather surprising, at least it was to us. So you should wait until the unrestricted or the unrestricted epidemic reaches its peak. Exactly at that time point, you introduce complete lockdown and you keep the lockdown for as long as you're allowed to not have the cost exceeding whatever was that limit. So you always start the lockdown. The lockdown at the peak of the unrestricted epidemic, and then you let it go for as much cost you can afford. So to us, that was a rather big surprise. Here is a more sort of formal description of the strategy. So, irrespective of how you start, sorry, this should be small s and small i, then the total. Then, the total incidence among all piecewise continuous intervention strategies. So, we assume that these preventive strategies are at least piecewise continuous and that the total cost does not exceed this value C1. And also, we assume perhaps there is an upper limit to how much lockdown you can have. Lockdown you can have. So I said earlier that we look at 75% here. But if this is one, there is no restriction because the prevention can never be more than 100%. Anyway, given these restrictions, the total incidence is minimized by the following. Do nothing, have a constant lockdown as the maximal, this is the maximum. The maximal, this is the maximum you're allowed to. So, have maximal prevention for some time and then go back to normality. And this starting point is uniquely determined. In general, it does not have a very closed form expression, but there is an implicit formula to compute it. In particular, what I said in the previous slide: if there are no restrictions on the amount of lockdown you can have, The amount of lockdown you can have, then the start is actually at the peak prevalence time of the unrestricted epidemic. Whereas, if you have, if you're not, if you cannot do 100% lockdown, then this time point happens slightly prior to the peak of the unrestricted epidemic. So, the take-home message is that heavy lockdowns of short duration outperform light lockdowns of longer duration. Light lockdowns of longer duration. And I guess also another perhaps more surprising result is that you should wait rather long before you impose the lockdown. Another result that we have is that whatever intervention strategy you have, as long as it has a finite cost, the total The total incidence will be at least this expression, which is the expression for herd immunity. Because remember, this is a deterministic model. So eventually, when you relax, eventually you have to relax your prevention since you only have a finite amount of prevention to do. And then it will come back at least until you reach Hardy Munich. Until you reach hard immunity. So, this is the lower level, and the upper level is perhaps not so surprising. The upper level of the total incidence is what the fraction infected if you have no restrictions. So, as an illustration, suppose R0 is three and you start in a virgin population, then any intervention with finite cost will result in a total incidence lying between six to six. Incidence lying between 66.7% and 94%. 94% is the final size when R0 is 3 and there are no preventions. And this is two-thirds. And that comes because if S0 is 1, R0 is 3, then this is 2 thirds. So on the next slide, I will show what happens if suppose we're only allowed to have 75% lockdown. 75% lockdown. How many will get infected is on the y-axis. If you do this, massive lockdown, but depending on when you start the lockdown. So suppose we had C1 equal to 15 corresponding to 15 full lockdown days, but since we can only do 75% lockdown at the most, that would correspond to 75% lockdown for 20 days. So, the theorem says that it's best to do 75% lockdown, but it's not sort of explicitly stated in the theorem when you do it. So, on the next slide, there's a plot of how many get infected for this strategy, depending on when you start the lockdown. So, we see that if we start the lockdown immediately, at the end, we get this 95%. We get this 94% getting affected. So we gain nothing in terms of total incidence if we put the restrictions right away. We do delay the epidemic, but the total incidence is not affected if we start here. So you should start with. This is, of course, very sensitive to what small fraction I start with. If I remember correctly, I started with one in 10,000 being infectious. Being infectious. So, in a community of 1 million, that would correspond to 100 people being initially infectious. If that was the case, I don't remember completely, but then the lockdown should, the best lockdown should start after 23 days. Then you see that you don't reach this lower level since you only had 15 days of total lockdown to spend, but you come fairly close to it. So, if you had a bit more, let's say. If you had a bit more, let's say 25 complete lockdown days, you would probably be up here, so you wouldn't gain much by having more lockdown costs. So starting too early is quite bad. Of course, starting very late is bad. That's clear for everyone. But what was not clear to us was how bad it was to start too early with preventions. For this model, remembering that there is no vaccine arriving and also assuming that there is a Also, assuming that there is a fixed finite cost that we can spend on preventions. So, here is a perhaps complicated figure, but I told you earlier that there would be a red figure corresponding if you want to minimize the peak prevalence. So, here is the preventive strategies. The blue strategy is the best strategy if we want to minimize the total fraction getting. The total fraction getting infected, assuming that we can only do at most a 75% lockdown. So the strategy says wait until 23 or 24 days, impose your maximum lockdown for about 20 days, yeah, sorry, for exactly 20 days and go back to normality. What will be the outcome of that? Well, the black curve here is the unrestricted epidemic, and of course, before. Epidemic, and of course, before we insert the prevention, the prevalence will be the same as for the unrestricted epidemic. But when we impose restrictions here, 75%, we reduce the contact by 75%, then we see that prevalence drops quite dramatically fast, goes down here. And on here, you have the cumulative incidence. So we see that we end up with With, I forgot what was, did it say on the previous slide? Yes, the total incidence was about 76%. So with this preventive strategy, we end up with 76% getting affected rather than 94%. If we instead wanted to minimize the peak prevalence, this is the optimal preventive strategy. The optimal preventive strategy. So we should start a bit earlier, not go up to 75%, which we were allowed to, and then gradually reduce the prevention. And how do you obtain this curve? Well, that is obtained because we want to keep the prevalence at this optimal value. And once here we have reached herd immunity. We have reached herd immunity, so then by itself a prevalence starts decaying. So we see that there's a big difference here in the peak, but also there is a difference in the total number get infected. In fact, this red curve lies more or less in the middle between the optimal strategy and the one with no prevention. Prevention. So, if I'm a consultant and someone says you're allowed to do 75% lockdown at most, when should you do it? Then the answer is start after 23 days and have this 75% lockdown for 20 days and then go back to complete normality. I'm sure that the health professional would then be very worried, saying, Can we really wait this long? No, I don't. No, I don't want to wait that long. I give you an extra week. So you're allowed to do this, what you claim is the optimal, but I give you an extra week. So let's start one week earlier. So on the next slide, I will have this strategy, but I will also have this strategy ending at the same time, but starting, if I remember correctly, one week earlier, or maybe it was 10 days earlier. So then we see what. So then we see what happens then. That's an even more surprising result. So here is the blue curve which we had before. But if we start one week earlier, we see that the incidence or prevalence starts dropping here, of course. But once we relax now, at the same time point as the original optimal strategy, we get this big second wave and the peak. And the peak for this big second wave is not as big as the blue peak, but it's still fairly high, not all that far away from it. And we see that at the end of the day, or at the end of the epidemic, we have hardly gained anything. So by adding one week prevention before the optimal, we actually do something which is slightly worse or maybe even much worse. Well, it's not worse in terms of peak. Well, it's not worse in terms of peak, but it is much worse in terms of total incidence. So I'm a bit, can someone tell me if I have some time left or if my time is out? So there's 10 minutes left. So we should save some of it for questions, but you have a few more minutes. Okay. Probably I'll skip the proof, but I mean, it is a Proof, but I mean, it is a form of proof. So, what we do is first we truncate, we say that there is a limit to, we don't have to look several years back into the future because the important things happens within one year. Now, I'm talking about this realistic parameter values, but for whatever parameter values you give me, there is a you don't have to look to infinity. There is a you can truncate it. Well, maybe I should show some slides for this. Yeah. So there are some expressions saying that not much will happen afterwards and the remaining total prevalence after some time, long time in the future, will be very small, exponentially small. An important thing is that here the blue is one, consider one prevention strategy, this blue curve. What we This blue curve, what we do is, and suppose that we have this ceiling of 75% lockdown is the most thing we can do. Then any blue curve can be approximated by, so you split up the whole time interval where you have truncated into small time units of length h. And in each time interval, you have either zero or You have either zero or four or the maximal lockdown, and the fraction of zero and the fraction of maximal lockdown that is determined by the mean of the blue curve in this area. So, here you see that here we have less less a much smaller part where we have the maximum. So, if you if you perform this sort of strategy and you make these intervals smaller and smaller. And you make these intervals smaller and smaller, then it's possible to show that the red prevention strategy approximates the blue perfectly well. So that's an important ingredient in this proof. You can also show that, as I showed numerically before, adding prevention strategy before an existing strategy can actually do things worse, but we have proven. But we have proven, maybe that existed already before, that if you add restrictions after an existing prevention strategy, then you will always have fewer people getting affected. And then, sorry, I missed, there is another result that we used by Feng et al. saying that if you have multiple constant level prevention. Constant level prevention periods, so maybe 10 prevention periods all at the same height, then it's always more efficient to merge these. So that is a result that we also use in this proof. So this is my last slide. So the main conclusion, please note that given the assumptions, and the assumption is that we have a simple model, of course, and also that the cost is linear. That the cost is linear, and that we want to minimize the total final, the total size or the total incidence. Is that it's best to wait, and actually a surprisingly long time we should wait, and then you should impose as much lockdown as possible until your intervention costs are used up. But please note that, I mean, in reality, is there a maximal cost? I don't know, perhaps the maximal cost. I don't know. Perhaps the maximal cost should be per month or per quarter of a year or per year. So maybe that would be a more interesting minimization criteria, which we have not studied. And also note that there is no vaccine here and there is no vaccine expected to come in the near future. And there is no waning of immunity and no seasonality. And we have homogeneous mixing and homogeneous individuals. Homogeneous individuals. So, a lot of simplifying assumptions, but hopefully, this result still has some interest to it. Thank you.
