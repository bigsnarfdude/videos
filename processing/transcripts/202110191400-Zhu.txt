So, first of all, okay, I would like to thank Professor Ye and Professor Zhang for inviting me to take part in this workshop and to chair this session. There are four speakers in this afternoon, and the first speaker is Professor Bao Cheng Zhu from Shanghi Normal University, and the title is LP Brun Ming. Title is L. P. Brun-Minkowski Theorem for C-Co-Comic Sets. So now let's please, Professor Zhu. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much for introduction, Professor Yuan. I sincerely thank the organizers, Professor Ye, Professor Woner, Professor Zukbening, and Nin for inviting me to give this talk. To give this talk, it's my pleasure. As mentioned by Professor Yuan, I will talk about the LP-Bromikowski theory for C-cucromyocytes. This is a joint work with Dr. Yang and Professor Yin. I will separate I will separate this talk into four sections. In the first part, I will explain why we introduce the RP from Kowski theory for CQ commercial sites. Section 2 contains some basic backgrounds for the theory in the SQL command size. In second three, we will In section three, we will introduce our LP theory for SQL commit sites. Finally, as application, we will talk about the limit case for the P equals zero. And to answer an open problem posted by John Schneider, that is a Lago-Minkowski problem for SQL Commerce. Okay, now. Okay, now firstly, let me introduce our motivation to this talk. Okay, now we will talk about on cone. Here we use C to denote a pointed closed convex cone in RN with vertex at the origin and having an important interior. Okay, now there is an important Okay, now there is an important research object that is a C closed site in the cone. Okay, here I is a picture. Now I show you a picture, talk about the definition in the picture. Now, here this column is seen, okay? And A dot is closed and convinced from convinced side. From the convent side. And the coset, the coset is equals C of the column, C minus the side A dot. So if A has a partial finite volume, then this side A dot is closed, it's called closed, C closed side. At the same time, this side. at the same time uh this side a is called uh cucumber set okay so uh later uh we will use a dot uh to denote the c close set and a is uh cucumber set okay and please note if a uh is usually not uh bunk it okay now if Okay, now if A is bounded, if A is bounded, then the C close set is a special case. We call this special set as a C4 set. So for this case, A is bounded. And Azushi Nider proved Aminkowski type problem. a Minkowski type problem in the CQ common side. Okay, now that is for non-negative finite for zero minor mu on the on the omega C. Now here, if this cone is C, okay, here this cone is C and this cone is cone is called the polar cone of C. Here we use Our thing. Here we use the C circle to denote the column, the polar cone, our C. Now, here, omega C omega C is a subset of the unisphere in the polar cone. Now, for each omega, for each omega, then we can get there is a cone volume measure based on the boundary of the C clue side. The boundary of the sequence set. Then, based on the volume Meyer, Schneider proved this Minkowski type problem. Actually, this theorem can be considered as the existence theorem for the solution to the Minkowski problem. However, the uniqueness is unsolved. That is, if A1 A1 dot A2 dot R2 C clue size, the corresponding size A1, A2 R2 C cooking size. So the question is, does the museum does the cool and the cone volume miner of A1 equals the A1 equals the cone volume minus A2 implies these two sequel conferences are the same one. Okay, now in this talk, we will solve this problem. So we want to solve this problem. We need to introduce the RP Brown Minkowski. A Brown-Minkowski and the Brown LP theory for the co-communications. So, to do so, we want to introduce a Brown-Minkowski theory for complex body. We know a complex body is a compact complex site with non-empathic interior. And it is determined by its support function, HK, which is defined by the market. Which is defined by the maximum projection of k along the direction u. So this is a support function of the current body. Now, for a current body, there is a special that is a surface eigenmir of a current body K. Now, that is for any body of site omega. So the surface eigenvector. So the surface eigenvalue of current body K can be given by the n minus 1 dimensional Haskell measure of the Gauss, the inverse Gauss map from the side omega onto the boundary of K. To define the surface agenda of a constant body K. And we use SK to denote the surface azure. Now, related to Now, related to the surface area miner, there is an important problem that is a Minkowski problem. Here I list the RP Minkowski problem. It is that what conditions on a given position minor mu. Then there is this corresponding K with R piece of the Azure mu. In other words, to find I to find under what conditions mu, there is a current body. It's surface RP surface area is just a given minor mu. Now here, SK is a classical problem, classical surface AGR of a common body mentioned above. Okay. Now here, HK is a support function of. HK is a support function of k. Now, especially if p equals one, okay, equals one, then this part disappeared. Okay, that is this problem reduced to mu equals sk. So this problem reduced to the classical Minkowski problem. Okay. If mu has density of, so to solve the problem is equivalent. The problem is equivalent to such kind of PDE. And there are also many classical results on this problem. For example, Closanti, Ludwac, and so on. The regularity is also studied. For example, a Chu and Jia. and the shijia one and punve one and the other others okay also there is an important special case um that is p equals zero this case for this case is very interesting because uh if p equals zero okay p equals zero then uh this minor um can be considered as a volume because considered as the volume because H can be considered as the height of a cone and S key can be considered the surface area of a band. So this guy is just can be considered the volume of a cone. So this mirror, this mirror should be considered as a cone minor. Then this problem can be reduced to the Can be reduced to the lock-Minkowski problem. And the solution has been studied by Andrews, Guanyi, and Broskin, and Lu Yangzhang, and Thankyu, and so on. Of course, there are many excellent references there in. Now, let's talk about the theory of Of for the code complex sets. Okay, now first thing. Usually we use SNY1 to denote the unit surface as a unit surface. C power, C circle is a power column of C. And suppose A dot is a C close set. Now that is in this column, C. A dot is a C. A dot is a C clue set. Okay, your C clue set. And define omega C. Omega C is a subside of the unit sphere in this cone. This cone is a polycone of C. Then we can get a Gauss map. A Gauss map from the boundary of A dot onto the surface, on the unit surface. On the unit surface, okay. Precisely, it is based on the subside omega C. Okay, omega C. So by the Gauss map, we can induce the surface as a measure of our CQ common set. That is, here we use Sn minus one and A dot to denote. And A data to denote the surface area of A dot. And then we use the n minus one dimensional hostel measure of the inverse cost map of eta. Here eta is a Bauser major on Bauser set on omega C. Okay, now to define the surface as here of E dot. Okay, E dot. So we have one new minor surface. Have a new mire, surface as a mire or cycl such. Now, as illicit in this picture, we know the boundary of A dot and the side A. Both the side A dot and A has a common boundary. So we can still use this mirror to define. Mayor to define the surface area of the C cucumber such. Now, here we use Sn minus one bar to denote the surface area of A. Please note, the total surface area of the C2 common site may be infinite. However, the total Mayor surface. Mayor, uh, surface miner surface major for the C4 site must be finite. Okay, now, uh, actually, there is some examples to show these statements, but here there is no time to show all of them. Okay, now similar to the support function of current body, okay, the support function of a CQ concept. Our sql concept is also important. It is defined by this functional. But here, the variable x is in the polycon C circle. Then, from the definition of the support function of a SQL convent set, then we know. Set, then we know the support of A dot is always negative, okay, and it is it can be defined on a C-clue set A dot uni. That AR was if A dot, if A dot is a C clue set, it can be given by the intersection of a half space. Here, half space is determined. Here, half space is determined by the function, the super function of A dot. So here, U is a unit, out of unit of what normal vector U on the omega C. On our hand, we we can we can define We can define the support function of a CQ command set A by the support function of A dot. Okay, now here we use H bar to denote the subfunction of SQL C common side A. And it is given by negative of super function of A dot. Okay. Now Now, from the definition, we know the support function A dot is a convex function. So, H bar is a concave function. Now, these two properties are very important in the following. Then, I introduce the cosm of single chromosomes. sum of sickle concepts by the support function. Okay. Now that is for two Cookon sites A1, A2. Now, we know A1 dot A2 dot are corresponding, are convex set. Okay. So A1 dot plus A2 dot is still convex set. Okay. So because A1 So, because A1 dot, A2 dot are both convex set. So, this Minkowski, this Minkowski sum is still convex. So, if we use C minus this Minkowski sum, then we have got a new set. Now, we call this new site as the core sum of E1 and E2, and denoted by E1 circle plus E2. Circle plus E2. Now, so there is a natural question. So, whether this definition is well defined, okay? So, we have already known this site is closed on a common site. So, it's only needed to check this site, this new site has a finite volume. So, it's very lucky. So it's very lucky that Schneider proved the Brown-Minkowski in quality for C co-common sites. That is, if A1, A2 are both C co-common sites, then this inequality holds. Now, from we know if these two sites are C co-composites, then the volume of E1 and the volume of E2 are both finite. Are both finite. So from this inequality, we know the volume of this sum that is secure sum is also finite. So from the definition, we know this is well defined. But here the volume is a very good question. Here the volume is a volume of a C cover set. It is defined by this integral. Now here the support function H bar A is based on the omega C on the side of omega C. Okay. From the definition of the volume, we know the Volume, we know this volume is homogeneous of degree n. And this volume is monitored. The mixed volume of the SQL command sets is also and usually we use V1 bar to denote the force volume of two. Volume are two sequel common sets A1, A2. Okay, and Schneider proved the Minkowski inequality for C co-common sets as follows. That is a relationship between the force of mixed volume of the volume A1 and A2. Now, here A1 and A2 are both C co-commissaries and with equality close if and only if A1 is the least to A2. Is the least to A2. Okay. Now, actually, Kowatsky and Timorin proved such kind of inequalities, but without equality conditions. Milma and Zutram also proved such kind of inequalities for more general mirrors, but still without equality conditions. Now, conditions. Now, in 2018, Louis Neidan approved this in quotes with conditions that is A1 is that is A2. Now, let's rewrite the Minkowski inequality in this way. Now, if we pull out the volume of A2 to the left heart. To the left hand, okay, to left hand, and then we can get a motor multiple problem. Now, from the equalities of the mean quality in quality, we know this problem has a solution that is A1. So, now if we replace this major, that is a surface as a major of E1 by a more general mirror, mu. By a more general measure, mu. Okay, now here mu is a finite position measure on omega c. So we can get a more general problem. Okay, now actually this problem can induce the Minkowski problem for sql comma sets. Okay now that it can be stated by this minor. uh that is to uh under what conditions on the finite position minor mu okay uh there is this uh c close side a dot such that uh the surface area of a uh equals uh it's just the given mineral mu okay so um actually uh schneider proved this Schneider proved this problem for a special case that is the minor condition of mu is this is this way that is the my that is the support of mu is concentrated on on a compact side subside of the our omega c so then a mu is a source area of a c4 side okay Last year, Schneider removed this condition. That is, this removed the compact needs to get a more general problem, more general solution to this problem. He also studied the co-volume measure of the C-closet. C close at k okay and it given by uh this minor this integral because here um here the integral ingrand is not q h k and k okay now um schneider can prove uh this this result that is for each for each is non-zero finite position migrant we can see it is the co- It is the convolum of a sequel site. But the uniqueness is unsolved. That is, if A1, A2 are two C closed sites. So the question is, does the co-volume measure of A1 equals the co-volume of A2 implies A1 equals? implies E1 equals E2. So actually this problem can be considered as a special case or a limited case of RP Browning-Kotsky theorem. So in order to solve the problem, we would like to introduce the RP-Browning-Kotsky theory for single coincidence. So firstly, we want to we will use the We will use the pico sum in our sequel command sets. Okay, so firstly, let us introduce a new function, h bar. Now here we use E1A2 to denote E1, A2 are both two SQL common sites. Here, P is positive and less than one. Then we use the And then we use the support function of A1, A2 to define a new function, H bar. And then we use H bar to construct a convex set by this interception of half space. Now here, the half space determined by the defined function, H bar. So we can know this side this side is common side. It's common side because it is an intersection of house space. So there is a question. Why does this site is still a co-current set? Because here, A1, A2 are both C co-current sets. Both C co-conversates. So the sum, piece co-sump, is also a co-common set. So is a question. Here we use this notation to denote C minus this comma set. And call this guy is P cosum of two C co comma set. Our two SQL commercial site. So we need to prove this site whether it is still a SQL commercial set. So we need to prove this guy. That is the RP Brown Nikotsky inequality for C code common sets. Now, if A1, A2 are both sequel commerce sets. Both C cookama sites. Then these isoparametrical inequalities have been proved by us. Here, Jing Yang is a doctor in China University and Professor Yang and Ming. So we can prove such kind of LP type Minkowski inequality for SQL conversions because. No, because uh the volume of E1 and the volume of E2 are both finite. So, from this in quotes, we know the volume of this peak sum is still finite. Okay, so this shows this shows our definition is well defined. Okay, so from the statements above, we can get a conclusion that that to give a formal definition of COPU sum. Okay, now here we use the support function to denote the pico sum. We have already known the pico sum is a spill or sql conversion. So the support function of the our um our single sum pico sum uh makes no makes sense okay so we we use this formula to define the site okay the pico sum that is if a1 a2 are two sequencers then we use the support function of them to give the support function of this peak sum that is this formula This formula makes sense. Now, actually, we can prove a variational formula based on this pico sum. We will use the powerful tool that is a Wolfship in a verb scheme. Here, F is a continuous partial function on the compact side omega. Then the volume keyf can be defined by this way. That is, we call this workshop associated with C, omega, and f. If f equals negative of the support function, then the workshop k f. then the workshop kf uh equals the the closed c close side the k dot in this case uh k dot is called the c determined by omega um omega okay later we will use k uh to denote the side in our all closed comma side that are c determined by omega okay then uh we Then we proved an operational formula of the workship. Now, from this formula, there is a new mirror is used. Now, here we call this new mirror as a LP of the idea, okay, of the A dot, of the side A dot. Now, here this is a new minor induced by this formula. Okay, so we use this new minor to define the LP subject as the sequence set. Moreover, we can use the same minor to define the LP subject as A. Here A is a corresponding Corresponding say coconut. Okay. So we can prove if A1, A2 are both sequel common size and has the same LP surface as you are. Then these two sites are the same one. Actually, this theory Okay, actually this theory, this result can be considered as a uniqueness solution to the LP Minkowski problem once the LP Minkowski problem has a solution. So moreover from the variational formula, we can denote this integral by the bio notation. The bio notation that is VP bar and call this guy as a LP mixed volume of E1 and A2. Here, E1, E2 are both C co-current sets. Now, actually we have proved this notation that the RPM mixed volume has some good properties. For example, it is it is homogeneous or degree n. We also proved the LP Minkowski inequality for cycle coincides. That is, if A1, A2 are both cycle coincides, then the RP mixed volume is less than the volume, the product of the volume of E1 and A2. E1 and A2. Now, then we also proved the equalities, the conditions that is A1 is the leads to A2. Actually, this inequalities have been proved by Schneider for P equals 1. And we also proved some other properties for the L P mixed volume. The RP makes the volume. Now let's talk about the RP-Minkowski problem for sake of common sets. Now here, we suppose P is all the same number, but doesn't equal zero. Now, under what conditions on the finite positive minor mu on omega c, there is a sequence A dot such that the R piece of the The RP surface area of COM as such is just a given minor mu. Okay, okay. As I mentioned above, I should prove this problem or p equals one. We also have a solution for this problem. In this case, that is In this case, that is if mu satisfies this condition, that is, mu is a non zero finite position major and its support is concentrated on the compact side of omega c. And then we can find simple sites, a dot, such that it's correct. the corresponding sql concept A the surface of surface area of A is just the given mile or mu here P is also zero number but doesn't equal zero and M okay it's very interesting if P is less than one okay our solution is unique Our solution is unique. Of course, if mu has a density f, then to solve this problem is equivalent to so this such kind of PDE. Okay, now that's the core. I look at the RPM volume again. Now you wait take the Take the consider the limit case. For this formula, this integral formula, if p goes to zero and omega goes to omega c so this formula can be reduced to this guy, okay, this formula and we we can We call this formula as log mixed volume of two C co comma sites. Now, based on this formula, we proved a log Minkowski type in qualities for Common sites. That is, if A1, A2 are two sequel common sites. So this formula. So this formula, this log Minkowski equality holds. Of course, the equality conditions also hold if and only if A1 is directed to A2. In our opinion, in our opinion, this inquiries can be considered as Considered as a complementary analogous of the logominking quality for convex bodies conjectured by Browski, Ludua Yangzhang. So we think this Latin inquiry is very important in our opinion. Because ET can be used to answer an open problem. open problem. That is, we use this in quoting and the encoding conditions to show to answer the open problem. This open problem. That is like A1A2. Here I are like A1 dot A2 dot R2 R B two SQL. B2 seclude sites such as A1, A2 as two square coincides. Okay, now if the condition satisfies this this way, that is the cone volume minor of A1 equals the volume minor of A2. Then we can get these two, these two single common sets equal. equal. Okay. Okay. So this is a part of the answer to the open problem posted by Yuf Schneider. Okay. Okay, thanks. Okay, I stop here. Thank you very much. Okay, thanks, Professor Zhu, for the nice talk. Any questions or comments? Hi, Bao Chung. I just want I just wondering those cool convex set is can be unbounded, right? Yeah, because here it's a finite Lebic volume. Yeah, yeah, each of the only volume of the cookon set is finite. Finite. So it's can be unbounded. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So how to? So, how to define the support function? A support function? Yeah, yeah. Use a sim minor. Okay, this is our support function or coverage body. So we use a sim minor. Here is a product. In a product that is a projection. A projection of y on the direction x, but here x is in the polycone. There are some conditions for the cone, right? Pardon? The cone should have angle less than pi over 2, right? The angle of the main cone. The angle of the no uh usually you can get more the the the angle may be uh um bigger than the uh than pi two uh pi of two I see okay okay thank you thank you so more questions or comments
