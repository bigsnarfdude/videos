Okay, so thank you, Mili. And really it's been a great meeting, and thanks to everyone for all the great talks, and really such a great intellectual environment. Intellectual environment at this conference. So, I want to continue with this theme of the morning, or at least of this first half of the morning, on combinatorics problems in mathematical phylogenetics. And so this enigmatic title is a reference to a paper of Joe Felsenstein from 1978, which really is a great paper on tree counting. Tree counting, and where he remarks that the principal uses of the numbers that he calculates would be to double-check algorithms and notation systems and to throw the taxonomous. I love this paper. So we're kind of think about what are the uses of combinatorics, mathematical phylogenetics, particularly tree enumeration. So we've got Felsenstein's list, checks on computer programs. Checks on computer programs. If you're trying to encode a list of trees in a program, you've got to make sure you've got the right number of those when you're running your program. Checking notation systems, and I would include the system that Julia just described with the matrices as a kind of a notation system for trees. There's this nice phrase in the paper, mathematicians diversion. And of course, frightening taxonomists. Finally. So I think this paper is really important as it is. It does have a little bit of a kind of a self-awareness about its position in the world of systematic biology. And it's maybe not super excited about combinatorial enumeration, but I'd like to make the case that there are a lot of really additional great uses for combinatorial enumeration in. Comatorial enumeration in mathematical evolutionary biology. So, going back just to the beginning of enumerative comatoics of trees, it really starts as a mathematical subject without much thinking in biology, or really any. And this is one of the early papers from the 1800s. And you can kind of get a sense of what it's trying to think about, which is kind of putting parentheses into expressions to get. Parentheses into expressions to get the same outcome. And it's almost like prefiguring what we use as the Newick notation for phylogenies. And a lot of the early tree thinking is about trees of notation for order of operations. So this is Schroeder, 1970. Other person whose name comes up quite a bit in this period is Arthur Cayley. And you see explicit notation and wording around. Notation and wording around trees in some of his papers, this one from 1889. And the earliest ones are from about 1856, one of them in French, and then this one in 1857. And again, you can see that order of operations is part of the backdrop. And I was just scrolling through this the other night. It's got some of the tree diagrams in it. You get to the end of the paper, and kind of the top of the page, Professor Sedgwick's remarks on the Sedgwick's remarks on the president's address, Geological Society of London. Thanks, of course, Adam Sedgwick, the geology teacher of Charles Darwin, and kind of an important figure in his intellectual backdrop. So that's an exciting missed moment of, you know, kind of the connection between evolutionary biology and mathematics. And kind of feeds into this quote that one can find in Darwin's autobiography that many people. Darwin's autobiography that many of you probably know. I took up mathematics during the summer of 1828 with a private tutor, a very young man, far enough from education to be anything but, but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, and after years I regarded it not proceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics. So I give this code to my daughter. She likes to draw and draw a picture of the story represented here. Picture of the story represented here. And so here's what she came up with. Pay attention, Charles. Pay attention, Charles. That's right. Okay. So. She's kind of spelled center wrong. Okay, so when do we finally get the beginning of the joint interaction between comet or numeration and evolutionary biology? And kind of think about this Yule 1925 paper that we've been talking about a fair bit as being the beginning of tree thinking in a mathematical sense in evolutionary problems. And this is the beginning of the And this is the beginning of the peer birth process where Ewell is kind of imagining trees that evolve in such a way where a lineage splits and each lineage is equally likely to be the next to split. And that's, of course, the assumption that shows up in the coalescent and birth and death process, and lots of other model assumptions in phylogenetics. And in our symposium a couple weeks ago, Amari. Ago, Amari Lambert made the interesting comment that actually Yule isn't really thinking about trees in this paper. It does induce a sense of tree thinking that Yule's perspective on species evolving within genera isn't explicitly about trees, it just sort of implies it. So, one really has to look forward into the 1960s to papers like this one from. To papers like this one from Edwards and Kevali Sworza, where there's kind of enumerations of classes of trees with the explicit intent of using those classes of trees for inference problems in phylogenetics and just for thinking through what are the possible shapes the trees could have when trying to infer biological relationships. And by the time Edwards and Caballi Swords are doing this type of work, we've already reached a period where A period where mathematicians can write in papers about trees. Our object is to augment the already rich literature on the enumeration of trees by the addition of several previously uncounted species. And I like to use the word species here, where species is used to mean class of trees rather than a biological meaning. And this is, of course, the paper made famous in one of the only depictions of. The only depictions of comedy linear information of trees that I've seen in popular culture Goodwill Hunting. Okay, so you know, kind of it's a bit after that Edwards and Fellows Forza, we get the Felsenstein paper and other work of Anthony Edwards, as well as really this really seminal paper of Harding that is thinking probabilistically about tree shape. What are the probabilities of tree shapes that would be produced by? Shapes that would be produced by random bifurcation, where random bifurcation is essentially the assumption of Ewell's model that each lineage is equally likely to be the next to split. And so kind of probabilistic thinking on this combinatorial space of trees. And so we're going to have a lot more to say about this just in that special issue that'll be upcoming, and Carolyn and Julie are both writing papers for that special issue, co-edited by Tanish Dahlberg and Mike Steele. Okay, so. Okay, so with that long introduction, I want to spend the time talking about one particular class of combinatorial enumerations, which is that of the labeled histories. So labeled history is a sequence of coalescence events. So for a labeled tree, it's the sequence of events that have given rise to that tree. And so if we think about what Pilio was describing, ranked tree shapes, this is the ranked tree shapes together with the labels. Tree shapes together with the labels for the lineages, both on the leaves as well as the order in which those branching events occur. So we'll look at this label topology with four species. You can see that the shape is the same, but what's different is which pair of lineages branches first, whether it's C and D branching first or A and D branching first. And the key importance of The key importance of label histories is that randomly joining pairs of lineages leads to a uniform distribution over the set of label histories. And that comes from the Edwards paper from 1970, the number of label histories that are possible for a set of lineages. You take n choose 2, times n minus 1 choose 2, times n minus 2 choose 2, and so on. Like which pair of lineages coalesces? There's 18 for four. Yeah. So those have the same. So, those have the same labeled topology but different labeled histories? That's right. Okay. So, yeah, so I guess this concept of labeled histories, you know, it's shown up in a variety of probabilistic problems for my lab over a long period of time. So, just a couple of examples. So, in work with James Deggan, we were thinking about gene trees and species trees and probabilities of particular gene tree topologies, conditional. Gene tree topology is conditional on the species tree. And kind of a key insight in that work is that if the branch lengths of the species tree are small, then gene lineages coalescing above the root of the species tree are more likely to produce shapes that have a lot of label histories. So, in particular, in this example with four species, symmetric label topologies have two label histories, and the asymmetric Label histories and the asymmetric labeled topologies have only one labeled history. So we can end up with this situation where the most likely labeled topology differs from that of the species tree. So the most likely topology for gene tree can differ from that of the species tree. And just kind of stepping back, you know, one step here: the probability that a given labeled tree topology is produced by randomly joining pairs of images. By randomly joining pairs of images, it's proportional to its number of labeled histories. So, when trying to think about probabilistic models for tree shapes, it's important to count label histories for different labeled topologies. And this is important both in kind of Yule-type thinking for phylogenies, trees of species, as well as for coalescent models of lineages. And these are just the most probable shapes, the shapes with the largest numbers of labeled history. With the largest numbers of labeled histories for a labeled topology with four, five, and six. So, two labeled histories here, three labeled histories here, and then eight label histories over on the right. And again, this comes from that paper of Harding from 1971. Okay, so another area of use of label history is this is a lot of work from Rohan, who's here, on probability that sets and lineages are monophilic. That sets of lineages are monophyletics. So, you know, kind of a computation that comes up a lot in species delimitation, kind of thinking about speciation, you know, recently diverged species. What's the probability that the lineages in a species have a monophyletic genealogy? And so from one of Rahan's papers over here, kind of got sort of two different sets of lineages just labeled in different colors and asking probability, asking questions about the probability if lineages are. If lineages are evolving on some kind of a species divergence model, the probability that a set of desired lineages has a monophyletic gene tree. So you can read about that in three papers or talk to Rohan. You know, and just one empirical example from this line of work was about testing the extent to which shapes of gene trees in maize and tiacinte. Trees in maize and Tiacinte align with the predictions of a population divergence model that was in a paper of Jeff Rasabara's group, where there's a model posed for what the divergence looks like for improved land races in maize and then of two different species in teosinte. And kind of this takes a little bit of parsing, but what you can kind of see is that. It takes a little bit of parsing, but what you can kind of see is that there's a theoretical prediction that's represented by a triangle, and then there's an observation that is a fraction of genes in the maize and TSCT genomes that have a particular monophyly pattern, and there's an agreement between the theoretical and observed effects. Okay, so those are two kind of older lines of work. So, a lot of people here have had kind of pandemics come up. Of pandemics come up a number of times and kind of pandemic-related projects. I would like to describe a project that I would maybe call more like a pandemic-inspired project in the sense that it's not work that was about the pandemic or any way at all helpful with the pandemic, but was inspired by something that happened during the pandemic, which is, of course, this. Of course, this event that, so for those of you not in the US, right? So, this is a college basketball is a big sport in the United States, and there's the annual men's and women's tournaments with large numbers of colleges playing in a single elimination format where each game the loser is knocked out. And so there was this. Knocked out. And so there was this interesting news story about how, in 2020, they announced that in the 2021 year, an event that is typically spread across the United States is going to be held all in one city. So Indianapolis for the men, Sanatana for the women. And so, of course, the first question that comes to mind is: how many game sequences exist for a single elimination tournament if all the games must be played sequentially in one arena? And so, And so that question, after thinking about it for a couple of minutes, is how many label histories exist for a label topology when you specify which leaves are which. So you can kind of think about this as a phylogeny of 68 species or as a sports tournament with 68 teams labeled 1 to 68, where, for example, teams 2 and 3 play and then the winner plays. Replay, and then the winner plays team one, and then the winner plays the winner of teams four or five, and so on up to the championship game. So, you know, that was kind of my first reaction to thinking about this just a little bit. And then there was kind of a thing I'd misread in the News stories. They were all going to be played kind of in the Indiana area, but it wasn't all going to be in one arena. It was going to be multiple arenas, but all in the same location. So let me get to that in just a second. So this is just a sports tournament. And that's the men's, and that's the women's. And very conveniently for this project, Stanford happened to win the women's tournament in that year, which was quite helpful later. Was quite helpful later, as I'll mention in a bit. Okay, so how do you count the number of labeled histories that exist for a labeled topology? So, this was first done by Knuth in a context that was only about partially ordered sets and was just thinking what, you know, got a partially ordered set, you know, how many ways are there to kind of arrange the nodes? And kind of appears in some exercises in one of his books. Rediscovered a few different times, the first time in biology, I think this is a paper by Brown. This is a paper by Brown that was in 1994. And essentially, it's a computation that involves for each node of the tree, you count the number of descendants of that node, the number of leaves that descend from each of the internal nodes. And there's kind of a recursive computation where you kind of find all the ways of labeling leaves within one subtree and then in another subtree, and then you combine those labelings. And then you kind of combine those labelings and then label the roots. So you put a classic kind of tree-type math where you kind of do something on the left, do something on the right, and then merge them together and then do something with the root. So, okay, so how many ways are there to schedule a single elimination tournament if there's only one arena available? We know how to do that. That's labeled histories. We've been counting those for a long time, starting with Edwards and then Brown. But now suppose. But now suppose what if multiple arenas are available, as actually was the case in those tournaments in 2021. So, well, this is actually a question in the kind of coalescent D space, with kind of coalescent theory. You kind of think about lineages merging kind of one pair at a time. But there's this whole generalization. Generalization of coalescent theory that involves other more general assumptions, such as simultaneous binary mergers. So, when you have a small population, you could have simultaneous binary mergers, and that might be a good assumption to include. And we might have heard something that includes that assumption in the John Wakely talk that we didn't get to hear. Can I ask a quick question? Strictly only care about the topology because there is an order in here that so you need to think about the history to some extent. But I'm confused because, like, at any fixed depth in this tree, it doesn't matter, like, chronologically whether, for example, you need to know the outcome of the 2-3 pair before you know who one is going to play. But it doesn't matter if, like, 6-7, and 15-60, like, the order, not all the orderings matter. Why is it delayed in history? Yes, that's exactly right. Why is it the labeled history that you really want to count here? Because the labeled histories are the events, when you have random branching in a sequence where each lineage is equally likely to produce the next bifurcation, the label histories all have equal probability. And maybe we should kind of come back to it. But you know, like, okay, if one is used to thinking about sports tournaments, you know, the way a sports tournament usually works. You know, the way a sports tournament usually works is you play all these games, then you play all those games, then you play all those games, and so on. But there's nothing about the tree structure that tells you you have to do it that way. You would just play this whole half of the tree down to the winner of that side of the tree, and then play this whole half of the tree to the winner of that side of the tree, and then have your final game. The answer is it's not about the ordering of the magic, it's because it's the label histories that are uniform. That's right. They're equally like, okay, that's right. Got it. Okay. So, alright, so go lessons. So, alright, so coalescent theory full of multiple mergers, simultaneous binary mergers, simultaneous multiple mergers, like all of this is kind of part of that whole intellectual tradition. So, this question about enumerating label histories with multiple arenas available, that's enumerating label histories with simultaneous binary mergers. And here's just a flavor of what that enumeration looks like for small trees. So, you can kind of just kind of look at. Small trees, so you can kind of just kind of look at the bottom row here. So, here's the shape of it, say, shape of a tournament or the shape of a tree with six tips. And there's six ways to label or to order the internal nodes if there's no simultaneity. So, if we have to put those nodes at different levels in time, there's six ways if there's going to be one pair of simultaneity. There's going to be one pair of simultaneous, one simultaneous pair, and that would be like, you know, one pair on the left is at the same time as one pair on the right. And then there's only one way to do it where we have either, in this case it's two pairs, two simultaneous pairs, where so these two cherry nodes would have the same time, and then the two nodes that represent three descendants would also have the same time. So that would be only three separate time periods. Separate time periods when you could watch a game on TV. There's only three nodes that have distinct time points. And so the enumeration proceeds by a recursion that generalizes that recursion that was originally solved by Knuth and then by Brown. And the key way to look at this is to have a lot of technical notation. There's sort of a lot of technical notation, but you know, there's something with the letter L and something with the letter R, and whenever that happens in trees, that means you've got a left side of a tree and a right side of a tree. So you do something on the left side of a tree, something on the right side of a tree. And then there's another term, which is what's merging those two parts of the tree together, and that's a trinomial coefficient. And the trinomial coefficient comes from three possibilities. Either the thing on the left side comes first, the thing on the right side comes first, or the things on the left side are happening at the same time. So, yeah, so I guess we ran this computation and solved this enumeration problem and did it for all the small trees. And because Stanford had won the basketball tournament, we were able to get a rare math story into the university news. And, you know, kind of said, canonical scheduling choice is chosen from a quite remarkably high. Is chosen from a quite remarkably high number of possibilities, and I was able to get them to get these numbers onto the paper. And I have to say, there is an element of frightening taxonomists in having done this. Okay, so that's labeled histories with simultaneous mergers. And so, of course, mathematical models and biology, what do we want to do next? We want to generalize, right? Right? We can argue about that point. All right, multiplication, right? So go up to multiplication, right? Because actually, label histories, to my knowledge, have never really been studied with multiplication. And of course, in phylogenetics, we often do have multiplication. We'd like to know something about multiplication and probability distributions with multiplication. There is some multiplication in some of the Canuth-type work and Richard. News-type work, and Richard Stanley in particular has an exercise in one of his books. But we can then try to solve these problems by writing legal histories with multifarcation. And of course, that leads us back to sports. Let's say how many ways are there to schedule a single nation arifurcating sports tournament? Okay, almost done here. And so the next simplest case is trifurcation. I looked around for a sport that has trifurcation, and the one I've And the one I found is right, so Game Show, organizing a sports tournament with Game Show tournament with Trick Location. And so they ran this tournament with 27 players, where they did it not in the way you'd usually do a sports tournament. They did, this was game number one, game number two, and game number three, and then they played game number four to get their finalist on this whole side of. On this whole side of a tree. Then they did another eight players, or another nine players to get a finalist, and then another nine players to get a finalist. And then they played the three winners. And so that was the winners of games 8, 12, and 4 played in game 13. And I'll leave it to you to watch the video if you'd like to go back and watch that. But what I thought was really quite interesting is that when they ran the tournament in the second year, they chose a different Second year, they chose a different label history. So they did, you know, they, I don't know why the front number five were there, but they did like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. They probably just, you know, had some ability to rearrange them for dramatic effect after having filmed them all. But then, you know, kind of similar to games 10, 11, and 12 in the finals. And the total number of possibilities that they could go through is 7,484,000. Subnormal 484,400. Okay, I'll skip this one and just go back to this. Felsenstein's uses for tree enumeration, additional uses for tree enumeration. So we've got intermediate steps in mathematical analyses in coalescent theory, expansion of assumptions for genealogical problems, such as the simultaneous mergers, define spaces for traversal when computing probabilities. So that's really a big one. When computing probabilities, so that's really a big one, and that happens in Rohan's work and also in kind of computational complexity analysis for algorithms, probability analysis for tree shape. A lot of connections with tree structures and other areas, and that's kind of really a nice piece of this whole project. And kind of feeding that back into the mathematical community for facilitating what might be discovered in the OEIS. In the OEIS. Great opportunities here for undergraduate research in methodical evolutionary biology. And, you know, we've kind of had a lot of discussions at this conference about which way are we going from math to biology or biology to math. And in this set of projects, I feel like there's been a lot of feedbacks in both directions. And I'd say just more generally, mathematical phylogenetics has been an area that's kind of had a lot of bidirectional. It's kind of had a lot of bidirectional work, and of course, publicity for university sports teams. So, thanks very much. And then, very historical treatment: mathematical literature. Were those all static? Is that always static? Were those all static? Was that always static, or was there a dynamic element of the development of the trees? I don't think there was any dynamical sense. Yeah, and I've actually had this happen in reviews with, you know, it's kind of like I think when we look at a tree, we immediately see a time dimension on the tree. And sometimes, you know, say some of the combinatorial branches of math, there isn't a natural sense of looking at a tree and seeing. Sense of looking at a tree and seeing it as having evolved in time. It's simply a graph of a set of objects on objects. So kind of one of the ways that there might be some ways to connect that. Thank you.
