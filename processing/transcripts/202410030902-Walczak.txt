And a recent work with this title that was assigned to it by Paul. Thank you for that. This is joint work with Tara Abrishani, Martin Dryanski, James Davies, C. Yingu, Iana Masajikova, Pavel Jonzzevski, and myself. My name is Jacques Palcza. Okay, so I will be speaking about what kind. Be speaking about what happens when, in certain classes of graphs, we exclude a Berlin graph. But let me start with telling you something about Scott's conjecture and around Scott's conjecture. So, this is going to be the first part of my talk. So, first, I need the definition. So, first, I need a definition, which perhaps a lot of you know. So, a class of graph G is chi-bounded if there is a function f with the property that for every graph G in the plus G, the chromatic number of G is bounded by the value of the function. Value of the function applied to the peak number of G. The peak number is the maximum size of a peak in G. So we know this is not true for all graphs because there are those various construction of subjective graphs with arbitrary large chromatic number. But also, we know that there are a lot of classes which satisfy that property. So, in particular, there is this famous Gerdfar-Sabner conjecture. Is this famous Janfar-Sandner conjecture that whenever we exclude a forest as an induced subgraph, then the class will satisfy this property, the class will be Kaibalden. And we also know that if we exclude something that is not a forest, just one graph as an induced subgraph, and that graph is not a forest, so it contains a cycle, then the class is not chi-bounded because there are high-chromatic high-density graphs. And okay. And uh okay, various uh o cases of this uh Gelfar-Samner conjecture are proved, but the conjecture in general is still considered wide open. So Alex Scott in the 90s proved some kind of different took some kind of different approach to this to this conjecture, namely instead of excluding a forest, he asked what happens if we exclude What happens if we exclude for a fixed forest, we exclude all subdivisions of that forest, all induced subdivisions? And he proved that in that case the class is indeed high-bounded. And then he made this conjecture. So this is a conjecture. Well, no longer a conjecture. Now we know it is not true. But let me write it this way. For every For every graph F, the class of F subdivision three graphs is a kind of So this conjecture is true for forests. That's the result of Alex. It's true for K4 and this is a combination of observation of Alex and the result by Levesque, Mafre and Strottignon from Lafre and Trotignon from 2012. Again, it is also true for something that is called banana forests. So these are graphs which look like this. This is a result by Paul Seymour and Alex Scott. And there are a few more cases which are somewhat similar to this. I think we can add I think we can add one more edge like that, and it still remains true. There was something like that. I don't remember precisely. But in general, the conjecture turns out to be false. Perhaps also one interesting case of that is the cycles. So what it means that we forbid subdivisions of a fixed cycle Of a fixed cycle, that means that we forbid cycles of at least some length, induced cycles of at least some length. So, this was one of the well-known conjectures of Yarfash, and that was again proved by Chudnowski-Scottsimo in 2017. And like, I believe that this conjecture was motivated by the result on forest and this conjecture about cycles. Yes? So, yeah, if. Have yeah, if okay, but we know now that this is false, so let me tell you about a specific class of graphs which satisfies this condition, so it excludes all induced subdivisions of a fixed graph. So, this is a class of graphs called string graphs. So, string graphs are intersection graphs of curves in the plane. So, curves become vertices of a graph, and whenever Become vertices of a graph, and whenever two curves intersect, we put an edge between two vertices. And there is an observation, maybe I will not write here, observation by Zinden, 1966. So, like one of the first two papers about string graphs, is that string graphs Graphs exclude induced subdivisions of one subdivisions of a non planar graph. So we take a non planar graph, subdivide every edge at least once, and that's not a string graph. And that's not a string graph. So maybe let me be more specific. One subdivision, say K133. So this is a complete bipartite graph 3 by 3, and we subdivide every edge exactly once. Okay? Why this is the case? Suppose that this is representable as a string graph. So, like the branch vertices of this concrete bio. Of this complete bipartite graph or any non-planar graph. They have to be drawn as independent curves, like that. And now every connection between them, so the subdivided path, it is drawn in a way that avoids all other of these paths. So essentially, we are getting a planar drawing of the graph that we started from. Okay, yes, so string graphs exclude induced subdivisions of some graph, like this. Then, Bering in 65 provided the construction of a sequence of graphs which are triangle three. 3 large chromatic number, so say that chromatic number of pk is equal to k plus 1. And his goal was to find such a family which is representable as intersection graph of three-dimensional axis parallel boxes. Okay? So representable As 3D box intersection graphs. And somehow this construction became forgotten over time, and only around a decade ago. Avrik, Ko≈æik, Kravicek, Lassoi, Micsek, Trotter, and myself, we proved that actually these graphs are string graphs. They are representable as string graphs. Okay, so BK is a string graph. So that means that the class of string graphs is not chi-bounded, because we have Graphs is not chi-bounded because we have this construction. And as a consequence of this observation, Potts' conjecture is false, yes, because the class of string graphs satisfies this assumption. Okay, so I will show you this construction later during my talk. Okay, for now, you can think of just Think of just some construction of triangle free graphs with literally large chromatic number, like your favorite one, whatever it is. Okay, so what can we do? Is there a way to, in some sense, save Scott's conjecture? So, what is nice about chi-boundedness? It tells us. It tells us that if the chromatic number of a graph is large, that there is a finite size witness, this complete graph which sits inside, it is a finite size witness of large chromatic number, which itself also has somewhat large chromatic number. Yes, not as large as the entire graph, but it is still large. So let me make a So uh let me make this definition that a class of graphs is P bounded This is just for the purpose of this talk. If there is a function with two parameters such that for every graph G in the class The chromatic number of G is bounded by a function. The first parameter is the click number, and the second parameter is the maximum size, the maximum BK, which can be found as an induced subgraph. Okay, so maximum k such that the BK is an induced subgraph of G. Of G. So it may look as a strange definition, but it follows this thought that, okay, if the chromatic number is large, then we want to have a finite size witness, and now the witness is either a complete graph as an induced subgraph or a large Berlin graph as an induced subgraph. Okay? And So Tudnovsky, Scott, and Seymour. Let me. This is a conjecture by Tubnovsky, Scott, Seymour, this article 21. So they try to save Scott's conjecture in the following form, just by saying that, okay, instead of I bounded, let's now require that it's the classes B bounded. We have a construction which We have a construction which disproves this conjecture. So, and we don't know of any other construction, so why not suppose that this is the only known construction? Okay, so let me write this. For every f, the class of f subdivision three. Three rubs okay I'm not sure whether this conjecture is natural or whether it's crazy so they write in the paper that we have little like quote we have little faith in this conjecture Conjecture. So, why it can be considered crazy? Because, like, okay, this is an complete graph, it's an extremely natural class of graphs with high chromatic numbers. But this is just some construction, and you will see later in my talk that it's quite a complicated construction, which, okay, it has some properties that the chromatic number grows. But apart from that, there seems to be nothing special about these drugs. These drugs. So, why specifically this construction? Okay, let me also make a detour in one direction. So, probably all of you know that the K-coloring problem as a decision problem is N-tomplete for N at least 3. And one can introduce the following K-L. Can introduce the following KL column problem, so problem with two parameters. Say that K is a constant L. This is a promise problem. So we are given a graph and we are promised that either the chromatic number of the graph is as long as K or the chromatic number of G is greater than L. And the task is to distinguish these two cases. And it's a big conjecture in the Conjecture in the area which now like very active, it's called the promise constraint satisfaction problems. But this problem is NP complete for every choice of K and L, of course K be at least K should be at least three. So, like to formalize this discussion about finite size weaknesses, if we If we restrict the inputs further to a class which is chi-bounded or which is P-bounded, then actually this problem becomes solvable in polynomial time provided that L is sufficiently large with respect to K. Yes, so L should be at least this function f of this function f of k here or the function f of k in this case. So here in this problem you you need In this problem you need to provide the witness that it's smaller than K or greater than L? I just need to answer yes or no. Then it's trivial for K equals L, so it's not easy. No, no, I have to distinguish this case from this case. So this should be, here the answer should be yes, here the answer should be no, and I am promised that I will never get an instance which does not satisfy that or that. Okay, that this is the problem. Okay, that th this is the problem. So for K equal to L, this is just the K-coloring problem. Okay, but if these two numbers are far apart, then potentially the problem is easier. Okay, so now say that we are given a chi-bounded class of graphs. So if we can find a k plus 1 click, then we know we are not in this case, so we must be in this case. On the other hand, if there is no k plus 1, On the other hand, if there is no k plus one peak, then the click number is at most k, so we cannot be in this case, because the class is chi-bounded, yes, if that is f of k, we cannot be in this case, so we know we are in this case. So the algorithm would just check for the existence of a k-creek. Yes, so this is polynomial because k is a parameter of the problem, and the same happens here. Yes, if we have. Here. Yes, if we have a class of graphs which is p-bounded or any kind of bounded with similar, defined in a similar way, with bounded size witnesses, it's important that the witnesses are required to be bounded size because then we can exhaustively look for them in the graph. Then we can solve this problem in polynomial time provided that the gap is sufficiently large. Okay. So, as crazy as this conjecture may look, it is actually quite likely to be true. And we have proved this conjecture not in full generality, but for instance, we proved it for string graphs, and more generally, we proved it under an additional assumption that the class is too controlled. So now I have to define what it means. So now I have to define what it means that the class is to control or whatever control. Okay. So the class of graphs G is uncontrolled. If there is a function, let me call it key to distinguish from f. Such that for every graph in the class, the chromatic number is bounded by this function g and now we take the maximum chromatic number of a ball of radius r in the graph. All in the graph G maximum overall. Maximum over all choices of vertices, and we take this ball of radius. Thank you. Okay, so we can say, for instance, that it turns out that one control That one controlled is the same as I-bounded. It's not difficult to see. One direction is trivial, the other direction is simple induction on the click number. Then this is stronger, so this implies that p-boundedness, that's trivial. Then it turns out that since Bering graphs themselves, this graphs from the Bering Grass themselves, these grass from the burning constructions, they are two controlled. This implies two controlled, and this implies three controlled, and so on. Say R controlled for some R have this kind of implications. Okay, so Shudnovsky, Scott and Seymour, in the same paper where they raised this conjecture, they proved a few facts about this notion of two controls. So, first of all, they proved that string graphs are two-controlled. Okay, I should write the class of string graphs is two-controlled. String graphs is to console. Okay, and then for every F, the class of F for every F and for every R if the class of F subdivision 3 Graphs is I control than it is two-controlled. So, for x-subdivision three graphs, these two notions collapse. We don't know whether they collapse in general or not. At least, I don't know. I don't know of any hereditary. I don't know of any hereditary class of graphs which would be R-controlled for some R and not 2. Okay, and there is also this conjecture by Scott and Seymour from the 20th actually these classes satisfy that condition so that they are two conditions. That condition so that they are two controlled. So, for every F, the class of F subdivision class is to control. I don't know how natural this is. I don't know how natural this conjecture is. It also can be considered as some kind of weakening of Scott's conjecture, but now it has the drawback that the witness of large chromatic number is not bounded size. It's just some subgraph of radius 2, but not of bounded size. So we proved, this is the main We proved, this is the main result. So let G be a class, let G be a two-controlled class of I could write F subdivision three graphs, but actually we can just assume that we exclude one subdivisions. One subdivisions of TT one subdivisions of KTT for some T so the energy is B. So we have something like this conjecture. Why we have something like this conjecture? Because if we exclude one subdivision of KTT for T sufficiently large, then we exclude three subdivisions of every graph. Yes? Like we have one side of the KTT, we use it to represent the vertices of our graph. Represent the vertices of our graph, and then we use the other side just to route the edges, the subdivided edges, between the vertices that we want. Okay, so this in particular, this applies to string graphs. This also applies to graphs with bounded asymptotic dimension. Dimension. The reason is that graphs with bounded asymptotic dimension, I mean, if the class is hereditary, I should probably write a hereditary class of graphs. Let's just assume that every class of graphs is by definition hereditary. So classes with bounded asymptotic dimensions exclude bounded length subdivisions of some graphs. Graphs and actually, for this result, which is written here, where we have this condition F subdivision 3, it is sufficient to assume that we exclude only subdivisions of bounded lengths, where this length depends only on R. Yes, so at least some H of R, like at most some H of R subdivisions. It's sufficient to exclude those. And And classes with bounded asymptotic dimension, they are controlled for some R because we apply the definition of bounded asymptotic dimension to get that there is a coloring with a bounded number of colors such that the connected components in each color class have bounded radius. Yes, so we partition graphs into a bounded number of subclasses. If the graph has large chromatic number, then one of these subclasses has to have a large chromatic number. Then one of the components of that subclasses needs to have large chromatic number. And the radius of that is bounded. Yes, so we have this R-controlled condition for some R, and then we apply this result to get that it is too constant. Okay, so this so example string graphs or graphs with bounded asymptotic dimension, provided that our class of graphs is already done. Yes? So um I understand the paper. So the down hit implies to control a lot and this Yes, so basically for classes of graphs excluding, like for F subdivision free graphs, this result tells us that all of these collapse. Right, does that control? Yes, so that conjecture becomes equivalent to this conjecture. Okay, so to have this conjecture, it is just sufficient to prove that every class of X subdivision free graphs is two control. What is the graph you choose for asymptotic dimension? That's just a one-dimensional grid or some graph which has. Should I elaborate on this? Because then I will elaborate. Basically, classes with bounded asymptotic dimension exclude some graphs. So I just take a graph which is not in the class, but not in specifically this class. in specifically this class I need to make how is it called I forgot this quasi isometry to make a class of graphs which is quasi isometric with some specific parameters with what specific parameters with this parameter this multi-negative constant H of R. Constant H of R to the original class, and then I have to take a graph which is not in that new class. And at most, H of R subdivisions of that graph will be excluded here, the class that we started with. Okay, so now I would like to erase everything except for the statement on the theorem to go to the Statement on the theorem to go to the second part of my talk. So please let me know if you have any more questions about whatever is here. So the second part will be about Berlin graphs. So let's do the construction of Berlin graphs, and I would like to express this construction in terms of Express this construction in terms of two operations on graphs equipped with a marked independent set. Okay, so we will maintain the fact that our graphs have a selected independent set. I will be then colouring this with a column. So, okay, so first of all, we have some base. So, P1 is the graph which looks like this. It is an edge. It is an edge with one of the two endpoints marked. And now there will be two operations. Let me call them clone. This is one operation. So what does it do? We have a graph and there is some marked vertex. This is a neighborhood of that vertex. So cloning that vertex means doing some. That vertex means doing something like this. Okay, this vertex remains, but I'm creating another copy of it which is not marked, and then attaching a vertex like this, which is marked. This is a clone operation, and then there will be an operation. Let's call it a substitute. So if I take two graphs. Two graphs. One graph has just some. For one of the graphs, okay, so for this clone, I'm pointing a specific vertex V. And this is like the copy of V and V prime. For substitute, we have a graph and a chosen vertex V, and I take another graph, but for this other graph, we take all the marked vertices. Marked vertices, and what we get as a result of this operation is that V disappears and all these multivertices from the graph on the left, they get connected to this neighborhood of V here by a complete bipartite. Okay, so we are substituting this. Okay, so we are substituting this for V. This is why I call it a substitute. Okay, but these connections go only to that. So notice that these two operations maintain the fact that this orange subset is an independent set. They preserve this property. So they also will never create a triangle. So now how do we? How do we create BK plus 1 from BK? So let's assume that we have one copy of BK and it has some marked vertices. I will just use two vertices for simplicity of the picture. So this is BK. Then we also take like as many copies of BKB. Like as many copies of BK as there are these marked vertices here. So each of them also has its marked vertices. So first of all, I'm applying the cloned operation to each of these vertices. So there will be a cloned copy of this plus this guy. Plus this guy, a cloned copy of this plus this guy, a cloned copy of this plus this guy, and a cloned copy of this plus this guy. And then I'm applying a substitute of this for that vertex and a substitute of this for that vertex. So instead of these vertices here, we are getting these connections. And here. Okay, so this was again DK, this was again DK. Originally, what we obtain is DK also. Is that clear how the construction works? So it has the property that it is maintained by induction that Maintained by induction that every proper coloring of unmarked vertices of BK contains the following situation: a marked vertex such that if we look at this neighborhood, then here we will see at least three colours. At least k columns. Okay, so this property in particular implies that if we have a proper coloring of all vertices of decay, then this vertex needs to have a different color from this k, so the chromatic number is at least three plus one, and it can be shown to be exactly three plus one. Why do we have this property? Okay, we have it at the beginning, trivially, for one, yes. For one, yes. And then, assuming that we have it here, first let's look what happens in this copy. There is a marked vertex, say this one, such that we see k colors, for instance, here. We see at least k colors here. So then we go towards this copy. Again, by induction, there is a marked vertex, say this one, such that here we see at least k columns. Here we see at least k colors. Now, if we see exactly the same set of colors here and here, then this one needs to have a different color from this k. And here we have a marked vertex which sees k plus 1 columns. Otherwise, if this set of k columns is different from this set of k columns, then this marked vertex already sees at least k columns. X already sees at least k plus 1 different colours. Okay? So this is the property of Berning graphs, like of this Berning construction. And then we can make this definition that say that B is the class of induced subgroups. Of BK for some K. So, Purdnajapi and Trotignon, in their recent series of papers, they called these graphs Berlin graphs. So, Berlin graph is an induced subgraph of dk for some k. Okay? So, it turns out that this class of graphs has very interesting nice properties, which somehow distinguishes. Which somehow distinguishes this construction of triangle-free hychromatic graphs from other constructions of triangle-free hychromatic graphs. What are the properties that we can say about this? Okay, they are triangle-free, they have arbitrary large chromatic number, they have arbitrary large fractional chromatic number, you can make more or less the same proof, but using fractional colourlings rather than ordinary colour links, just it will grow by half in each. It will grow by half in each step rather than by one. It turns out that it always has a linear size independent sets. This is something that I was telling you during the open problem session. If you are interested how this is proved, I added a small sketch of the proof to the list of open problems, because this is not a published result, this is something that that I plan to include in a planned publication, but I don't know when it will happen. I don't know when it will happen. So just have a look there for the proof. Okay, so large fractional chromatic number, but bounded whole ratio, turns out bounded by 3. What next? Okay, it has representations as 3D box graphs, geometric intersection. They provided a lot of alternative characterizations of this class of graphs. My favorite one is that these are. One is that these are exactly the graphs which have a geometric representation by intersecting frames, so boundaries of rectangles. By boundaries of rectangles, I mean the nested rectangles, nested boundaries, they don't generate an intersection. Every intersection has to look like this, including the orientation, the right. And there are excluded configurations, three excluded configurations. This is excluded, this is excluded. Excluded, this is excluded, and the triangles are excluded. This is the only way to make triangles with that. So, this is excluded. And now, this is just an equivalent characterization of these graphs. A graph is a Bergen graph if and only if it has such a geometric representation. What else? We can recognize these graphs in polynomial time. This is something I did with Pablo Fonchewski. The paper is on archive. Is on archive and in polynomial time we can actually construct this representation. Okay, this is the maximum independent set problem in this class of graphs is solvable in polynomial time. So we have, I believe, the first example of a hereditary class of graphs which is not chi-bounded and allows a polynomial time-independent set algorithm. Okay, and now this result, which in particular applies to Bering graphs, because they satisfy this property, this result implies that this class of graphs is a minimal non-chi-bounded class of graphs. So every proper hereditary subclass is already chi-bounded. Again, I believe this is the first known class of graphs with that property. Okay, so that's Okay, so there is something interesting about these Berlin graphs, which maybe makes it more likely that this crazy-looking conjecture is actually true. Another way of defining these graphs, and you should see it easily from this description, is that B This B is the minimum class of graphs containing E1 and closed under these two operations. So clone and substitute. Okay, basically clone is just part of what happens here, and substitute is again part of what happens here because we can forget about the clone stuff. And like if we look at what is happening here with just these vertices, that's exactly a substitute for that vertex. Okay, so the key idea behind the vertex is that the vertical The key idea behind this proof is that we can replace these two operations by a clever composition of these two operations, and it still generates the whole class of Berlin graphs. So let me say that this is the operation which I will call double. So what does it look like? We take a graph. We take a graph, the same graph, two copies of the same graph, that we write one copy in this way, one copy here. So this copy, we have a distinguished marked vertex, and there we have some G, and another copy of G, but in this copy of G we take care of all the distinguished vertices. Vertices and what we do is we first clone this vertex and then we substitute this copy for that. So instead of this we get all these conditions. So this is a doubling operation. Okay? So the way how I describe So, the way how I describe it, it already guarantees that we do not go beyond Bering graphs. But actually, I can replace this by double. And it's kind of non-trivial. Okay, we see that we can do a clone with this operation, but it's not that trivial that we can do Not that trivial that we can do just a plain substitute. Basically, we need to do this substitute through the entire construction sequence of this graph, showing that this graph is already in our class. We need to simulate this construction and maintain this substitute throughout the entire construction. It will have a cut point when we do the double, when you do the double once, but then when you do the double with this graph, like the second copy of this graph here, then you will suddenly get a vertex here which will be connected to one of these guys. So now this is no longer a cut point. Not just this guy, but also all the other guys here. All the other So after the next double, it stops being a cut point. Are you okay? Is that an independent set on the word? What the marked vertices there are? This is an independent set, yes, because the marked vertices are always an independent set. That's maintained through all of these operations. Okay, so the reason why this description is particularly nice is because it allows us to apply the Chubnovsky-Scott Simul framework. Let me call it like this. Uh so uh so this is this is a way of proving okay this is a way of constructing induced of of recovering induced subgraphs from graphs with very large chromatic number which was Which was introduced. The first paper that I know with the first use of this framework is that paper about long holes. So number three in the series. And then there is this paper number five in the series, which is Chandeliers and Strings. This is the one that I was referring to earlier as well, which further elaborates on that. On that. So, what is it about? Suppose that we have a class of graphs G, which is two control. And suppose that we take a graph from that class which has huge chromatic number. Then, okay, we can, first of all, we are going to prove this p-boundedness. Okay, I no longer have a definition, but there is a function of two. Definition, but there is a function of two parameters: click number and this Berlin graph number. So, I'm going to prove this by induction on the click number. So, in the induction step, we can assume that for graphs with smaller click number, we already have this B boundedness, which in particular means that if I have a graph with huge chromatic number and no burning graph inside, then the first neighborhood of every vertex. Neighborhood of every vertex is small, small in terms of the chromatic number, because it has a smaller peak number. So, what do we do from this two-controlled condition? We extract this two ball with large chromatic number, but then because this first neighborhood has small chromatic number, then it actually means that here we have something with huge chromatic number. Okay? So we can repeat. We can repeat. And here we have something with huge chromatic numbers. And so on. And we obtain a structure which is called a multi-cover. So we have a set with still huge chromatic number and a sequence of covers like that, which we can make as long as we want. As long as we want, but of constant length, so that each vertex here is covered by this set and by this set and by each of these sets. And moreover, we know that these top vertices here do not send any edge to the right because this was always the exact second neighborhood. Yes, the first neighborhood is here. So this set was the set of Was the set of vertices at distance two from here, and whatever was here was from distance two from here, and so on and so on. Okay? We repeat this kind of stuff. But we don't know anything, unfortunately, we don't know anything about edges which would go this way. So, in particular, if we just do that construction, there will be such edges because this is yeah, this vertex it is. Yeah, this vertex is covered by that set and it is covered by that set. However, if we are able to restrict this set and these sets here so that we still have a multi-cover, but something that is called an independent multicover. So independent multi-cover now means that not only we don't have this kind of edges, but also we don't have this kind of edges. Edges, but also we don't have these kind of edges. This is independent, multi-covered. Then should Novsky, Scott, and Seymour show that we can find one subdivision of an arbitrary long bipartite graph in this structure. So, what is the other extreme? The other extreme. The other extreme. The other extreme is something that is called a skew multicolour. So now, okay, we again do not have any edges forward, but we have all edges going backward. And from here to here as well, I will not draw it. Okay? So this is the other extreme. This is called a skewer. As Q1. So let's first see that we can actually obtain either a lone independent multicover or a lone skew multicover. So this requires some care as we extract this multicolor when going on. So suppose So suppose that we are in the process of extracting that multi-cover, and what we are now going to maintain is that each of these pairs separately is either independent or skewed. But in the whole thing, we may have both independent pairs and skew pairs. So, for instance, this might be a skew, but here this might be an independent. The battery. And now I want to continue this extraction, maintaining this property. So using two controlled conditions, I'm extracting the next guy. And now, let's split each of these previous guys into two parts. One is the part which is adjacent to here, and the other is the part which is non-adjacent to here. Is the part which is non-adjacent. So now each vertex here, because it is covered by each of these sets, that it will have a neighbor here or here, it will have a neighbor here or here, and so on. This gives us some kind of a signature for each vertex. Yes? So, for instance, this may be a left-left right vertex, which means that it has a neighbor in the right part here, left part here, and left part. Here, a left part here, and left part here. So, this is a coloring, an improper coloring of that with a bounded number of colors. So, there will be a color class with high chromatic number, and we restrict just to that. So, we restrict to something that is homogeneous and we make these sets smaller, yes, so we forget about these parts which we don't need. This doesn't destroy the conditions that we had before. Conditions that we had before, but now these pairs are already either independent or skewed. So now, when we have a long multi-cover such that each pair is either independent or skewed, we just apply Ramsey to get a long fully independent or a long fully skewed. If we have a long fully independent, we are done. So now the question is what to do if we have a long fully skewer. Quick. So, okay, it's not enough to do what we have done so far. So, what I will try to show you is not exactly that I can find an induced copy of BK. I will show you that I can find a homomorphic copy of BK. Because for induced copy, the proof will be more complicated, and I have no chance to show you all ideas. But showing a homomorphic, Ideas, but showing a homomorphic copy is already quite simple and involves just one. This is the second crucial idea that we had. And by the way, notice that a homomorphic copy of decay also can serve as a bounded size witness for large chromatic number. Because a homomorphic copy also has large chromatic number. Okay, so. So let's fix a sequence of graphs such that each next one is obtained from the previous one by doubling with respect to a carefully chosen vertex. And then at the very end, we get our target burning graph. So, this n is the length of the skew cover that we want. Okay, so let's assume that we have that skew cover. And what I will want to find in that skew cover, now we will be going by induction backwards. So, So showing that we can construct first find in some way find G1 here, then in some way find G2 here, then in some way find G3 here, and so on. So in the I-th step, suppose that I have still I guys here. What I want to find is that, okay, not induced but homomorphic. Homomorphic copy of EK. Which such that okay, the white vertices of that sorry, not BK, but g n minus 9. White vertices I want to sit here and the red vertices, I want to have a copy of red vertices here, and the same copy of red vertices here, and here. I mean, the copy of the same red vertices. The copy of the same red vertices. So the red vertices will have multiple representatives in each of these guys. And we want that this is a homomorphic copy. So now when going back one step, I want to make one more doubling, yes, one next doubling, which takes me from Which takes me from g n minus i to g n minus i plus 1. So, how to do that? There is this vertex V which we see somewhere here. And this W now means that I want to find another copy of G M L. Of Gn. Okay, do you see this colour? Another copy of Gn minus I, which is connected to this vertex. Sorry, not connected to this vertex. It's active. It's marked vertices. They should appear somewhere here, and somewhere here, and somewhere here, and somewhere here, and somewhere here. And moreover, And moreover, all of these red vertices should be adjacent to this V. This is what we are looking for. This is exactly the doubling and maintaining this property that we have this precisely placed homomorphic copy. Okay? So we need to again modify our construction procedure. Modify our construction procedure. I think I will take five more minutes. Is that okay? Thank you. We can cut you off now. So as we are extracting the multicover, before extracting a new part of the multicover, let's do the following thing. So, first of all, this is something that we get This is something that we get after Ramsey. Here we are not able to anticipate which specific previous parts will get to Ramsey, but okay, I can iterate over all of them. So let me just select some I parts from the previous ones and now. And now, for every vertex V here, for every I, and for every subset of I vertices from this, I am asking the following question. Is there a homomorphic copy of G n minus I with marked vertices here, which are moreover adjacent to this V. Adjacent to this V. I'm getting an answer, yes or no. And I'm getting such an answer for every choice of I and every choice of this subset. So this gives a vector, this gives a kind of a signature for this vertex. It will be a very long sequence of zeros and ones, which are answers to this question. However, this second, so, but this is still a coloring with a bounded number of colours. Still, a coloring with a bounded number of colors. So, this has huge chromatic numbers, so there will be a homogeneous set with a huge chromatic number. Homogeneous in the sense that all of the vertices give the exact same answers. Okay, so we restrict, we take that homogeneous set and continue extracting multicolour inside here. So now what happens when we do this construction? Look what I know of this vertex. And now I'm using the assumption that the multicolor is skewed. All of these yellow vertices, so this is something that I have already found by induction. And all of these uh orange vertices, they are neighbors of this top vertex. Of this top vertex here. So there is a copy of Gn minus I which is a witness that the answer for this vertex V and for this specific choice of I indices, that the answer is yes. Because that's the weakness. But now here, But now, here we have restricted, like at this step of the procedure, we have restricted ourselves to a homogeneous set, which is homogeneous for these answers. So, for that vertex, sorry, that's the different call it U. So for now for this vertex V, which vertex this is? This is that vertex which got doubled. Which got doubled? The answer is again yes. And this guy gives us the record. Okay. So that's it. Thank you.
