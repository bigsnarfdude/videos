And so it's a great pleasure to have Laura Fredrickson join us from Oregon. And she'll be talking about ALG gravitational instantons and Hitchin moduli spaces. Yeah, thank you so much for the invitation. It's been a really great workshop and that's a Cocoa platform. Seems like it's a wonderful It's a wonderful way to interact when we're all remote or virtual or whatever you want to call that. So, yeah, today I'll be talking about ALG gravitational instantons and hitch and moduli spaces, which is definitely tangentially related, but not unrelated to the topics at hand, because monopoles on R2 cross S1 are solutions of Hitchens' equations on CP1, and this just kind of One and this just kind of fits just you know, maybe right in the middle of just hyperkalar geometry in general. So, with that, yeah, I'll get started. So, a gravitational instanton for the purposes of this talk will be a non-compact, complete Ramanian forming. A Ramanian four-manifold with holomonomy exactly sp1 or su2. So this will throw out the flat case, and but sometimes people want to include that. So this implies that it's hyperkalar. So we have a four-manifold X with a hyperkalar metric G, and then three complex structures satisfying the normal quaternionic relations and its Kalar with respect to each of these. Respect to each of these. So, when you talk about gravitational instantons, there's always kind of a choice of the curvature decay condition because this is non-compact that you need to impose. And maybe the mildest would be to assume that the Ramanian curvature was integrable and finite. And if you assume that, then the Ramanian curvature tensor necessarily decays like r to the negative two as you go out. Negative two as you go out to the ends. Yeah, so there's some classical families of these gravitational instantons, starting with work by Hitchin and Kromheimer and other people. So there's the, these are called ALE, ALF, ALG, and ALH, where ALE stands for asymptotically, locally the Euclidean. An example of that would be the quaternion space, except for that's flat. Except for that's flat, or R4 with the, yeah, which is identified with the quaternions. And then if you take successive quotients by Z, you get kind of different volume growth. And so the next one down is asymptotically, locally flat. And then after that, the alphabet takes over, and ALG and ALH have no They don't stand for anything. Or maybe people have been finding things for those as well. And it's a theorem of Gao Chen and Xu Shang Chen that if you actually impose a slightly different curvature decay condition, this is somewhat recent in the last couple years, that any gravitational instanton satisfying this curvature decay condition is necessarily of one of these classical families. Families. Okay, so the classification of gravitational instantons is not really based on the volume growth, it's based on the asymptotic model. And so the classical families, the ALE ones, are asymptotic to some C2 mod. If you take a discrete subgroup of SU2 that acts on C2, and so it's asymptotic to that with a flat metric. To that, with a flat metric. The ALF ones, Chen and Chen classified all these different. So the first one is due to Kronheimer, and the rest, Chen and Chen, they described all these different asymptotic models. And particularly relevant for us will be the ALG story, where these ALG ones are asymptotic to some space. It's a relatively Some space, it's relatively straightforward to write down where the cone angle is 2π beta. It's flat, and then the torus fiber is T tau. And so, yeah, these ALG models, our asymptotic models are classified by the parameters tau and beta, which are in turn actually very restricted because you need to make sure that the holonomy around that cone point still lies in SU2. Point still lies in SU2. So that makes this tau and beta, they only lie in a short list. And so you can see that because the tori are of finite size, as you go out towards the ends, then the volume growth is just like the volume growth at the base, which is R squared. And AlH is similar. Okay, so there's also two more recently discovered families. For recently discovered families by Hio Hein, ALG star and ALH star, and they're asymptotic to some other thing. I want to note that the volume growth of these ALG star spaces is also R squared, so just like the volume growth of ALG. But you'll notice that the curvature decay condition is not quite like, you know, R to the negative 2 plus. Negative 2 plus epsilon. It's a little bit of a weaker curvature decay condition. And it's a folklore condition conjecture that these are the only families, so that all ALG gravitational instantons satisfying that the Riemannian curvature tensor is integrable lie in one of these six families. Okay, so then with that, you'll say that Then, with that, you'll say that a hyperkiller manifold is ALG or ALF or whatever, if there's a model and a diffeomorphism from your space minus a big ball to that model, such that the pullback of the metric compared to the model metric is decaying like r to the negative epsilon. And similarly, all the complex structures i, j, and k satisfy similar. Yeah, differences. Questions, comments? Okay. Maybe one comment: that ALG star appeared before ALG. These were the S-monopole modulus spaces of periodic monopoles. Cool. Was that in your paper, Sergei? Well, our paper with Antoine Kapostin about periodic monopoles originally was called New Hypercalibration. New hypercalimetrics, and then we was to drop the word new, but they appeared before so LG star appeared before LG. Okay, all right, so the ALG star are more classical or or they're newer. Yeah, okay, so with that, switching kind of towards gauge theory, there's many hypercaler manifolds from gauge theory, whether instances. Whether instanton moduli spaces or monopole moduli spaces or Hitchin moduli spaces, and some particular examples of each of these are four-dimensional, and so you could ask how they fit into the classification. And so there's a conjecture of Philip Bulch that every 40 Hitchin moduli space is ALG or ALG star. That's maybe not the surprising part of the conjecture, but maybe. Part of the conjecture, but maybe the more surprising part is that every ALG or every ALG star gravitational instanton can be realized as the hyperkalor metric on a Hitchin moduli space. So I want to talk about essentially our efforts to prove something like this conjecture in a particular case. But first, I want to talk about, you know, why bother? So, one reason to So one reason to consider this is that we could use this result to actually prove existence in the Torelli theorem. So here we want to consider ALG moduli spaces of a certain type, beta and tau. And then there's a space of allowable parameters. And the map is just by integrating the symplectic forms of omega i, omega j, and omega k over the homology spheres. K over the homology spheres. And so there's these allowable parameters, and we'd like to prove existence is the same as proving that this is surjective. So there's a history of using gauge theory to prove existence in Torelli theorems. And in fact, this is what Mynerv did for the ALF AK, gravitational instantons. So, what he did is he proved that all ALF, if you look at ALF, if you look at all ALF of this asymptotic type AK gravitational instantons, that within each of these is isometric to one of these multi-taub nut spaces. So the argument is that there was an asymptotic killing vector field, which could be extended to the entire gravitational instanton and then integrated to get the S1 fiber. Get the S1 fiber. So all these multi-tub nuts are, yeah, are come as Gibbons-Hawkins onsats. And then these the fixed points of this S1 action corresponded to these points. And so the multi-taued nut is the Gibbons Hawking onsets on R3 minus K points. So, but then the multi-tab nut, there were enough parameters there to map surjectively onto the allowable Trilli parameters. And here, what you do is you're integrating the two spheres around each of the k-points. And so that's how the existence proof worked in that case. So could you pause a second there? So, my understanding correctly is that these allowable parameters is you will set. Parameters is you will set a number of spheres and you'll look at these integrals over those spheres. And so, in particular, the example you're giving there is if I give you three spheres, that would give me three nuts. If I have more sphere k spheres, I would have a multi-thub nut with k particular points, etc. Right, that the dimension of these. Uh, right, that the dimension of these uh ALF gravitational instantons uh grows like that. So for AK, you need K spheres. Okay, thank you. Yep. Okay, so for the ALG version of the Torelli theorem, the current status of what's been done is that there actually is an ALH version of the Torelli theorem with existence and uniqueness proved by Chen and Chen. Uniqueness proved by Chen and Chen, and that there's some work in progress by Gao Chen, Jeff Biakloski, and Zheng to prove the uniqueness part of a Tirelli theorem for these other spaces, ALH star, ALG, and ALG star. I just want to mention the approach there because it's not at all a gauge theory approach, but the approach for uniqueness is actually just to use the uniqueness theorem for the Theorem for the K3 Torley theorem in order to get uniqueness for these other spaces. So, for the way it works for the AlH space, you can take any ALH gravitational instanton and then glue it to itself. It asymptotically looks like T3 over R. And so there's some gluing radius, and you take one copy of it and glue it to another copy. Hopefully, it'll be a Know, hopefully, and it'll be a closer and closer to a K3, the larger the gluing radius is. Okay, so how does that give you uniqueness? Well, if you have one ALH space that is two different ALH spaces that have the same Torelli parameters, you could take one and glue it to itself, and then the other and glue it to itself. And if you change the gluing radius, you can actually make the Torelli parameters of the result. Make the Terrelli parameters of the resulting K3s match up. And so then you know that there's an isometry between these two. Okay, so because there's this long, skinny, flat neck, the isometry is going to have to map compact areas onto compact areas. And so then by taking that gluing radius going off to infinity, in the end, you get an isometric map from 1k3. map from one K3, isometry from one of the K3s, one of the ALHs to the other. And so that's roughly how that theorem works. And then you can do, it's much harder for these ALH, ALG star, and ALG star spaces because you can't just glue them to themselves. But just as K3s, there's typically 24 singular fibers. Fibers and these all, but you know, there can be less depending on these fibers have different Kadira types. And so these, for each of these singular fiber types, you glue in a different ALG or ALG star or ALH star model. And then the argument is, I think, supposed to be similar to the ALH argument. Questions? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Oh, okay. So in the ALG case, you are expected to get an elliptically fibered K3, right? From this gluing? Yeah, right. But like in the LH, what kind of K3s do you get? Which one? I think it's still the elliptically fibered. You're just gluing into elliptically fibered K3s, but the ALH, you're right. It's tricky to glue the ALH stock. To glue the ALH star into the K3. But they had some interpolating the LH star into the I1, I2 fibers. Okay. So, yeah, so then here's just kind of a So, then here's just kind of the last thing I'll say about this. Okay, so we have these three different spaces, and I'll claim that we definitely can show that Hitchin moduli spaces of a certain type are ALG or ALG star gravitational instantons. And so there is a map here, and Chen and Vyaklowski and Zhang proved that this is injective. And so, what I want to, what I'll talk about today is, you know, the surjectivity of this map. We believe and hope that this is the case. We believe and hope that this is the case. That if this is surjective, it follows that this map is surjective. So you would have a Torelli theorem, and then that in turn implies that this map is surjective, which would imply the modularity conjecture in this certain case. So that all these kinds of ideas are related. And then another reason to consider this This conjecture of Bolch that every ALG or ALG star space could be realized as a Hitchin moduli space, would just be to relate two well-studied areas, that of gravitational instantons and that of Hitchin moduli spaces. And then also, this is maybe our personal motivation. So, this is work in progress, what I'm describing with, sorry, I meant to say this. Describing with, sorry, I meant to say this earlier: with Rafe Mitzeo, Jan Swobeda, and Harmut Weiss. And as you know, we've been working on studying the asymptotic geometry of the Hitchin moduli space all for, you know, a while at this point. And so our motivation for studying the asymptotic geometry of the Hitchin moduli space, and it's, you know, a somewhat similar story to what Michael and Chris described yesterday. Chris described yesterday is that there's this really beautiful and intricate set of conjectures about the asymptotic geometry coming from the work of Davide Gayotto, Greg Moore, and Andy Neitzke. And so this is really kind of was our original motivation for getting into this and I'll say a little bit more about maybe what this approach could tell us even about proving. About proving their conjecture in some certain cases. Okay, so with that, I have maybe two slides on the Hitchin-Moduli space. So the fixed data for a Hitchin-moduli space will be a complex vector bundle E over a Riemann surface C. And there's a couple different varieties of Hitchin-moduli spaces. There's the ordinary case where you don't include punctuation. Ordinary case where you don't include punctures, and then there's you can include some divisor D. And if you do that, you're going to have to include some extra data at the punctures. And these, you know, various types go by the names of parabolic hitch and moduli spaces or wild hitch and moduli spaces, a la Picard and Bolch, or maybe I want to call them like twisted Higgs bundles or twisted wild hitch and moduli spaces. Moduli spaces and Mochizuki has done a lot of work on those. And from this fixed data, you'll get a Hitchin moduli space. And this is a hypertailor space. So the moduli space consists of triples of a holomorphic structure on your bundle E, and then a Higgs field, which is a one-zero. Which is a one-zero form valued in the endomorphisms. Locally, this is just a matrix of holomorphic functions because of this compatibility condition one, all times dz. So, and then lastly, Hermitian metric H, which satisfies this the second condition. And due to work by Nigel and Carlos Simpson. And Carlos Simpson, that once you have the algebraic condition of stability, if you have a pair del bar E and phi, you have some existence and uniqueness for the Hermitian metric and vice versa. So we really won't need much about these hitch and moduli spaces for this, which is kind of convenient. I just want to tell you what the data is. Data is for SL2 parabolic Higgs bundles because that'll be maybe the will be definitely the most relevant case for this talk. So we're going to fix a divisor D on our Riemann surface and then we'll also fix generically this is the full flag situation a complex number M at each of the points of the divisor and then another The divisor, and then another number alpha, which flies between zero and one-half, the parabolic weight. And the way that this controls the Higgs field is it controls the singularities. So you'll see that the Higgs field needs to look like M0, 0, negative M, D 0 over Z plus holomorphic. That's when M is not zero. And that this alpha, this parabolic weight, is controlling the singularities of the Higgs field near the door. At the Higgs field near the divisor. And the reason why it's SL is because the determinant of H is, well, it's because alpha plus 1 minus alpha adds up to an integer. That's kind of why this SL condition is here. But that doesn't really matter. So with that, So, with that, one salient feature of the Hitchin moduli space is that it's an algebraic completely integrable system, which means that there's a vibration of M onto a half-dimensional base. Generic fibers, all fibers are Lagrangian, and generic fibers away from a complex codimension one singular locus are abelian varieties. And why this is important. And why this is important for us is that there's two hyperkaliar metrics on the regular locus. So, if you stay away from these singular fibers, there's one hyperkaliar metric, which just comes from the restriction of the hyperkalia metric on all of M. And this one is difficult. It relies on knowing that H solving Hitchens equations, which is a non-linear Is a non-linear second-order elliptic PDE in H. So very non-trivial. And schematically, it looks like this. It's called the L2 metric because it really looks like integrating the square of things. Here I'm using the notation that eta dot is a variation of the holomorphic structure, that phi dot is a variation of the Higgs field, and that nu dot is some. Field and that new dot is some correct variation of the Hermitian metric that doesn't change, that leaves it in Coulomb gauge. And then if you write it like this, indeed, you see all of the H dependence, not only H dependence, but dependence on the metric variations. And then besides that one, there's a much simpler one called the semi-flat metric, which just comes from the interval system structure. It's called semi-flat because It's called semi-flat because it's flat on the torus fibers, and for that reason, it's too symmetric to extend over any of the singular fibers. And so in the interior, these are different, but the conjecture of Guyota-Moore and Neitsky is that actually asymptotically, these are the same. And so if you take an array of Higgs bundles in Array of Higgs bundles in the regular locus, and you go out along that ray, that the difference of these two metrics is exponentially decaying. And I've written this schematically, that there's some first exponential decay condition, and they give both a recipe for the exponential decay and the coefficient. And then there's some faster decaying pieces, and that they truly give a full series expansion of. Series expansion of this difference. But I'll just stick with the first, this kind of weaker version of their conjecture for most of the talk. So this L and this omega have some geometric meaning. In the rank 2 case, the Hitchin base is everything, that's the base of the integral system. That's the base of the integral system is holomorphic quadratic differentials. So it looks like a holomorphic function times dz squared, and then this L is just is up to a scale, the length of the shortest geodesic in this flat metric. And so, yeah, so you can take the, if you have two zeros, and then here the orange is the pole and the blue is the zeros. And you see, I picked the zeros that were closest. You see, I picked the zeros that were closest together, and so L is reading off that distance. Alternatively, if you'd prefer something a little bit more disk-like, there's this spectral curve perspective. So that Higgs field is locally a two-by-in this case is locally a two by two matrix of holomorphic functions, and so you can consider the eigenvalues of that. And that's generically a two-to-one cover over the base. One cover over the base. And so this is the spectral curve. And then L is, up to some scale, the area of the smallest Lagrangian disk in the cotangent bundle with its boundary on this spectral curve. And that's the same because you see that this disk projects to that little line segment. And then this And then this omega is a generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariant, or it's the BPS index of some certain n equals 240 theory, or you can maybe view it as the weighted count of the number of special trajectories in the flat metric. But it's an integer up to scale. There's some kind of other corrections, or it's an integer, but there's maybe a missing. Maybe a missing non-integer piece in front. And so that's what their conjecture roughly is. Questions, comments? Okay. So yeah, we've all been working on proving this and the status at this point is that first Matseo, Sfoboda, Weiss, and Witt proved polynomial decay. proved polynomial decay in the in the rank two case of this of gl2 minus g semi-flat and then David Dumas and Andy Naitzki proved exponential decay are restricted to the Hitchens section in the rank two case and the Hitchens section is a section of this integral system and in this case the Hitchens equation is reduced to a scalar problem so that's the convenience of that The convenience of that. I proved exponential decay more generally and in the rank n case. And then you'll notice that I put all these stars here. None of these rates of exponential decay were optimal. And so then together with Raithmatzeo, Jan Swobeda, and Hartmo Weiss, we proved exponential decay for rank two parabolic Higgs bundles. And the reason why. And the reason why was because we wanted to get one of the smallest hitch and moduli spaces. We wanted to get a 4D hitch and moduli space. And if you don't include punctures, the smallest you can get is dimension 12 rather than dimension 4. So we started to consider this 4D case as, you know, as just a toy case. It is actually Housel's toy model to try to see whether we could get the full conjecture. The full conjecture, or you know, more of the conjecture, if we could prove L or prove omega in this baby case, which is still really hard. And so I'll skip this. Yeah, the key idea is it's similar to what Michael and Chris described about like the asymptotic abelianization and that you're building. And that you're building approximate solutions. And yeah, I'll just call that to skip that. So the case I want to focus on is the SU2 Hitchin moduli space on the four-punctured sphere. So here, yeah, rank two, four points, zero, one, infinity, and then one P0. And then And then what you'll see is that, like I said earlier, we're going to fix a complex number at each one of these points, and then a parabolic weight between zero and one-half. And so there's a 12-parameter family of solutions, one complex parameter and one real parameter at each of these four points. And so for each of this, each member of this 12-parameter family, there's a hitch in moduli space. And it's a corollary. So we proved. So we proved that G L, this L2 metric differs from the semi-flat metric with this exponential decay. And so that actually implies automatically that all these Hitchin moduli spaces are ALG of type beta equals one-half, and tau being the related to the P0 by the elliptic modular lambda function. So that takes care of this. So that takes care of this ALG stuff. And we also proved one other thing, which is that there's a special kind of four-dimensional family of Hitchin moduli spaces and also of ALG spaces, which is that if you take all these complex masses, these complex constants equal to zero, then actually the difference of the L2 metric and the semi-flat metric, we actually got the correct constant of exponential decay. Exponential decay that Guyota-Moore and Nineski had conjectured. And this was nice because we also were able to give a more geometric interpretation of what L is. L is the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian on the torus, T2 tau, with respect to the semi-flat metric. So So it follows that actually that there's actually a four-dimensional family of ALG metrics, which are going to have some very quick decay to the model metric. So there's three kinds of metrics that I want to kind of disambiguate. There's first the L2 metric, and there's the semi-flat metric. Now these pitch and modules. Now, these itch and moduli spaces generically have six singular fibers, all of I1 type, and the local model is built on a Goriwafa. And so, and then there's this G model, which is just this, you know, this cone. And so, really what was happening when we turned the complex masses to zeros, we brought all six singular fibers into one D4 type singularity. And then the model metric coincided with the semi-flat metric, but normally. Semi-flat metric, but normally these are different. Questions or comments? Okay. Sorry, I have a question there. And maybe I misunderstood. And I don't know if this is an excess of humility or if there was something deep in what you said, but you said that you proved the correct parameter there that was predicted by the conjecture. I would, of course, have phrased it differently in saying that. And saying that you prove they had the correct thing in their conjecture, but perhaps there was something mathematical in that statement there. Oh, yeah. Okay, so I definitely have gotten. I was very happy to not talk about the asymptotic geometry of the Hitchin moduli space as a bit of a break. But yeah, no, it was tricky to prove this correct asymptote, this conjecture. This correct asymptote, this conjecture that we proved the conjectured exponential decay. And it was based on the fact that there's a Claude Lebrun had a generalized Gibbons-Hawking onsatz that worked on hypertailor metrics of the Gibbons Hawk that had a S1 symmetry. So when you bring all of the singular fibers together, there's a natural S1 symmetry. There's a natural S1 symmetry, but just rotation around the base. And this actually reduced comparing GL2 versus G semi-flat to a scalar problem on T2 tau cross R. And so then we could look at the we're able to prove a bootstrapping argument that we're able to start with our initial exponential decay and then improve that. the K and then improve that until we got to the first part of the kernel of the of the which ended up coinciding with the the eigenvalue the first non-zero eigenvalue of the of the Laplacian which is the linear term so so yeah there was a there was some math there and yeah thanks for the question Benoit Other questions? Okay, so you had a 12-parameter family of Hitchin moduli spaces. Now I want to talk about the ALG moduli spaces of that type. And so these are all asymptotic to C mod T2 tau over Z2. And And I want to kind of make two different arguments why this is 12-dimensional. One is more of a synthetic construction, and then the other one is a deformation theory argument, which is maybe the correct one. So if you look at the number of orbifold points of C mod T2 tau over Z2 with this Z2 action, you'll see that all of the fixed points of the Z2 action definitely. Fixed points of the Z2 action definitely lie over the zero in the complex plane, and that there's four of them. The origin, tau divided by two, you rotate it over to this point, and then you see that it's the same point in the torus, and similarly, these other two. So, a synthetic construction of why this should be 12-dimensional, kind of based on the work of Picard and Minerb, you could imagine. In Minerb, you can imagine that you should be able to resolve each of these orifold singularities. Each of them locally is asymptotic to, or if you zoom in around one of these orifold singularities, it looks like C2 mod Z2. And so you look at your ALE spaces of that type, and you see it's a Gucci Hansen. And so you glue that in, and there's three gluing parameters. There's one scale parameter, and then And then there's a relative hyperkala rotation. And so, for that reason, you have four Gucci-Hansens and three Boolean parameters, you get a 12-dimensional space. From that perspective, you could also see that all of these have the same homology, that it's a five-dimensional homology and it's generated by this central sphere because T2 tau mod Z2 is a sphere. mod z2 is a sphere um and there's a and there's one exceptional curve in each of the copies of a gucihansen so so that's an argument for the homology um uh we also uh this is with uh uh rafe and and yan and uh harmon and i uh uh in our our work we've written up something that's not uh just carefully uh which is uh known Known, I guess, which is that the neighborhood is diffeomorphic to anti-self-dual harmonic two-forms tensored with R3. And so in this particular case, you can see that you can compute, this appears in Hausel, Hunsaker, and Mitzeo, that this is a four-dimensional space. And so, again, you have dimension 12. And so, yeah, it's a natural question. Are these two? Uh, and so, yeah, it's a natural question. Are these two 12-dimensional spaces the same? Um, and so, yeah, so uh, the conjecture is that, yeah, 40 Hitchen moduli spaces are surjective onto the ALG and ALG star spaces. And if you wanted to know kind of what are the spaces that are in play for these various things, um, here are the different beta tau parameters. You do see that. Tau parameters, you do see that they're pretty constricted by this requirement that it has Z2 holonomy around the point, the torus, the cone angle. And you see that all of these are the relative hitch and moduli spaces as on CP1 with various numbers of punctures. And so I was talking about this one. You can have any tau because Any tau because if you look at the cross ratio of four points, you can get some interesting stuff. But once you get down to three or fewer points, there's no interesting cross ratio there. And so yeah, some of these are these first four are parabolic hitchin moduli spaces. Some you can see rank three. See rank three, four, and six on the three-punctured sphere. And then there's some other ones which you have to include go from parabolic hitch and moduli spaces to wild or twisted wild hitch and moduli spaces. And I've denoted the irregular singularities by these orange infinities. And so, you know, it's a bad, it's too bad you have to go to wild, but at least you're going to stay in range. To wild, but at least you're going to stay in rank two, which is some consolation. So, that's the chart. And these ALG star ones, all of those are ALG, and these ALG star ones are the ones that sometimes go by the name NF equals 0123 in the physics literature. And if you wanted to look those up, you could look at Guido Moronetsky's wall crossing and hitching systems. And hitching systems paper to see the exact hitching bases. For example, okay. So yeah, so this is what we want to consider is what we're working on is proving indeed we've proved that SU2 Hitchin moduli spaces mapped these certain ALG spaces with parameters based. Spaces with parameters beta equals one-half and tau. And then the question is about the allowable Trelli parameters and whether this first map, you could ask whether it's surjective and whether it's injective. And so we haven't finished this yet. This is what's work in progress. But what we have done so far is we've gotten almost all of the way to understanding the Of the way to understanding the strongly parabolic cases. If we turn these complex masses off and set all of these m's equal to zero, I can describe the map in that case. And if you do that, like I said before, there's a special space subset of these ALG gravitational instantons of this type, which have exponential decay to the model as opposed to Exponential decay to the model as opposed to the typical r to the negative fourth. Okay, so what are the Torelli parameters? Like I said, it's the homology, oops, that should be lower, is z to the fifth. And it's generated if you take this situation, then the Hitchin moduli space looks like this. There's a single singular fiber, and it's of a And it's of a D5 spheres arranged in a D4 configuration. And if you, there's a constraint that if you take the, so what the Tralley parameters are is going to be the areas of these four exterior spheres. This fifth, the central sphere, doesn't have any extra data. And that's going to be because there's this relation. Because there's this relation in homology, and that we're always fixing t2 tau to have, it's naturally gonna have some fixed volume, and that's 4 pi squared. And so the central sphere is just a linear combination of these others. And so for that reason, the space of allowable parameters is these four volumes such that the sum is less than 4π squared. So, one kind of interesting feature of this is that there's this chamber structure that zero, that this hypercube is divided into 24 chambers by real codimension one walls at which one of the five spheres collapses. And pictorially, yep, question? Yeah, so I mean, if you think. So, I mean, if you think kind of if the resolutions parameters are small, these are just kind of taking C times analytic curve quotienting by Z2 and resolving. Yep. So in a certain regime, these parameters are just kind of parameters for Eguchians. And then, I mean, it's true that the metric only depends on one positive parameter given the area of one. But But if you think of it in the Torrelli family, that's really a real line rather than a minus the origin rather than a positive. Oh, I see. You want to put the volume of the torus in there? No, no, I'm saying that two spheres could be, I guess, solomorphic or anti-olomorphic. Or anti-holomorphic, so the parameter is really a non-zero real parameter rather than a volume, no? Right, in general, yeah, but in this particular case of the strongly parabolic things, these volumes really are the integrals of omega i over these. So, all right, so the trolley parameters would be the integrals. So, all right, so the Trolley parameters would be the integrals of omega i, omega j, and omega k over these four spheres. Omega j plus omega i omega k is the holomorphic symplectic form. And because these are Lagrangian, this all lives in one in the central fiber. The integrals over omega j and omega k are zero. And the integral of omega i is the same thing as the volume because it's a Lagrange. Yeah, so this is this is actually we're just looking at the case where the uh spheres are holomorphic, and there is a flipped case where they're going to say holomorphic and that that flips this. So this is just sort of one of those uh chambers. Okay, oh gosh, yeah. Right, so pictorially, and this is a two-dimensional kind of representation of the chamber structure, there's kind of There's kind of three types of chambers. There's these exterior chambers, and then there's some special chambers that are adjacent to those, and then there's some other ones. And there's this special Bisois polytope, which exists inside of this big hypercube. And this Bezois polytope, the central sphere, is represented by stable parabolic bundles. And if you're outside the Bieswaw polytope, the central sphere is not represented by stable parabolic bundles. That's an unusual feature that only occurs in the genus zero case. And so, yeah, so there's 24 chambers and Claudio, Meneses has been doing a bunch of work on this. And if you want, I ripped this picture out of his paper. There's a connectivity graph of these 24 chambers, and you can see it's kind of a Chambers, and you can see it's kind of a mess. But a regular ordered mess. So the thing that we've, I'll say what we've done on this. We have a map from the Torelli, these hypercube onto this simplex. And the map is onto this volume where these mu max. Where these mu max at 0, 1 p naught infinity, and μ min is equal to, we have some formulas for this. And we've checked these formulas in two chambers and they seem, so we're still working on proving that in all the chambers, but these seem, I'm very confident that these are the right ones. And so up to checking that, this trellis. Checking that this Trelli map is an isomorphism from the interior of each chamber onto the simplex. And the proof sketch for this is that there's a U1 action on this moduli space, which generates a moment map. And for that reason, the volume is actually just can be computed of each of these spheres, can be computed by looking at the value of the moment map at the top and the bottom at these fixed points of each of the spheres. And so that's exactly. The spheres. And so that's exactly why rhoda is μ is that this is related to the moment map up to some scale. And so that's what's going on here. So in particular, oops, sorry. Yeah, there's a 24 to 1 cover of this simplex. And it is onto. So what we're still working on is turning on the complex. Working on is turning on the complex masses. Once you turn on the complex masses, that one singular fiber breaks into generically six I1 fibers. And the monodrome around each of them, those is conjugate to 1101. And if you wanted to figure out, yeah, so if you want to know where are these four homology spheres now in this picture, so there's a factorization if you go all around these six singular fibers, the total monodrome. Fibers. The total monodromy is negative 1, 0, 0, negative 1. And you can, there's a factorization of this as ABABAB. And this is a unique factorization that you can identify three of the singular fibers as kind of having the same 1, 1, 0, 1 type, and then three other ones have a conjugate type. A conjugate type. And the existence of these spheres is really about whether this collapsing cycle, which is well defined and corresponds to the eigenvalue, sorry, the eigenvector of the monodromy, whether that matches up with the collapsing cycle at other places. Otherwise, you might wonder this collapsing cycle, which is where the sphere is coming from, it might, if you compare If you compare these, it might not glue up into a sphere. Yeah, okay. So these, there's two, there's a sphere between each of these kind of points, these three A points, but one is a linear combination of the other two, and there's a sphere between each of these B points, and one is a combination of the other two. So there's your The other two. So there's your four. And what's in progress is that we're trying to integrate omega j plus i omega k and then also omega i over these four exterior spheres. And we expect that it's a linear combination of those complex masses, the m's, for the holomorphic symplectic form, and that it's just dependent on the alphas, a linear combination piecewise for Piecewise for the omega i's. So hopefully we can report back that indeed we have a survey trajective map onto the allowable trelle parameters soon. And then lastly, I wanted to say in the last few minutes about, you know, how could this help us want to turn back to this other Gyoto Mornitsky Guyodomornitsky perspective, which is, does this get us any closer to like our longer-term goal of understanding Guyodomornitsky's conjecture in the simplest case? And I said that we do have the correct rate of exponential decay, but we don't have this constant omega, and we certainly don't have the series. The series. So here's an argument that we're considering working on pursuing, which would maybe give away an approach to proving the Guido-Mornitsky's conjecture in this case without actually having to do the hard work of actually proving it. It's a proof by exhaustion. Debate is a proof by exhaustion. So Gardemore and Neitsky, they define a recipe to produce a metric, G GMN, using the integral relations. And that metric that they define certainly satisfies the power series. G GMN minus the semi-flat is exactly what they conjecture it to be. So this conjecture I phrased is equivalent to the question: is this metric that question is is this metric that guy more and construct first of all uh is it smooth um and second of all is it uh hitchin's uh hyperkaler this l2 metric that's the standard one on the hitchin moduli space um and so uh the first step would be to indeed prove that it's smooth but once you have it smooth it definitely has this asymptotic type to the semi-flat and so it's also of alg type So it's also of ALG type, and you know it's in this large space. Now, if you have a surjective map from the Hitchin moduli space onto this ALG space, space of all ALGs of this type, then you actually know that the Guyodom-Mornyski metric is the L2 metric for one of these Hitchin-moduli spaces. It just might be the one that you wanted. And so you just, it's a question then of matching the parameters. So it definitely is the same interval system. It definitely is the same interval system, and so you can get that the m's, you can make those match up. And so it's done, it's just a question about whether the alphas are actually equal to the betas. And so this approach would, I don't think it would give you know very much insight into the analytic meaning of Gaudo Mornitsky's conjecture, but it would be an approach. And yeah. And it, yeah, to proving that. So, with that, I'll call it a day. And yeah, thank you so much for the invitation and your attention. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? So, probably it's best to pipe up if you have one. Well, if I may make a comment, this space, the one that you've focused on mostly today, this D4 ALG space, is modulus space of periodic monopoles with four singularities. And from that point of view, it's very easy to see what the deformations are, the parameters. There's a position. The parameters, these are positions of the singularities. Unfortunately, so there's also a physical way of computing asymptotics, which is this Gibbons-Manton approach. And it's a fairly universal approach. It allows to compute asymptotic of modulus spaces of monopoles in various situations. But unfortunately, it's not a mathematical theorem. So it would be extremely useful if somebody would prove that monopoles, when they're fast. That monopoles, when they're far separated, indeed behave as abelian blobs which interact as Gibbons and Melton prescribed. So my student, Rebecca Cross, used some of this and made some sense of this, but it would be good to have a theorem like this, which can be applied to any monopole. And if we had a theorem like this, one would be able to not only compute the asymptotics by also using Tau's approach. By also using Taub's approach, compute exponential corrections. I'm just suggesting this as a project for enthusiastic monopole, for monopole enthusiasts, analytically inclined. Thanks, Sergei. Any other questions? I have got some questions. So, one is this Gautamo Naitsky proposal. I mean, first of all, have they actually First of all, have they actually solved this Freeman-Hilbert problem? I mean, so you make it sound like they have an independently constructed metric, but I wonder if their prescription actually yields a metric a priori. I mean, I think they have some kind of non-trivial Riemann-Halbert problem, which looks quite difficult to solve. Right. Yeah, no, no, I'm not claiming that that's that's why I put that putting proving that it's smooth as a separate thing that needs to be done. Separate thing that needs to be done. No, but I mean, to say this is smooth, you're assuming this already exists, right? So, I mean, are you claiming that this is already shown to exist, but you don't know the smoothness, or has it been constructed? I'm hoping that we could prove that it exists as well as proving the smoothness. Okay, so. So, the second thing is, as far as I understand, the conjecture seems a little bit more general because a priori, you just need a hypercalometric maybe on a complex integral system, something. I mean, it doesn't necessarily have a gauge theoretic interpretation a priori. Is that right? What conjecture you guide on Monetsky's? Yeah, I think, I mean, in a sense that you can produce a metric from certain maybe DT invariant data. Oh, yeah, so this is only in. Oh, yeah. Sorry, well, this is only in this one case. Okay, so yeah, yeah, no, I mean, yeah, the four, yeah, proving the 140 case. Um, yeah, sorry, I meant in this case, yeah. Because this was the only case where we had the right constant of exponential decay anyways, and it's just it's just the simplest of the Hitchin moduli spaces. Okay. Thanks. I had a question, which is that list of A. Question: Which is that list of ALG parameters you had with the angles and such. It looked somewhat close to the sort of setups you have for realizing Penn Levi equations as isomonodromic deformations. And I know you used Penn Levé in your earlier things. I'm just wondering, is there any link whatsoever, or is this just yeah, and I think. Yeah, and I think if you look at some, all right, there's one particular paper by Philip Bulch, which is talking about the Pan Levé versus these Dinkin diagram types. So there's a Dinkin diagram versus, yeah. Though I haven't personally looked at the Pen Leve connection as much on these. Okay, so nothing it doesn't. Okay, so nothing doesn't really appear in your story in any way. No, not at all. I mean, the yeah, if it should, yeah, let me know. Okay. So maybe another question. So do people think that this Kauto-Mornitsky expansion is going to converge with a kind of finite radius of convergence or something? Yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's not an asymptotic series, it's a true one. Okay, thanks. Okay, any other questions? Well, if not, I'll thank her again for a wonderful talk. And we'll see each other again at 1:30. In the meantime, of course, there's the Sococo room if you're There's the Sococo room if you're so inclined. And well, thank you again.
