Surely it's much pleasure. I know those are lots of syllables, Alan. It's okay. Dow. Okay, well, thank you, everybody. I have to say, this is one of my favorite conferences. I have to say, this is one of my favorite conference venues because of the food. I fall in love with the soup and the hot sauce. I think the last time I was here, there was an earthquake somewhere in the vicinity, and we got to feel that at breakfast one morning, which was very nice. So this talk is different than things I've talked about in the past, and it's probably the fastest, the smallest interval between when something is proved and when I've tried to talk about it that I've tried to pull off. So we'll see what's going to happen. That I've tried to pull off. So we'll see what's going to happen, we'll see how this goes. This arose basically last year in Jerusalem. We're having lunch, and Justin mentioned Raghavan Toročevich proof to me and described the ideas. And I was like, it rang some bells with some stuff I'd been looking at with some cardinal arithmetic stuff. So that's where this comes from. And I've tried to gear things so that the point is, I want to get to something that I think. Is I want to get to something that I think is useful in more context because part of what I had been looking for was there was what I thought was a good idea. I wanted an application for it. And it turned out that this is the application I was looking for. So let's go in a little bit of history first. Go way back to the beginning with Ramsey's theorem. I think we are all grown-ups and no one loves this now that if you partition the case. If you partition the k-tuples from omega into finitely many pieces, and one of the pieces contains a homogeneous, infinite homogeneous set, right? There is an infinite H, all of whose K-tuples lie in one of the pieces. And this is the convention I'll be speaking a lot about colorings. And by that, I generally mean just a function, generally to a finite number at this point. So I'm going to look at the step. Going to look at the step of trying to generalize Ramsey's theorem to the uncountable setting. And again, we have a classic theorem of Sierpinski that there is a function coloring pairs of real numbers with two colors such that the coloring doesn't have a uncountable homogeneous set, right? It takes on both values. And it's a lovely idea. You fix a well ordering of the reals and you color a tuple by whether or not the well ordering agrees with the standard ordering of R. With the standard ordering of R. And then you ask, okay, what do homogeneous sets for this color look like? Well, they've either got to be a set that with the standard ordering of R agrees with the well-ordering, so well-ordered set, or reverse well-ordering if you're going the other way. So that tells us, right, that it's hard to get interesting homogeneous sets for this, right? As soon as you hit a, like, have a For this, right? As soon as you hit a set that has an order-theoretic copy of Z, you know that both colors are going to appear because it now just as bad as it gets, right? So this is a motivating question for a lot of research in set theory. And let's talk a little bit about some of the ways this could go bad. Of course, we have Stabo's famous theorem that there's a coloring of pairs of omega one with omega one colors. With omega one colors such that each color occurs on every uncountable subset of omega one, kind of a complete failure of generalizing Ramsey's theorem. Kind of looking at the reals, there's an old result of Saharan that it is consistent that really Sierpinski is as bad as it gets. This is from this paper called Was Sierpinski Right? It's consistent. Write, it's consistent relative to large cardinals that anytime someone hands you a coloring of the pairs of real numbers, I think he writes it with three colors, but you can find an uncountable set on which the number of colors reduces down to two. And the proof actually shows this works perfectly well when you are working with finitely many colors. Original proof using omega-1 Erdős cardinal. Later, Later elaborations on that, it's still murky to me exactly where you land, but it's somewhere in the MALO hierarchy. A couple of aspects of this, the resulting model has two to the olive zero large. It has to be a fixed point of the olive sequence. And it's unclear if you need large cardinals for this or if you can maybe get this with a smaller continuum. Of course, CH is not going to work because of stabos work. Of Stavo's work. Now, looking at the structure of homogeneous sets, you can start asking about: okay, well, we've got a topological flavor going around with colorings of reals. We know that Sierpinski's coloring tells us that any copy of the rationals is going to work on the rationals just as well. And because the rationals have a copy of Z inside of them, you can't get homogeneous sets. There's some old work I am. There's some old work. I am totally cheating here in taking this from the introduction from Dilip and Stabo's paper because a lot of this was unpublished. If you color the pairs of rationals with finitely many colors, you can reduce the number of colors to at most two on a copy of the rationals. I think it's there that it's important that it's order isomorphic to the rational. So you forget about the topology and just look at the About the topology and just look at the order. Baumgartner said that that's an important distinction because there's a coloring of the pairs from the rationals or the omega-mini colors that assumes every color on any topological copy of the rationals. Stable and Bill, some point in the 90s, show that kind of generalizing this to sigma discrete metric spaces, there's a coloring of pairs with countably many colors that Many colors that takes on every color on copies, topological copies of Q. So go back to Galvin's conjecture in the form I'm referring to is that if we color the pairs from R with finitely many colors, can we find a subset homeomorphic to Q in which the coloring reduces to two colors? We know we can't get to one, but is that as bad? But is that as bad as it gets? Now, okay, this is where we get to the Raghavan-Torochevich partition theorem. Assuming large cardinals, Galvin's conjecture is true, and they prove something much more spectacular in general, right? They said if you've got enough, large enough cardinals, then if somebody hands you a metric space that is not sigma discrete, then you can find. Then you can find, given any coloring of the pairs with finitely many colors, you can find something homeomorphic to the rationals on which at most two colors appear. So the sigma discrete, non-sigma discrete divide is kind of detected by this. It's much stronger. It's lovely because it's a direct implication from the existence of large cardinals. You are deducing something about sets of reals, which are always fascinating kinds of results. Results. So let's talk a little bit about the large cardinals they use. Let's see. Given a non-sigma discrete metric space, if you're in V delta for delta, a wooden cardinal, then you get the partition holding. The proof uses a game associated with stationary tower forcing, and it's related to the generic elementary embeddings you obtain from wooden cardinals. If there is a proper class, If there's a proper class of wooden cardinals, that's kind of an assumption that gets you all non-sigma-discrete metric spaces. And if you're interested in just the uncountable sets of reals, you can work with just a precipitous ideal on omega one. Now, reading through this slide, right, there are some natural open questions that arise. Probably the first one that springs to your mind is: isn't this supposed to be a topology workshop? So which episode did that appear? It was filmed in California, I think. I don't know. So, yeah, you're right. I'm not going to talk about wooden cardinals or strongly compact cardinals or stationary tower forcing. I won't define generic elementary embeddings. I'm going to try and work without needing that. Work without needing that. Although, of course, all this stuff is lurking in the background. So let's take a dive into the Ragovan Tororchevich construction. So what I tried to do is go through and I call it a remix because all the ideas here are theirs. I'm just kind of reconfiguring it a different way to highlight some aspects of things. We're going to take a set of reels of size all of one. Of reals of size all of one. We're going to identify it with omega one just by some bijection. Color it with finitely many colors. And I'm going to fix some normal ideal on omega one for now. You can think about it as the non-stationary ideal. During the course of the proof, this is going to vary some, but I want this intuition in your mind. So let me talk you through this. Given a pair of colors, if we've got a pair of J-positive sets, don't think about them as stationary, they're said to be weakly IJ saturated if. I wrote down the formula there, but the way I want you to think of it is you have A on this side and B on this side. They don't have to be disjoint or anything. And the condition I'm demanding is that there is a. There is a positive set of ordinals on the A side that connect to a positive set of ordinals. Each of these connects to a large set of ordinals via J, via I. And going back the other way, there's a large J positive set of betas, each of which connects back to a positive set of alphas by J. So they're By j. So there are lots and lots of pairs on which the coloring takes the value i or j, and there's some sort of left-right orientation hidden in the background. That's weakly IJ saturated. So we are going to have a stronger condition. But let's do some easy stuff first. The point is, if I've given you an ideal, just needs to be something, doesn't need normality or countable. To be something doesn't need normality or countable completeness. If I give you j positive sets, then there's got to be some choice of ij for which we're weakly ij saturated, and that's fairly straightforward because there's only finitely many colors to work around. So for each alpha over here, you know, there's at least one color, I alpha that works. And there's only finitely many colors, so you can stabilize. All right. That's very easy. So every pair of positive sets, there's some IJ that works. There's some IJ that works for it. Now we want to start trying to manipulate quantifiers. So IJ saturated without the weekly is a hereditary condition. I have weekly Ij saturated pair A and B. And if I pass to positive subsets on the left and right, then the result is still. Then the result is still weakly IJ saturated. Okay. A couple of things to note, right? This is inherited downward. If you're sticking with positive sets, if you refine on each side, you still maintain that condition. And I guess the first condition, if we take our ideal J and enlarge it. And enlarge it. Then being Ij saturated over the larger ideal implies Ij saturated over the smaller ideal because positive sets for the small, larger ideal are positive for the smaller. Okay, so that's a couple of operations. We can increase the ideal, we can shrink our sets, and still we'll be okay. So here's my first kind of proof. I want to show that there's an First kind of proof. I want to show that there's a normal ideal in omega 1 and a pair of colors i and j such that for any normal extension of j, we can find an ij saturated pair over i. So, okay, this is the first deviation from what you find in the Raghavan Todorčevich paper. They were working, I guess, with J being non-stationary or precipitous ideal or something. We're doing something a little more general. Only slightly though, because the same proof works. Only slightly, though, because the same proof works. First observation is: if I have this condition holding, then anytime I extend J to a normal ideal and I hand you an I positive set, I can find within that an IJ positive, an IJ saturated pair over the ideal. And that's the observation that if I apply the lemma to the normal ideal where I extend by one set, so I take the ideal I and then. I and then into the dual filter I toss y. Then my hypothesis produces a pair that are saturated over that. I intersect down, and that's fine. So I want to think about this as whenever somebody hands me an extension of J, a normal extension of J, and a positive set with respect to that ideal, I can find large IJ saturated pairs inside. And again, we've already mentioned that if I'm saturated over the larger ideal, then I'm saturated over the smaller ideal. Okay, the fact that this is for every normal extension of J is going to be important. So I will highlight that here and we will remind you of it later. Okay, observation two: if I fix an ideal, don't worry about. Ideal. Don't worry about the extensions. Then there's going to be some choice of colors that works. Okay, let's talk our way through this. What does it mean for a pair Y and J to fail to be IJ saturated? Okay, that means it has an extension that isn't weakly IJ saturated. That's just by the definition. If I write out what that means, you don't have to do this. My point is that once I have a pair that fails to be weakly IJ saturated, then anytime I extend to positive sets, that condition persists. Once it's dead, it's dead forever. So, okay, that's all that's going on in this slide. Now, let's put this into a proof. If a pair of J positive sets fails to be I, Of J positive sets fails to be IJ saturated over J, we can find A and B inside that are large with respect to J or positive with respect to J, and that's not weakly IJ saturated. So we iterate. We run through all the finitely many pairs, I and J, decreasing at a time. And then running through the L squared mini pairs, we would arrive at a contradiction. So at some point, we have to. Contradiction. So at some point we have to hit an ij, which is saturated over the ideal, or else we contradict the earlier lemma that there is an i and j for which we get a weakly saturated pair. Okay, so let's take that and fold in the capturing every normal extension of j. It's the same proof. For every normal ideal J and For every normal ideal j and pair of colors ij, there would be a normal extension for which there is no ij saturated pair over i. That condition is preserved if we take further extensions of the ideal i, because we've seen that saturation goes downward to smaller ideals. So running the same proof, run through all L squared pairs, you would end up with a normal ideal such that no matter what we chose, we're not ij saturated. Boom, that's bad. Bad now. Point here is: I don't have control over the ideal J, I just know it exists somehow, and it will be dictated by the vagaries of the coloring. I don't know. Now, let's fix such a normal ideal, say it satisfies the conclusion of the saturation lemma, and the corresponding pair of colors ij. Of colors ij that states these first two bullet points kind of state what we've discovered: that you know, given any positive set with respect to an ideal extending j, we can split into find ij saturated pairs that are large with respect to that extended ideal. That's the pair of colors that we're going to use to try and build the homogeneous set. So let's go through some pictures. The Raghavan Torochevich proof is kind of technical, but I found that it's kind of, you can see what's going on if you have some pictures. So what I want to do is somebody hands me a J positive set. I can split it into an IJ saturated pair. And I'm going to just keep splitting. Splitting. All right, certainly no problem. I'm not shifting the ideal at all here. I'm just saying that this can be done. Well, what does that do? What I want to point out is that if you look at the sets that are on the right, the blue ones, if I look at a later one and an earlier one, the pair is IJ saturated. Pair is Ij saturated because as we're going down, we're refining more and more, right? So, this is a way of producing kind of an infinite sequence that are pairwise Ij saturated if you look at it in the right order. Next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to try and arrange for these things on the left, even though they've got to be large with respect to my ideal, I want them to be getting metrically small. And that's easy to do because we're working with subsets of R, so we have a nice second countable topology. And I guess the point is: if somebody gives me the normal ideal J and a large, a J positive set, I can cover each one of these guys with a rational neighborhood of a length as small as I want, because there's only countably many of them. I know that for one of those little teeny open sets, I've got to be covering a large. Open sets, I've got to be covering a large piece. So by taking that, playing the normality of the ideal versus the accountability of the topology, you can make these guys be large in one sense and small in another as we go down. So the picture I want to have in mind is this is actually what you're doing. You're splitting, but you're also making them small. Now, what I would really like to happen is for Really like to happen is for the intersection of the S's to be non-empty. Because if it is, you end up with that sort of a picture. And if I take a step back, you end up with this. These are the T's, and they're converging into the point delta. We know that something here with something there is ij saturated. And if And if you're if you do a little only slightly more work, you can arrange that this delta connects back to everything here by I. All right, you you have to take a little more care when you're doing your shrinking, but that's not a problem. All right, so have this picture in your head. These guys are getting smaller, they're converging to delta, delta connects back to everything in blue. Delta, delta connects back to everything in blue by eye. And then the blue sets are IJ saturated if you look the right way. This is configuration as what you call delta is an IJ winner over J in the set S. Now, if you read the Ragovan Torochevich paper, IJ winners take up a part of, well, this is the picture what you want. The only difference here is I have. The only difference here is I've added an ambient ideal J, but everything goes through. The question is, though, that's wishful thinking. How could we guarantee that a countable decreasing sequence of positive sets has non-empty intersection? This would be easy if they were almost everything, but it's not, of course, right? So, this is where the large cardinals are going to creep in. You're going to want some conditions that imply that you can build this splitting sequence so that there's something at the bottom. Okay? Now, let's talk about that. There are a couple of issues. If you have a normal precipitous ideal on omega-1, I'll define that in a minute, then you can leverage that to do it. You want to think about a To do it, you want to think about a precipitous ideal as being a ghost of measurability past sitting on omega-1. Okay? The proof they use is that if there's a wooden cardinal, then you can use the non-stationary deal in any of its restrictions. And that's leveraging a lot of the California set theory to show that, well, you can make that arrangement. And that's the use of large cardinals in their proof. Put that together. If there's a wooden cardinal, then for any uncountable subset of the reals and any coloring of finite cardinal of finite sets, you can find something homeomorphic to Q on which C it takes at most two colors. The issue is building enough IJ winners, which allows you to construct the homogeneous set that you want. Again, they proved a much more general result. I'm focusing on the reels here. Reels here. So, all right, let's move on. That's my Raghavan Todorchevich proof in a nutshell. Picture is really the issue is there's some natural operation we can do. And if it happens that we can arrange something that has not empty intersection, then they have a machine to build the queue that you want. So let's talk about precipitous ideals for a second. There's been lots of discussion of games, and I'm going to. And I'm going to use a characterization of precipitous ideals using a game. This is due to Galvin. The issue is you've got a normal ideal on omega-1, and you want two players to alternately pick. They're just describing a decreasing sequence. And then it's empty versus non-empty. Empty wins if the intersection is empty. So, what we want, we want to make sure that the intersection is non-empty. Well, that's precipitous. Non-empty, well, that's precipitous. Precipitous is exactly the player empty does not have a winning strategy in this game. Okay, now a nod to where this originates, right? J is precipitous if and only if the generic ultra power resulting from forcing modulo this ideal is well-founded. And that's kind of the motivation. The characteristic, the definition I gave is a characterization due to Galvin of this condition. Due to Galvin of this condition, um, I've said they're the ghost of measurability past, they're equiconsistent with measurable cardinals. And of course, you can replace omega one by other sets and structures and get the same ideal. I'm just focusing on omega one here. Now, I want you to take a view, a certain point of view, of that precipitous game. When I switch from ideals to filters, I feel like I'm switching from Israel to California. So let's go. Let's see. We want to think about the two players as adding, trying to build a filter, extending the dual to the ideal we have. And they have control. They each have the power to add one set to the filter when it's their turn to play. Okay? And Okay, and you know, that's the fact that we're decreasing in our game is that okay, they have to do a sane thing and respect previous choices. But the point here is that if you're a precipitous ideal, you're allowing both players to influence the construction of this filter duel one set at a time. Okay. And then empty wins, has a winning strategy if and only if she can ensure that the Sure, that the ideal has the set has empty intersection. Okay, that's precipitous. So, the question of the day: we want non-empty to be able to win sometimes, right? So, the question is, what if we were to give the non-empty player more power? All right. We are still going to hold the empty player to selecting one set of limiting her influence to one set at a time, but we are going to try and let. And let non-empty do more. He gets the freedom to not restrict his move to one set. All right, of course, the point is that makes it harder for empty to have a winning strategy, therefore easier for player two, for non-empty to win sometimes. What might this look like? Okay, lots of ways to go, but here's the weekly precipitous gain. The change is The change is we're allowing essentially the non-empty player to do whatever the hell he wants as long as he keeps things normal. Okay. So as we're playing, empty is going to be handed the ideal, an ideal, and she's going to get to pick a positive set with respect to that ideal. And then rather than just picking a positive subset of her move, we're going to allow the non-empty player to expand the ideal. The non-MP player to expand the ideal more as long as he respects her move, okay, and still keep the same condition, right? So, right, that's a non-empty responds by selecting a normal ideal, extending the previous move, restricted to empty's move. So, empty gets to keep her set in the filter like she wanted, but we get to add more stuff. And the point is, if we're allowed to add more stuff, we're putting restrictions. Stuff, we're putting restrictions on what empty in play. All right, so the definition: a normal ideal is weakly precipitous if empty does not have a winning strategy in this game. All right, let's talk about this for a bit. These ideals have been dormant for a long time. They were first used by Shella in the 1970s when he was doing initial work on cardinal arithmetic. He was looking at ways to extend. He was looking at ways to extend the Galvin-Heinall work on strong limit singulars of cardinality, uncountable cofinality. They obtain bounds in cardinal arithmetic in a situation where they're working with something that isn't a fixed point. And Shela was able to get results even when there was a fixed point using these kinds of ideals. It's actually ZSC theorem. We'll talk about that later. The point is these kinds of That later. The point is, these kinds of ideals are very easy to have laying around. If the point is, if you've got a failure of the singular cardinal hypothesis somewhere, then these kinds of ideals are going to be around because of the large cardinals. So that's again, creativity from Shela. Either we don't care about what happens and everything's trivial. If it's non-trivial, we have these ideals. These ideals allow us to get a foothold at fixed points. I'm not going to talk. But I'm not going to talk too much about that. Yeck named these ideals Weekly Precipitous in the early 80s. There's like one paper where he uses this name. And just when he was investigating games on ideals, Shella observed that if there's a Ramsey Cardinal, then there is a weakly precipitous normal ideal. This is the driver behind, and he's those of you familiar with the numbering, this is Shirach 111. Numbering: This is Shirach 111, I think. Um, yeah, it is, yeah. Well, I mean, he did the work in the late 70s, and then I think Uri wrote it up in the 80s and was published. So, I mean, it's one of my favorite papers, right? That's why it's in my mind. So, if there is a Ramsey Cardinal in there, So, if there is a Ramsey Cardinal, then there is a weakly precipitous ideal. Okay? No consistency. And Donder and Levinsky investigated this and some related concepts. They showed that consistent, it's consistent to get these things in a generic extension of L. The point is, if zero sharp exists, then if you take any indiscernible and collapse it to omega one in L, the result you'll have these kinds of ideals around. You'll have these kinds of ideals around. Okay, so they're they've got a large cardinal. I don't know if the existence of one of these guys implies large cardinals, but they're certainly got that flavor. So let's see. This is the ingredients we had previously. I showed you that there's a normal ideal on J and a pair of colors IJ, such that for any normal I bigger than J, there's an IJ saturated pane over I. And then we have. Saturated pane over I, and then we have the remix of the Ragavantorchevich construction. If we can produce lots of IJ winners, then we can build the homogeneous set. So, I'm going to fill in a couple of steps here. All right, if J is a weakly precipitous normal ideal satisfying the conclusion of the saturation lemma, then we have what we need. Now, the problem is we can find normal ideals satisfying the conclusion of the saturation. Satisfying the conclusion of the saturation lemma, but we don't have any control over them. And we know that if there's a Ramsey cardinal, there are weakly precipitous ideals. We just got to make that match up, right? So this is the part that's really useful, that if there is a Ramsey cardinal, in fact, every normal ideal on omega-1 has this weakly precipitous property. And this is the idea that I think should have broader use, right? I think it should have broader use, right? Because it's just the kind of thing that you find yourself wanting to do when you're playing games. So I'm going to, let's see, make a nod to why the first ingredient holds and then spend the rest of my time on the second because that's the interesting part. If you put these together, then you get the theorem I was advertising that if there is a Ramsey Cardinal, then we get the Galvin. The Galvin conjecture building. All right, so let's take a look at the first ingredient. I want to say that if we've got a weakly precipitous ideal satisfying the conclusion of the saturation lemma, then every J positive set contains a J positive set of IJ winners. All right, so this is just modifying. This is just modifying the argument of Raghavan Todorchevich in the presence of precipitous ideal. And the picture, right? The idea, of course, is we play the game as we go down. The universal quantifier on every extension of J we can find a splitting is what we use to play the weekly precipitous game as we go down. And then the fact that we're And then the fact that we're weakly precipitous means that there is some way of doing this so that the intersection of the red sets has something in it. Now, let's talk large cardinals. I'm using a Ramsey cardinal. I'm not going to use the actual definition of a Ramsey cardinal. I'm going to give it to you, right? This says that if you color the finite subsets of capital. The finite subsets of kappa with two colors. You can find a subset of size kappa such that the coloring is constant for each n on all the n tuples. Okay, and standard large cardinal argument, standard arguments in any introductory large cardinal text show you that this is actually equivalent to you can let the number of colors be anything you want, less than kappa. Now, Now, this is going to be technical. In a minute, I'm going to need to use the board, so we might want some light up here. There's a representation lemma here. I'm going to be handed a normal ideal on omega one, and I want to represent it as a projection of something coming from the Ramsey Cardinal. Let's talk my way through this. Yeah, I'm going to need this in a second. To, I'm going to need this in a second. So, given a Ramsey Cardinal and a normal ideal, we want to find a stationary set, generalized stationary set in the sense of YAC, of subsets of kappa, of cardinality kappa with a couple of properties. We want that there's a projection top to bottom. So, given one of these large sets, its intersection with omega 1 is an accountable ordinal. Okay? And if I take the non-stationary ideal, If I take the non-stationary ideal in a generalized sense restricted to this stationary set, then the Ruden-Hussel projection of it is just the ideal J I started with. So it's representing any normal ideal in the presence of a Ramsey cardinal. We can represent any normal ideal in this form. And this is really reading Matt Foreman's handbook article and adding in something from Larson Stationary Tower. Something from Larson's stationary tower book, both of which are on my bookshelf. So the actual stationary set is you want to think about this as elementary submodels v kappa of size kappa that have j. When I say elementary here, you want maybe an expansion. You're allowed to add parameters and stuff. And you want them to have large size, but you want that this countable ordinal isn't in a small set. Isn't in a small set in n okay. That's the description of the thing we're using, and then a couple of things to argue about why is that set stationary and why does the non-stationary ideal project down to J. Say a couple of words about the first of these because that's really where the Ramsey cardinal gets used. Without the large cardinal floating around, it's just a general kind of It's just a general kind of fact that for almost every delta, if you take the scolem hole of delta in some expansion of phi kappa, that's a countable model, it's going to have this property. And that's just the version of, well, we know delta intersect omega one is not in any non-stationary set. It's just, this happens a lot when you have a normal ideal. You don't want it to be any small set. So this is a J star. This. So this is saying we're putting it inside all the positive, the large sets, right? Okay. So that's. So that's, yeah, not going to be in any small set. Now, the point is, once we get these countable models, we know there's a stationary set of countable models. The Ramsey-Cardinal argument with indiscernibility is what allows us to basically inflate these things to have size kappa, but not pick up any new sets in the ideal. Okay, and that's this is the Larson argument. Larson argument. So I'm just going to totally wave my hands at that because the important thing is we want to visualize this. There's a lot of models that have the property that, you know, when we project down to omega one, we end up with the normal ideal. It's important here that the models are large, though. We're going to use that in a crucial way using deep magic from before the dawn of time. So, key idea here is: I don't actually know how far back this goes. I know it from a paper of Magidor from the late 70s. But the picture is, and I'll go to the board in a minute, there's a way of lifting functions from omega one to kappa to regressive functions defined on the stationary set. Now, in a way that respects In a way that respects the ordering with respect to the ideal. Really, what's going on here is, don't want to define it. You're taking a generic elementary embedding obtained from forcing at the Ramsey Cardinal and using the fact that we're projecting down to omega one to factor it through generic elementary embedding with critical point omega one. This is what that looks like when you're a topologist and don't want to deal with all that nonsense, okay? Nonsense. Okay. So let me show you how this works. So I am given F mapping omega 1 to omega 1, and I want to define F tilde mapping. I guess I've got my, let's go to kappa. Go to kappa. Oh, yeah, yeah, I changed it. Now, okay, this is going to look totally like I reach into the air, but again, there's a generic elementary embedding in the background here. What we do is f tilde of some z. So z here is one of these sets in tilde x. So it's a set of size kappa that has small intersection with omega one, and we're avoiding all the, all right, so. Hold this. All right. So this is equal to nothing up my sleeve. The f of x, sorry, z intersect omega one. That's that's an ordinal less than kappa element of the increasing enumeration. The increasing enumeration, yes, okay. So, first, this makes sense, right? Because we know z has size kappa, so this is going to land somewhere in z. So, this is a regressive function, f of z, f tilde of z is an element of z, right? I wanted to show. I wanted to show, though, that this has the property we advertised, that it respects the ordering module of the ideals we're working with. So let's see how that works. This one should be a follow-your-nose. So let's assume F is less than modulo J G, but the conclusion fails. The conclusion fails. So, but let's call this maybe script y equal to z and x tilde. Let's mix font like crazy such that g tilde of z intersect omega one is less than or equal to f tilde of z intersect. Sorry, z, you're right. So Z. You're right. For that to fail, this would have to be stationary, right? Okay, but now we're going to just do a Ruden-Kiesler projection argument. We're going to project this stationary set down. So we have pi mapping y to omega one by pi of z is equal to z. z is equal to z intersect omega one the point is i of y pointwise image is j positive right because right um if I take a delta in here well what do we know Well, what do we know? Well, you're in the projection of y, there's going to be some z upstairs, but so fixes delta is equal to z intersect omega one for some z and y. And let's trace through what this means, okay? Right, so g tilde of z is the g of delta. The G of delta element of the enumeration of Z is less than or equal to the F of deltas L of the increasing enumeration of Z. But of course, the only way that could happen is if G of delta is less than or equal to F of delta, but that's happening on a J positive set. J positive set, so that had to be wrong. Okay, the point is, we have a way of lifting things, we reverse in the projection. Thanks. We'll keep that in mind because we're going to apply this to a very specific function a little bit later on, a few minutes. I think we can go without the lights now. So I'm going to sketch the proof that if there's a Ramsey cardinal, then every normal ideal on omega-1 is weakly precipitous. Ideal on omega-1 is weakly precipitous. In hindsight, this is a version of wooden stuff using stationary tower forcing. Any normal filter on omega-1 can be generically extended to something with a well-founded VL for power. This is a weak version of that, holding on to any Ramsey cardinals. It's really, you're getting a kind of generically extending our normal ideal on omega one. Normal ideal on omega-1 to something where the revow ultra power is well founded out to kappa and not fully. But of course, kappa is big enough for our purposes. We're only dealing with reels, right? Okay. So let's assume the empty player has a winning strategy in our game. And what I'm going to do now is totally old school, like 70s. Given an alpha less than omega one, we look at the tree of finite sequences of partial plays of our game where alpha is still alive at the last moment. Okay, that forms a tree, and that tree has got to be well-founded because this is a winning strategy. We know that alpha is not going to be in the intersection of anything produced along the way. So, okay. For any alpha, we have a kind of a well-founded tree associated with playing the game. Associated with playing the game, well, well-foundedness, we immediately get ranking functions in the usual way, right? The point is, if we get a longer sequence, our rank has dropped. Okay, and we're going to, I guess this is the key point here. The rank of any node of our tree is less than bet2 omega one plus, because think about the possible plays in our game. How much data are we using? Our game. How much data are we using as we're playing the game? We're using subsets of omega 1 and normal ideals on omega 1. There's at most two to the two to the omega one objects that we're playing with. And so our tree has to have ring bounded by the successor of that. Okay? And we need that, okay, that's less than kappa because we're going to want to apply this idea to the ranks. With me? With me? Alrighty. What we're going to do is non-empty is going to cheat. Non-empty is on the side, as we're playing our game, going to be building a decreasing sequence of stationary subsets of this big stationary set we built. Okay? I look at it as the elements of this stationary set or our countable elements. Stationary set are our old countable elementary submodels with a huge attic attached to it. And we use the attic to kind of keep things organized. What Non-Nifty is going to do, he's going to promise that his plays look like the projection of the non-stationary ideal restricted to these stationaries that he presents us. Let's go back. Point is, if we do that, If we do that, the ideal Jn plus one is probably not going to be generated over player one's move by a single set because we're projecting, even though it's generated by a single set upstairs, the projection is going to be much more complicated. And this is where we're taking advantage of the change in rules for weekly precipitous. We're allowed to play with the shadows of stationary sets and stationary ideals. So, suppose we have arrived at a point, and Empty has been using her week winning strategy. Strategy. Everything that's in her last move is still alive, and therefore T alpha will have a corresponding, it will have a, this play of our game will have a rank in the game played using in the tree T alpha. Okay, so that's going to induce a function, rho n plus one, from a n plus one to whatever the rank is, okay, which is less than kappa. Okay, which is less than kappa. Okay. Now, how are we going to move? Is that what I want? Back up for a second. If we play according to this, the point is we're going to. We're going to be producing the rank sequence, which is going to be less than Jn. So if you look at the earlier I's, we got a rank function with respect to a smaller ideal. But we're, of course, making sure at each point to respect player one's moves so that the ideal we're building is going to respect that these ranks are decreasing almost everywhere. If given an alpha and a n plus one, we look at the play that led to it, and that's a decreasing sequence. That led to it, and that's a decreasing sequence of ranks. Okay? What we want to do is lift this situation using the Magador argument and see what happens. So, yn plus one, we know that a n plus one is positive with respect to the projection of the stationary ideal, so we can pull it back. So we can pull it back and end up with a stationary subset of Zn plus Zn. That's what I'm calling Yn plus one here. Okay. We know that given anything, that's not working. Given anything, here we go. Given anything here, it projects good grief. Good grief. It projects to something in a n plus one by our choice, right? We're pulling back, it's an inverse. So it projects to the right spot. The rank is the tilde function actually lands inside of g because the rank is less than the cardinality. So we're fine. We can do the lifting. Now, the top ideal is normal, and therefore you're Normal, and therefore, here's the magic: we've lifted to a regressive function, we can stabilize its value. All right, so there's that's how we're going to proceed. We stabilize the rank function upstairs on Zn plus one, and then project downstairs. And that's what gives us non-empties next move. So, okay, given the situation, pull it upstairs, do your computations, project downstairs. That's what we do. And now it's just a matter of saying, And now it's just a matter of saying, why do we get a contradiction? Of course, we're going to end up with a countable decreasing sequence of ordinals. Let's see. Walk through. I look at the sequence of n's. If I've got a finite n and I take an alpha and alpha n, we know the ranks are strictly decreasing because they're ranks. And we know that this sequence is strictly less than j in decreasing. We've already argued. Than J in decreasing, we've already argued that that has to happen because it happens on a n, right? That's the first statement. So, our lifting, all right, this is what we proved on the board. That's going to be decreasing modulo the non-stationary ideal, right? But we know that these functions are constant on Zn. And so the only way that can happen is that their constant values are decreasing, right? So, boom, there's your contradiction. Boom, there's your contradiction. So that tells us that empty cannot have a winning strategy in this weekly precipitous game in the presence of a Ramsey ideal. The idea is, well, we've got enough space. We can add attics to all of our houses and use that to organize things. So if I look at the big picture of what I've done, right, given an uncountable set of reels and a coloring with finite colors, there's a normal ideal of satisfying the conclusion of the saturation lemma. Of the saturation lemma. If there's a Ramsey Cardinal, that he deals weakly precipitous. Those two conditions together imply the conclusion of the saturation lemma that I needed. And that's exactly what you need to implement the Ragavan-Torochevich construction. So that's the proof of the theorem. Now, things not appearing in this talk until now. The actual Ragovan-Porochevich construction of the homogeneous. Porochevich's construction of the homogeneous set. It's very lovely. Certainly, take a look at it, right? The proof that every normal ideal on omega-1 is weakly precipitous doesn't really need that that's an honest to goodness Ramsey cardinal. We just need an inner model with a Ramsey cardinal that has the same set of normal filters on omega one. And you can get that kind of thing from failures of the singular cardinal hypothesis, for example. It's a very weak assumption. You can modify our argument to a Um, you can modify our argument to obtain the full version of the um well, sorry, I noticed that there's nothing special about the fact that we play with omega one. If you're working with Ramsey cardinals, then any normal ideal in the generalized sense that lives inside V kappa, you can do the same argument to show it's weakly precipitous. And that's what's going to allow you to attain the full Ragovan-Tordotrovich theorem, including, and basically what you do is everywhere. And basically, what you do is everywhere they said wooden cardinal. Well, you can use Ramsey Cardinal instead. I look at, I look at taking the Ramsey Cardinal and doing the stationary tower forcing out through a Ramsey Cardinal. So if you do stationary tower forcing, whatever that is, out through a wooden cardinal, you tend to get nice generic elementary embeddings with well-founded target models. If you do this poor man's version, you still get nice generic embeddings. The target model is no longer well-founded. Model is no longer well-founded, but you can prove that it shares an awful lot of structure with the ground model. And it's very close to being well-founded in a sense. It has representatives of all sufficiently large cardinals that are good enough to prove things about. And that's, I guess, the next talk I give in a set theory setting will be about that. That's it. Thank you for listening. Is it known that you really need to learn? Is there any hope showing that? There's hope, yeah. I mean, there's a plausible ZFC scenario that involves, I guess, how does this work? Using complete accumulation points. So you're given something that's positive, and you can find a complete. And you can find a complete accumulation point of that, complete in the sense of every neighborhood of you contains a J positive set. And the problem is I can't literally split a J positive set into an IJ saturated pair. I have to throw some of it away. If you don't have to throw anything away, then well, you're going to be a complete accumulation point of one of the other two pieces, and you can make the argument work. So they're plausible scenarios. They're also plausible ways. There are also plausible ways where maybe you do. Maybe that is way too much to hope for, but I don't have anything intelligent to say about that. I will say that that whole nest of problems resulting, looking at the was Sierpinski right paper of Shela, I do think it's entirely plausible that you can use the Ragavan Torochevich construction as an engine for devising a notion of. As an engine for devising a notion of forcing to add an uncountable to homogeneous set in a very mild way, and in that way, maybe prove the consistency of the Saharan's result using a Ramsey Cardinal, but obtaining it with a small continuum, two to all of two. I don't know. That's what I'm thinking about now. Okay, well, what a good thing about it. Hey, well, wonderful. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That ends the button. Are we mindful about my check? Oh, lunch. Yeah, it's lunch time. So it's lunch and then. Launch and they will
