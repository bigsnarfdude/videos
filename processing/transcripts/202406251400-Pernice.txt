Yeah, very one is enough, but everyone knows the top. Thanks, organizer, for inviting me and for organizing this beautiful conference here in this beautiful place. Before I start, I guess full disclaimer. Although I really want to be in the Although I really want to be in the Brouwer and directory theory group, I am not one. So I'm really a stacky guy. And when I thought about this a long time, well, no, three years ago, it's not a long time, but it was still a PhD. And I would probably say something wrong. Please correct me because, again, I'm not really in the field. I learned these things through trying to solve this problem instead of going through literature and everything. You are we are all well if it's all in our we are in the browser days, yeah. At least in the brow prime, I hope. So, um, yeah, the joint the thing I want to talk is a joint work with Gujarat Monocera, and this will not be. I will talk about the results that we have, but That we have, but the first half of now will probably be just a resume of what is known in literature and a bit of a review of the classical browser problem. And then I will talk about briefly about the derived browser problem, or at least how to extend to the derived. I will not talk about derived scheme. I'll just talk about like somehow the derived will only be in the algebra, not in the geometry. And I will explain this. And finally, our project, I will say how it goes into the literature. So I don't know if this is called exactly like this. If this is called exactly like this, again, because I'm not an expert in the literature, but as far as I know, this is called the Brouwer-Grotenik problem, or most famously, Brouwer equal Brouwer prime. And it is incredible that I am the one that is going to introduce, well, at least to talk about this as first. So, well, for fields, this is, I mean, it is interesting, but it is some holiday. It is interesting, but it is from the definition itself. That when you start with a field, you have this Brower group, and it is defined using the central simple algebras over the field. And there is this beautiful notion of Moit equivalence, which I briefly say that everyone probably knows there are two ways of defining this Moita equivalence. One is that two things are equivalent, say that. Say that somehow, if there exists, this is, I mean, one of the possible definitions that one can give, two things are equivalent if there exists two algebras of matrices such that when you tensor, these become isomorphic. And the other one, which is the one that we really will use in this talk when we pass to the derived setting, is that the category of Is that the category of left modules over A is actually isomorphic abstractly as categories to the categories of the L modules over B. And when you quotient by this equivalent, then you get the Brauer group. This is the usual thing. And very classically, this is actually classified by the Galois echoology of the field with coefficient in the invertible field. This is probably the first time I write this. I will use H2HGM from this moment on, but. From this moment on, but I will enter computer Galois. But very, so very easy, general well, easy, I guess. It took some time, but first Azumaya for rings and then Grotendik for schemes, say that we stay in the quasi-compact, quasi-separated world. I will never leave this side, this picture. They generalize this idea for scheme or for rings and then for schemes. For rings and then for schemes. So you can define the Brower of a scheme. And here, well, instead of the central simple algebra of a field, you call them Mazumaya algebras. And what are they? Well, they are OX, how we say OX algebras, which are locally free of finite rank. Such that, well, a way of defining central simple algebra is actually asking that the natural map from A to its dual mutensory with A, there is a very natural map to the endomorphism of A, not endomorphism of algebra, but of sheaves, sorry, of O modules, in that case of vector bundles, of a vector space. This is actually an isomorphism. So this is, if you want, you can take a definition of what is an isomorphism. Nasomayon. And here there is a map. And this map goes into. Excuse me. Yep. I think you have to also require that the fibers are all non-zero for a right. I mean, this is wrong, and Grodendi got this wrong, actually, in his original definition. Because otherwise, I mean, otherwise, because that satisfies this, yeah. That satisfies this, yeah. I mean, you don't want, yeah, you don't want to have the zero, the zero ring inside, even over a field, you don't want to. Oh, right, right, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. You're saying zero over an arbitrary x, you need all the fibers to be non-zero. Yeah, yeah, okay. Thank you. I would say, yeah, this epsilon, this kind of epsilon condition that you're talking about is actually what will come back in more. It's actually what we'll come back in later in the talk, but yes, thanks for pointing out. Um, so and we have a map here into the H2 et al of XGM. And now, well, the thing that everyone here probably knows is that as a warning, well, EDA is injective, but in general, not subjective. This is in general. In general, not surjective. And in fact, one can prove that it lands inside the torsion part. Well, say torsion of this group. And this is what is usually called the Brauer prime, the homological Brauer group of X. And well, now you can ask, well, is this math surjective? And this is, well, Brauer equals. And this is, well, Brouwer equal Brubber prime. As you can see, this is the problem that I wanted to talk about. And somehow, okay, there is the very, very famous result by Gaber. And it was also later proof of the Young, which says that if X is quasi-projective, then, well, Brouwer equals Brouwer prime for X. Brubber prime for x. The idea is that you have this line bundle, which is ample in some more generic sense. You can, let's say in the finite type case, it's really just a line bundle, an ample line bundle, and you just produce, you manage to produce this twisted sheet that probably Max will talk about in the future lectures. And so you have these classic projected things, but you. Things, but you start wondering where is the point where it stops being true. And there is a, I mean, again, I'm not an expert in the field. The contract example, I know, I read it from the paper of editing, asset, fresh, and vistoli, but there are probably many other examples that I'm not aware of that they construct a singular non-separated scheme. Scheme is in fact a finite type of a field such that these two are different. Oh, okay. Thanks. Okay, so that's okay. It's good that I know this one then. But so now the point is: where do we draw the line? At least, where is that we should expect this to be true? Expect this to be true. And I will not state any conjecture. And I talked one with Angelo, and he essentially told me that the feeling, which is not shared by everyone, is that it should all foresee the scheme. But this is just a feeling. Again, this is not even a conjecture. I will not claim that this is a conjecture in any possible way. But this is somehow what he told me to be, maybe it was his feeling, I don't know, but that it was somehow the feeling that perseported his scheme for some reason. For some reason, should be true. And so, what I'm going to do is that somehow pass to the trying to get this problem into a more stacky version. Well, it's not stacky, but somehow, as Max explained, if you know the stacky description of this one, or at least the objects that are here, you can get a grasp of the geometry that is behind the problem. It's not just an algebra problem. Dealing with cosycle is kind of a pain, as everyone knows. So, having some kind of Everyone knows. So, having some kind of element that you can associate which is more geometric sometimes can help. So, this is where gerbs come into play. So, maybe a remark: Max already said this, but if X, well, we said it for the groups, but for fields, but this is true for also for plastic compact positive schemes, then the H2 et al of X B G, well, of X G M, this is actually classifies GM gerbs. Gm gerbs over x. And again, you can think of gerbs as just a stack such that it all locally is of the form x times bgm. It's not completely true, but let's avoid strange things to happen. So there is a very nice way. I mean, now you know that this map should tend, you should send one of these guys to a GM gerbs. But what is the gerbs? I think the max internet. The girbs. I think that Max hinted at this. Again, this is probably not the first reference where you can find this. The first time I saw it, I was a student, I saw it in Olsen book. It's a gerb of trivializations. When you have essentially the map that you have from here to here. Yeah, I know, I I I definitely imagine. It's just that it was a very reading book at this time. A book and the zero, then let's say. But so what is the map? Well, giving an altemy algebra, you can associate this gerb, which is called the trivialization gerb, the gerb of trivializations, which is defined. Let's say I will give you the definition as a functor of groupoids. So, what is the group that we're going to associate here? Well, you have a vector bundle, and then you have an isomorphism where the vector bundle is just a vector bundle over S, and an isomorphism is just an isomorphism between the endomorphism of the vector bundle with the Azomay algebras pulled it back to S. Now, we know that Azumay algebra trivialized up to netal cover, and this somehow says that this. Cover and this somehow says that this kind of object up to an entire cover of x becomes just BGM. It's very easy to prove that up to an entire cover this becomes just BGM. So this says that this GA is actually as a gm gerb and is actually the image to this map. But there is something more. It's not just a gm gerb, it's also a quotient stack, which seems something completely unrelated, but we will see in a moment why it's not. Just to... Just to be more specific, I guess to be a bit more to be sorry, to be more complete, you can also do the same for, well, essentially mu R gerb. So if you start with an Azumay algebra of rank R, which is usually, well, R squared, which is usually an element written as an element of this guy, you can associate a gerb, which is an R gerb now, mu R gerb, and the object. And the objects here are kind of the same, but you add an isomorphism. And this isomorphism is essentially, well, it is actually a trivialization of the determinant of the vector bomb. So that somehow you, with this determination, you remove the gm. But of course, when you do the determinant, some of the, because this is rank R, sorry, here I should have R, this is rank R vector bundles, mu R inside the diagonal matrix, of course, will vanish. The diagonal matrix, of course, will vanish. So the mu r will still be as automorphisms here. And in fact, you can prove that this is a mu r gerbs. In fact, a mu r gerbs is also quotient. So I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah. Now I want to talk very briefly about something that we actually talked with said about this in the last couple of days, essentially, which I wanted to point out. Couple of days, essentially, which I wanted to point out an application with Cedan Andrea about this. I just want to point out an application of why somehow one could be interesting to this. I mean, it's definitely an interesting problem on its own, but there are some strange applications. And somehow this quotient stack behavior, which is strictly related to the twisted sheaves, is where this application comes to fruition somehow. I'll try to be brief. So, I'm not going to state real results because there's nothing written about, well, exactly, it's not written, but it's not real results, it's just an intuition. So, you start with a question of ALPER, which is the existence of a Deline-Momford separated stack, which is not a Potion stack. Of questions there. So every, I don't know, mathematician that studies stacks would probably say this is, this has to exist. It's not possible that every Lee-Manford separated stack is a quotient stack. This is one. Yeah, always quasi-compact quite separated. Yeah, this is always the basic notions. The basic, yeah. The answer is. The answer is probably no, but when you ask me this question, I thought about it, I tried to say, okay, where I want to search in examples. The first thing to try, okay, let's try at least in the case where x is smooth and try to see what is the point, at least where x is smooth. And now I'm going to write these things, which is not a statement, again, but it's more like an idea. I will write two statements. Yeah, sorry, maybe I should say that everything is overfield, yes. I should say that everything is overfield. Yes, that's a good point. So, yeah. And probably, if you want to say only dm, you should say the characteristic is zero. Just to be safe. Otherwise, you could tame. But yeah, even characteristic zero is still an interesting question to find this contract on. Because when you say quotient stack, you mean quotient, like a global quotient stack. Yeah. X mod G L N. Algebraic scales for algebraic. Algebraic space modula. This is the point. Yeah. So saying that it's over a field of character zero, that's just the same as saying that it's a Q scheme. Yeah? Is it sorry? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it would be over K. Yeah, that's what I say. It's important to say this is over. Say it's important to say this is over k, so it's moved over k, right? This is zero. Oh, smooth over okay, over k. Yeah, sorry, I wasn't too precise. So one statement is that every smooth separated the Liman first stack is actually a quotient stack, and the other is Brauer equal Brauer prime for smooth separated DM stack. There. So, these two things seem really unrelated, but I mean, again, it's not a proof, but somehow the feeling is that if this is true, this should be true as well, and vice versa. And this is nothing profound. This is somehow literature already existing, mainly this paper by again editing asset crash vista, plus just a real small epsilon, really small. Just a real small epsilon, really small, like if it is. And yeah, I guess that there is a seven-page paper after that, yeah, which is the only cross-fish to leave. And very, very briefly, otherwise I will not make it. The idea is that, again, don't take it as a proof because I'm not going to state, like, I haven't written like a formal proof. This is just an idea that was discussed. Just an idea that was discussed like two, three days ago. Um, so you start with your course moduli spaces, your anchor received zero. So you have your coarse moduli space here, and what you can do is that you can rigidify rigidify by the center of the generic stabilizers. And here, this is again, of course, modular space. So, this is an abelian gerb. Modular space. So this is an abelian germ. And well, what happens is that from the paper that I just cited, the paper gives you that x prime is actually a quotient stack. Yeah, x prime is actually a quotient stack. The idea is very natural somehow you have a smooth stack. A smooth stack and smooth stacks comes from a very natural vector bundle, which is the tangent bundle, which is something that does other smooth stacks, well, other non-smooth stacks do not have necessarily, right? So you use that vector bundle and you say, well, it's not necessarily true that the tangent bundle is a faithful representation on the stabilizers of the guy, but you can prove that essentially up to taking jets big enough, you get a bundle which is really the faithful representation. And then you can do this, you can never represent one map to BGLM. Can have a representable map to BGLN and go for that. It's really nice, and somehow I have the feeling that this kind of reasoning should tell you that there should exist something which is not a quotient stacks, and it should be outside the smooth case. Or at least this is where I will look at. It's very difficult to, I mean, somehow when you take the smooth stack between the pool of smooth stacks, how many vector bond will we have? I mean, you definitely know there are two, but you expect to be more like combining this, like just. Expect to be more like combining this, like jet bands and so on. But what if I take randomly a singular stack? How many vector bands do you expect it to have? And I don't know. That's the feeling I said that somehow there should be only one, which is O, but of course, that's not always the case. It's very difficult to construct examples. Right, so somehow this is a question stack now. Everything reduces to slides gerb. And somehow, I will not say the detail about this, but this. This, but this statement, the browser point statement, should imply that, well, I will write a lemma, which is, okay, this is really, this is proof, so this is not an idea or anything, this is really a lemma, which says that if you have an element inside the Brouwer prime of an Ethereum scheme, is a scheme, then this one is actually in the Brouwer. If and only if the following are equivalent, yes, if and only if the gerb associated to this guy is a quotient stack. And again, this is everything has somehow to do the fact that exists of this vector bundle that probably Max will talk us about more about the existence of these vector bundles that at the end give you the somehow related to the twisted vector bundles that we already seen. And of course, this. And of course, this doesn't tell you the equivalence because this is only for schemes. But the point is that maybe there is a way to generalize this for quotient stacks, because the only thing we need to say that, well, if BrowPy now is true, Privy Smooth, separated, say, even Cauchy stacks here, then automatically get that this one is also a Cauchy stack. But again, it's not a proof. It's nothing. It's just an idea. Well, somehow these two things are related. These two things that seem very far from This two things that seem very far from being equal. Well, different things are related. And I guess it has to do with the fact that these results, as if you somehow being a portion stack is encoded in the generic gerb. Sorry? X is not, sorry? In the paper, they assume it. I guess you can do a limit argument. In the paper, they assume this. Limit argument in the paper they assume this, uh, but I guess, well, yeah, no, no, I guess here you can do just an approximation argument, like from yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, I guess that's true. I didn't thought about it, but okay, now I need to start with the right part. So, somehow this was just to explain how somehow problems can relate to other problems. Problems can relate to other problems. I mean, this is not something that, I mean, we're very used to this in math, right? We start just changing the names of properties and trying to get new things, changing names. So let's go more into the derived part. Derived and so minus. Again, this is not really derived in the sense that this is just, this will always be your. Just, this will always be over quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme, not derived schemes or anything. But the object we're going to consider, they will be derived. So, first definition is a derivative Zumaiyajar. So, I thought about the notation, and I really want to distinguish two things. But in Lurie's book and also in Anthea Gabner, well, in Lurie's book, mainly because. Well, in Lewis' books mainly, because in Teil Gabner, they only deal with stable case. I want to distinguish pre-stable and stable case. So I will use a slightly different notation and really hope that people were not aiding me for this. But so let's say we are on a quasi-compact quasi-berry scheme. So what we do is that we take an element of the category of quasi-coherent. Here, I will start writing quasi-coherent sheaves like this, but this is always mean to be the infinity category, or if you don't like the derived category of quasi-group sheaves. Category of quasi-grade shifts over X, and we say that this one is derived Azumaya algebra if let me see. So again, this is not the this is not the way it is defined in Luri or in Toen, but this is because I Or in to end, but this is because I wanted to distinguish two things. So if this is connective, and so this is a perfect complex, it's a perfect connective complex, and the mapping we have in the classical case that we can take now derived. This is the opposite algebra. This is again here, I will take derived. This is an isomorphism. So you can just take the. This is an isomorphism, so you can just take the same definition for the classical case and generalize it with putting the right derivative. That's the usual thing. So, how I'm just wondering, how do you, how do you do you need again a non-degeneracy condition? Or what is that? How's that look in this context? Yeah, it's essentially that it's the same degenerate condition, but you have it on the pi. So you take the pi zero and you say that the pi zero for every stock, well, for every residue field, is non-zero. But it's the same, it's the same. But it's the same, it's the same exact condition, is essentially. Okay, okay. Yeah, that is true. There is this epsilon. And it is. I'm not quite sure that it is in the Luris book. I would need to check, but I remember at some point there are some remote. There are some remarks. Yeah, everybody gets this wrong. Yeah, that's fair. So the other definition is something that is usually what is called derived my algebra, but I will call it extended because in Lurie's paper. Call it extended because in Lurie's paper, the group that classified this is called extended. So, an extended algebras is the same, but only without the connective part. So, you just have the thing above. So, I thought about it if I should call the first one non-connective, and this one should be the normal one. But I always feel weird that to put something which is more conditioned, I should. More condition, I should. How do I say this? Right. Yeah, I don't know if I should call it non-connective or not this one, but I use extended because this is what Lurie uses in this book. The engineering condition now, if I remember correctly, is that the pi zero of A, so somehow really, if you go to the That's a good question. I don't remember if you can say that it's enough to take the pi zero because now you have also the other sides. Yeah, I should look into it. I don't exactly remember. Yeah, that's a good question. Right. Anyway, so here, this is what we will call Brouwer X. And with this greater equal than zero, to remember, these are only the connective one. Remember, these are only the connective one, and this would be the Brouwer or the extended asomi algebra. So, these are very somehow the derived definition. But now, there is another thing that the Louis and it comes from To N, in fact. They do. Yeah, that's right. I need to portion, of course, by the Morita equivalence, but okay, but once you do that, then yeah, yeah, there are. Yeah. Yeah, there are three, and the Morita equivalence, again, you can phrase it exactly is the same way as you do for the classical one. So you either ask that there is a perfect complex as when you tensor with the endomorphism, they get the same, or the best definition will still be that the category of left modules are the same, are the isomorphic. So the definition here is actually the reason why you start considering. Here? Oh, yeah, yeah, of course, yes, yes, yes. This doesn't have to be a perfect competition. Right. Yes. Yes, in the first one, yes. And I will show you in a moment why, but yes, that's the definition. In fact, this definition is essentially useless. And I will show you in a moment why. But so the categorical notion. So the categorical notion is a bit different. So I would I guess I would I should put a D you're saying okay let's put a D just to avoid just to avoid yeah that is a good point. So for the sake people hating me I'm not sure if everyone knows what this guy is. This should be the category of, let's see, presentable, if I remember by so presentable, stable, compactly generated, presentable, stable, or well, pre-stable. There is a P here, this means for pre-stable. P here, this means for pre-stable, compactly generated infinity categories, which are OX linear. And this L and omega stands for the functor between these categories, preserve compact objects, and have left a joint. And that's it. I think that that's what I want. So it's this very B category where you have all the infinity categories of, which are all x linear. And here there is a very famous symmetric monologue. Very famous symmetric monodial structure given by the Luri tensor product or of this one or the connected one. I'm not saying anything new. This is all in Luri's paper. So but what I want to say is that the brower now I want to say what is a categorical azumay algebras. So if I start with m, an element, for example, of the one with the p. This is a categorical azumaya if m is invertible, is an invertible object for this structure. So if there exists a dual, and when you tensor with the dual, you get a unit. The unit in the pre-stable case is just this one, or the pre-stable case is this one without this. In the stable case, it's this one. No, no, X is a quasi-compact positive. So there is, yeah, you, you, yeah, exactly. So you need to start if you want. Yeah, yeah, there is a mobile computer. Yeah. I will show you that this is actually also equal to the one, the sheafs one, you using the one of finance of gate query, but yeah, that's for now. But yeah, that's uh for now, let's stick with this notation. So these are the categorical one, and to distinguish for this one, let's put a C here. And I mean, here I don't have to put like equivalence because there is all there's already the isomorphism equivalence, isomorphism of categories. And here, I would say that this is an extended atzumaria. It's the same. M is an invertible object now in this one with a p. And here I have. And here I have. Again, I'm not sure this is the right notation to use, but I really need to distinguish these two objects, otherwise. Sorry, this is, I messed up. This is the opposite. Like the standard and the one above, like exactly here, right? The standard are the ones which are the stable case. So when there's stable here, I guess I should have, yeah, should have said like this. Like this. And the so the extended will go here, we'll call it this. This will be the group classifying, well, the infinity category, the infinity group classifying them. In the pre-stable case, this is what we call the infinity group by classifying those. These are invertible objects of, of course, invertible means inside this category here, not this one. I know it feels like. I know it feels like a bunch of nonsense. And I think that it's actually a lot of, I think that, I don't know, I will show you in a moment, but somehow what we are trying to do is reprising the problem in another way. Again, it's just. So you would think you can do it with this one, right? Because, okay, here that's very difficult because you're having both sides. You could think that you can do it with this one. Sides. You could think that you can do it with this one, and this is actually what happens because all these ones are actually classical. So, somehow, in the connective case, you can always say that one of these is actually Morit equivalent to a classical one. So, somehow, this definition is not really making sense. And I'm sure you, and I'll show you why, this is work of Louis, but this will all that stuff on that board. Oh, this one. Oh, this one. Okay, okay. Okay. No, no, no, that's good. That's good. That's good. It's not been published? Oh, no. Oh, okay. My bad. Sorry about that. Fair enough, yes. Right, so okay, I can very briefly go through examples, which I guess are not really examples, but it's good to have it in mind. So satisfied? Yes, I think so. Yeah, the FPQC, the SEN and X. Yes, this should. I mean, the point is that these. I mean, the point is that this guy does FPQC, I'm not sure. Definitely FPPF. Yeah, and I think you can deduce that because of the invertible elements, you can deduce. Yeah, I think this is in Lewis's now, yeah. Yep. Yeah, this is what I'm going to write down. Oh, wait, I was writing the examples. So if you have an Alzheimer's algebra, classical one, so let's say classical Alzheimer's algebra, the one that you always think of, well, now you can associate two categories, which is the natural infinity category generalization of the left module. And this one is. And this one is stable and is, in fact, an invertimal element inside this category here. So, this would be an extended Azumay algebras, and this would be a categorical extended Azumay algebras, and this would be just a category Azumay algebras. Just to give you examples of what is that we're doing. Like, we're essentially saying we are identifying everything with the modules of sorry. Modules of sorry, we left modules. Yes. So now I will draw, try to draw a picture. So let's see, we have classical sites here. And here you have these Azumayas, mod Morita, and here you have the GM gerbs. So here you have the derived The derived version, which is well derived Zumaya. Sorry, sorry, this is pre-stable first, pre-stable case, or if you want, non-extended, but again, very bad to say like this. And here we have the derivative mod Morit as well. Here you have GMGERP. And here you have something else, which is this class. This classical, sorry, the categorical Alzheimer's algebra. And finally, I will draw some lines, of course. They will not just say here. In a stable situation, here you have this derived Alzheimer's algebra. Sorry, here I said I will put some of these signs, probably up or down, depending on where I have the space to do that. So, here, something to. So here something changes. I have GMGerbs and Z torsors as well. And here, down here, I have the category also my other. So let's try to write some line. So what Lurie proved is that these two actually up to my equivalence are the same thing. And essentially, that's why here, in this part of the diagram, nothing is really changing. So this is the, I should use blue. is the blue this is the brow map essentially just written down in a different way but okay yeah okay so for now on when I say Luria we mean map okay okay um then we have a map here which is just seeing uh pre-stable well uh connective vector but connective Connective Alzheimer's algebra and seeing as a normal Alzheimer's algebra, like with a complex, just seeing connecting to a non-connective case. And here, you all, the map is just the map where you go from, well, you're just GM0 to GM0, and the torsor is just trivial. Here, I should say that you also have a map from here. And what you can prove is that these two are actually the same. We'll try to avoid saying who proved this. Avoid saying who proved this and okay. Ah, right, okay. Okay. And what happens is that, so here, this map is now, yes, you see, this isomorphism. So because this one is not clearly subjective, this is not clearly subjective. So this cannot be clearly subjective. But what happens is that at this level, in the stable case, every one of those becomes isomorphism. Of those becomes isomorphism, so it's really all the same picture that you have to keep in mind. And okay, here I have a map, and this map, let's try to give some names to all the maps that I put. So this was the map that we call the Broward map, which is the same. So here, these two maps are essentially the L module thing. So you start with an Azumaya, either connective or not, and you associate the L module over that, the left module over the Azumaya, but you can do the same. Left module or the other Zoom address, you can do the same here and here. This is essentially the content of our project. Of course, this was already proved. But in the paper, whoever proved this, there was no, at least in Lurie, there is no mention of gerbs anyway. So there is no explicit description of how to go from here to here and vice versa. But the important part is that. The important part is that we also don't only prove who are these guys, but we also say that they preserve the symmetric monoidal structure between these two. It's just which makes it really easy to prove that it's actually the same. And this would be the content of the future, which we already have an idea of giving a Z torso who is going to be here. And yeah, but it's like on hold like three years now. And I focus on other things. And at some point, I really need to go back. But I'm saying this conference, it really. To go back. But I'm saying this conference, it really wanted me to go back. So I guess this is good. Just wrote it down, right? Yeah. So this math I circle the first one, yeah. So what about the original question? Yeah. The one I know, which is in Lurie's book, he says that the if you look at this guy, and if you take the cohomology on X on the scheme. On X, on a scheme, this is H2XGM. But it doesn't really explain why there are GM gerbs, or even if there is a structure here of an infinite categorical thing that says that these two are the same. So what we need was just, it was advertised by Parta, this project, where he said, because Guglielmo was a student of Mauro, and he said, well, you guys should do it. You guys should really investigate what is this map because getting a picture of this, kind of like what can associate to a gerb and so on, can help. And so on can help. I mean, the real problem is still here. That is somehow the real problem because somehow this here, this map is easy, but going back is choosing a compact generator of this. If you have a categorical algebra, so a stable infinity category, you can always find, well, invertible. And in this condition, you can always find a compact generator. And this is what you will use to construct the derived algebra, taking the endomorphism of that generator. But choosing a generator is not a canonical thing to do. There is not a canonical thing to do. But here you really do canonical choices. So that's somehow the easy part. The real hard part would be really choosing some canonical things here. Oh, yeah, you would solve. And it will not be natural in general. But what my hope is, and I really love to see, if you start with one of these pre-stable categories, one of these, you do the stabilization. And I have to say, if x is smooth, in fact, if x is smooth, This if x is smooth, these z tors should actually disappear. So, these vertical maps become isomorphism in normal, even. Yes, exactly. So, um, you see it as a, so you stabilize, you see it as a stable category. Now, you know that it's a compact generator, and now you want to prove that at least maybe in the separate case, I don't know, maybe quasi-projective even would be another proof. If you can prove that it's a connective generator, then you're essentially done. And the point is that Lurie proves that. The point is that Luri proves that if you have an element which is connective and generates the stabilization, then it was also a compact generator of the connective part. But you really, yeah. You really want to find a compact generator, which is, and it's very weird because this is also connected to the fact that if you start with an element here and you know that, for example, in a smooth case, this will have torsion. So if you tensor with itself enough time, you get something which is equivalent. itself enough time you get something which is equivalent to actually morita equivalent to actually something connective so and because it's trivial and these two are equal you actually can can prove that it's isomorphic to something which is connective which is like the endomorphism of perfect comp well which is an endomorphism of um sorry i have to start here so maybe i'll write it down another remark it said if i start so So, this is all for reformulating the same problem, which is the browser problem. Another problem is that okay, you can try to find generators, compact generators, for the thing, or another thing is that you start with it in the more categorical sense, or you start with the more derived sense, you start with one of these derived Azumayas. In the smooth case, for example, these two would be the same. So you said, okay, this one, you know that this one is actually, in the smooth case, this is actually James Gerb, so it would be in Brubber prime. Gerb, so it would be in Brauer prime. So you start in the smooth case, this would be in Brauer prime. So this is Morita equivalent to say O, which is a connective thing, is really connective. And well, you would like to say, but again, it's just another reformulation same problem, that this one was actually connected from the start. And you actually know that if it was connective, this actually implies that this was, well, a classic ozone, because of what was written there. Of what was written there. So, somehow, these are, I'm not claiming that this will solve everything, but it's just another formulation and formulation. And the key is to find the formulation for which separated work. And of course, I don't know. So, in the last 10, 12 minutes, I will try to explain what we did, which is this map. Well, explain, yeah, what are the two maps and show somehow some insights about these two maps. Some insights about this too much. I would really love to. The first time I saw this, I was really puzzled by the fact that here you have like the two dual groups, like GM and Z. And I really don't know. I mean, it's really strange. Somehow, what we are trying to understand. What we are trying to understand, where we were trying to understand, but we need to get back to it again. We think that somehow this Z torsor here would give you some kind of twisted triangulator structure, triangulator structure on your category. And so I'm not sure, like if you go with GM, you say GM squares, that square, for example, right? Yeah. Exactly. This is a shift, but somehow they're a shift where you need. They shift, but somehow they're shift when you pull back to the tile, like the cover, you have the shift, which are very well defined. But then, in your category, when you go back to the when you glue them up, you have something that's not really a shift, right? It's like mixed thing and it's and somehow this part, I mean, in the normal case, you don't have those, you don't care, but uh it's also really interesting. And we have an idea how to construct this category from this z-tour, from giving a z-torso to this one, which is essentially a category that we expect to have some kind of twisted. To have some kind of twisted t-structure, but not really because you cannot really go from here to here with such a category. It's been 20 years, but there's just something I just asking. Take any GM term on a reasonable thing. I think you can always find a perfect complex of twisted sheets. So you can always find a perfect complex of twisted shapes. So the derived endomorphism algebra is going to be derived Ausuma algebra with that class, but it won't be necessarily in the actual Brower class. So you can get any class in H2 of GM this way. Yeah, yeah. So it would be trying to understand. I think so it's not connective. Right. The point is that will not be connective, I guess. So this thing you wrote there on the board. Yeah. I'm concerned about like the thing on the left, just the A is in DZE. Like anything is going to have, every gerb is going to have something in DZ that isn't connected. That isn't connected. The average j would be as something in DAZ, which is an Azomai. No, this is an Azomai algebra. Derived Azumai algebra. Right. And it's totally unrelated to the any kind of. And it would be a torsion. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We take a torsion class. But then it's not, I mean. But maybe this is something I'm not understanding. I mean, this would say if you start with an answer algebra, which would essentially mean a GM gerb. Well, in a smooth case, at least, or a normal case. Let's say smooth case. And then it is of tertium because it is in a smooth case, it is in a smooth case, and it is a Moitophilian SO2. What am I saying? Say something stupid? I'm just saying every torsion class has that property, whether or not prior equals raw. The derived thing is floppy enough that you just kind of know this because you can make perfect complexes. So you're saying that there exists something inside. Something inside here. I don't understand the thing about C. I only know about B and only a little bit. And it's been, like I said, I'm old and it's been a long time. But I think if you go down to like sort of just endomorphisms of a twisted, of a complex of twisted, perfect complex of twisted sheaves, it's going to be one of those things. If you start with the derivative as my algebra, here, derive. Start with the GM jerk. Let's have a GM jerk here. Let's say over here. It takes most of this nothing else. Yeah, yeah. Take a perfect complex of twisted sheaves. Yeah, and then you use endomorphism. They use endomorphism ring and category. That's a derived ausumyology. Right, but it's a trigger one. Right. No, no, no, no. It's a twisted. So you just have a derived ausumiology, Brian. Right. Yeah. Sort of almost a priori, just from like the case here. But this does not lift here in the connective one. So, but what you wrote there, you just wrote DZ. Maybe you meant DZ greater than or equal to zero. What did you mean? You wrote Boba implies a connected. No, I'm saying that if the the happen if if the let's say like this if the if the brawler premise is true for example for a smooth separate scheme this is an isomorphism this is an isomorphism for smooth scheme these are all isomorphisms and so you get that this also is an isomorphism yeah but i'm wondering if you take like the ekhb counterexample yeah but this is not separated no these are only separated case i mean and just assuming in the case where if if this is true for some separated schemes right i mean this is not true every every time but what i'm saying is that suppose that for But what I'm saying is, I suppose that for, yeah, I mean, and the Bravo-Bravo prime, what I'm saying is Bravi-Co-Bravi prime is exactly equal to this one. This is, yeah, it's another formulation of the Bravi-Co-Bravo prime. Yeah. So let's see. Let's see what I should do. Okay, I guess I will give you the. I guess I will give you the only one direction, which is somehow the more interesting one. And it's the one that actually Mauro asked us to do. And the other was somehow coming from that. So I want to explain, yeah, the circle, which in particular I wanted to explain how given a GM gerb, and I think Max will also talk about this, you get one of these categorical Azumai algebra. Categorical Adzumai algebras, connective categorical algebra. And the map is just, well, just is this twisted sheaves. I will use it to say it would be just the identity. It will be like a identity character on GM. This will be the ED twisted sheaves, ED twisted sheaves, giving, yeah, giving, oh my God, giving a GM manager, you can associate one of these categories. And the point is that, well, let's. And the point is that, well, let's start with the thing we know. We know that this actually goes into, let's see, PST X L omega, right? We know that there is such a map, which again, sends gerb to the sheaves, the twisted sheaves of G. And now we are PST, right? We're looking at the pre-stable case, so the hopper one. The stable case would be. So, the upper one, the stable case would be here. We do a lot of the things actually also here, but this is the one where somehow the grottoing problem is really related. Here, you add this Z torsor, so it's somehow a bit musky. I don't know how to say. And so, what the thing we want to prove is that if you prove that this association is symmetric monoidal, because you can symmetric monoid, I need to say with which structure. So, first thing, okay, let's say, first thing. First thing, monoidal, symmetric, monoidal structure. So there are these two symmetric monoidal structures. Here we know what it is, right? This is the tensor product. And this tensor product actually descends, whatever, it's like this. This tensor product actually sends the invertible ones. So somehow the PR blah blah blah, this is done. For the gerubs, there's a very natural one, but somehow. There's a very natural one, but somehow we didn't search through your thesis, but we didn't find it. I mean, we didn't find it written explicitly as at least as an infinity category thing, which is on the GHGERPs, you can find this star product, which is a very natural thing to do. It's very classical. There are a lot of things that have been done with this star product, but somehow, if you want to put everything into infinity category, you need to give this a symmetric monoidal structure, and you need to do it in an infinity category way. You need to do it at An infinite way. You need to do it that without you. I mean, you need to do it in a way that you don't have to worry about compatibilities. And that's usually difficult, but somehow the start product is really good. So, because this start product is essentially the is universal, and that's where you can really do things. It's like the GM gerb, which is universal for maps from the product to the GM. For maps from the product to the gerb, from a gerb, that when you look at the inertia, what happens is just a multiplication, the normal multiplication. So, if one of another way of saying that this guy is the rigidification of this one along the gm inside the gm square given by the multiplication. But okay, there is a structure here. There is a gm structure, and you can, using all the nonsense and the functionality of this guy, you can put a structure here. So, there is this star product, and okay. Product. And okay, I'll finish it bringing down to proposition. They will essentially say that this thing is this map here is most symmetric monoidal. And because if this map is symmetric monoidal, now it's clear that we go here. Because every gerb, when you take a gerb, you can always take like the opposite gerb, which trivializes it. But then if this is a magic monoidal, it means. It. But then, if this is a metric monoidal, it means that this one should have the opposite one. And the opposite one would actually be the essentially the quasi call it of, well, I don't know how to call this the dual curve maybe or the opposite. And it's not really a dual, but yeah, this would be the, somehow, the because this is symmetric monoidal. And probably this was already known in the classical case. We tried to do it in the infinitive categorical case. Categorical case. Of course, that's a very true proposition. I mean, the superposition just tells you how to do it, how to how you do it. And let me take the, because I don't want to worry about directions of the maps. So you start with two characters of gm and two gm gerbs. This very natural thing to do is just taking the external product of the chi-twisted sheaves over the chi prime, g prime. And here, everywhere, you can put a lesser greater or equal. So everything is connective somehow. They're all the connective parts of them. Parts of them. And here I have the twist chi, chi prime twisted sheaves of this guy. And the first thing to prove that this is an equivalence. At the classical level, this is just defined by taking the taking two sheaves, one in G and one G prime, you pull them back and then you tensor them. But then, of course, this is an equivalence in the infinity category center. The infinity category setting. And proposition two would just be as above, but then you take the itwisted sheaves of the categories of the star product. You can send them here by pullback. Again, I should put this guy. And this is also an equivalence. Is also an equivalence. So, very briefly, I will give you a proof of this. Well, I'll just say in words, what is a proof? The idea is that you construct this map, these two maps, functorially, without using chi and this greater or equal than zero. So you really do just a level of quasiquarium sheets. You construct the map. Once you have the map, you prove that, first of all, essentially everything restricted to the characters. Everything restricted to the characters. You can really restrict here to the characters. You just need to work out the details to see that they go, chi and chi prime goes into this exactly. But is it really classical, not really interesting? Finally, what you prove is that this actually factor also for the greater or equal than zero case, essentially because you use that gm is linearly reductive and this map is flat. So every map you're considering is flat, so it's the exact, and also the push forward would be exact when gm is reductive. So you get these maps. So, you get these maps exactly from this guy, and these are all functorials, these are just defined pullbacks. And here is also a pullback. And finally, to prove that these are isomorphism, you just pass a trivial cover, and then you're just proving that these are just map from BGM to BGM, and you prove everything for the BGM case. And this is, yeah, so this proves essentially that these map factors, that you have this map actually here. The inverse is very easy, it's just that I will not discuss this. Is it's just that I will not discuss this, but it's a trivialization map exactly as you have the trivialization for the gerbs. So, to get that gerb here, you have a trivialization gerb that you can do for also for the categories using this one of finance of gate square. And then you prove that these two things are one in the university of the but that's somehow the hardest possible proving these two things, like go into the details of these two. Yeah, I think I saw. I think that's perfect. Proposition two, you're saying you imagine you just need to construct the map and check that it's functorial, like that it that it worked well, and then you check that it's a trigger. It seems like you know you test this our problem in terms of activity of I don't know what other derived as a bias. Have you tried like you know so there are many known cases have you tried proving this thing directly in the cases where bar equals bar prime is known? That's right. Yeah, yes. That's right. Yeah. Yes. I thought about, I don't know, I what we wanted to do at the beginning is that let's try even the smooth projective case. I don't know. Like even very easy, right? I mean, we've known already that like prove it using this other, like in this other language somehow. I mean, it's known as, of course, you will do know it, but then we stopped because we needed to write a PHTP. I mean, yeah, it was like. Yeah, it was like, yeah, I take the trivial brow. Now just take A, take any random perfect complex end of E. Is it not? You, I guess I should say no, I guess they should. I guess it should be equivalent to a connective one. Yeah. Right, yeah, that's right, that's right. Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. Right, but yeah, I agree. Yeah, you need the problem is that you need to find an equivalent one that is connected. That's right, that's right, that's right. Yeah, because these are all equivalent up to Morita. Yeah, because these are all equivalent up to more either. Yeah, somehow the I don't know. I mean, that, so here the thing seems very weird. And even though one would like to approach it here, that doesn't seem to be very good. Here, I like the idea of finding a generator, but finding a generator is also very hard. And it I think that somehow I really struggle to see how a thing like separated nets works. Thing like separate networks. Right. But over. I try to think. No, I never try to think about Overfield, I guess. But like somehow over a field, this has to be like everything is semi-simple, right? That's categories. So maybe one could work through that. I don't know. I could think of this, but it's just, yeah, I mean, just in these are only familiar. It's just, yeah, I mean, just in these are all refermulation, and what we wanted to do is just give lights of some map. But I also not sure that like this kind of procedure will help you understand. Maybe, I mean, at the end, probably it will be easier to find a way to prove this. And when you prove this, you find like the right Azumaya for the GM gerb, I don't know, in the separate cases, say, and then you get, ah, but that was obvious. It was actually this one here, right? At the end, I think that that would be the. At the end, I think that that would be what would happen at some point. But somehow, for the generator, I have a feeling that separateness could be more handy. I don't know. The fact that you have opens alpha and you intersect in still alpha instead of just quasi-compact. I feel it's more alpha than just, I don't know how to use it here. I really don't know how to use it there. Yeah, that's the that's the have you see this paper on email? Of approximable triangular. Sorry, yeah. So there's a notion of something called approximable triangular dependence. No, I haven't. Okay. So the idea is: you know, every 20 physical, right? You have a compact generator. Uh-huh. On the category of quasi-inshaxes. Yes. Okay. So Newman wants to quantify this. Oh. Find the speed by which this happens. So we kind of start with a connective generator and bounce the finger connectivity basically. Ah, okay. No, I didn't know about this. It was able to prove that any scheme is regular, even only perfect complexes has a bounded. Nice, yeah, right, right, right, right. No, I didn't, yeah, I again, I have not been thinking about this for a long time, and I definitely don't know enough about all the C structure and things, but that's that's could be a forget. Even proof for a smooth case would be like non-projective, would be great. Because it would, I mean, if you prove for smooth case, it is nothing. No, let's uh thank you, speaker.
