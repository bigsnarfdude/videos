Who's from the University of Edinburgh Sundays and UC Davis Sundays? And he will tell us about QFTs for non-semi-simple DQFTs. Thanks a lot, Ben. I'm zooming in from Edinburgh now. And yeah, thanks to you and Nina and Slava. And hi, everyone in the audience. In the audience. So I was going to throw in an apology later, I'll throw it in now. I assume you invited me for this conference to talk about my work on not homology, in particular with Lev, Rosansky, and Oblomkov and Hubrin and Garner. But I've gotten distracted from that for the last while. And so if you want to hear. So, if you want to hear about that, you can look at this drink math talk from last summer. I've been working on a thing that sort of touches upon many ideas that I think are related to this conference and will hopefully still be interesting for this particular audience. So, So, this is based on work with Thomas Kreitzig, Nick Garner, and Nathan Gere that started out as part of an FRG collaboration that was supposed to find a physical framework for some invariants that Nathan and Constantino and Patrio Muran had. Jiramuran had been describing. So, an earlier sort of experimental paper we wrote, well, it proved that ADO invariants have recursion relations similar to those of the colored Jones, which was a motivational check for us. Also, really closely related. Also, really closely related to this is work by Gukov, Sin, Nakajima, Park Pay, and Supenko that came out last year that deals with precisely the topic I will discuss, how to build three-dimensional physical quantum field theories that compute the sorts of semi-simple. Sorts of semi-simple vanishing quantum dimension not three manifold invariants that are out there in mathematics. And Sergei and Fagin Rashitikin, I understand, are working on the next stages of the next evolution of the paper that appears there. So So, and I will try at various points to connect to what I know of their work. Okay, so motivation. This conference exists in part because of what happened 30 years ago. Witten gave a 3D quantum field theory framework for Jones polynomials and extended quantum fields. And extended quantum invariance to three manifolds using Chen-Simon's theory. The Chen-Simon story with compact group was very closely related to representation theory of rational vertex operator algebras that appear on the boundaries of transignants. And that entire story got reformulated in terms of quantum group representation theory by Group representation theory by Reshtikin and Turayev. A key object in each of these perspectives is a certain braided tensor category. There are extra adjectives on top of braided tensor, but it's the minimal bit. This category is the category of line operators and the 3D field theory. Its objects are Its objects are lines, and its morphisms are local operators at junctions of lines. In the VOA perspective, one lets the lines end on a boundary where the VOA lives, and then they define modules for the VOA. And in the quantum group perspective, the line operators we're talking about are certain modules for a quantum group at a root of unity. At a root of unity. And I should have said it above, it's an even root of unity that is relevant here. The thing that's sort of important to emphasize is that the classic story involves a semi-simple representation category. There's a massive reduction of complexity in the full category of quantum group modules known as semi-simple. Known as semi-simplification, that is the part that fits into ReschT can thrive. In terms of physics, a very basic way to say semi-simple is that there are no non-trivial junctions of line operators. And for the few physicists in the audience, so Trans-Simon's theory doesn't have charged local operators. Wilson lines can't end. Aside from Aside from a certain equivalence relation that shifts things by k. And that is why Chern-Simons gives rise to something semi-simple. So the story has evolved a lot. And in math, even in the 90s, starting with work of Aguchu, the Gucci and sorry. Akutu de Gucci and Otsuki, who defined something that's now called the Adio invariant and the TQFT of Lubashenko's, also Hennings. So there immediately were extensions to a larger class of representations of UQ of G at a root of unity into a bigger category that's not semi-simple and has objects with vanishing quantum dimensions. It was also noted by Kashmir. It was also noted by Kashaya and Rashitikin that looking at this big category should actually give you invariance not just of three manifolds, but three manifolds together with a choice of a flat complex connection coming from the Frobenius center of the quantum group, which is related to the Langlands dual group at when the root of unity is even. And I'll connect to this, I'll call it a deformation by flat connections throughout. So it's some extra completely classical data that can deform the topology of that is there in addition to the topology of the manifold. Sorry, there was a question in the chat that I'm not entirely following. You're not supposed to ask things in the chat. You're supposed to just be rude and interpret. Well, no, you're you have the option of ignoring things in the chat, right? So, what I was at least trying to tell people is, you know, don't expect the speaker to look at the chat. But if you want to look at the chat and answer the question. Yeah, okay, no. So I think I've not read the second question. So I'll, so, so like everything in some version of these, these. And some version of these mathematical TTFTs is built out of a category. And it's a question of the category being semi-simple or not. So typically in almost everything I've seen, it's an abelian category. And so you can ask that question. Okay, so it turns out that actually doing this properly and in full generality using a non-semi-simple category where Where there are vanishing quantum dimensions, certain hop links or certain unknots look like they evaluate to zero, is really tricky. And putting like describing the braiding in this category and actually defining invariants is really tricky. And this is where the program by Giri Costantino Patira Murand and many follow-ups in the last five, 10 years. In the last five to ten years, have played a major role in sort of systematizing the construction of these invariants. And defining the braiding requires a process called unrolling of the quantum group, where a logarithm of K or rather H is adjoined. And I'm not going to say much about that unless you ask questions. Um, there's some physical meaning behind unrolling as well. Um, so in parallel, um, rational VOAs were generalized to logarithmic VOAs. One of the first key examples that will be relevant here is the triplet algebra that was generalized by Fagin and Tipunen. So the triplet is relevant for SL2. So the triplet is relevant for SL2 and Fagin-Tipunin algebra's work for NEG. And there were expectations from the beginning that representation theory of these fake interpretant algebras would be equivalent to representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity. And this has, there are many, many steps in proving this. Are many, many steps in proving this, in particular, proving an equivalence of bread and tensor categories, modular tensor categories. And that I think, as far as I understand, the final steps in that have now been completed. So that's that I sort of think of as the math side, math and mathematical physics. But there's sort of a missing. There's sort of a missing generalization of transients from here, which is what I want to talk about. There was a discussion in, well, yeah, there was a discussion in this work of Gukoff et al. last year about why looking at cohomological 3D quantum fields. Homological 3D quantum field theories, things like twists of supersymmetric theories, things like Trasansky-Witten theory, is a promising perspective. And if one is going to start deforming by connections, by flat connections, it would be good if these theories had some flavor symmetry. Having a cohomological TQFT, like a twisted supersymmetric theory, doesn't Supersymmetric theory doesn't necessarily give you semi-simple or non-semi-simple and vice versa. The reason this is a good place to look is that the categories of line operators are typically full-on, non-trivial derived categories with lots of extensions of objects. So generically, they're not semi-simple. And another way to say not semi-simple. And another way to say not semi-simple is that there are local operators. Turns Hyman's doesn't have any, and twists of supersymmetric theories typically do. And there are also appearances of the triplets in work stemming from the 3D correspondence in this paper of Cheng Chin, Ferrari, Gukoff, and Harrison. Okay. So, I want to propose one model for a 3D quantum field theory that has all the right properties. Like I said, if I'm going to use a supersymmetric theory, everything is derived and there is no choice about it. And so the sorts of categories that are going to appear are derived versions of quantum group and Shaken-Tipunin algebra categories. Capunin algebra categories. And the theory I'll talk about is one that has a ton of familiar ingredients that I bet are going to show up in many other places in this conference. So someone takes the Gaielot-Witten S-timaladine kernel, T of G, engages one of its flavor symmetries at a turn-Simon's level K, and takes a topological A twist. And it takes a topological A-twist of that thing. And I expect that it is the 3D mirror to the sorts of Brzezinski-Written theories that Gukauf and Al discussed. We write down an actual action, a Lagrangian formulation of this twisted theory in the BV formalism, which is, it's not entirely trivial that it suggests. I'll say that. Trivial that it suggests. I'll say a bit more about that later. And look at boundary vertex operator algebras. So there are holomorphic boundary conditions for this theory. And they're sort of two that we can use. And they give rise to dual vertex algebras. One of them is the Fagen-Takunin algebra. And the other one is something else. One is something else. And the relation between these two vertex algebras is analogous to level rank duality in WCW. They are mutual cosets of each other inside free fermions. And conjecturally, with some steps toward a proof by Thomas Kreitzig in our paper, conjecturally are mutual cosets and have equivalent module categories. Module categories. Okay. And then there are a bunch of simple checks one can do to make sure that one is on the right track. Things like computing dimensions of Hilbert spaces and the growth and degroup of the category of lines and some fancier things like trying to compute things about Hilbert spaces directly in a co-market. In a cohomological or geometric quantization sort of way. So, yeah, I'll say it now. Part of what got me excited about this is that the 3D field theory perspective just opens up a lot of different methods that can now be used to, in parallel, sort of study the quantum group and VOA objects, just like Turns Heinz theory did. Just like Turns Highlands theory did. Okay, and there's still a lot to do there, but we've done the first few things. Okay, so that's the general perspective. I want to say a little bit about the three sides of this. And I want to go through a bit of representation theory of quantum groups at an even root of unity. Of quantum groups at an even root of unity, and I'll just focus on SL2. And then I'll talk about the field theory, and I'll maybe spend two and a half minutes going over where the vertex algebras come from. Okay. Cool. So this is part of a reminder, but I don't know for me, this was. For me, this was not so much a reminder, but a lesson into things I had completely ignored for a long time. So it was known from the early 90s what representations of U2SL2 at an even root of UND look like. There's a large center called the Fubinia Center that includes kth powers of the generators, EF and K. And it's useful to And it's useful to not specialize k to the k, but k to the 2k. That plays better with the monoidal structure. The existence of this giant center that looks like the Langlands dual group, PGL2C, as in this As in this is a silly sort of, you can do a simple dimension count. Specializing the values of the center or asking what values the center can take is sort of like specializing a point in a three-dimensional space. It's more precise than that. And I've tried to illustrate how specializing k to a certain, or k to the 2k, to a to a certain non-zero complex number gets associated to an Complex number gets associated to an actual element of PGL2. The relevance of this is that representations split according to the value that the center takes on them, or rather indecomposable representations split and can be grouped. And there won't be any homs among representations with different values of the center. And a fancy way to say that is that the category will fiber over a spec. Will fiber over a spec of whatever part of the center we want to take. And here it's this thing I wrote that looks like PGL2C. And each fiber of the category is a particular block that doesn't have homs with any other blocks. An even fancier way to say this is that one expects to find a coherent sheaf of categories. And a nice thing that was discussed. A nice thing that was discussed initially by Tikoncini, Katz, and Perceze is that what you see in the fiber should only depend on what conjugacy class in PGLTC you're in. So sort of classifying the representation theory can be done conjugacy class by conjugacy class. In terms of TQFT, this sort of thing. This sort of thing leads to this sort of representation theory is what leads to invariance of three manifolds together with a choice of flat PGL2 connection. In the case of link invariance, we're talking about a flat connection at the complement of the link. And the way this works is that a flat connection and the complement of link. That a flat connection or the complement of link has monodromy around a certain strand. And the monodromy around the strand tells you what object or what block of the category you're supposed to choose objects from to color that strand with. And the beautiful and non-trivial thing that was initially discussed by Kashyaya Bin Rashitikin, I think, is that this monitor. This monodromy picture plays well with tensor product if you do it properly, and it's not entirely trivial. But if you define everything properly, then you expect as two strands get collided, the monodromies multiply, the holonomies multiply. And similarly, the tensor product with some slight modifications in the non-abelian case takes you from It takes you from fibers over G and G prime to the fiber over G G prime. Obviously, you want this to play well with braiding as well, and it does. So that almost already tells you what to expect from physics. We'd like a topological QFT that allows the deformation by That allows the deformation by flat, in this case, PGL2 connections or flat Langman's dual group connections. Having a deformation by connections is a general property of quantum field theories that have global symmetry. And here we'd like to see flat connections that are complexified. A QFT with such properties. Tea with such properties, I first saw and appreciated in a really nice paper of Viktor Mikhailov about five years ago. And to say all of this, that was a nice example that had these properties. To say all of this in maybe another physical perspective. So physically, So physically, there's a separate category of line operators depending. Sorry, let me say it like this. If you have a field theory that can be deformed by flat connections, one can introduce vortex lines for the flat connection. And then we can ask, what do line operators in the background of a vortex line or a holonomic defect look like? And that's the block of the category. Let me say a little bit about going back to just quantum group, what the representations look like. In a generic block, which can be, where the homonymy can be diagonalized, which is Belian, the fiber is semi-simple. Is semi-simple with 2k simple objects. And they all have dimension exactly k. They have vanishing quantum dimensions. Yeah, sorry, there's a type of dimension is k. They all have vanishing quantum dimension because q is a root of unity and the values that k takes on this representation sort of are evenly spaced around the unit circle. Applying the sort of modern Costano-Gir-Patira-Muran formulation to this recovers the old ADON variance of links in S3, where you color links by representations in the category in one of these generic abelian blocks. And then, if you try to extend it to other three manifolds, you get invariants of three manifolds together with the choice of a. Together with the choice of a flat abelian connection. The monoidal structure is extremely simple in these generic blocks that lets one very easily compute dimensions of Hilbert spaces. I want to say in physical terms what one is doing. So, one would expect a Hilbert space to be generated just like in transmons by Just like in transcendence, by putting Wilson lines inside a handler body. And so then one just counts how many different sort of networks of Wilson lines fit inside a genistry handle body. And that'll generate the Hilbert space. And that answer is correct. And one gets a very, very simple dimension. This sort of formula for the dimension of For the dimension of Hilbert spaces, it is surprisingly simple. I want to contrast this with the Verlinde formula, which has lots of subleading corrections in K, and this is sort of the leading part of the Verlinde formula, and that's it. It almost looks like this is a Belian-Trinsiman's theory. It is, however, not, and the braided structure is much more interesting. Okay. So that's a simple piece of the category that still has some problems because of vanishing quantum dimensions that require modern techniques. There's another sort of most interesting block of the category at trivial holonomy. So if we specialize the center so that k to the 2k is 1 and e to the k and f to the k are 0. K and f to the k are zero, we get what is called the small quantum group. Its representation category is not semi-simple. It sort of looks like this. They're 2K simple objects that involve things that look like representations of ordinary SL2. The plus minus has to do with whether k to the kx is one or minus one. You get two copies. One, you get two copies of ordinary reps. And then there's a thing on the end. And I'm not sure I can actually do a laser pointer right now. But there's the last representation, VK, has vanishing quantum dimension. All the rest are nice. And the last one is also automatically projective, but the rest are not. And the projective covers I drew there as well. So they're 2K and decomposable projectives. Projectives. The Rashtikin Tureyev story from 30 years ago takes a single copy of each of these first k-1 representations. And that's the semi-simplification. Another way to say it is that they quotient out by anything with vanishing quantum dimension. That's the classic Transimon story. The Kashai invariant uses Uses that last simple projective module with vanishing dimension. And the entire thing goes into the TQFT that Lybrushenko mostly defined and that this much more recent paper sort of put into the universal formalism that it fixed up a few small issues. Few small issues. And so now it can be seen as a case of that universal formalism. Okay. So that's a small quantum group. If we don't deform by flat connections, this is the category we expect to be getting. It's the small quantum group module category in a field theory. I want to talk about what sort of I want to talk about what sort of Hilbert spaces come from such categories. First, if we're going to do things in a derived way, the Hilbert space associated to a QFT with the small quantum group categories, its line operators, is going to be Hochschl tomology of this category. And the picture there is that suddenly we can color. Is that suddenly we can color or we can sort of decorate the inside of the solid torus, not just with line operators, but with line operators together with local operators at their junctions. That'll give you the cosenter of, give you h0 of the category, but also we can start taking descendants of local operators that are one forms and integrate them around paths going around. Going around the core of the solid torus. And that entire thing on the nose generates what in mathematics is the Hochschield homology complex of a generator of the endomorphism algebra of a generator of this category. You don't have a choice in a cohomological field theory. And And I had a lot of fun computing actual tomology groups and then realized that, in fact, they were known. So they look sort of like this. The HH0 is what appeared in Liebashenko's work and in much of the TQRT literature that deals with the small quantum group. There's a space there of dimension 3k minus 1 and SL2Z actions. The modular group action on this has been well studied. Action on this has been well studied and is extremely interesting and is related to the triplet. The whole thing has, so I computed and spent like a week running Mathematica and then realized that in fact the entire Hilbert space has a nice geometric manifestation. Manifestation. There's a factor of C2 and then K minus one copies of the full Dalbo cohomology of T star of the flag variety, which is suggestive in ways that I will discuss later. That T star, in fact, it's shifted in cohomological degree using a C star. In homological degree, using a C star action on the fibers, this T star two of the flab variety is something that is hopefully familiar from a lot of work on 3DN equals four theories and their connections with not homology. Okay. From the geometric formulation, it's really easy to see that the character, the Euler character of Character, the Euler character of this derived Hilbert space is 2k. And that's the same as just the dimension in generic blocks. And so I think I didn't say that there are these flat connections lying around. If we're the Hilbert space on a GSG surface depends on a choice of flat connection on that surface, and the choice of flat connection tells you what sort of blocks of the category to put inside. Inside. So on a torus, we can deform the Hilbert space by turning on homonily for a flat connection on the torus. And that deformation completely kills generically all of the hierarchical homology and gets you back down to a finite dimensional Hobart space of dimension 2k. And the growth indicator is also a fairly simple thing. And it's also got dimension 2k. The growth indicat ring has Um, the growth and degree ring has that presentation that I will reference but not say anything in detail about. Okay, so that's data. Now we're looking for a 3D topological quantum field theory that matches this data. In particular, it should be labeled by a group, maybe a Lie algebra, an integer. An integer level. And we wanted to be trans Simons-like in a few senses. The categories we were dealing with still had finitely many simple objects. And in the OA language, they're C2 co-finite. And so just like in turn-signment theory, we'd like to have sort of a finite number of inequivalent simple objects, something like both. Equivalent simple objects, something like Boson lines. Moreover, looking at ADO invariants, which come from this representation theory, as I mentioned before, one finds that they obey recursion relations, and they're exactly the same recursion relations that the color Jones obeys. So whatever field theory we're going to get can't be too far from Turn Simons. We know that the field figure should have a should be non-semi-simple and that there had better be local operators around. And there should be a Langlands dual global symmetry that gives rise to flat connections. And I think if you take this data and say it the right way and stare at it, Say it the right way and stare at it, there is at least to me a more or less unique answer to the problem. You start with the Gaiota-Witten S duality interface. This is a 3D n equals 4 supersymmetric theory that has g times g dual global symmetry. And gauge, either G or G dual. Here I'll just Well, here I'll just for concreteness, I'll be gauging this simply connected one. Gauge G with a transient level. This is a little trickier than it sounds, because in general, gauging symmetries with transients level can't be done while preserving unequals Fourier supersymmetry, which you then need for a topological twist. This theory is extremely special. Extremely special. So, Guyotun, written in a different paper, showed that you can preserve the supersymmetry you need as long as roughly the trace of the moment map squared for your symmetry is constant. This holds in the infrared. I think this is not the right conference to make too many physical statements about. Statements about this, but there's something very subtle here. In particular, supersymmetry is only what you need for a topological twist is only preserved in the infrared. The leftover Langlands dual symmetry still acts. And so we've got a theory that has a root between Simon's level and a Langlands dual global symmetry. And now there are two options for how to make it topological. In 3D. In 3D n equals 4 theories have two twists. I called them A and B because they correspond to two-dimensional A and B twists on boundaries behaving many of the same ways. The A twist is a reduction of Witten's Donaldson twist, and the B twist is what was used in Rosansky-Witten theory. Flavor symmetry or global symmetries behave in different ways. Behave in different ways depending on what twist you use and what sort of symmetry you have. There are options. The Langlands dual symmetry here in the A twist will give rise to deformations by flat connections, exactly what we want, flat complexified connections. And in the B twist here, it will give rise to deformations by monopoles. This is maybe a little backward from expectations. Maybe a little backward from expectations if you know a bit about the A and B twists. And it's because the symmetry acts in a way that's a little backward from usual flavor symmetries. So that's what you want. So my theory is going to be the A twist of this thing I constructed. And let me also note that the B twist has featured in work of Capustin and Salvina also about 10 years ago. Also, about 10 years ago, they defined something called Trin-Simons-Strozansky-Witten theory, which is the B-twist of the same thing that deformed onto the Higgs branch. It's not, however, what we want. Okay, so now I want to ask the question, is this reasonable at a more quantitative perspective or more quantitative level? Or more quantitative level. When the group is SUN, one can say what this theory is quite a bit more concretely. One starts with a 3DN equals 4 theory that's defined by a quiver variety, or that's defined by a quiver. The Higgs branch of this thing is the associated Nakajima quiver variety. So this is T of G when G is SUN. When G is SUN. So the associated Nakajima quiver variety is the milk and cone of G or resolution thereof. That thing still has a G symmetry, which is then what we gauge with a transignance level. And it's that final gauging that's a little weird and doesn't entirely fit. and doesn't doesn't entirely fit into much of the 3dn equals 4 um at least not not the study of 3dn equals 4 that's that's appeared in math so far um um the the wilson lines i wanted are are wilson lines for that last um for that last For that last G, or in this case SUN gauge group, it is quite non-trivial that there are Wilson lines of the A-twist. The A-twist usually only has vortex lines, but with the Transhyman's level, it does have Wilson lines. And the flat connections I deformed by are related to resolution parameters for the nil-potent cone. At least, sorry, in this description, one can only really see. Description: One can only really see a diagonal part or diagonal or abelian flat connections that have to do with resolution parameters. So as I said, there's a BV action for this theory, or sorry, there's an action for this theory. The only way I know how to write it is in the BV formalism. And I mentioned that this. I mentioned that this should be dual, should be 3D mirror to the work of Gukoff and all. So they discussed, at least abstractly, some spaces whose Rosansky-Witten theories should give these not semi-simple invariants. And I think these spaces should be the Coulomb branches of these TNK theories. Okay. So given that what is at least from a computational physical perspective, a concrete description, one can do computations. So one can compute what are called twisted indices and adapt them to the topological a twist. So these are partition functions on a Riemann surface times S1. On a Riemann surface times S1, and they will give you characters of Hilbert spaces. They will also, out of order, allow you to compute expectation values of circular Wilson lines on Riemann surface times S1, where the Wilson line wraps S1. This immediately gives you access to the growth and degran of the category that it matches, what it's supposed to match. And then one gets other characters of. Or their characters of the derived Hilbert spaces I mentioned earlier that are completely invariant under deformation by flat connection. And one again gets the characters or generically dimensions one is supposed to get. And there's a bit of, there's more that one can find from here. The Hilbert spaces are actually representations of that language dual group. Language dual group, and one can find those representations sitting there as well. That's sort of numerical things that are fairly easy to compute. More interesting things that are accessible with a lot of the recent developments in N3DN equals four theory and N3DN equals two theories, topological and holomorphic twists. Using many, many recent developments in math and physics, one can actually access the Hilbert spaces themselves and optimistically algebras of local operators and categories of lines. I should say there's still things we're pinning down precisely here, but the category of line operators in these theories. Category of line operators in these theories is so in a 3D n equals 4 theory T of G, it would look like the modules on the loop space of the Nakajima quiver variety. The extra Turn-Simons gauging sort of tells you to take loop group at level K invariance of that, but it has to be said correctly. So as a comparison, if we were constructing ordinary compact group Trinsimans theory as a supersymmetric theory, which can be done, one would compute the category of lines and finds coherent sheaves for point mod loop group at level k. In other words, representations of the loop group at level k, which is correct in turn-simons. And one gets Um, and one gets should stop waffling on so much. Anyway, one gets a generalization of this. Um, so I think the right way to say it, instead of saying demodules, you say coherent shoes on a quantized space. And that happens to have an action of the loop group at level k and look at the corresponding equivariant derived category. A very concrete way to say that will come from vertex algebras. Way to say that will come from vertex algebras that I'll discuss in the last minute. So, Hilbert spaces and transients and geometric quantization look like sections of the kth power of some line bundle on bungee. And here we get a deformation of that that Because of the extra T of G piece, we'll get that line bundle tensored with a certain rather complicated sheaf over Bungie. And for the Hilbert space of the two-sphere in transhymens, that thing has dimension one in this other theory. It has dimension one in homological. Has dimension one in homological degree zero, and otherwise has an entire copy of functions on t-star flag shifted in homological degree on top of it. And the Hilbert space of the torus and Trin Simons is roughly a thing of dimension k to the n. Number of representations of the loop group. And And in so, so, what you expect from the Schiffy perspective here is that when you get roughly a product of the Trinseyans-Hilbert space, and whatever comes from should be the colon branch of this theory, and it looks like the colon branch is this T star 2 of flat variety. And so one gets this derived Hilbert space that is sort of Chon-Simon's time's full-del Vocal homology. Full del Vocal homology of T star2 of the flat variety, which is very, very close. This is approximate because it doesn't factorize completely, but it's very, very close to the description I gave maybe 20 minutes ago where the Stalboca homology was appearing to the getting k minus one copies of it for SL2. That is as far as I can go quantitatively with the field. Go quantitatively with the field theory. I should say there's another perspective that is extremely useful on this A-twisted theory coming from four dimensions in four-dimensional Yang-Mills and the Langlands twist and lifts of that either to six dimensions or to brainweb constructions. So there are two ways to define this theory. To define this theory. So T of G with G gauged at level K can be realized as a sandwich in four-dimensional superior Mills theory with a Neumann boundary condition on one side together with K units of Trin-Simons coupling and the action on the boundary and a T of G or T of S U N boundary condition on the other side. The four-dimensional S The four-dimensional S-dual of that involves a modified non-pole on one side and a Dirichlet boundary condition on the other. And both of these are quite useful. We wanted a particular topological twist of the 3D theory, and that is induced by a particular choice of Capustin-Witten and geometric Langlands twist in the bulk. And A corresponds to A and B corresponds to B. To A and B corresponds to B. So one takes the A-type Language twist on the side of this that looks a lot like the 3D theory we started with and takes the B-type Language twist in the S-dual description. A useful thing about these pictures is that they immediately tell you where the quantitative features, Wilson lines and flat connections are coming from. Wilson lines live on the left boundary. From Muslim lens live on the left boundary condition, which is Naiman, in one S-20 frame, and flat connections live on the right boundary condition, which is most easily seen when it's Jirishle in the other S-20 frame. So the B setup here should be closely related to this work of Gukov et al. They particularly focus on a deformation of that. Focus on a deformation of that to generic Langlands twist parameter and talk about a sigma model to T-star of the affine and Grassmannian that should analytically continue ADO invariance and this entire TQFT, which would be extremely interesting to say more about. I hope they say more about it. This 40 perspective lifted to 60 also connects with, or should connect with categorification, which is unfortunately all I'll say about this in this talk, but like a lot of those connections have already been made initially in Witten's formulation of component homology from four, five, six dimensions. Five, six dimensions, and then prominently, which is in work of Luka Pei, Butraf and Rafa, which in the 3D, 3D correspondence, which is what eventually led to their work on this. Okay. So there should be categorification here. I think this is roughly where it comes from. It's sort of clear this is where it should come from. But I don't have anything else to say about that yet. Okay. Okay, and then I'll just finish up. So there's a third perspective here: vertex operator algebras. And there's sort of two. And to introduce what happens, I want to remind one that in Transimon's theory, there's this WZW model on the boundary. But if you look at the theory a bit differently, and if you really At the theory a bit differently. If you realize Trinseyman's from a supersymmetric theory, then there are actually two potential holomorphic boundary conditions that support two different vertex operator algebras that nevertheless have the same representation category. And the way that happens is that these VOAs are mutual commutants. They're mutual cosets inside some number of free fermions, which has a trivial representation category. Representation category. So we find an analog of this level ranked duality picture conjecturally in our supersymmetric theories, where one of the vertex algebras is the Fagin-Tipunin algebra, and the other one is something else. And they so conjecturally embed as mutual commutons inside the free fermions, and Thomas has gone some way to proving that in our paper. Thomas quite soon. Just as a reminder, the representation of the module category of the ficken to put in algebra is exactly what we want. Once if you have a holomorphic boundary condition, bulk line operators, we're going to define modules for the spee Modules for the COA. And so, like, identifying the fake entity-putin algebra was like a really exciting connection that sort of tells us we were on the right track. And in fact, making all of this precise, just a monster proof that the category of lines in the 3D theory is what one needs. Okay. So one of these vertex algebras, One of these vertex algebras, the one that's not fagged into Putin, is derived most easily by putting the most natural boundary condition on the 3D Lagrangian theory and using work of Costello-Greyoto and mine with Costello-Greyoto to just systematically write down the boundary vertex algebra. One, it looks sort of complicated, but it's what you expect. Of complicated, but it's what you expect from the quiver T of G theory with an extra transience gauging. So there's an algebra A of S L that comes from the T of G quiver that's essentially some copies of a beta gamma system for the matter in that quiver, BRST reduced by the gauge groups in that quiver. And then one takes that, tensors it with another bunch of free fermions and takes an affine. An affine SLN at level K coastlet. That's one of the descriptions. It's maybe not the useful one, but most useful one. This thing you get is a particular limit of what's called the language kernel BOA in work of Kratsukio and Rapchuk and KO2. It's extremely important in language program. The fake and Putin algebra comes most naturally from the SDU perspective. I think it should also exist in the field theory. Like all of these should exist both in brains or 4D and the 3D theory. Anyway, it comes most naturally in the S2OL formulation as a collision of corner vertex algebras, the ones that were designed. The ones that were described in work of Gautier-Rapchak and Kreitsuk and Beatu. And here the relevant vertex algebras are a W algebra and an affine algebra, where the levels, the inverse levels sum to k, and one takes an infinite level limit and peels off the Fagin-to-Plinin algebra. That particular decomposition for arbitrary SLN was described recently by Sudi Mata. So, yeah, so there seem to be these two boundary vertex algebras around. And I think they give equivalent module categories, and that's what replaces WZW. There's a lot left to do, particularly getting SNT matrices and understanding in more concrete terms this structure of what This structure of what it means to have a derived TGFT. Very abstractly, that's what Koncevichian theory and many people in Hamatapi theory have formulated. But it would be nice in this particular case to have a more precise understanding. Kabustin and Rozansky and Selina have formulated this sort of 3D TQFT in the B-twist. Yeah, so thanks. And I hope that that wasn't too, too far from the subjects of interest. All right. Thanks so much, Ter. So, does anyone have any questions? Oh, I guess Sergei does. Yeah, thank you, Tudor, for a very nice talk. I have a couple of questions, but maybe I'll start with one. So you focused on even root of unity. So let me just talk about SL2. So there is this chart between Langland's dual and the group itself, depending on whether root is even or odd. So do you see what happens for odd root of unity and why it happens from QFC point of view? I do not. I do not, and I haven't thought about it much. And the natural quantization of Trin Simon's levels in this framework, it's only the even roots that appear. Yeah, I'm not sure. The story is way simpler in the odd case. I left a lot out. I left a lot out in discussing representation theory in the even case. So it would be great if there was some physics behind that. All right, so I think Calvin had his hand up first. Yeah, thanks for the talk. I have a so I thought it was like the Poisson dual group, not the Landlands dual group. Or are those the same thing? It's not exactly the Languenz dual. I think that's an oversimplification for certain roots of unity. Yeah, sorry, the story is more complicated. And I'm not sure I can say anything better about it. Sorry, I should also have, like I said, I saw a lot in the audience. I forgot to mention that not semi-simple 3D. Not semi-simple 3D theories also show up in supergroup transients and supergroup WZW models. It's maybe a much simpler way they show up. And Vrzansky and Soler were one of the first people to talk about that. It's just not what we focused on. All right. And then I think it was me now trying to go in the order people raise their hands. The ordered people raise their hands. All right, thanks, Tudor, for a nice talk. So, can you say, in the language of two zero theory on the three-manifold, what one is changing? Like the usual setting of how one's supposed to get Chassan's theory from to zero theory. What should you change to get this version? I think Sergey might be able to say that better. So it's So it's like this is the way this was showing up in his construction. So it was the auxiliary geometry in these 60 constructions tells you what sort of Trinseimans theory you have. So if you want complex Trinseyman's theory at a particular integer level, then you use a lens. integer level then you use a lens space in in 60 um if you want a holomorphic sector in analytically continued transient theory then you use a cigar times s1 um in in 60. so in the the bit that's not topological the the bit that's that's holomorphic um and and this story seems to arise from from this cigar times From this cigar times S1 picture, where the cigar twisting parameter is specialized to k or one over k. Or it's a specialization of like the omega deformation parameter to the particular integer values. How is that different from the usual way we're usually supposed to get translations theory? Like the vanilla trans theory? I would say boundary conditions. I think Tudor finally talked basically that two boundary conditions at the tip of the cigar and the rim of the cigar are basically changing. I think that's basically what he, at least that would be my rephrasing. I don't know if Tudor would be. Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. Sorry, I guess you can see it in the brain construction that is on the left here. On the left here. So, if you took that picture and replaced the T of S UN boundary condition with either a Dirichlet boundary condition or let it go off to infinity and chose a flat connection. That's Witten's picture for analytic continuation of Transimons and it is what I thought Sergei's starting point was for, sorry, it's definitely Sergei's starting point for these homological blocks. Service starting point for these homological blocks, though potentially at generic psi parameter, not psi equal zero. I'm sorry, I think so Whitton's paper would be on the A side, Neumann and D3 extended only. Sorry, maybe I sorry. You're and there's an S duality interface that that should, sorry, you're right. Sorry, you're right. So, um, so let me let me say it this way: start with the left, remove the transients level from the boundary, and just work out generic psi parameter in the bulk. Take the s dual, thank you. Then you get ordinary nom, not some weird version of a norm boundary condition. You get ordinary nom at generic at generic bulk psi parameter and a Dirichlet boundary condition. And that's a thing that can. That's a thing that can be categorified. And like counting, or if you don't want Dirichlet, you just let it go off to infinity and choose a flat connection at infinity. That should be equivalent. And how are you changing that? It's special things that happen when psi goes to an integer or one over an integer or zero or infinity, depending on your... Infinity depending on your duality frame. I see. So you want to say you don't change anything, you just specialize psi to a root of unity, and you'll get this immediately. Yeah, yes, but but like, but that's, that's like, that's a really non-trivial limit. Yes. Yeah. I think that that's maybe the simplest way to go at it. Yeah. I'm sorry, quick question. What if you switch A and B in your picture? What if you put B on the left? Your picture? What if you put B on below? Then, well, then in the simplest case, you get this Trin Simons-Rzansky-Witten theory that Campus and Selvina talked about. You get something very different. Actually, I don't understand something. Sorry. You won't couple to flat connections in the right way. You won't come with the flat connections in the right way. So it will be just a different theory. Yeah. The thing I don't understand is the standard construct, if you're asking just about not invariance as opposed to three manifold invariants, nothing cares about Q. Q could be anything at all. So at the same time, you're saying that the quantum dimensions change. So that's a huge change. It's not. It's not. Yeah, that's correct. But that is where the volume conjecture comes from. So, if like volume conjecture is actually working in this category that has vanishing quantum dimension, and that is Kashaev's invariant. And as far as the Jones polynomial goes, you're absolutely right. It just doesn't care. There is Q, it doesn't need to be a root of unity. The Jones polynomial still makes sense. And so I sorry so in terms of like in terms of representation theory or the actual category of line operators, there's a drastic change. In terms of numeric invariance, they may be just a very nice analytic continuation that connects everything. Maybe. Maybe a different thing you could say is that if you naively just plug in the values that give you the Kitchen variant, you would into the Jones polynomial, you would technically get zero. And really what's happening is there's like a modified dimension. It's just everything's one, so it's not very people don't always emphasize that perspective. Oh no, it's right. You're absolutely right. You're right. You re-normalize it. You would get zero. Yeah, yeah. It's just for the Kushaya and variant, it's just multiplying by one, so it's not very interesting. Multiplying by one, so it's not very interesting, but yeah, yeah, but but for the ADO, it's more complicated. Thank you. Okay, let's try again about physics. Um, are you telling me that we should modify something if we work at psi being the root of unity? That we are changing the boundary conditions on one end? I think the answer is yes. Clearly, I agree. Yeah, sorry. I would concur, and I would say that there are choices. So you have choices, and what you describe is a generalization. I mean, yet another choice which leads to which includes this non-senus simple model. And the boundary condition we are changing is the boundary condition at infinity or at the tip of this R plus that would has? Well, this can be. Well, this can be said in different ways, but now I'll mute myself a little may try to make a naive comment. So maybe everybody knows. So when Q is the root of unity, you get new representations that are associated specifically with this fact that e to the k becomes a central element. So you get k-dimensional or two k-dimensional. Dimensional or 2k-dimensional representations that were not there. And so, physically, I think when Witten did his construction, he rotated cigar a little bit when you go around the circle. And I guess for your construction, you need a lens space. So it's a little bit different. Instead of cigar, you have a sausage, and S1 is fibered over it. And that's how you get your integer. So, from Witten's perspective, you can perspective uh you can recognize in if if you would like relate your to relate your picture to what witten says in his paper on command of homology uh you would have to remove the right brains instead there would be a semi-infinite cigar and the left would be twisted but in a different way which in witten's case it allows any any key and in your case it's only And in your case, it's only the integer. Yes, right. Yeah. So you're saying that we are replacing the base three manifold from cigar trans to a lens space. You have said this, I guess I had missed that. Is that correct? I mean, no, it's still a cigar for me. So sorry, lenspace gives you complex transaction.
