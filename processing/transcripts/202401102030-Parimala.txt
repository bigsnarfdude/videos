It is my pleasure to introduce Professor Paramala from Emory University, Atlanta, whom I met first in 1984 in a city then called Bombay and now called Mumbai. And so please, Paran. Thank you. So the organizers, thank you so much for inviting me and giving me this opportunity. Inviting me and giving me this opportunity to speak in this place. And I mean, this is the first time I'm coming to CMI without Seshadri being around. And I remember him on this occasion. And I'm so glad one of my persons who helped me and Jaya through this project, Rosa Ramanan, is here. And I'm so glad he is able to make it this morning. Okay, so let me begin with some. So, let me begin with some introductory remarks. So, suppose K is a totally imaginary number field. And X over K is maybe C over K. I may mix up between C and X, but they are the same. So, this is a smooth projective, whatever you want. Projective, whatever you want, geometrically integral curve, and f is the function field of this curve. Basically, it is a function field in one variable over this totally imaginary number field. I'll tell you why I put the condition of no orderings on k. So, in this situation, there are no orderings on this field. And one of the big open questions here concerning quadratic forms is the following: whether large enough dimensional quadratic forms over this field. Dimensional quadratic forms over this field admit a non-trivial zero. Okay, so that is the so-called U invariant of F is the maximal dimension dimension of quadratic forms, Q quadratic form or form over F and Q is anisotropic. That means it does not represent zero non-trivially. So this is an invariant related. An invariant related to quadratic forms of a field. And so the question is for such function fields, whether this U invariant is finite is a big open question, whether large enough quadratic forms do admit a non-trivial zero. This is a big open question. And this is the question I want to discuss today. We are nowhere near any solution or even close to solution, but some attempts have been in the last few years towards approaching. Few years towards approaching this question. There are some approaches which I want to explain in this talk. And also, there is a jump in the activities here since if the local case, when K is a periodic field, in this case, then we know that U invariant of K of C curve or a P is 8. That is, every nine-dimensional quadratic form has a non-trivial zero. This looks yeah. This looks, yeah, this is not a very old result. It is in the 90s, last century, this thing. So, because of this local case, there is reason to believe that maybe nine-dimensional quadratic forms admit a non-trivial zero. But anyway, even finiteness is, yeah, maybe I should attribute some names. So, myself and Suresh proved it when it is a non-diadic periodic field, and Keith Brown and subsequent. And subsequently, using his results, LEAP had a completely different approach to this problem for all primes without any condition on the p-adic field. Of course, we revisited this and we also got using our cohomological methods approved for p equal to 2 later on. Okay, so this is the situation for a periodic field. Okay, so this is the focus of my talk. How does one approach this problem or? How does one approach this problem of whether large enough dimensional quadratic forms admit a non-trivial zero over function fields of curves or totally imaginary number fields? Okay, the first, let me just bring back Wyworsky's classification of quadratic forms via Galva Cohomological invariants, HiFZ mod 2. These are the Galva Cohomology groups and the quadratic forms. And the quadratic forms for quadratic forms have successive invariance in these Galvo-Cohomology groups, motivated by Milner conjecture, and which is now a theorem due to Wywatsky, which says that quadratic forms are completely classified by the Galo-Cohomology invariance. In some sense, you have a classification in terms of Galois cohomology. And therefore, now we have a question on quadratic forms over such fields. And now you have a classification. And now you have a classification. You can think whether we can use the classification to give an answer to this question. But in order to answer the question, we need a better understanding of the Galaxy-Modic groups. They are also equally difficult to handle, and we need more information on these groups in order to say more about quadratic forms. So, first from Vivor's case theories, there are first thing is quadratic forms are quadric forms. Forms. When I say quadratic forms, maybe not up to isomorphism, up to planes, up to hyperbolic planes classified by Galva Cohomology. Galvo Cohomology. Okay, this is the first statement. And as a consequence of Hyword's case theorem, you have the following that every element alpha in the Element alpha in the Galva cohomology for every eye is a cup product. You can write it as a cup product as follows. So A1 dot A2 dot AI, where A1 in H1 of FZ mod 2. Maybe I just didn't say characteristic F is here. We have a number generally this discussion more general, characteristic is not to. Characteristic is not to Z mod to Z. This is mu 2, so this is just square square class, F star mod F star squared. This class stands for the square class of AI. Every element in HI is generated by, is a sum of such symbol, every element is a sum of such cup products. These are called symbols. A single cup product is called a symbol. A single cup product is called a symbol, and every element is a sum of symbols, is a consequence of Weigz case theorem. And so we say that this HI has bounded symbol length. This is the notation has bounded symbol length. This is the obvious notion, symbol length. If every element in the Co-Moltier class can be written as a sum of at most n symbols for a fixed n. If you can find an n, capital N, such that every element is a sum of at most n symbols, then you say that this has bounded symbol length n. And from Vivot's case theory, it is not hard to deduce this fact. Okay. So first of all, So first of all, if f is so suppose F is a field, for any field, if the following, suppose first that the so-called comb logical dimension of F is finite, is N, which is finite. The comb logical dimension essentially measures that the comb algae groups with the Galva comb alga group with torsion coefficients vanish beyond a certain level. Then you say comb logical dimension is bounded by n. So if the comb. bounded by n. So if the comb logical, that is all the comology for finite coefficients vanish from n plus 1 onwards for this field. That is the comb logical dimension. That is the invariants live in finitely many hi z mod 2 i less than or equal to particular n. And secondly, if all h i f z mod 2 i less than or equal to n if they have finite symbol length Have finite symbol length. Finite symbol length. Then the U invariant of F is finite. That is large enough quadratic forms admit a non-trivial zero. This is not a difficult exercise starting from Wyburgsky's theorem using classification. These conditions that finite cohomological dimension plus bounded symbol length for all the non-zero cohomology groups implies you invest. Groups it implies u invariant is finite. This is the approach we have been adopting, trying to bound the symbol length wherever you want to prove finiteness of the u invariant. Okay, so now if k is a totally imaginary number field, totally imaginary number field, there's a field without ordering. And let me fix this notation: f is k of 3 as before. Here, first of all, the cohomological dimension of this field is 3. All the cohomology vanish. All the comology vanishes beyond 3. And so, in this case, we need to only bound the symbol length for 2 and 3. H1, everything is a symbol. So, one needs to get bounded symbol length for H2 and H3 in order to arrive at cohomological dimension. So, in this direction, I want to state a theorem. It's a beautiful theorem, non-trivial of Suresh. Of Suresh. This is the first breakthrough for function fields or number fields that this f is as here. Every element in H3 is a symbol. It's a big breakthrough in H3FZ mode 2 is a symbol. Is a symbol. I mean, there is a lot of history behind this question of elements in H3 being a symbol. First, I want to say that suppose you have a field with U invariant. Suppose you have a field with u invariant at most 8. Then, say remarks, of course, in this case, you know that every element in H3 is a symbol. Okay, it's an easy exercise. So, if ever you want to prove u invariant is 8, this is a necessary condition. And this exactly via this that we proved in the local case, where k is a periodic field and function fields. We first proved that everything in H3 is a symbol before we got that U invariant is 8. And in the case of our number field, it is much more subtle because. But much more subtle because in the periodic field case, we assume blanket P is not equal to 2, but you have to deal with primes 2 as well here. So it becomes much more complicated. But we have this theorem before us. So it's very good. So U invariant of this field is finite if and only if H2FZ mod 2 has bounded symbol length, has bounded symbol length. Bounded symbol length symbol length. Finally, it reduces to H2. So, questions? So far, it's okay. So, but H2, this is treating it as a mu2. This is just the two torsion of the Brauer group of F. This H2 is the two torsion of the Brouwer group. So, the whole question reduces to a question on whether two torsion of the Brouwer group represented as H2 has bounded symbol length. Here, I want to read. Bounded symbol length. Here I want to recall that. So, bounded symbol length is equivalent to, we have this notion of two torsion of the Bravo group. It is represented by classes of central division algebra, so okay, by Weiderburn. So, this division algebra, there are two invariants in the Brauer group. One is the index, which is the square root of the dimension. The other is the order in the Brauer group. We are sticking to two torsion in the Bravo group. So, here, this is due to, there's a much more general result due to Saltman. General result due to Saltman and also crash and here's an independent proof of the same statement for the Braver group. So I just said there are two invariants: index of alpha is the index of the associated division algebra class d alpha, which is the square root of the dimension of, because it is a form for the matrix algebra, the dimension is the square. So this is the index invariant. So this bounded symbol length is the same. The bounded symbol length is the same as bounded index, bounded index for two torsion of the Brouwer group of F. This is, they prove it in a much more general setting. So this is a fact. So finally, we are reduced to finiteness of the U invariant is equivalent to the boundedness for the every element in the two torsion of the Brouwer group has index at most two to the capital N. index at most 2 to the capital N for a fixed n. Okay, so the problem reduces to this, the final question. So this is what I want to discuss today: the finiteness of indices, bounding indices in the two torsion of the Bravo group. Okay, so first, there are a few reductions which have been in the last 10 years. All these results have been around. First is for the so that so I'm just going to concentrate it. I'm just going to concentrate on this question of bounding index of Brawer classes. That is the goal. So, first is reduction to the unramified case to the unramified case. So, what do I mean by this? You have this Brouwer group of F and you have this curve C over K, and this is the function field. And the Brouwer group of the curve sits inside here. Group of the curve sits inside here, and you take the curve C over K. You suppose you take any regular proper model of this curve or the ring of integers in the number field. You take any regular proper model. Then you have this two torsion of the Brouwer group of the model sits inside the Brouwer group of C and Brouwer group of C sits inside the Brouwer group of the function field. And so, And so we have this following theorem of due to theorem. This is Lieblich, Suresh, and myself. And this is already maybe about a decade ago. So we proved that suppose given any alpha in the Brewer group of C. Now I will stick to two torsions. The statement is slightly more general. Two torsions. The statement is slightly more general. If any element in the two torsion of the Brouwer group of C, which is contained in the Brouwer group of F, there exists ABC in F star such that when you go to F square root A, square root B, square root C over this, alpha is unramified, is unramified, is unramified on RNA soot on model. On Arnasut on model. On a model of sorry, I began wrong. Suppose you take any element in the browser group of So you take any element in the browser group of the function field, then there exists this extension of degree 8 obtained by attaching square roots of three elements such that alpha is unramified. Such that alpha is unramped and a model of this function field f root a root b root c. So, what is this is what I wanted to say. This image is called image driver classes on a regular proper model. This image you could call it unramified, being unramified on C. Okay. Everywhere, I mean, exactly, exactly. There are three ABC square classes such that. ABC square classes such that when you go to this particular degree eight extension, alpha is unramped. Of course, this ABC will depend on your alpha. Starting with the Brouwer class, you can find a degree eight extension, which makes it unramped on a model. So, but this extension, even though extensions are themselves different, but the degree is eight. So, we are reduced to suppose you want to prove alpha has finite bounded index. It's enough to prove after extending to this that the extended class has bounded index. Okay. Class has bounded index, okay? Then you will have a finite splitting degree for all the elements in the Brower group. Thus, we are reduced to the following question. So, when I say unrafted Brower classes, it means it comes from a regular proper model. So, question. Question Uh is two torsion of the browser group unramped weight browser group? Does this have bounded index? Bounded index for all f. So because we can't fix the field, we are going to all possible extensions. If for all fields, if all unramified classes have bounded index, then the U invariant is finite. So this is what the reduction finally is to unramified brow classes. For all function fields in one variable over a totally imaginary number field. If you start with a given one, you go to some kind of extensions depending on your browser class, so on and so forth. Okay, so have common bounded index, fixed bounded index. There's a common capital N such that for all function fields of curves or totally imaginary number fields, unramified Bravo classes have Unramified driver classes are bound. The bound n index bound two to the n. Now what we are using here is this result that degree 8 extension, it is unramified. Then you we don't take any more core restriction. You multiply by 8 your index above. Okay, that's good enough, I mean to start with. Good enough, I mean, to start with. Right? So, eight times that index over the field will be the index below. Okay. So, okay, so we are reduced to bounding indices on the unramified drama group. So, the next reduction is this Lieblix method or technique to bound such unramified classes. So, let me have a little bit of generality. Suppose C over K, C. Suppose C or K, C over F, F is any field, any curve, or any field, it doesn't matter, somewhat general. And suppose you take, so the Brouwer group of C. So let me stick to two torsion in the Brouwer group of the function, Brouwer group of C over K and F is case. Okay, what? So you take any element alpha and alpha tilde in the Bravo group. Alpha tilde in the Brouwer group of the curve, not over the function field, but you take something in the Brouwer group of the curve, no harm because we are going to have something even in the Brouwer group of the models to start with. So you have something in the Brouwer group of C. So you have this exact sequence. So a Kuma sequence H2C mu2 to H2CGM. The two torsion. This is just the two torsion. This is just the two torsion of the Brouwer group of C to zero. We have this exact sequence, and you have this Brouwer class alpha tilde, which is in the Brauer group of the curve. So you can make, choose a lift alpha of this Brouwer class in H2C mu2. It's unique, no unique lift. There's a discrepancy up to, and for all the discussions from now on, let me assume that C of K is not empty. So you have a degree one divisor below. So when you choose this lift, So, when you choose this lift, I'll never mention it again. I don't say explicitly where you use it. The lift actually vanishes over the algebraic closure. You can assume this because C admits a rational point. You have a correction from here. So, you fix a lift of alpha of this alpha tilde and H2C mu2. So, you get this is what you can define as alpha is the mu2 jerk on C. So, you have an associated Brower case. So you have an associated browser class, so you have a mutual job. And let me denote by: suppose L0 is L is any line bundle on line bundle on C. So let me denote by M C alpha to L. This is the twisted moduli space. This is the moduli space of moduli space of alpha twisted. Alpha twisted twisted with respect to this job. Alpha twisted, stable, locally free, rank two, free, rank two, rank two bundles, vector bundles, I mean, bundles on bundles with determinate sheaves, let me call rank two sheaves, with determinate. Determinant fixed determinant L. So this is a twist of the usual moduli space of rank 2 vector bundles, stable vector bundles of rank 2 and determinant L. It's a twist of this model space. So this is the alpha twisted sheets. So you look at this model space. So I'll recall some few facts from Liebig's theory. So So, first of all, so in this modulus space 2L0, since it is a twist of the usual modulus space of rank 2 bundles, if L0 has odd degree, let me suppose that L, okay, this is a variety, this is genuine, a smooth projective, L0. A smooth projective L0 is odd degree. Let me fix this. There is no difficulty in assuming this because we are having a rational point, and mostly we will take L0 to be O C of P. Okay, this is the choice I'll make. So, this is a smooth projective variety, smooth projective variety ORK. In fact, it is geometrically a rational variety. It's a very nice variety. Of course, I'm fixing L0 odd degree. Of course, I'm fixing L0 odd degree. So, in this case, and secondly, if you take the moduli stack of the same stuff, rank 2, alpha twisted, etc., the stack to the moduli space to L naught, this is a mu2 zero again, mu2 zerb. And this mu2 0 from stack to the space defines an element gamma in the two torsion of the Bravo group of this moduli space. So, you get this comes with a bravo class. This comes with a brower class in the modelized space. And three, so maybe I should add this: that this is a smooth projective. And you have this fact that the Brauer group of K subjects onto this are all Brawler classes are constant classes in this case. These are all computations of Lieblich. So there are no non-constant Bravo classes in this model like space. A Bravo group of MC alpha. So, to the all the Brauer classes are constants. In particular, this job is defined by basically the image of a constant Brawer class. And the most important fact I want to use is that suppose gamma is 0. Suppose this Bravo class is 0, the image is 0. Then this is the criterion. If the model is space to L0, if it admits a rational point of what. point of what is the base of k is not empty if this twisted modulus space admits a rational point then the index of alpha tilde is this divides two period is equal to index for your braver class provided this modulus space admits a k-rational point so your question of yeah index of this brawler class so alpha in h2c mu2 lifts this alpha tilde in the braver class of c. In the Brouwer class of C. And if this modulus space admits a rational point, then in fact the index is bounded by index is 2. So you would have resolved the bounded index problem if this the modulus space admits a rational point. So, but why do we expect it as a rational point? Because of the following. So let me just come back to the arithmetic situation. Suppose, so I already have it here. K is now the arithmetic. What is gamma? This gamma is, so this is a mu2 zero. It defines an element in H2. This is just from the stack to this model space. This is the moduli stack of rank 2 bundles. The stack to the space, you have this natural map. Yeah. Okay, so the next is the arithmetic case. This much is very general from Libra. This much is very general from Leibrich. Suppose K is totally imaginary, as before, imaginary, and F is the function field of your smooth projective curve, A of C. We are in this situation. We have this alpha tilde. In fact, in the two-torsion of the Brouwer group of the model, which sits in the model C of the, so let it be the curve C, you have a two-torsion. C, you have a two-torsion in the model because we are assuming the class is unramified. This is contained in the Brouwer group of the curve, which is contained in the Brouwer group of F. So you are starting with such a class. When you look at it locally, alpha tilde over Kv, look at it here and you can pass from F, which is K of C, to K V of C when you go to the local completion to the local extension. Now, this defines a brower class in. Bravo class in this model over OV, the local complete discrete valuation ring. This is a complete, this is a local ring. This is a periodic integers, and this is a relative curve. Therefore, the residue field, when you reduction, modify it is a curve or a finite field. In this situation, it is very classical due to growth and achieve and so on. That the Brauer group itself is zero. So, your Brauer class, alpha tilde Kb, is zero for all. Kv is zero for all completions. We don't have any real Archimedean completions to worry about. All completions of K. The Bravo class is zero. If the Bravo class is zero, what happens to alpha? Alpha in H2 CKV mu2, this is the class I'm looking at whose images is alpha tilde H2C kv gm to torsion. So this goes to zero here over Kv. So, this goes to zero here over Kv, which means that it comes from pick CKV mod 2. So, it comes from a Picard element. Suppose it comes from some L L V locally to alpha K V. Suppose it comes from some line bundle class. What I want to say is that the entire moduli space alpha CKV alpha to L naught the moduli. L0 the moduli space we are looking at when you look at it locally because this comes from a line bundle class this is just the usual mod the moduli space is untwist I'll not repeat it again this untwist to a usual moduli space of uh rank two bundles with a fixed determinant so entire moduli space untwists so this moduli space has plenty of rational points you have rank two line bundles which are stable over this curve so you you you have this property that You have this property that this space locally admits points. Okay, so we have a smooth projective geometrically rational variety, and it has locally a point. There is no Brauer obstruction to having rational points. The question reduces to, is there a Hase principle for this variety? So the question reduces to Hase principle. I'm interested in getting a rational point over the number field. The question reduces to... The question reduces to Hase principle for this twisted moduli space alpha L naught. Okay, this is what I just I want to describe now what is what is the progress. There's very very little progress and a lot of anticipation. So in this situation, I mean, so in a paper with Jaya, with Ramanin contributing With Jaya, with Ramanin contributing to an appendix, we just made a wild conjecture that I will say the reason for this conjecture and so on. The for alpha in two torsion of the Brouwer group of a model, period equal to index. If it is period 2, then in fact, index is equal to 2 is our conjecture. Of course, it is again a very wild conjecture. So the reason this is This is, and the reason for this conjecture is this following positive statement over positive characteristic fields. This is a theorem of Lieblich that if X over K Fq is a smooth projective surface, projective surface surface and P is a prime And P is a prime which does not divide this Q, then for alpha in the Brouwer group of the surface with index alpha. So maybe I don't index alpha co-prime to Q. You take Brouwer classes whose indices are co-prime to this characteristic of the field, then period equal to index. Period equal to index. So this is the first. To index. So this is the positive characteristic analog. So he does prove in period equal to index with this minor condition of co-prime index co-prime to the characteristic. So this would be sort of the number field analog of this conjecture we expect. And so we started looking at this question several years ago. It was a project going on for years. And so finally, we decided probably for a general curve or a number field, it is beyond. We don't know what to do. Beyond, we don't know what to do. Maybe we just thought we would just pin down to hyperelliptic curves, where, I mean, there is this beautiful paper of Deshali Ramanan, where they give the description of the model, not the twisted, but the modulus space of rank two bundles with odd determinant, et cetera, et cetera, in terms of the geometry of the intersection of two quadrics in the projective space. So, we have this beautiful paper which we can use in order to understand what are. In order to understand what our twisted model is spaces should look like and so on, of course, that's the direction we started off with, and we needed a rational construction of this quadratic and the smooth intersection and so on, or the given ground field. But then Ramanan helped us, all this can be worked out, and he wrote it down for us. And still, we ended up with another kind of questions for questions concerning the intersection of two quadratics in projective spaces. But, you know, I mean, I will not. But, you know, I mean, I will not go into, I don't have time to go into this aspect, but what we have in this direction positive, I'll state theorem. So basically, all that I'm saying is with Jaya IL and with inputs from Raman L. So, this is the theorem we have positive in this direction. So, if a suppose the genus of the curve is 2. Then period equal to index index for two torsion of the Brouwer group of model. Because this is a statement, this conjecture is true when the genus of the curve is two. Here, all the curves are hyper elliptic. But the hope is, and that is what we tried to work out, was original hyper elliptic curves. So maybe I'll just explain the method. Explain the method of proof of this theorem now. So, any questions? Yeah, this is the elliptic case, it's known, yeah. Period equal to index, yeah. Yeah, that's true. I mean, I didn't say for genus one, it's true, yeah, sure. For genus one is true, yeah, sure. Okay, so the idea of the proof. Is it okay? The mic? Okay, so we have a C over K is a hyper elliptic curve. So what I'll describe here is the so-called Heke correspondence. So, but if somebody has a question why it is called Heke correspondence, you should direct it to the authors who named you. One of the authors is here. Ramanin is here. So, this is concerning. This is a sort of he told me once and I could not understand why. But anyway, so this connects the model space of, I'm interested in rank two. Let me stick to my situation. Rank two bundles with maybe determined. With maybe determinant one like OCP or degree determinant with the usual moduli space of rank two. Now you have to take semi-stable bundles of rank two with even determinant, like you can take OC. So odd and even determinants, there is a bridge through this Hecke correspondence, which links the two spaces. That is the point of this Heke correspondence. So let me take L0 to be, just to be simple, my OC of P P is a rational point of the OC of pp is a rational point of the curve rational point of this curve and so you have this model space of so let me define this Poincaré bundle so E is the universal bundle over C cross M C to O C this admits a universal bundle maybe Poincaré bundle whatever it is called this is a universal bundle and so let me take this fix the point C Take this fix the point C and C of K and look at the fiber of this bundle E P. This is a bundle over MC2OC of P. So you have this S. This is actually a P1 bundle. Sorry, let me just restrict it to E. I'll come to. So you have this bundle restricted to the fiber, and let me denote by P. And let me denote by p the Grassmannian of rank one quotients of this bundle EP. So you have a rank two bundle on this. You take the rank one quotients of this bundle EP. This is my P, this P to M C to O C P. So you have this natural map. This is because this E P is a bundle of this. And you also have a map S prime. This I'll describe. map S prime, this I'll describe. So the geometric points of P can be the this P, which is the Grassmannian of Rankine quotients, the geometric points admit this following description that you take pairs of vector bundles E F. So E is the class of E is in MC 2 OCF land determinant determinant degree 1 and E F is a bundle which is caught between E minus 1. It's a rank 2 Between E minus 1, it's a rank 2 locally free sheaf. It's caught between E minus 1 and E minus P, the twist minus P and E. It is something sandwiched between here. And the dimension of E P mod F P is 1. Maybe it is automatic. This is 1. So this characterizes the geometric points of this P we have constructed. And therefore, in fact, we can show that this bundle F. This bundle F, the bundle F actually belongs to the class of the bundle rank 2 bundle F. In fact, belongs to the modulus space of semi-stable bundles of rank 2 with trivial determinant. We started with a bundle with determinant OC of P, which is degree 1, and through this correspondence. Through this correspondence, we get a rank 2 bundle with trivial determinant, semi-stable bundle. It need not be stable. So you have a map P to, first of all, you have this bundle map to Mc2OC of P. This is the degree one bundle. You also have this map, this geometric points are characterized by this. So you have a map S prime to MC semi-stable to OC. So you have So, you have this variety P, which is fibered over this as well as this. And this S is a P1 bundle geometrically. And 2. So, what is S prime? So, first of all, in this situation, this modules space, this is the only case where this is semi-stable bundles. This is smooth. This is essentially the unique case when it is rank 2 and OC. This is smooth, and in fact, it. See, this is smooth, and in fact, it is isomorphic to the projective space P3. So, this is a P3, and S' is actually a conic bundle, conic bundle ramified on a smooth quartic hypersurface, quartic hypersurface in P3 hypersurface. Surface on this moduli space here, which is a P3. This probably one can understand this quartic hypersurface as the Kuma surface associated with Jacobian of the GNS2 curve. Okay, this is the ramifications geometrically integral hypersurface on which this is ramified. And so I have just 10 minutes to go. I'll be a little quick. So you have this, do you have this twist alpha for this modulus space in which I For this model space in which I am interested. So I have this twist, and I want to say maybe at the end, if there is a question, I will say there is also a twist here, which also lifts to a twist alpha of the bridge Heke correspondence. And I can call these maps S alpha, S prime alpha. So you have the whole situation admits the twisting by this alpha. So you have this twisted setting. You have this variety which is fibered over this and this. Which is fibered over this and this. And this is what this is at twist of the projective space. And this is the space in which we are interested in rational points. And you have this bridge P alpha between this. So I want to say first of all that when you look at this right-hand side, MC semi-stable, we notice a twist of P3. And if this twist of P3 is basically a Bravo-Savior variety, it is associated with a central simple division algebra over K. If it locally admits a point, it has a point. It's a homogeneous space. As a point, it's a homogeneous space. Okay, so what happens locally? I already said locally, the twist disappears because alpha, the Brauer class is trivial, it becomes the untwisted. The whole this Poincaré, this Heke correspondence, it completely untwists locally to give usual Poincaré bundle over these usual modular spaces with the line bundles just slightly adjusted. Okay, so all these are genuine hacker correspondence for modular spaces. Hecker correspondence for modular spaces, they all admit rational points. Okay, so this twist of the projective P3 admits locally a rational point. So, by Hase, Brava, Noita, locally trivial algebras are trivial. So, you get, because it's a projective homogeneous space, you get that Mc alpha 2OC, this as a rational point, which is actually a genuine P3. Okay, this is a big simplification of the whole situation, P3K. So, you have a P3k. So you have a conic bundle over P3K. This so instead of getting a point here, let me try to get a point here. So this is a conic bundle, and I know something about the ramification. This is a smooth quartic hypersurface, geometrically integral. And then I want a rational point here. It's hard. And of course, locally, I said all these spaces untwist. This also untwists the usual Heke bundle. And therefore, locally, this also has a rational point. If there were a Hase principle for P alpha, I'm done. For P alpha, I'm done. So there'll be a global point. And in order, I mean, okay, you measure Haas principle in terms of the so-called Bravermanian obstruction. But beautifully here, so there is no Brauver-Manny for such a conic bundle, which has ramification along one co-dimension, one point, namely the smooth quartic hypersurface. The Brauer group of this, P alpha, is nothing but the Brauer group of K. It's just Surjects onto this. So there is no Braverman in A. So there is no Brauermanian obstruction in this case because this is a conic bundle ramified only along a co-dimensional one point. Okay, so it's no Bravermanin obstruction. This locally has a point, whether it has a global point. So in this situation, we don't have a general Hase principle for a conic bundle over P3, which has such ramification, even though there is no Brahmanian obstruction. But this part of the story was explained to us by. Was explained to us by Kolya Telaine. So, okay, what one can do is the following. So, you can choose a line, pick. There is a choice for a line in P3 of K such that you can restrict this concrete bundle to L, to this L, which is a P1 inside this P3. You can restrict the whole situation. Can restrict the whole situation in such a way that there's a delicate way to choose this line such that with the following properties: that this trill, P alpha admits local points, it's still preserved after the restriction, it still has a local point. And secondly, this is the S prime restricted to L. And secondly, you can also adjust it so that the Brouwer group still maps onto P alpha restricted to L. Originally, on the whole of P alpha, there was a Finally, on the whole of P alpha, there was a subjection of the constant group. You can make this deduction in such a way that the Brouwer group of this, all the Brouwer classes here, also constant classes. Now, what do you have after restriction? You have a conic bundle over P1. You feel slightly better. It's a conic bundle over P1, which and this has locally a point. There is no Brauver-Manian obstruction. But where is the ramification of this conic bundle? S' restricted to L. E is ramification. restricted to L is because the original ramification was along a quartic hypersurface restricted to this line, it has ramification at most along a divisor of degree 4. Okay, so has is ramified along a divisor or divisor of degree 4. At most the device the RAM key is contained in a divisor of degree 4. So this is the situation of a conic bundle no Conic bundle, no Brown-Manny obstruction, and then ramified exactly along a divisor of at most degree four. In this situation, there is this theorem of coleothaline, which says that this P alpha L restricted to L, K is not. And in this situation, there is Hase principle. There is no Braun-Manny obstruction. There is no Brahmanian obstruction. Therefore, there is a rational point. We are done. This implies that when you project it down, you have that. That when you project it down, you have that MC alpha 2 OCP of K is not empty. And in this case, because the gamma, once again, I forgot to track the gamma, which gives the stack MC alpha 2 OCP to the stack to this MC alpha 2, etc. The stack, it is given. etc the stack it is given by i already said it is given given by a constant brow class and it is uh locally all the stacks and twist the stack the stacks are trivial locally the constant brow class is locally trivial though so this this also is zero globally because already there's a no there's a rational point here the obstruction to the stack getting a point is zero and therefore you get that in this situation we get that index of We get that index of alpha tilde is two. So you get what you want in this process using the maybe I have a couple of minutes. Yeah, I have a couple of minutes. So I'm glad I finished this proof because I wanted to say it in full at least here. So as I said, we embarked on this process of attempting this question for general hyper elliptic curves. As I said, the model is spaces of rank 2 bond is MC2OC. Rank two band is MC2OCFP rationally by the work of Ramnan. There is a description of this in terms of some, in the case of general genus G, hyper elliptic curves, G minus one dimensional grass manning of zeros inside the smooth intersection of the two quadrics. You can construct a quadric so that this problem of this model is space problem can be translated to this is the untristed case, smooth intersection of certain grass manions of. Intersection of certain Grassmannians of zeros in the intersection of two quadrates. And you have a twist, and then you have to work it through quite a bit. Eventually, what we see, the twist is locally trivial, that you have a twist of the two quadratic, there's a twisted quadratic situation, but the twist for the quadratic disappears. You do get even for the twisted model space, intersection of two genuine quadrats or a number field whose grassmanning of zeros determines the rational point for the moduli space. Rational point for the moduli space. You get up to this point of looking, translating the problem from the twisted moduli space to a problem on the intersection of two quadratics. And it's not just a point on the intersection of two quadratics, which is easy to obtain, as we have seen in previous talks by Jean-Louis and others. If the dimension of the projective space is large, you always get a common zero. But what we want is a G minus one-dimensional zero space inside the intersection of the linear space inside the intersection. Linear space inside the intersection, which is hard to, we don't know how to make any progress. But there's a translation. If one is interested in the arithmetic side, you can try to attack this problem independently. So then you'll reach a solution of our problem. But so even though we had this correspondence thinking we could do something more, we were not able to achieve something further using this discussion. So I stop at this point. Any questions? So I'm back to the question, the technical question. That's the point. When you get this element in the browser, the two ideas part you handled it, so it must be quite difficult, in fact. Which one? When you say the two torch of the top of the model. Torsion of the Bravo group of the model. Yeah, but to show that the class alpha is unorified on the model belongs to Bravo C tilde. Oh, that is a lot. That's quite a lot of work. This is the paper of Lieblake, which is very basic for the discussion. It's not easy part. It's not computational residues, yeah. Yeah, because you know, here again, did plans we have to deal with with it's a number field, right? So without a didc, maybe there is a way to see this, but. There is a way to see this, but with the dietic primes, it is delicate to get it into degree 8 extension or even for any general prime, root A, root P through A, P, root B, P, through C, to get it unramped is pretty hard. Yeah, yeah. You were mentioning this uh for the case of genus at least two. Case of genus at least two bigger than two, sorry, you're mentioning the search for linear spaces. Do you know the geometry of this variety of linear spaces? That is the real point that we try to analyze this. We have some things. We have some discussions with Jaya. It's going on with Ramanin and so on for genus 3. There are some here it is the P3 and so on. Things got very easy here. But there is a geometry. But there is a geometry, something more general for genus 3. Okay, it's not for any genus. But we couldn't really somehow, in order to get a local global, we tried to get a homogeneous situation where you can appeal to something or some kind of a nice configuration or inside there are some rational space. But we didn't reach any conclusions so far, even for GNS3. I mean, for instance, do you know that this rational GNS3? So you're looking for what you're looking for lines? Are you looking for lines in that? Uh, lines, are you looking for lines in that case? Uh, it's lines in this case, yeah, yeah. I mean, do you know that the variety of lines lying in this instruction of two corrects is geometrically rational? Oh, I don't know. Maybe somebody has an answer. I don't know really, but we are looking at it from the modular space point, the antisted model space and the geometry, and so on. That's what we are looking at directly as we did in the case of GNS2. We never went to the core of quadrics, but we straight away dealt with. Quadrics, but we straight away dealt with the Hakke correspondence. So we were trying to look at it from the modeling space point of view, not really from the intersection of quadrics. I don't know the answer. No more questions? Yeah. No, but it is for the Jacobian of the curve even in general. The two torsion of the Braver group of the model, this corresponds to the two torsion of the Jacobian of the curve. So it is the same problem, but it is harder. Exactly. It's a reformulation. It is, in fact, Exactly. It's a reformula. It is in fact that question. Of course, there are big open questions about miniteness and so on. Yeah, I see. No, but you may have two coverings. You can have some, there was a talk before on this topic of two coverings and so on. So, yeah, there could be, but there is no way which leads to, at least we don't see a way which leads to. To at least we don't see a way which leads to the kind of Hase principle we want for these spaces, right.
