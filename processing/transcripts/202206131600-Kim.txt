Hi, nice to meet you. My name is Jin Su Kim, working at PostTech. So I think I'm pretty new to you because my main research is intersection at probability and mathematical biology. But honestly, I'm kind of beginner of infection disease modeling. And I haven't done yet any research focusing on infection disease model. But I'm here to learn it. And I'm here to show you my research. I'm here to show you my research and look for potential collaboration with you. So, today I'm going to introduce chemical reaction network theory and how we potentially use this one for studying infection disease models. So, as you know, when we have a biochemical system, there are lots of ways to analyze it. But as you also know, there are different or many different Many different approaches to analyze this model by using network description. So, Boolean network, PEP3 net, and gene regulatory networks. The other network modeling is, which I'm mainly working on is reaction network, or many people call chemical reaction network or biochemical reaction network, which is, for example, like this. So, as you see, this is what As you see, this is one example describing how the protein is produced. But the other network usually just uses nodes and edges to represent how two components or two variables are correlated. So if two variables have some correlation, they are connected with an edge. Sometimes we use direction or not, or we use plus or minus sign to show is a positive. To show is a positive regulation or negative regulation. But in reaction network description, we use more detailed description. Like we are actually describing the actual interaction between species, like P goes, just goes outside the system or dies out, and M created protein P. So this is more detailed network description. Detailed network description. And for a given reaction network, we also have lots of mathematical modelings, deterministic model, for example, OD or PDE, stochastic model. We mainly use Markov chain or sometimes SPDE. Of course, we can mix them so we can use hybrid model. So let me briefly show you how deterministically model the reaction network. So for example, we have this simple reaction network. We have this simple reaction network where four reactions exist. So, this is a given reaction network describing how this system behaves. And then we can think of this phase plane where x-axis is A and Y-axis is B. And each axis represents the concentration of chemical species A and B. So, if the current system is at here, you can imagine this amount. Here, you can imagine this amount of concentration of A and this amount of concentration of B. Since we have four reactions, there are four directions at each point. So, you can imagine like this tag of war. So, each reaction pulls the system into their own direction with their own weight. So, simply, if you consider this vector, each component represents the concentration of A or B. Of A or B, then this X of T satisfies this ODE. So as we can see, this is the direction given by each reaction. And this pulls the system with their own weight, which is described by K. So this is a simple ODE description for a given reaction network. We can also think of stochastic model for a given reaction network. Stochastic model for a given reaction network. This is the same example. Now, instead of concentration, we think of exact count of species A and B. So this phase plane is now integer grid, not continuous plane. So if your system is here, which means you have this amount of A, not the concentration, just the exact count of A, and this amount of B exists in the system. And since there are system and since there are also four reactions we can think of these four jumps potential jumps at this stage and how do we determine uh okay so since this is stochastic and discrete uh system we can think of jump at each state not continuously behaves or continuously moving it is a discrete jump so we need to decide where to go and when to go randomly so Randomly. So basically, we just roll a die and choose where we go for the next jump. And we use exponential clock to decide when we go. So we just use two random variables, rolling a die and sampling from exponential distribution to run this system stochastically. More precisely, we can think of this. So capital X of t is an integer-valued vector. Is an integer-valued vector representing the count of A and B, respectively. And if we characterize the jump probability, then this Markov chain is fully characterized. So this definition is enough to characterize the Markov chain. So the level side means when the current system is at state X, maybe for example, this, the probability This is the probability of jumping by this reaction, for example, B to A. So B to A means you lose you lose one B and gain one A. So the probability jumping by this reaction within short time window delta T is proportional to lambda. Lambda is called reaction intensity. So this is a sample trajectories of determining Sample trajectories of deterministic and stochastic models. As you can see, deterministic model behaves continuously over the phase plane in time, but the stochastic model jumps discreetly. So one of the main philosophy of this field, there are lots of open problems and important problems, but one of the main philosophy of this field is we want to derive a qualitative behavior of the system by only using. The system by only using the structure of the network. Why we think of this main problem? So, for a given biology system, we think of first the reaction network modeling as I just described before. But as you know, one of the most challenging part is estimating the unknown parameters, right? So, we should use lots of data, lots of money and time to infer what parameters is. What parameters is to be here? That's a huge obstacle in this field in mathematical biology, including infection disease modeling. So, mathematicians in this field, in this field means the chemical reaction natural theory field, they thought of something very, I think, creative idea. Let's assume those parameters, kappa i's, are just all positive numbers, but we don't know what exactly they are. But can we derive some interesting But can we derive some interesting dynamical behavior by only using this structure, not using the parameters? That is one of the main philosophy of this field. So the following theorem is one of the famous, most famous theorem in this field. And I think this theorem gives you the example of this main philosophy. So suppose you are given such a network. Then assume all the parameters are positive. Assume all the parameters are positive. Then you got to check two conditions. One, you compute this left-hand side. So you count the number of nodes and you also count number of components, connected components, and you compute dimension of vector space spanned by reaction vectors. I will show you what this means in the following example. But if you see carefully this 11 side, this 11 side is. side this level side is completely determined by the structure not parameters there is no dependence on kappa i's if this index is equal to zero this index is called a deficiency and the other condition is weak reversibility but you can read this guy as a strong connectedness of the graph meaning that if you have node one and you have a directed path to node two Directed the path to node two, then there is another path from two to node one. That is the definition of weak reversibility. I will not go all the details, but it's also purely structural condition. There's no dependence on couples. If these two structural conditions are satisfied, regardless of the parameters, we know that the associated deterministic system, the ODE, which I showed you before, has unique local. Has unique locally stable statistics on the positive orthogonal. So, this is, I think, when I have seen this theorem before, I thought this is a really beautiful theorem because you don't need to estimate all the parameters, but you know the stability automatically, as long as these two simple, I mean, two conditions are met. And I think checking these two structural conditions is not that complicated. So, here's an example. So, here's an example. So, we have this reaction network. Let's count the number of nodes: one, two, and three. Let's count the connected component. We have only one connected component. And this reaction corresponds to vector negative two, one, because we lose two A's and gain one B. And the second reaction corresponds to this vector because we lose one B only. B only. And the last reaction corresponds to 2,000 because we gain only two A's. And you can think of the spanned space by these three reaction vectors and compute each dimension, which turns out to be two in this case. So we subtract three by one and by two. I think I should change this order. So three minus one minus two, which is a zero. So the first condition is met. And this is. Is met. And this is also a weaker reversible network. So we know exactly how this dynamics behaves. I mean, in the sense of stability question. What do you mean by on each compatibility part? That's a good point. Can I use board? The not good for Zoom audiences. Sorry about that. No, Zoom can make you right there. Oh, really? All right, right, right, right. So in some cases, like A and B, your dynamics can confined on subspace. Can confine on subspace over this 2D like this. Once your system starts at here, the system always confined on this. If your system starts at here, your dynamics may confine, may be confined on this. In this case, this hyperplane is called compatibility class. Yeah, sorry for not giving you all the details. So in this case, each diagonal line has unique localist tables. Another beautiful theorem given by my advisor and the other colleagues is stochastic version deficiency zero theorem. So every conditions are is the same as before. But now if you model this reaction network with the Markov chain, then what we know is the probability density function. So PAT means A t means okay, I can use this one again. Your Markov chain at time t is belonging to some subset A. So this is P A T. And as you expect, this probability evolves in time, right? The system probability always evolves in time. If you let T go to infinity, then this converges to some fixed, or we call the stationary distribution. Distribution or limiting distribution. So these two structural conditions guarantees that this limiting distribution exists. Furthermore, pi is product form of plus sun. Okay, I have only five minutes. Sorry, I have to run. But you can forget everything, but the main philosophy of this field is: can we use a structure, purely structure? Structural, purely structural conditions to derive such limiting behavior or existence of some steady state or existence of limiting distribution, uniqueness, and stability. That's what we are mainly focusing on this field. So, how can we apply these ideas for infection disease models? So, to me, I think if we think of SIR or SEIR, such infection disease models for Such infection disease models for macro scale system, I think the structure might be all this pretty similar between each, like each country or each big cities, I think, but of course parameters are different. But if we think of some small community like a school or campus, I think the underlying structure of infection disease model may have different structures. For example, so this is one example. So, this is one example: like the green, pink, and blue, they represent students in campus, but they have different schedule of taking courses. So this red, pink and green use the same dorm, but pink takes course this and this, but green takes course this and this. So they have a slightly different behavior in each day or. In each day or daily schedule or weekly schedule. So I can simplify this individual-based model into a compartment-based model. So these green students are grouped into a single group and pink students are also grouped into another group. Then we can maybe obtain this kind of reaction network for each group. And each group has the same student. The same student, each group has students who have the same schedule. So you can think of two different scenarios. So here, all the students having the same course are living in the same dorm. So we can intentionally assign these students. Maybe the second scenario, we don't care whether they take the same course or a different course. So the Course. So the green student and blue student take the same course without separation. In that case, the scenario one and scenario two may have a different underlying network structure. So we can probably think of how we apply the chemical reaction network theorem into this infection disease model. Unfortunately, and honestly, I haven't found any concrete examples. Any concrete example about two diseases in batch models have different structures, and one for one scenario we can apply chemical reaction effect theorem, and the other one maybe not. So, we can compare two systems. Unfortunately, I haven't found such example. But before I just wrapping up my talk, I will give you one very interesting approach using the structure of networks. Structure of networks recently founded by my colleague Yuji Hirono, this guy and his colleagues. To think about this very toy model. And if you solve the ODE associated with this linear model, it's pretty simple. And you can compute the positive steady state of A and B. Interestingly, so positive steady state of A is pretty clear, but positive steady state is a state of A. Pretty clear, but positive steady state of B is K1 over K3. Why is this interesting? Because you have, I mean, B has this inflow from A with kappa 2, but in the long run, this Kappa 2 dependence is disappearing. But this does not affect the long-term behavior of B. That's non-trivial, I think, thing. So you can remove this node and edge from the system, then you. From the system, then you can simplify the original system to be this simpler one. But in both the systems, the long-term, I mean, the positive steady state for B is identical. So this is structural simplification. You can apply the same idea to a more complex system. So if you have this kind of very complex network, but you can remove these parts. But you can remove this part. You can simplify to be this. But these four variables: x1, x2, x6, and x9 have the same positive steady state for both the systems. So how would we apply this one for infection disease? Actually, I have no very concrete idea, but as long as some infection disease model have this kind of very complicated structure, it's non-trivial to. It's non-trivial to know that this edge does not affect this variable, or this edge does not affect this variable. This is a very non-trivial problem. But if we apply such chemical reaction nature theory and we found that this edge or this edge does not do not affect X6, we can maybe, how do I say, make some decision, right, in small community like campus that, oh, student, these students' behavior. This student's behavior does not affect this student. So we can neglect this kind of interaction or this kind of activity to control excess. This is a very, very naive idea, but I would like to discuss this further during this workshop. Maybe I have to wrap up my talk. Thank you very much.
