I'm working at the Wiltshentrum Biology Department at Basel University with Eric Van E. Begen with also here. So today I want to talk about a new mechanism that we call cross-coupled sensitivity and it's related to gene regulation. Actually, that's one topic we are very interested in the lab. How bacteria tune their gene expression to Environmental conditions. And of course, one key feature of gene regulation is that it happens in response to environmental stimuli. So for complex organisms, we know and we even know from our own experience that visual or auditory stimuli are extremely complex dependent. I mean, I do see this orange dot smaller than the bright one. A dot smaller than the right one, but not if I remove the context. And similarly, these lines here are very wiggly, but more when I'm at the front actually. And if I now remove the checkboard, you see that they are parallel, right? So I think it's those are very straightforward refresher of reminders of what I call context dependence. And so a while ago, we started wondering whether much simpler organism like bacteria could also. Much simpler organisms like bacteria could also respond to environmental stimuli in a context-dependent manner. And asking what kind of mechanism would be involved and what would set the context actually. So I'll give you the answer right away. Sorry, we figured out that the current growth rate is really the key variable that is setting the context for. For specify the response of bacteria. And well, my talk will be mostly about that, and we have two parts, one part which is about regulatory response in single cells, which will lead me very naturally to this concept of cross-coupled sensitivity. So, because we want to study gene regulation in single cells, we had to do some development efforts a while back. Efforts a while back, and we combined well, developed a microfluidics chip which combines a motor machine design where bacteria can grow over very long terms in comfort conditions. So, for those of you who are not familiar, those are narrow channels in which each grain bar corresponds to one bacteria, and this is a main flow channel where bacteria are, from which bacteria provide nutrients. Where bacteria provided nutrients and where they will flow out. And we combine that with a very fast and accurate mixing junction, which is called a dial wave from Jeff Asti's lab. This works very nicely, allows us to indeed do a control switch with great accuracy and look at the responses. So we call this a dual input motor machine, and because it was harder than it sounds, we decided to make it. Sounds, we decided to make it publicly available as well as the image analysis software that we developed for which is called MoMA for Mozilla Machine Analyzer. And that's really a state-of-the-art solution for the analysis of Mozilla machine data set. So to get started with studying gene regulation in single cells, we turn to a textbook example, which is a lock operin. And so, in this experiment, you will see these E. coli cells. Again, each vertical channel hosts like five to ten of these cells, a grey mark here, growing when they are exposed to changing environments with glucose for four hours and then lactose for another four hours. And we can do such cycles repeatedly. And because this train has a translational fusion of a LagZ with GFV, the cell. GFP, the cell will turn green when they express their lactopyrin. So you see the time now we switch to lactose. You might appreciate that they have stopped growing for a while and now you see them inducing their lactopirin with different dynamics. And when we age here, we go back to glucose, they grow slightly faster again, and you can probably appreciate that the green is fading away. Fluorescence is diluted, which really means. Which really means that how much lag genes you have at the certain switch is set by the intervals that you have spent in lactose, right? And how much dilution you have done. This will be useful later on. Alright, so to give a quantitative look to this, yes. Do you see the difference between the cells that are close to the channel versus further down if you're changing the right now? I didn't see in the video, it's like because you think that you can see the difference. So, like in the induction, well, sort of the speed of induction, for instance. Well, sort of the speed of induction, for instance, we don't see a clear difference though. So there are traits where most machines have like position, clear position biases or effects, like growth rate, for instance, I guess would be something where if you look at steady-state growth rate, depending on the precise detail of how you do it, you can have pretty clear differences. But here, like, I will go into this slide in detail soon, and we have no effect for that. Yes, so to give a quantitative look to this kind of a To give a quantitative look to this kind of experiment, we use this image analysis software mobile. And this is a kind of plot that we produce if we analyze one of these gross channels. So you see each cell cycle as a colored line. Here, bottom panel is a length on the semi-log scale, and top panel is like the GFD fluorescence for the corresponding cells. For the corresponding cells. And of course, I'll go to the stochastic aspect of the response, but I think it's already important to highlight that there are several features which are really essentially deterministic. So the first one is that when we switch to lactose for the first time, every cell stop growing. So here you have four, but that's true for our entire data set. The third one, deterministic aspect. Close to deterministic aspect is that a cell restarts growing at the same time Start growing at the same time, like the GFP becomes detectable. And the third thing which caught our attention is that the expression stops extremely rapidly in all cells with very similar dynamics. So this brings me to really what is the key stochastic feature of the response, which is like what Andreas asked about, how much time every cell spends before inducing its like operant. Spend before inducing its lag opponent, what we call the induction lag. And to our great surprise, when we look at this distribution of these induction lags over like 10 experiments, 1500 cells, we see that it's very clearly bimodal. So we have a third of the population that is responding fast in 20 to 50 minutes, and the other two-thirds that spend between one and three hours until it switches on the lag operator. Switches on the lag operand. So very surprising to make a new observation like so clear on a system like the lag operand and of course we first try to find a correlate that would estimate, yes? How exactly do you define the lag time here? So I define the lag time here in a very heuristic manner as a time it takes. I define it based on the GFP in this case, but we can also, well, we have played several games. So here it's defined on GFP as a time. It's defined on GFP as a time you need to increase your fluorescence sort of twice above the background by 200 GFP molecules. And 200 happens to like sort of your fluctuation when you are in the repressed state are plus minus 50 something like that. So the 200 is sort of two sigma away. Yes? That's the maturation time of GFP in this case? Is it less than this very case I don't know but the same GFP in the same cell has been measured at like f sev five f five between five and seven minutes alpha life. Between five and seven minutes, alpha life, alpha maturation time. So you can see that extremely clearly here, I think. Oops, sorry, wrong direction. Yes. So when you switch back to blue cores, if we look at the delay before the fluorescence starts decreasing due to bleaching, these distributions of delays is exactly the Gaussian you expect from the measurement of maturation time. So yes, so it's my Yes, so it's my model, and we would like to know if there is any sort of physiological trait that can predict whether a cell will have a short or a long life. And so we tried several. Cell cycle was a strong candidate. You can take cell cycle progression or added length if you believe in the other model to describe the cell cycle. Initial fluorescence, so initial laxity quantity, we also were interested. also were interested or growth rate and as you can see none of these was able to or is able to predict whether a cell will have a short or a long life so at this point I think maybe I will give a very quick refresher on the lag operant for those of you maybe maybe it's not even a refresher I don't know so the lag operant uh is a small genetic circuit uh which is uh uh uh repressed by a dedicated transcription factor which is called lag I Is called Lag I. It's a set of three genes. And when lactose is present, lag I is itself inhibited by a lactose derivative called allolactose, which leads to the expression of the lag operant genes and forms a positive feedback loop. So because we could not find physiological variable linked to the Linked to the type of lag, we set out to distinguish between two possible explanations. One would be that the short and long lags are purely set by the state of the lac operant at the time of the switch, and the other would be that it's a much more general difference in the state of the cell, for instance, I don't know, a translational capacity or something like that. And so, to do that, we pair to systematically. That we perturb systematically the expression in the repressed state by perturbing the quantity of black eye in the repressed state. So we can increase slightly the basal expression by using tiny amounts of artificial inducer IPTG. And you see that when we do that, of course it's low enough that the lag operant is still off, right? But now when we switch to lactose, it's not one-third but two-thirds of the cell that will have a short lag. Cell that will have a short life. And conversely, we can reduce the basal expression by overexpressing lag eye from a plasmid, and now all cells have long lag. Yes. So from that, we conclude that, well, it's entirely set, well, it's a property of the lacopern whether cells will have a short or long lag, and that there must be a threshold in your quantity of lag protein at the switch. Your quantity of lag protein at the switch that will make you have a short or a long life. And of course, we would be interested in knowing this threshold. So you're saying that it depends on the number of Lag I? I'm saying that it depends on the number of Lag proteins, well, not necessarily Lag I, actually probably others, right? Because when we change the number of Lag I, we also change the probability of birth in the repressed state, and we think what matters is really the quantity of effectors, because Lag I is not meant to. Because lag I is not meant to sense the lactose itself, right? So I'm saying that it's probably the quantity of lag z and lag y that matters. It's very important to point out that we cannot see up to, let's say, 50-80 like molecules, right? Yes, so this is what is in this tiny panel here. If you look at the laggy GFP fluorescence, maybe this is mislabeled. This is the fluorescence in the GFP channel, and it's actually a mixture of auto fluorescence. Channel and it's actually a mixture of autofluorescence of the cell and lag D GFP fluorescence. And this autofluorescence is sizable. It's on the order of a few dozens GFP molecule. Yes? If it's correlated with the amount of black eye, wouldn't you expect there to be some correlation with physiological state, for instance, the size of the cell? Since as the cell divides, the amount of black eye divides? So the exact same thing. So well, that's an interesting point. We don't have a clear model for. Actually we don't have a clear model for how the we use it under the assumption that Leica is somehow a constant concentration. Because essentially nobody knows. At least that's my take. If someone has information on that, it's almost understand the question. So as a cell by its width like I beat out, it's quite additional. Well it just is a steady state, right? The concentration might change it. No, it hasn't corrected that. It's also being produced calling it. That that's how homeostay is all from the initial. Wait a second. How's it being produced if you're just adding in if it's the initial pre-existing amount? Where is it produced from? The Lechey is the regressor that is there at a cost in concentration. Yeah, yeah. And we have time training the level at which it is. Exactly. So we are messing up with the steady state. Yeah, so normally there are 40 molecules per second. Notably, there are 40 molecules, but there are 30. Alright, so as Eric pointed, we cannot measure this quantity of lag protein. So now when I say lag protein, I mean lag Z or lag Y. And because of this autofluorescence problem. And so the trick I used was to do a series of experiments. Do a series of experiments where I systematically modified the quantity of flak protein remaining by exposing the cells to two consecutive switches, right? So I prepare them by growing them in lactose and then I switch them to glucose to de-use their lact protein for variable amount of time. So when it's a short period you will have a lot of lact protein remaining and here you will be back in the regime of a steady state. And now I can ask Uh now I can ask uh uh what whether you have a short or long lag uh at the second switch uh uh uh depending on the expected or on the measured uh number of remaining lag proteins. So this is what you see on this plot. When the dilution is short, you inherit a large number of lag protein and every cell will have a short lag. And actually as long as you inherit 10 lag protein or more, so a fairly small number, So fairly small number, every cell will have a short lag and it's only when you go down to having on the order of one molecule that you relax to the fraction that we see in naive cells that have never seen lactose before. So from this we conclude that this threshold is extremely low on the order of one, one protein. And how do you determine that number of inherited LAG? Making many crude assumptions. So for every cell I see switching So for every cell I see switching at the second switch, I track back its ancestor at the end of the first lactose period. Here we have a fairly good estimate of the LagZ numbers and I know how many divisions happen in between and I assume node gradation equal partitioning and that works relatively well. Yes. So altogether this is a All together, this is a painting, the following picture, where the cell with short lag corresponds to cell in which there are all. So again, when you are in the glucose, growing in glucose, there is a very weak stochastic expression of the lag operant. So there will be some molecules around and some proteins around. And cells with short LAC corresponds to cells which already have at least one Lag D and one L G Which already have at least one lakh z and one lakh y when the switch takes place, and can immediately kickstart their positive feedback. And to the contrary, there are another subpopulation of cells that we call sensorless, and they will have long lags, and they are essentially waiting for the next burst of lag expression as if there was no lactose around. So we can call this a single molecule trigger. There is a very similar dynamic that has been reported for a sense. Similar dynamics that have been reported for a sensing of mutation by the lab of John Parlsen for the Ada protein. And here we report something similar for environmental sensing, environmental signals. So before moving to this cross-couples and the TVT per se, I want to make two more comments on these sensorless cell populations. The first is that the sensorless cells are really waiting for some. Sensible cells are really waiting for something to happen. It's a rare events tile signal, but waiting for something to happen. I mean, I would expect the tail to be much longer, right? It is to be exponential. Yes, me too. So I can give you the, well, I didn't want to enter this territory, but because the question is coming, actually I've also shown, well, I can show you offline if you want, that cells are talking to each other. And so as soon as a cell is induced, it's capable of inducing its. It's capable of inducing its neighbors. So, what matters is actually the first passage time to inducing, well, is the time to inducing the first cell in a given channel, and then you can only wait so much longer for every other cell in the channel. And if you take that into account, now things start to add. And that becomes payable, right, statistics. That becomes payable statistics. Well, you ask, Eric. No, I mean we do not have enough data points to be able to. Okay, that's the really clear. But have you seen that uh it's sort of as faster than exponential people tail? It's probably like the raw data, and you've got easy if you can figure five holes with so you're it's it's it's almost like you have the first cell to you have many And you need one to to spark off and then it and it starts telling its neighbors to to um yes, indeed. So there's some time, right? It's not instantaneous once the first one starts then. So that makes the statistical. And you can almost see that by eye already in the first movie. Uh I can show you later if you want, but it's very striking that actually once the first cell has induced The first cell has induced, every other cell will induce relatively quick. So you never have a gross channel where two cells are induced and the other are waiting forever. But we looked at the correlation, try to stratify by position or by generalogy, and actually we realized that position is, well, you get both signals, sorry, but you get position for sure as well. So you need the first first passage time. You mean the first first passage time in the entire system or in the given channel? system or in the given channel? All the cells in the channel are coupled with them. Yes. First and then channel party. Alright. Yes, so we wonder whether it matters to have this sensorless subpopulation, matters in terms of does it affect your overall population life. And for the kind of parameters we have we see that a population will where also Where all cells are switching fast, will have a population lag that is sort of one division time shorter than a population where all cells are slow, right? So it's a pretty sizable difference. And we also checked using population dioxy experiments that this sensorless subpopulation seems to be also present not only in lab strain but also in natural isolates. Also, industrial isolate. So it seems to be a fairly generic feature of the lacoperman. And then also, of course, it's interesting to study the lacopurn, but you like to use it as a model system to learn something more general. And so, well, is it something specific of the LACOBURN or can it be a property of other sensing systems of E. coli to have these sensorless subpopulations? So we don't have a single cell data for other Single cell data for older systems, but recently there has been very precise quantitative protonics data becoming available. And of course it's giving you bulk measurement, but if you can live with the assumption that for low-express protein distribution of copy numbers can be close to Poisson, then the fraction of cells which have no protein, the sensorless cells, is set by your average number. Your average number. And for instance, to have 5% of your population being sensorless, your average will be 3. And so if your average is below 3, more than 5% will be sensorless. So I focused on two component systems because they are well annotated and we know which one is a sensor. And fortunately, nine of those systems have been quantified in the study I was mentioning. The study I was mentioning. And there are, so each line here corresponds to the distribution of expression level in many different conditions, 28, I'm right. And so you see that roughly half of these two component systems are expressed in several conditions at levels where a sizable fraction of the population will be sensorless. So we take that as evidence that several sensorless That several sensing systems will actually function in a regime where the response is stochastic due to the low level of expression, which I find a very surprising observation. All right. So this brings me to an intermediate summary. I've shown that the distribution of induction lags from glucose to lactose is bimodal. We believe, or we have demonstrated, that this is going. Demonstrated that this is governed by the single molecule trigger, which means that it depends on whether there are zero lag protein or more at the time of the switch, and that this time of single molecule triggers seem to be expected in many different sensing systems in E. coli. And so now I want to move on to this gross couple sensitivity business. So I've put a lot of emphasis on the fact that the sensitivity threshold On the fact that the sensitivity threshold for lactols is enough to have one lact protein. Actually, for a long while, it was a very surprising observation and conclusion for us, because a very well-established paper in the field has demonstrated that the threshold has a large value, which indicates that hundreds of permanent molecules or lakhoi are necessary to switch the phenotype. And they were using a very similar approach, using also this type of memory. Using also this type of memory experiments. So, in fact, there are several differences between these two assays. First, they use an artificial inducer, which is TMG, and it's not comparable to lactose in terms of induction strength. Lactose is metabolized, but also we realized that when you use an artificial inducer like TMG, what you do is that you grow your cell on a given nutrient source and you put them in a steady state. Source and you put them in a steady state of growth, also because you like that for your bonding assumptions. And then at some point, you give them an inducer. What we do is that we actually switch them from one tree into the next, and the next one happens to be also the inducer. And as we have seen, there there is a transient growth arrest. And that made us wonder how important this growth arrest would be for the dynamics. So we started with a simple model of the Of the lag meduction to see the effect of dilution by growth. So we modified a phenomenological model which has only two variables, the intracellular concentration of inducer, X, and the quantity of lag protein, in this case of permease, Y. So X dot is simply an import term. An import term, so the quantity of permease times the external concentration. And here we stick in this dilution by growth and decay due to dilution and degradation. And similarly, for the permease, we have a basal expression rate with some repression term and again dilution by growth. And when you solve the model asking what is the critical concentration at which our Concentration at which, how the critical concentration at which the system will switch from off to on depends on growth rate, you see that you obtain this dimensionless quantity where you have a lambda squared in the denominator. So you can see that clearly if you draw induction plot curves, for instance. So with the you this curves just show you how you switch from off to on and when the off to on and when the uh doubling time is uh sh uh is short um uh you have a certain critical concentration and you see that this changes dramatically when the doubling time is increased. You can see it more synthetically in this phase diagram where you get induction from off state to on state as a function of both the inducer level and the growth rate of the cells. And in this large regime, And in this large regime where dilution is faster than degradation, you see that we have a quadratic dependence of the critical inducer level to gross rate. So this is what we call gross couple sensitivity. It simply captures that the intracellular concentration of inducers is set by a balance between import and dilution by growth. So of course we would like to see if it's happening in real life. So for a moment I will forget about microphoidics in single cells. This is very classical population assay based on a minor assay. And so we can measure the induction of the lag operon as a function of artificial inducer TMG. And this is the induction curve you obtain when you grow cells. This is the induction curve you obtain when you grow cells in Glisfor. Oops, I want early one. So, what we will do now is that we can modify the growth rate by changing the nutrients on which the cells are growing and measure against the induction curve for this different growth rate. And so, as you can see, as the growth rate increases, the critical concentration at which the switch occurs is also increasing. And if you now plot this critical And if you now plot this critical concentration, you see that it's decreasing faster than linear. In this case, I have a 2.7 exponent with growth rate, which is a strong confirmation of our modeling result of the importance of growth on the sensitivity of the cells. All right. Right. Can you remove the TMG or delete out the TMG and see whether it transitions at a different condition? Thank you for the swift transition. So that's the next slide. So as I understand your question, at least. So we wondered whether, because this is now all at steady state in DOT, right? But it was motivated by this experiment during transients. And we wondered whether we could also see the effect of dilution during this transient. So now what's difficult if you want to do that is as I is as I mentioned, we cannot really, well we cannot at all compare the inducion strength of these artificial inducers that you can use to be at steady state of growth and lactols, right, which gives you this growth arrest. So we needed a trick where we could have the same inducer strength with the same inducer, but in one case steady growth and in the other a growth arrest. And the trick comes from using another sugar which is called lactulose, which has an interesting property to require Property to require LACY and LACZ for being catabolized, but not or only very weakly inducing the lacopearl. So now if we use that, so yes, so we pick a TMG concentration where no induction happens in visceral, and what we do is that we go back to the MOSO machine and we convert two series of experiments. In the first series of experiments, we want to have sustained growth, so we switch. Growth. So we switch cells from glycerol to glycerol plus the artificial inducer. In the second series of experiments, we want to recapitulate the growth arrest, but again with the exact same concentration of inducer, right? So the TMG here will be the same in power. And so we switch from glycerol to lactal loss plus TMG. And this is what we observe. So the first panel shows you the instantaneous growth rate. The dotted line is at the switch and at the end of the experiment. switch and at the end of the experiment is a solid line so you see that you have no gross arresting glycerol as expected and cells do not induce their lacopearl. In contrast when you use laculos you see that the cells transiently stop growth and then restarts growing very slowly because you give them only very few TMG to induce their lacopurn and to eat their food. Uh and then you see that the vast majority of the cell have induced their lacopurn at the end of the experiment. induce the Lachoper at the end of the experiment. So this is allowing us to show that this effect of gross couple sensitivity also matters to describe transient dynamics of induction. Okay. Are the x-axis different between the top and the bottom one for the left panel? No. This is a gross rate in this role point five in the MOSA machine. Is that your question? Yeah, that's that's what I'm asking. Why are the dashed lines not the same? Two lines not the same then in the top. And the bottom line. Well, that's the whole point of the experiment. Here, they are always seeing lithium. So they grow at the same speed. Oh, no, no. I mean the dashed line at the top compared to the dashed line at the bottom. Are you talking of this one and this one? Yes. Yes, okay. Yeah, those prior to at zero hours, they should have all been in the same one. So do you want to do, well, I guess you're surprised of. Well I well I guess you're surprised of the fact that it goes to zero here. Or are you surprised by the fact that it is at zero five? They're the same at the top and they're different at the bottom. What I'm asking is if they're if the top spawn and the bottom one both in glycerol at zero hours. It's right after the switch. Ah yeah sorry. Before the switch they would be the same. So it's before the switch they're the same. Right after the switch they're going to gross per rest in the bottom and not in the problem. So they're resting immediately at zero hours? I mean. Exactly. Zero plus hours. Exactly. Okay. All right, so in the last two minutes, I want to maybe extend a bit. So those are, well, of course, you expect this effect of this impact of growth, which is, I mean, really, what this gross couple sensitivity means is that the means is that the response of your gene surprise will not only be a function of the strength of the inducing signal, sorry, but also of how fast the cell grow. And we expect this to be a general effect. So we started wondering what is the simplest system where you can see that. And in fact, if you think of an autoactivity activating transcription factor and you model it taking growth Model it taking growth explicitly, it's well very intuitive, but remarkable that you can already have this kind of bi-stable dynamics where the doubling time will critically impact the expression level and make the system switch from being induced to induced. And you can complexify that to many types actually of gene circuits with positive feedback. So, this is again the Back. So, this is again the case of two component systems, which I hope the cartoon makes clear: is we somehow complexified version of this auto-activating transcription factor. And here as well, the phase diagram shows you that you will eventually switch on provided that you grow slow enough. So, we have considered So we have considered several specific architectures, in particular competence and sporadicizing in vacillus subsilis as well. Another interesting candidate, also less well described, would be virulence in salmonella ephemerid. So we are excited about it because it's a very simple passive mechanism that gives you nice properties for free. One nice property is that as soon as the condition becomes being adverse and the cell grows slower, there will be Slower, they will become more sensitive to environmental signals, which is something that's potentially advantageous. The other passive or implication is that we all know that cells, even isogenic, even in the same environment, can be growing at very different state, at very different rates. And so, if you take gross carbon sensitivity into account now, this tells you. Sensitivity into account now, this tells you that those cells will be have different sensitivity to signal. And if this signal is homorphogen, for instance, you can imagine that this will eventually lead to differentiation, simply based on this difference of growth rate. Alright, so this is a summary. Again, I've shown that the distribution of flag induction lag by lactors is bimodal and is governed by the single molecular trigger. I've explained you why we believe that the lack operant induction is governed not only by the strength of the induction signal but also by gross rate and this is what we call gross coupled sensitivity and finally I elaborated on why we think it's a general mechanism with several implications or implications on different systems. So I did most experiments in this world I did most experiments in this world. Modeling is done by Eric and well, data analysis we did together. Several other people have been involved. Diana Blanc in particular has done the biochemistry experiment for the gross coupled sensitivity. Matthias and Athos have helped with different aspects of the microphone and data analysis. And Florian Juk in the lab of G. Meyers in Dresden has developed a MOMA, the image analysis software. Major D software. Thank you for that. Yes, sure. So question about the long lag and the second mode of the distribution. So I guess you know affinity's concentration. So can you estimate what the typical time there is? What the typical mean lag time is? Typical mean lag time is in the second peak. Because that corresponds, so there you just have to wait till I guess. So what determines actually the mean of that second peak? You are asking in terms of like biochemical biomolecular dynamics. Well, okay, I've not tried to model that say phenomenologically with with all Phenomenologically with all interaction constants. At some point, I've been trying to take malleable data from single molecule experiments to rather model the burst dynamics in the repressed state. So when you are in your steady state in blue cost before, and see what parameters would give me a fraction of cells with zero and more than zero that would match that, and also now what kind of distribution of flags. What kind of distribution of flags I would expect, and that was actually pointing exactly to Idyas' comment that then you get a nice exponential pay for the signal thing. But I think I'm not replying to your question. Your question is not determined just by the dissociation of the luck repressor, that you just have to wait till the lap repressor dissociates. But then you also have to wait until you recruit semi-7G, right? It's not necessarily waiting there. Yeah, so you have to wait for recruiting of polymer raise. Sorry? You have to wait for gene arrays. Sorry? You have to wait for gene expression, right? That that is that waiting time, is that limited or is that determined predominantly by the time it takes for the Lacquer pressure to dissociate from the promoter? I don't know, because it's how long it takes to come back, and you need sigma 70 to come before the Lacquer processor comes back. I I haven't I mean, we haven't modeled it, but I have the feeling that that's the crucial thing, right? It will come off, but if there is lots of lac I in the cell Lots of lac I in the cell, it will rebind before any sigma 70 will make. Yeah, so the competition between the lag repressive dissociation rebinding versus the sigma i. This is why we see if we if we titrate a bit the lag i am out, we make the concentration a bit less, and they become more fast. Because now
