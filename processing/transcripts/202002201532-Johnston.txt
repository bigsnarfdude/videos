Just give me the heads up now. There are no equations in this talk. No. So some of you may be running to the hills as we speak. I don't know. But I think, despite that, I think this fits in well with this meeting. So throughout my career, I've been interested in how different kinds of neurons are made. We estimate that there's tens, maybe even hundreds of thousands of different kinds. Maybe even hundreds of thousands of different kinds of neurons in our nervous systems. And when we think about how different cells are produced, we, you know, might looked at something like this, right? Everybody is familiar with the wide landscape. And the way we as developmental biologists think about this, normally, is that you have some kind of signaling that's going to push this ball down one path, or you're going to have some lineage history or division history that's going to push it down another path. Another path. But as everyone in this audience, and I'm grateful I don't have to convince people that this is actually important, there are times when these decisions are made at random. And there's a lot of big questions that we ask concerning these kind of mechanisms. And the first question is, well, just simply, what are the molecular mechanisms? How does gene regulation respond in a stochastic way? The other thing is, where are the sources of variability? Where are the sources of variability? And kind of more importantly, even where are the sources that actually matter? You know, is it during transcription that it matters, or translation, etc. And one of the biggest things is that we really don't know in multicellular organisms how these things work, in particular. And especially in actual developing tissue in an organism. So, to study this question, we turn to the fruit fly eye. And you may be looking at And you may be looking at the side and think, okay, I don't see any stochasticity there whatsoever. It looks very regular. You're probably familiar with this from popular culture. You know, you have these series of 800 amatidia or unit eyes. But interestingly, there's two main types of these unit eyes. And they're defined by the expression of light-detecting rhodopsin proteins in the R7 photoreceptor, such that one subtype expresses rhodopsin 3 here, labeled in blue. Rhodopsin 3 here, labeled in blue, and the other expresses Rhodopsin 4 here labeled in red. And the amazing thing about this is that this is a random pattern. At least it's amazing to me because as a developmental biologist, you know, in development, we're almost always thinking about how do we get the same thing every time. You know, if you look at your hands, they're pretty much identical. Yeah. Sorry, I vaguely remember that each method is like six or seven or eight or something like this or something. Which ones are we talking about? So which ones are talking about? Which of those are yeah, so so basically for each omatidia each unit eye there's eight photoreceptors and this is number seven of those eight. These are the ones in the center. Number one through six are on the outside. They seem to be very stereotypical. They're the same Rhodopson expression pattern every time. The R7s had this random self-weight decision, and the R8s are actually linked. And the R8s are actually linked via some unknown signaling mechanism to get their fate dependent on R7 fate. So this is the one that measures colorization or? So this is, this is, so these are UV detectors. The neighboring R8 cells are blue-green detectors. And what we've shown is, I'm not going to talk about today, but what we've shown is when we change this ratio of different cell types, we can actually change the fly's innate color preference. So we think of it as a, this, this. We think of it as a, this, this dochasticity is just a kind of cheap way to disperse cell types across a tissue. All right. By the way, keep the questions coming. You know, especially, I know there's probably a lot of clarification questions along the way. Please don't be shy. All right, so what do we know? What controls this decision between these blue and red cells? Well, there seems to be a key transcriptional regulator called spineless, and throughout my talk, I'll abbreviate it. And throughout my talk, I'll abbreviate it as SS. And this spinal transcription factor is expressed in an on-off manner, such that about two-thirds of the cells express spinalus here in green, and about one-third do not. And the relationship between spinalus and these red and blue cells is that in cells that do not express spinalus, you get red option three. In cells that express spinalus, you get red option four. So we knew a lot of this for a long time. There's actually a pretty complicated network downstream. Pretty complicated network downstream of spineless, but today what I'm focused on is truly the regulation of spineless because this is the kind of key step. So today, what I'm going to share with you are more or less two stories. It's going to be mostly focused on the first story, which is very close to being done. All my stuff today is unpublished. We're just kind of waiting on one last experiment. And then the second part is newer stuff that I'd really love to get your feedback on. So in the first part, Your feedback up. So, in the first part, I'm going to tell you about this two-step mechanism involving transcription and chromatin regulation that controls this decision to either be a spineless on or a spinus off-cell. And then in the second part, what I'm going to tell you about are kind of our first steps into looking at how transcriptional noise plays a role in this process. So, this work, the first story is mostly by talented. Talented grad students, Katie Anderson, and Luke Gortman, working together. The second story is by Liz Urban. They've also been helped out by a technician, Minnie Yan, and a former postdoc, Alexander Newhouse-Philippe. So to get at this state of neurons, we have to take a step back. So, what I've been showing you are pictures of the fly eye in this adult stage. But it appears that the timing of this is a lot earlier. We have to go way back if you. Go way back. If you didn't clean out your trash can properly, you may have seen maggots in there. So we have to go back to this kind of maggot or larval stage and take a look at the developing eye at this point. So this is a schematic of what's called the eye antennal disc. And what you can see here is that this circular part is the antenna part, and this kind of big part is the eye part. The eye part. And what's nice about this is spinalis is expressed all the time in the antenna. So it acts as a nice positive control for continuous expression. Now, of course, the expression in the eye is a lot more complicated. And it acts in a wave of development. And so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to box off a series of cells. And it's going to look like these cells might be moving, but in fact, they're going through different states. Okay? So if we look at this box, what we see is that at some point, Is that at some point during their development, every single cell will express spineless. And as time moves on, these cells then turn off spineless in what we call the differentiating cells. And then finally, they make a decision to be on or off in the terminal cells, which will last for the lifetime of the organism. And so when we image this, what we see is the following. What we see is the following. There we go. So, what you're looking at is what kind of we use technology that Brian introduced very beautifully this morning, and we use what's called nascent in situ phish. So, as part of this, we're labeling the introns. So, what you're seeing is a single dot per cell, and this represents the expression state within that cell. One thing that's complicating towards this whole thing is that in somatic tissues, fly chromosome. Somatic tissues, fly chromosomes pair, and so this is they pair so tightly that this is below the diffraction limit. So we just say that from this joint locus or whatever, we'll see expression or not. So all right, so just I just want to clarify this one more time because it's important for the rest of the talk. I'll be showing a lot of pictures like this, and I just want to be clear that, you know, though this is spatial information, we really think of it as representing time points. So these are cells that are undifferentiated, these are cells that are now in the precursor state. Are now in the precursor state, these are cells that are differentiating, and finally, these are cells that have made that final choice to be either on or off. What's the time scale as it moves across? So it's about 24 hours. Yes, 24 hours from initial expression to terminal decision. Yeah. All right. And so one other point before we start to get into some real data is the expression of spinos. So I said, okay, these cells express spinos or not, and indeed, the antenna expressed. Or not. And indeed, the antenna expresses both spinal RNA and protein. Interestingly, the precursors express RNA only. And it's hard to say that they don't express any protein. It's hard to prove that there's not even a couple molecules there. But at least as far as we can tell, we detect no protein. And what we've done is we've knocked out the obligate heterodimer protein, and we see no effect on the expression in this early state. Finally, these terminal cells express. Cells express again both RNA and protein. And again, I'm just going to loop back here that this expression of RNA, if it's going to play a role, what I will hopefully convince you of today is that the actual act of transcription seems to be important for the regulation of this gene. So, you know, we work on gene regulation during development. So, of course, we just started with a simple question: what DNA elements control spinalx expression? And to get at this, And to get at this, it's a bit more challenging. This gene is a little bit bigger than some of the genes that you guys have been talking about in E. coli. So, this gene is about 60 Kb, and it's extremely complex. I'm just going to share some of the elements today with you. But what we did is we used CRISPR to basically do what we would call like a reverse promoter bashing approach, where we knocked out elements looking for the requirement of those elements for expression. Elements for expression. And interestingly, we found three key elements. So, one other thing I want to note is that just due to technical reasons, when I show adult expression of spineless, we've shown that there's 100% correlation between spineless and these red rhodopsin IV cells. So during my talk, I'll show this rhodopsin 3,4 stain as a proxy for looking at spinelus. So this is our wild-type retina. In each of these cases, we see a complete loss or a near-complete loss of spineless in these R7 photoreceptors. R7 photoreceptors. And so, for some of these, it's pretty obvious. In the promoter, okay, that's not shocking. But then, these two other elements, we were curious about what these elements could be doing. So, we took these DNA elements and we hooked them up to reporters. And what we saw was that this upstream element drove expression in all photoreceptors early in development. And then this late enhancer drove expression specifically in R7 photoreceptors late in development. Late in development. Okay, so we have two enhancers: an early enhancer and a late enhancer. And we've shown that these DNA elements can do this job, they can drive expression, but what are they doing during this process? So to get at this, we wanted to tease apart the different kind of temporal expression of spineless. And for this part, what I'm going to show you is the antenna here I'll keep as a control for all these experiments here in the corner. I'll show this wave in these R7 precursors here. Seven precursors here, and then I'll finally show the adult here. Again, keep in mind that red Robson 4 is an indicator of spineless expression. So, the first thing we want to do with this assay is ask a simple question, okay, what happens if we knock out the promoter? Again, we predict that we lose expression in all three of these tissues, and indeed we do. We see no expression in the antenna, no expression in these R7 precursors, and no expression in the terminal R7 cells. We next said, okay, what happens if we knock out? Okay, what happens if we knock out this late enhancer? Our prediction is that we would simply lose expression in the terminal R7 cells. And so we do this experiment. Indeed, what we see is no effect on the antenna, no effect in these early R7 precursors, but we see a complete loss in the terminal R7 cells. So now we thought, okay, well, if this early enhancer is doing anything, perhaps somehow this early enhancer could be required for the late expression. So we made the hypothesis. The late expression. So we made the hypothesis that when we knock out this early enhancer, we would not only lose early expression, but perhaps lose late expression. And so we did this experiment, and indeed this is what we saw. Again, we have a nice positive control for the antenna expression. We see no expression in the R7 precursors, and we see a complete loss in the terminal R7 cells. So, together, what we conclude is from this part is that early expression is required for late expression. And now we wanted to kind of get into a little bit more of this mechanism and particularly look at the frequency of this spinalist gene turning off. Because what I've shown you so far is pretty absolute, right? We knock out this enhancer, we completely lose expression. So the next thing we wondered is, well, can we tune this early expression? Can we kind of turn it down or turn it up and then affect the late on-off ratio? So the simple hypothesis is if we kind of turn down early expressions. If we kind of turn down early expression, we're going to also decrease the frequency of spinalis turning on in the late terminal R7 cells. So, again, what I'm going to show you here is the R7 precursor cells in wild type and the terminal spinalis in the adult. And what we did is we looked at a cis regulatory LN mutation. This is a single base insertion in that 60 kV gene. And as you can see, this lowers expression in these R-7 precursors. Lowers expression in these R7 precursors and it also lowers expression in the terminal R7 cells. We also mutated a trans factor called ASH2. It's a chromatin regulator. And we see a similar effect where we dim expression early and we lower the frequency of spineless in the late phase. So, alright, so hopefully, I've convinced you that we can kind of tune this down. We next wanted to see if we now turn it up, can we also increase? And up, can we also increase the rate of expression late? So, to get at this, we turned to, we had identified a key repressor called CLU or Clumphus. And in this mutant, if we either knock it down or have a mutant in it, we would expect to see de-repression of spineless. And this is indeed what we see. This is a little bit complicated, so I'll just walk through it slowly. These are called mutant clones. What you're looking at here in purple is wild-type tissue, and in non- Tissue and in non-purple is the mutant. And what you can see is expansion of this early wave temporally later into development. So we've now tuned this up, we've increased the duration of this early expression, and what we see is we can now tune up or increase the on-off ratio late in development. So, what I've shown you so far is that there seems to be this relationship. This early expression somehow dictates the on. Dictates the on-off ratio late. But, you know, it's biology, it's a lot more complicated than that. So I have to go back to one of these earlier reporters to remind you of something. So there we go. So we go back to this late reporter, and what I quickly mentioned, you may not have noted, is that this late reporter is expressed in all R7 photoreceptors. So if we look at a different time point, it's pretty dramatic, right? This is endogenous. It's pretty dramatic, right? This is endogenous, spineless, it's expressed in a subset, whereas the reporter is expressed in all the cells. So we must be missing, you know, a repression step somewhere. So we wanted to get at this, and activation is kind of easier to test for, right? You can hook up an enhancer or promoter to a trans sheet and look for expression. But repression is a bit more challenging. So we had to kind of come up with a different strategy. And what we did is we developed what we call a repression reporter. A repression reporter. And we really want to test this in the endogenous locus. So, what we did is we went back to our spineless locus and we created a reporter in which there is a general eye enhancer driving GFP. And we said, what happens if we put this into the spineless locus? What we know in control experiments is that this GFP is expressed in all the eye cells. And we thought that if repression was important within the locus, if that we Within the locus, if we now put this transgene in the locus, that it, oops, if there's no repression, it would be expressed in all the cells. But if repression was important, then we'd see it in a random subset of these cells. So we did this experiment. And I'll tell you what we saw. So in our control, again, we're looking at spinalis-on cells in red, spinalous off cells in blue. And in our control conditions, this reporter is expressed in all photoreceptors, not just R7s. Photoreceptors, not just R7s, but all eight photoreceptors within these amatidia. What happens in our repression reporter? Well, again, we have our spineless on cells in red, our spinus off cells in blue, and in this case, it gets repressed all the way down only into those spineless-on R7 cells. Suggesting that repression at this locus is key for this stochastic fake choice, is that, you know, that the whole, that this locus is turning off expression. Locust is turning off expression in these cells. And so, you know, okay, maybe this is some kind of fluke. You only try one position. So we actually tried, we use CRISPR and we put this into four different positions. So we put one kind of in the 5' UTR, the 3' UTR, this intron, and we took out a whole chunk of the gene. And in all four of these conditions, we saw the same result. And so together, what this suggests is that, you know, repression limits finally. You know, repression limits spineless to a subset of our seven cells, and this repression affects the entire locus. Okay, so together, this pointed us towards chromatin. And we said, okay, we started this whole story by saying there's some kind of activation, you know, that's important for this, and now I'm saying that there's some kind of repression important. How can we tie all these things together? And so, you know, it's probably pretty obvious at this point that this tissue is very heterogeneous. That this tissue is very heterogeneous. There's a lot of different cell types, a lot of different developmental time points. And so, doing assays like ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq are not really possible. So, what we did was we had to develop a new technique to look at chromatin kind of on the single cell level. And so, to get at this, oh, so here's the challenges: we have this heterogeneous tissue, and we want to have cell type specificity. So, what we did is we said, okay, how So, what we did is we said, okay, how can we assay kind of chromatin in a kind of a broad sense? And we thought, okay, well, we know that heterochromatin is usually more compact, euchromatin is more open. How can we develop an assay for that? So now we turned to, again, this oligo-based and situ approach, but in this case, we did DNA fish. And what we did is we labeled the Smilus locus itself in green, upstream in blue, and downstream in red. And we said, okay, what is And we said, okay, what is happening in these cells as they're going through these different expression states? So, again, these are a couple examples. Sorry, the blue is a little hard to see, but we can see that in the spineless off cells, it's a bit more compact. And in example spineless on cells, it's more open. And what we simply do is we identify the central peak of fluorescence intensity. And this is just a model. And from that, we kind of say, okay, can we calculate the Kind of say, okay, can we calculate the compaction rate in those subset of cells? So, okay, what happened? So, I've shown you already or convinced you that spineless expression is very dynamic. What about the chromatin state? So, this is just a reminder. We have our antenna disc here that always expresses spineless. We have the undifferentiated part that does not. We have the R7 cells, R7 precursors that express spineless, the differentiating cells that do not, and then finally the terminal. That do not, and then finally, terminal cells that are either on or off. And so we said, okay, you know, let's take a look at all these different cell types. So the first thing we did is we act, there's a cell type that's not labeled here called the peripillo membrane. This actually ensheaths this tissue, so this acts as another control, and spinals is not expressing these cells, and this kind of gives us a baseline or an off-control for compaction rate. We then go to the antenna, and what we see is we can now see a We see is we can now see a difference in the compaction at this locus between off cells and on cells in our controls. So, okay, that was pretty easy. These are pretty consistent cell types. What happens in the eye? So, in the undifferentiated, kind of see what we expect. Spinose is off and the chromatin is compact. What happens in those R7 precursors? Okay, spinose is on. The locus is open. Okay, great. This is not too shocking yet. This is not too shocking yet. But what surprised us was that next, as they differentiated, they didn't go down to the compact state. They actually went to some intermediate state. I'll tell you what I think that is in a second. And we did this in different areas of the eye disc to see if it was maintained or changed over time. And it seems to maintain over time. And if we take it all the way out to the terminal cells, which this is marking all our sevens, we see that this intermediate is. sevens we see that this intermediate is maintained. So what we're currently trying to do is what we're currently trying to do is tease apart the on and off cells. And just for technical reasons that's been a real challenge. So where we are right now is with the following hypothesis that basically in the undifferentiated cells spineless is compact. As development moves on, spinos is expressed. Spinos is expressed and the chromatin opens. Spinos then turns off, and there's two main hypothesis here. One is that in general, each of these cells is kind of in a variable chromatin state, or that they kind of immediately snap into an on and off state, and we're just seeing the average of those two. That's the one we favor, but we don't have the data for that yet. And our hypothesis that we're currently testing is that basically these cells, Is that basically these cells in that differentiating state that kind of lock into that chromatin state will then dictate the on and off state later in development. Wouldn't you then expect the width of the distribution you showed to be wider in those last three categories? Yeah, so I totally agree with you. So also we expected maybe a bimodal distribution. Part of the problem is this assay is very noisy and we just don't know. I would love to get more input from everybody in the room. I mean, you know, I'm not putting anybody on the spot, but what we've seen so far is we've done a lot of kind of, you'd say like back of the envelope tests where we're just like, oh, okay, let's take this population, this population, and put them together. And essentially, when we narrow that down, these are all normalized to the percentage, right? We see the same kind of distribution. What we don't know is, is that representative, or is it just that we haven't done enough cells? Or is it just that we haven't done enough cells? Part of the issue here is that we've done this across multiple retina, but there's a lot of technical variability, as you imagine. Sometimes we feel kind of lucky that this actually works. But I guess even if we perturb the tissue, probably the cell, the nuclei distance remains the same. I think ultimately what we're working towards is literally looking at the on and off cells, and you think like, oh, just use a. And you think, like, oh, just use a reporter. It's a little bit more, it's a little non-trivial. What we're actually trying is that method is trying to get those reporters to work. And the other thing we're trying is actually a three-color RNA and C-tube, because the neighboring cells are ubiquitously expressed. So our idea is to use those, sorry, the neighboring genes are ubiquitously expressed. So our idea there is that we can use the RNA signal from the neighboring genes and then look at the spineless expression state with spineless itself. Itself. Alright, so we still have this big question. You know, what is the compaction state? This is kind of like the last frontier of what we're trying to figure out here. But in the meantime, we can ask a couple questions. You know, I've been kind of describing this transcription and compaction thing, right? And in the field, often people think of chromatin determining transcription state. And there's a small minority of people that think the other way. Think the other way. But the relationship between transcription and chromatin is not always obvious. So, this is one thing we thought we could test pretty easily. And so, to get at this, the first thing we did is said, okay, this is what our wild type distribution looks like. You know, what would happen if we knocked out the promoter? Kind of a brute force method. If transcription was important for the chromatin status, then this will change. If transcription was not important, if basically chromatin was doing its own thing, we'd see a similar distribution. Its own thing, we'd see a similar distribution. And in fact, what we see is basically everything goes to the compact state. So, what this argues is that minimally, chromatid opium requires the promoter here. And I would say that it requires transcription, but I'm trying to be conservative. But then for us, the bigger question that we were curious about is what about that early enhancer? So does that earlier enhancer itself open the chromatin? Itself opened the chromatin. And so again, this is our wild type distribution. We now knocked out the early enhancer, and now what we saw is that we see everything go to closed compaction state, except for the antenna, which is our positive control here. And what this really argues is that this transcription from the early enhancer is opening the chromatin, and then the chromatin is locking back in to determine the transcription state later in development. So, what that leaves us is with this two-step model. So, in step one, as I kind of just mentioned, early transcription opens the locus. We think of the spinous locus as a kind of closed, compact state. As time goes on, this early enhancer is going to open the locus in all these R7 precursors, and then it's going to turn off. And we think is happening at this point is somehow, and we don't know the molecular mechanism yet, is that chromatin is going to compact. That chromatin is going to compact in one subset of the cells and not in the other. And as a result, when this latent hancer that wants to be expressed in all the cells turns on, chromatin is either going to prevent it from being expressed, or chromatin is going to be open and allow for expression. So, um, for a long time. I have no idea. Okay, well, I guess we've got about 10 minutes. Okay, oh yeah, you're my person. Oh, yeah. Doing good? You're my person. Oh, yeah. Doing good? All right, great. So, one thing that we think is cool about this is that, you know, across stochastic biology, especially in cell phone specification, there's not a lot of unifying principles. Noisy transcription seems to be one kind of fundamental aspect. I kind of bring this up here with the Com K example that probably most of you are familiar with in the room. And kind of on the opposite extreme is the olfactory system in Mouse that has about 1300 choices. Mouse, it has about 1300 choices, and all we can, you know, probably the clearest mechanistic input there is that we know the chromatin plays a role. And what we think that's kind of nice about this work is that this kind of brings these two things together in metazoans in that both of these things, this pulse of early expression and regulation of chromatin state, are necessary for determining this stochastic cell-fake choice. So, just to wrap up this. Just to wrap up this first part, then I'll briefly go a little bit into the second part. What I've shown here is this two-step mechanism involving transcription and chromatin. The next question, of course, is, well, what are the sources of variability? Because what I've shown you doesn't get us to randomness, right? It would get us either to all on or all off. Meaning that this is compact, it's turned on. Okay, well, it should either stay on or it should. Well, it should either stay on or it should recompact and turn off. So, something must be variable, and we still have not identified that yet, but we think we have some ideas. And what we've looked at first is transcriptional noise. And so, in particular, we're looking at transcription in this early phase of expression. And what we think is going on is that this noisy early expression is ultimately determining the late on-off state within each cell. And so, our hypothesis is that, again, there's some kind of very Is that again, there's some kind of variability in the precursors. This is then remembered through this chromatin decision, and this ultimately determines the on-off decision late in development. And so, kind of in my last couple minutes here, I'll show you our efforts to kind of assess this transcriptional variability. So, again, now we turn back to this oligo-based RNA-fish approach. And what we do is we do nasin and sits against two parts of the gene. Against two parts of the gene. And what we predict here is that across this 30 KB transcript, that a cell that's just starting to initiate will see a red dot. And as it continues to transcribe, this dot will turn yellow because it'll be a combination of the red and green. So Liz in the lab this experiment, and our prediction was that in the antenna where we see consistent expression, we'd see a lot of kind of regular yellow dots, and in our antenna, we Dots and in our antenna, we predicted we don't know what. We were thinking that we'd see a lot of variability. So, Liz did this experiment. What I'm showing you now is the antenna. And if we zoom in, you can see it's fairly consistent. When we then look into the eye, we see something very different. We see kind of all combinations. So, we see cells that are only red starting to transcribe, a little bit of green mixed in, and a whole lot of green. Yep. Slide back. Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. My thing sort of maybe reply to myself. This is not uniform. This seems like there is some clustering here. So this is in the antenna, and I completely agree, but keep in mind that this could be due to just general burstiness of this gene in this particular context. What I'm going to show you in a couple slides is What I'm going to show you in a couple slides is relating the kind of noisiness within the antenna and comparing it to the eye. All right, so hopefully I've convinced you just kind of qualitatively that it seems like the one tissue is more regular and the other tissue is a bit more variable. But of course we want to kind of quantify this. So I kind of don't have to tell this audience that transcription is not always a continuous process. You know, it can be continuous, in which case we kind of expect it to be more of this kind of signal. But in other cases, when it's more bursty, what we might expect to see is that cells that are just initiating will be more red, whereas if this burst is going through, they may be more on the green side until of course the new burst starts where we now get more red signal again. We now get more red signal again. So, to look at this, what we now did is we kind of upped the ante. We now did three-color RNA fish across the three main parts of this gene. What I'm going to call is the 5', the mid, and the 3'. And we said, okay, let's just compare the intensity ratios between these different parts of the gene as they're being transcribed. This is a raw image. Because it's three-color, it's kind of hard to see, so I'll just show you some numbers. We had to develop a MATLAB program. Developed a MATLAB program to identify spots, which to you guys may seem trivial, but in 3D with multiple cell types, it was a bit more challenging than we expected. But this was really great work by Luke Vorben in the lab. And ultimately, at the end, what we're going to do is quantify the total fluorescence intensity per spot. And so we started here, and this is just kind of a sample distribution of the ratio of the red and green. I just want to remind you that these. I just want to remind you that these are, for the most part, intronic probes. So you can get more green than red if things are being spliced out. So there's a lot of biology here. There's transcription and splicing that we're basically assessing in one foul swoop. So if this was kind of our continuous distribution, we'd see something like this. But this is not in all cases. If cells have more initiating, they might have more. More initiating, they might have more 5 to 3 prime ratio. Or if they're more terminating, this may shift the other direction. But in general, if these populations shift, this would suggest a more discontinuous or bursty kind of cell type. So, alright, so what do we see in the actual data? There we go. Alright, so we started by comparing the 5' and the 3'. And in the antenna, we have this kind of distribution here. Distribution here. And then when we look in the R7 precursors, we see a much wider spread. We did this across kind of all the conditions. Here's just showing the overlay of the spreads. Because we had the three color in one image, we then did the 5' to the mid. And again, we see the same thing with this increased noisy distribution. And finally, the mid to the 3', which again we see. Prime, which again we see more noise in the distribution. So, you know, this is great and good. There's obviously variability, and I forget somebody earlier today mentioned that they hate the word noise. Yeah, because this doesn't necessarily indicate there's more noise, it just indicates there's more variability. And one source of that variability could just be developmental time. That variability could just be developmental timing. Because keep in mind, if we again zoom in on these cells, over time, they're in different transcriptional states by definition. Okay. So in a given cell here, if we focus in on these two cells, this cell has just turned on expression, whereas this cell is further along in expressing the spinalist gene. So maybe the variability is just due to that, right? Some cells are turning on and some cells are turning off developmentally. But because this is occurring nicely across the This is occurring nicely across this tissue, we can actually relate it kind of to the placement within the tissue. And so now I've been showing you the images kind of up and down. This is now turned 90 degrees. But basically, in this particular image, the posterior here, the oldest cells would be down here. The youngest cells would be up here. And if we can ID those dots, and our simple prediction is that if we draw a line straight through the middle of that. If we draw a line straight through the middle of that distribution, that we should see a relationship that looks like this. Basically, a linear relationship if you kind of took it all the way from one side to the other. We just haven't figured out a way to automatically identify the youngest to the oldest cells. Alternatively, if this was a truly kind of noisy process, what you'd predict is kind of a random distribution across that space. Can you say briefly the previous slide? So sorry, why is it a V on its side, right? Sorry, why is it a V on its side rather than just a line? Yeah, because here's where the line that would break the, they would go straight down the wave would be, except that we just measured the distance from that line. We didn't measure the anterior to posterior. We didn't give it directionality. So if you think about it, this should, like if we did that, this would be flipped over here. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So what did we see? Alright, so what did we see? This is just showing you kind of one part of the spineless gene, but at least in our preliminary experiments, what we see is kind of this noisy distribution across the space, at least initially suggesting that indeed this is noisy expression and it's not just due to developmental timing. So, can we sign off? Okay. So, I have one more experiment to show you guys. So, what I've shown you here is that we have these R7 precursors. What I've shown you here is that we have these R7 precursors. We've kind of have our initial measurements of transcriptional variability, and it appears that spinal expression is noisy in those R7 precursors. But there's a lot that goes into transcription. You know, there's initiation, elongation, et cetera, et cetera. What part of transcription is actually the noisy part here? And so to get at this, we turn to a different technique. And this also Brian introduced this morning, the MS2. Brian introduced this morning the MS2 MCP system. So, very briefly, you can put in hairpin sequences. We did this into our spinus locus, and you have the MCP M cherry protein. And when you see expression, you're going to see a dot in the nucleus. And when there's no expression, it's going to be off. At the very end, I'll leave a movie because we're just breaking into getting movies going. But I'm just going to show you some still pictures which have already given us some new information. Given us some new information. So, what we did is we used CRISPR and in four different separate fly lines we inserted this either into the 5'UTR, the first intron, the third intron, or the 3' UTR. And we just asked a very simple question is, you know, where are these things expressed? How many cells are they expressed in? And so this is an image. This is the antenna. We see a nice expression across that. And in the eye here, if we zoom in again. In the eye, here, if we zoom in again, we can see a nice expression in this wave. But now, what we wanted to do is, you know, could we get information by comparing different regions? So, what we did is we compared the intron1 region insert and the intron three region insert. And what we saw was pretty different. So, in the antenna, it looked pretty much identical. And we quantify this across all four inserts. We see that the number of dots across this tissue is pretty uniform, suggesting that transcription goes all the way through the Goes all the way through the locus. But now we went to the R7 precursors, and we saw it was much different. So hopefully, you can see here that the intron1 is expressed again in all or nearly all R7 precursors, whereas intron3 is in much fewer cells. And so when we quantify this, what we saw was this pretty straightforward break. The 5' and intron 1 insert was expressed at a much significantly higher level than the intron 3 and 3' UTR inserts. And 3' UTR inserts. And so what's suggested to us is that one source of variability in this process is transcriptional elongation. And so what we're looking now is to try to figure out is there a pause or a block or early termination that's kind of driving this variability. So just to wrap up, what I've shown you in this part is that spinal expression is noisy in the R7 precursors, and that transcriptional elongation is a possible source of this variability. Source of this variability. So I've already shown you this model once, so I'll just go through this. And I'm sorry, I will say one last thing is that, of course, even if this is variable, that doesn't mean that it's actually driving the cell fate choice at the end. So one big goal that we're trying to do now is link this early variability to the late one-off expression state. And very briefly, I'll just thank again Liz Urban, Luke Bortman, and Katie Anderson, a former grad student, and I'll lately take any questions. And I'll lately take any questions. Thank you. Quick questions. So this is our early MCP, MS2 MCP experiment. This is over 24 hours of eye development, ex vivo, in a dish. Yeah. Maybe it's not the most sort of posture question, but why do you think the ironing is done through this sort of present involved? Is sort of rather involved in some sense mechanism as just every cell just randomly making a choice, right? We don't make it quite how a random choice can be, we make what's the, why is it so involved? So I think the question is almost the opposite way, right? Is I'm not surprised at all that's involved, right? Because at least in development, most of the development is driven Is driven towards overcoming noise, right? This is one of the rare examples, or one of the rare clear examples in metazoans where it actually takes that noise and takes advantage of it. I think that I get this question a lot. I agree. It's like, why is this so complicated? And the big why, we don't know. One thing I will say is that this is a rapidly evolving system. So this. So this mechanism is converted to deterministic back and forth during evolution. And interestingly, it actually can be used in other cell types. So Mike Perry and Claude Desplan's lab showed that the butterfly has two independent choices dependent on the same mechanism. But again, we don't know why. One big thing I will say is that, compared to bacteria, they kind of want to enter these transient states, they ultimately almost always want to go back. Almost always want to go back, right? They stochastically go into these other states and then they return. This is different. Once you make that sulfate choice, you want to stay with it for the rest of time. I think that's why, at least, for example, why chromatin is evolved because it's just why not make a pattern for a s reason of uh just doing something or do uh just uh Yeah, so um yeah, so so there's a couple different answers. One is a practical answer of just like, well, evolution is just so, right? So, you know, if you think about it, let's say they wanted to make lines, right? Making lines is also, it's got its own set of challenges, right? And there are actually species of flies that make lines. We don't know how those work yet. But the other thing is, this is if you But the other thing is this: if you have lines in the visual field, if you move your head or the environment moves at a certain frequency, you won't be able to see them. So the idea is that by having this random distribution is that it's for basically the LES-ing the problem. Yeah. Well, we don't know for sure because the right experiment, in other words, make a pattern, is very technically challenging. Yeah, cool question. Yeah, good question. I have one question. How do you actually think transcription is actually sort of meaningless with quality? What was that one again? How do you think transcription sort of affects quality? What is the model of it? Just out of 2000? Yeah, that's a great question. I think a lot of people want to know the answer to that. Sorry, I just want to go back to this for one second. So, you know, there's this idea. You know, there's this idea of pioneer transcription factors, and when we think of this as like a, there's two, basically these enhancers are very different. This enhancer can control expression and by proxy control chromatin. This enhancer is the exact opposite. It's controlled by chromatin. And the difference between those promoters, nobody really knows. One third thing that I haven't brought up that we're curious about is the idea that this is an intronic enhancer. Intronic enhancer. Because it actually creates a feedback in the system if you think about it, right? That if this is open chromatin, now, and let's say chromatin constantly wants to spread and close, sorry, the marks want to spread and the chromatin wants to compact, is that if this is driving expression, it'll reopen the chromatin and then it'll act again onward and onward. Anyway, all right, thank you very much, guys. Thank you very much, guys. So now what I have to do is. Alright, our next speaker is Max Curtis. Can you speak about the emergence each inverted? Yeah, so it's a completely different talk, that's what I proposed, because you know, I adapt. I'm really happy to see that there's so many international people and so many faces I haven't seen before. So I was also expecting to be more sort of like see the old buddies, but Andreas, I guess, pulled one under there. So I'd never given this talk before, and it's very different from what I anticipated giving, but let's see how it goes. Yeah, I'm associate professor in the Department of Social. I'm associate professor in the department of social molecular medicine, University of Ottawa, but that's just my formal title. I'm really a student of emergence. That's my thing. Most of us knows what emergence is, and I don't have this one to work, so I'll do it like this. Right, so the emergence is really about the appearance of something that's unexpected, unexpected. An unexpected system property or some unexpected effect of some sort. And we call it emergence because it seems to be appearing out of nowhere. And the thing about emergence or emergent properties or effect is we cannot explain them or predict them even if we have full knowledge about the individual system components. And for that reason, we have these properties and effects. These properties and effects they define reductionism. So, because by definition they disappear if you take a system apart. And we're actually using these emergence properties all the time in various ways, both in what we call the top-down and in the top-up approach to gene networks. So, this is a large network about genetic interaction. About genetic interactions in yeast. And what I'm going to talk about here for this part of the session is really important. It's a bit old, but it's really important now to take this up again because now we have access to CRISPR technologies. And we can use CRISPR technologies to do gene editing at a massive scale, which has not been able before. It's just too complicated. But now it is. This work was done first in EASE because EAS is so easy to introduce gene knockouts in. So easy to introduce gene knockouts in. That's why homologous recombination a few days later. Brilliant work in setting that up due to those technologies. And it's been done in coli and a lot of other organisms now. But now we can do it, and we see it led in grant proposal now that you have a little side study where you do these competent children genetic perturbations in order to figure out any other factors that might influence it. So that's sort of the top-down approach to it, which is a part one of my talk. My talk. And the approach there is to disrupt the network to find genes and interactions that are associated with some sort of emergent cellular or molecular property.
