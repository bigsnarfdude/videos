To discuss the application of balancer on node and links. And the application is for such specific recombination of DNA and also a reconnection of vortex protein links. And for the DNA, we mainly consider unlinking password of DNA carton. So DNA carton will be unlinked by recombinations and we are interested in the pathways. And the the method we will use are actually Method we will use, actually we discuss the mathematics of advanced, and the method we will use is the relation of the crossing number of the link, not the links, and also a signature. And we consider relation. And if the time permits, I'll discuss the signature proof. Okay, first, I'd like to give you how we apply urban surgery. So these are not your links and then These are nodes and links, and if you consider DNA nodes and links, we only are the nodes and the two component links appear if we consider our station. And if you go to an application of the vertices, then sometimes three components, four components appear. And for the DNA, we consider double-standard DNA and it goes circular, and we just consider the topology. And we just consider the topology of the center circle. And this is a picture of noted DNA. And for the DNA, we use some method. That is that we are interested in recombination of DNA. We like to know the mechanism of the DNA, which happens inside the small or here. So this is the enzymatic complex. And there, the recombination happens. Recombination really. happens. Recombination grabs the two parts of the double-sounded DNA and cut those two and do the reconnection. And this is the DNA before the recombination and this is the DNA after the recombination. And sometimes the topology is changed and we use the information of the topology to characterize what is happening inside this ball. And this is their model. So they use the tango model. So this is the Tango model. So, this is the enzymatic complex part, and here the recombination happens. So, these two parts of the double-singed DNA is changed like this. And we will use, so they use a tangle surgery, but here we use the word band surgery. And so, so this is site-specific recombination. Special recombination. And we prepare, how do we prepare DNA titanium and each component has one site. There are sites there and size there. And recommendation happens at the site. And then you have a knot. And this note has two sides there. And if you have another recombination, the knot will turn into two component links. Two-component link. And if you consider such DNA recombination, only not or two-component link appears. The same similar things happen for the reconnection of the vortex. So this is a picture from a paper in Nature Physics 2013. So they made the uh knotted vortex as in this picture and the uh as uh as the regression happens and the j uh the topology of the vortex not changes. Of the vortex node changes, and such from the 24 node, first you have a hot link and trivial node and the trivial link. So the similar things happen, and we also model this using a bound surgery. So this is a change of the topology for the mode X nodes. And also another example by simulation, they also they also observe the change of the topology. The recognition also ties a lot. So we are interested in such things. And the method we will use is a bound surgery and lots of links. The band surgery is something like this. So we prepare a square and we embed that in three-dimensional space. In three-dimensional space. So that the two sides of the square meets the north. So this is the part of the north, and here you see a twisted square. And that is called a band. And in this picture, this part and this part connects this part and this part. And we get rid of that part and instead we will put the other two sides. Then this part will change into this. We'll change it to this. And we call this local operation of note and links as a band surgery. So the band might be very complicated. And so this is a very simple example of the band surgery. And also, band surgery is also called smoothing if you consider some orientation of the node. And here, if your bands so suppose you have an orientation of nodes and links. Orientation of nausea links. And if the band surgery deserves an orientation outside the band part, it is called coherent band surgery. So here you see some orientation. And the band surgery changes this part to there. And outside this band, this note and not a link or this neutral link has the same orientation. Then it is called a coherent band surgery. So this is an example of the coherent band surgery. So this So this turfoil is oriented as this way. And after the band surgery, you have oriented hoping. And this is the example of the coherent band surgery. And so you can consider it as a smoothing. So if you smooth this orientation, then as a result, we have this. And we use a coherent. And we will use coherent biology to model site-swiss recombination and multi-parallel recombination. And one observation is that coherent band surgery always changes the number of the lots and links. If you start from two component links, then after one coherent band surgery you have not, or maybe three component links, and uh and uh two component and not, and so on. Component and not unsold. Okay, so let's take a look at the unlinking pathway. So it's based on an experiment in 2007 where recombination, which is called XLCD FTSK, unlinks the noted DNA. So in their experiments they prepare this type of links. That is right around it. It's right-handed, 2M2M cutter number. 2M is the number of the crossings. So they prepare something like this. And please note that the orientation goes the same way. Orientation of the DNA is given by the orientation of the sequence where the recombination happens. So they prepare uh these two links and as a result of the several recombination, uh they have the unlink. They have the unlinked experiment. And we characterize unlinking pathways using a mathematical model. So we model using a coherent band surgery to model the recombination. And the assumption we made is that for each recombination, we assume that the closing number goes down to each step. So maybe it's a strong recommendation. So maybe it's a strong pre-comp assumption, but with this assumption we have a good result that showing that we can show that there is only one pathway starting from 2 to M plus link and at the end you have trivial links then we show that there is only one pathway. The pathway uh uh give you uh as a first result you have a tonus node. You have a tallest node with one less crossing, and the next one you have a tallest link with one more less crossing, something better. So, if you start with a two, six tallest link, first result is a 5, 1, that is 2, 5, 12, and then you have 2, 4, tallest link, and so on. Okay, and then if you relax assumption a little, so Assumption a little. So here we assume that the crossing number goes down every time. But if you assume that the crossing number can stay the same or goes down, then you have more variety of pathway. But so here we only consider the pathway from 2,6 total as not. We assume that each product is not too complex unique. So that is a natural condition if you consider a DNA. We consider DNA recombination and we assume that the pathway is the shortest, then we can show that the Della 7 are there 9 pathways starting from 26 Torres NOT 2 ANNOC. And the shortest pathway means that you need at least six steps, six recombinations to go from two six towards pink to anode. to unknown. And the the length we you need comes from the difference of the signature. I will show you later, but we know that the cognitive pathology changes the signature by one. And if you know the difference, if you difference of the signature, we know that there are units six steps. And this is the first way we get the time. And today I'd like to consider some generalization generalization of this result. So we like to consider more general case. So where we consider the case where the link has more component or something like that. Okay, so and for the proof of this theorem, the main method we will use is a signature and the clausing number. And the result we get is something like this. So suppose L is a non-trivial oriented non-con link, then the signature of the link is bounded above by the closing number and bounded by below by the minus closing number. And if you have an extreme case where the If you have an extreme case where the signature is minus a 1 minus closing number, then we have a characterization of the link. And using this, we show that the unique pathway. And we like to, based on this, we like to consider the following problems. The first one is the following. So we have this inequality. And we like to know, so for given integers C and D, For given integers C and D satisfying something like this, so this. Can we find the node link having this? This is one question. A second one is that we have a characterization of the extreme case. And what? Can we also characterize other cases? For example, sigma is equal to 2 minus Causing number. That is the second one. And I have to give you the value. And I'd like to give you the background of this question in the next slide. Sad one is, I will explain this later, but there is some relation of the place of the bone surgery and the thyris surface. And this part comes from study of the reconnection of the vortex. And it seems that the reconnection, antibiotic reconnection. Anti-battery connection happens at something called the ice surface. So we like to discuss that in the last one. Okay, first, I'd like to give you the background of the second question. So second one corresponds to second one corresponds to the characterization of the note which appears here. Of the note, which appears here. So if you assume the closing number goes down at each recombination, then we characterize it. The blue one corresponds to that case where the signature goes up by one, but the closing number stays the same. Then the closing then the signature and closing number satisfies this condition. Satisfies this condition. So if you use characterize these notes, then we can characterize the product of the nodes and links which appear as a recombination of these nodes and links. That is the background of the second one. Okay, we discussed the classic number and the signature. So first I'd like to give the brief introduction of the signature. To do that, we prepare a zip surface, something like this. Here a surface surface, something like that. That is our limited surface which is bounded by the border ring. And you prepare a basis of the one-dimensional homology group. So for example, this case, you have two circles as a generator of the one-dimensional homology. And you make a link from this. So you move Move A just a little to the upper side of the Ziphit surface, then consider the linking of these generators. Then you have a matrix which is called Ziphead matrix. And you take so this is a Xiphet matrix, and you take transpose of the Zybank matrix plus the Zybank matrix, and you have a And you have a symmetric matrix. The signature of the matrix is called the signature of the link, and we know that that is the signature is a number defined by the number of the positive eigenvalues minus the number of the negative eigenvalues. And that is invariant of the ink. We are interested in such an invariant. And the good thing is that if you consider a coherent path surgery, the signature changes by one. And you can use the signature to discuss the number of steps you need to get one link from the other link. Okay, and we show that the signature is bounded above crossing. Bounded above clausing number and bounded by minus clausing number, and we have a characterization of this. For the first question, so this is the answer. So actually you can find such a Northend links, exception of this, you can find each pair within a class of two-wheel Northian links. So this is the result. So in a So in 2013 we characterize a red path and that but that must be two something towards not a link. And we show that except these points we can characterize ah we know that we can find nothing for the black part. Okay, so this is the answer to the first question. So this is the answer to the first question. Uh and nowadays uh some people are interested in this type of the picture. So here we consider a pair of the uh invariants. So here you take a crossing number and here you take a signature and you give the area where can be realized some by the modeling. And Kokitaniyama has some result from this kind of research. He takes a closing number, a specific number versus genus or something like that. And if you are interested in, please go to his page and he has a nice slide on his page. So you can take a look at something like a similar picture like this. But in his picture, he always take a closing number in this direction. So you have to rotate. So, you have to rotate maybe 90 degrees. Okay, so we and so this is one result. And the second result is a characterization of the links satisfying this. So, that means that the blue part of the which appears in a pathway. So, we can characterize the link as follows. So, we you have some Taurus node and Taurus node and also a three-formed link. Actually, I have a picture made by Kai. So these are the type of links we have. We have a characterization of the note satisfying this. Okay, so this is uh answer the second question. So we have characterized this. And uh so these two links appear These two links appear here as I connect the sum of the two to ours. If you consider so bodex nutrition links, maybe sometimes you have three components or four component links. And we are also interested in such a phenomena. And so this is just this only. So this is just this ongoing work, but we are considering a band surgery which appears in the pathway. So this is an expanded pathway. This beautiful picture is made by Kai. And out of this picture you see the old pathway. So starting from the si to six stories link, so this is the pathway uh two five and two four. five and two four and two three that is 25 node and hop link and unnode and unlink and so here you see connected sum of the toy foils and the connection sum of toilets and hotlinks and so on. And so for this unlinking pathway, so we know where the bound is, we have another without characterizing where the bound is. without uh characterizing where the band is. And uh so these these are the uh exam uh these are the bands which corresponds to these connections. So here this band corresponds to the band here and this one corresponds to the bound here. The interesting thing is that uh you can put the band on the one on the minimal genus surface of this link and if you change the And if you change the order of the reconnection or recombination, you see a different pathway. So instead of doing a bunch of here, if you do a bunch of here, then you have different results. That is the connected sum of the two photolas link and the hot link. Then you have a three-component link. That will not That will not happen for the DNA, but if you consider reconnection, that might happen. It depends on the first formulation of the protein street. So you can see the many pathways. And so this also gives you a pathway which where the crossing number does not go up. So starting from So starting from six closing, then eventually the closing number goes down to zero. And uh it seems that uh if you consider nothing satisfying uh uh such crossing number condition, and also if you assume that the pathway is the shortest, I think we I think uh this should be the older pathway from that to to fix our. To six torus load. Torres link to load. I do think it's correct. We are working on it. Okay, so these are the answers of the questions and we are thinking about. And this is a method. So this is a problem which we which we uh refined, which appeared in twenty thirteen and uh I think the group is the same. And for the characterization of the links satisfying this, we use a similar method. And uh the main idea is that uh if you have a link satisfying this, then Satisfying this, then we know that the link has a diagram which has three Ziphead circles. Ziphead circle is a circle which is obtained by applying the Ziphead algorithm of the orientation oriented link oriented link diagram. Then if you have this information, then you have a way to characterize the To characterize the link. And actually, we know that the link is a growth striplet. And to characterize these links, we use the method without paragraph characterization of the tribal up to conjugation. Then there are six of six classes. And uh you know that the link has to be The link has to be positive RAID and we know and we characterize which will be conjugate to positive RAID. And we also use the Delta by MSK of the calculation of the signature. And combining this, we have the result. Okay, I stop here. Thank you very much for your attention.
