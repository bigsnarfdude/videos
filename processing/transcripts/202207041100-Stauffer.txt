Thanks, Mr. Maddox, for the invitation. This is the deal and for accommodating all my requests for the new course coming out ahead of each lecture. So in this collection, we have a lot of mood scale analysis, which is a method of proof, let's say. Actually, mood scale analysis has been used in. has been used in many ways in many forms since forever essentially but what i'm going to talk about today is a method that became almost like a recipe and i don't know i in my opinion everything starts with a paper by her test and blood dispervis that starts to look at or employing multi-care analysis to analyze some part of the systems and after that these things catch up. This thing catches up and Alan Ziegman used it for analyzing rhombic delacements, and then all the students of OzOx use analyzed runtime and also percolation with strong dependence, especially level set of percolations of the Causion fields. So, what I'm going to do in these four lectures is the first three lectures, I'll take one problem, which the problem is. Which is the problem of spread of infection. It's not only due to my own personal choice of this problem, but also because it was one of the first problems analyzed by Helicas and Baldis Revisus. And I'm going to actually do a multiscale analysis to prove something on this model. So I'm going to present you multi-scale analysis through the analysis of this particular model. I'm not going to do the actual proof of Cassie's, but I'm going to do it. But I'm going to do it in the more general framework that became kind of standard in this era. That you can see if you look at papers in perpetuation, for example, you can see traits of these muscle numbers. So I'm going to do this. That's my goal for the three first lectures. In the last lecture, I'm going to kind of tell you a bit about some recent developments on using multi-scale analysis for systems out of stationarity, out of equilibrium. And this has been done. And this has been done in the last two. Okay, so this talk, this whole four lectures will have nothing to do with KCN, but I hope this technique is quite general. I'm using this for analyzing mixing time of random dynamic environments. So maybe you can find it an application for analyzing these concepts. Okay, so let's start. So this talk, this lecture will be a bit light. Be a bit light. I'm going to just introduce the model, introduce the questions, tell a bit what's known, and then at the end, we're going to do a simple proof that does not have node scalars, a single scale argument. So that's the start. So I'm going to talk about the mode of spread of infection. So let me define that's one of you. That's a model and look at the whole of this series. So particles can be of two types, just two types, so susceptible or infected. So in the monological literature, it's called an SI model. So I'm going to call it S part for the susceptible particle. S part for the susceptible particle, I part for the infected particle. And it's gonna, let's talk about the initial configurations. When I is zero, we start with a Poisson point process of susceptible particles. So S particles are just a Poisson point process on CD. Everything I'm going to talk about today is the 1Z of some intensity which is the parameter of the model. So each site of the D has a dependent horizon variable, mu, which gives the number of particles that are susceptible and start from that site. While I particles start with Starts with one part for the origin. So I take this for some clouds, they are also separate, and I add one eye part and orange. And that's my initial configuration. And then from plane zero, part will just move as independent simple norms. So front line zero, right. Right. A particles move independent of one another as continuous time. Each particle just has a plus one clock of rate one. When this clock rings, the particle chooses a neighbor. The part will choose a neighbor of its current position, uniformly drawn, and jumps out. So that's how part flow works. Okay. So for the moment, I did not tell you anything about how I particles interact with S particles, just telling how they move. And if, well, you can already guess how they interact, but if I don't tell you, if it doesn't interact at all, this single part will just. All and this single particle just move as an n-part, and s part will just move as s particles without changing types at all. Then the s particles heavy stationary. It's an important property, it's easy to prove that independent synchronous ones, once it is a measure preserving transformation of the not going to prove this, but you can you can try to do it if you if you haven't done. If you if you have a very simple just the plus one property so time zero you could have an s part s particle so at zero you can have many s particles yes and please feel free to interrupt me as much as you want but really as much as you want okay so now let me introduce how particles interact it's the simplest possible mechanism you can think of Possible mechanism you can think of: you know, whenever a susceptible particle is at the same site as an infected particle, the susceptible particle gets infected. This time of interaction is usually represented by what was sometimes called reaction formula. It's just, I can just represent it like this. If I find an S particle and an I particle at the same site, then At the same side, then this becomes that's what this means. If I have an S partful plus an I part of the side, with all the particle, that's not the problem. But if I find an S plus I, then they become two I. So the S turns into I. So if there are many S I become side with I, all become all become spontaneously I1. I can interrupt your message at once. I can interrupt as much as I want. I was interested in the model some years ago and I invented the name the true contact project. True contact because I think this is much more, the word contact process fits much more to this model than to the model that it has reviewed. That's good. Thanks for the motivation. Actually, this model, I think it's a very natural model, it's been think of. And actually, the first person I know that has thought Person, I know that, as Photo asked about this special, was Spitzer in the 70s. And Spitzer in the 70s raised the problem of analyzing this model, but as you see, it just got really analyzed in the early 2000s. So let me tell you, the first question we're going to look at, and that's the question I'm interested in doing this lecture, which is whether the infection has positive speed of growth. So the set of infected particles growth, right? Particles grow, right? S particles become infected and remain infected forever after that. So the second infected particles are growing over time. And I want to know how quickly does this grow? Particles, obviously, they do simple and no more independent of one another, so they are diffusive. So by time t, they will be at the distance of order rooting from the initial position. But the infection will go much faster. Particularly, the question that Spitzer was rather interesting is whether it Since it was rather easy to say, it's rather growth with positive speed. So positive speed of growth. Before I define this property, we just introduced, I think, a standard notation for counterfarm to the right. So look at the screen just there. Maybe you can look up to where you're seeing yourself. Ah, yes, so yeah, let me define down here. So I'll define by eta t s of x. x is the size t is time if s is susceptible. It's just the number of susceptible particles, the number of s particles. particles at site x at time and the same thing with i here to replace i i have the number of i part in fact with particles etc and i'll see this as a county measure so for any subset of cd is our subset just a sum Our subset is just a sum of all x. Just a counting, just a number of x paths in this set of sites. Then we can define what positive speed of growth is. Positive speed of growth is just that the number of infected positive speed. But positive, there exists a constant which can depend on the dimension and on you positive, such that the number of infected particles outside a ball of radius constant T, the number of infected particles L and T outside this ball is at at least one for all For all large amount of feet, how much when this happens, I say that the infection is positive speedup of one. Both linearly in time. No, no, we should also tell you that if this happens, then there is actually a limit. And that's gonna get okay. So now we can start talking about some of the known results of the model. So, casting servings. I'm going to cite the center of the paper, so maybe I should just write this KS. So they in the paper appeared in 2005 this house positive speed of growth for this number so to do this they develop a very So to do this, they develop a better control of multi-scale analysis and better do this proof, but from a different multi-scale analysis, I think it's more robust for other models. Sorry, so for any mu n dimension. For any mu n dimension, yes. Should have that should try. And that proof was based on an earlier work of themselves from 2003, where they analyzed a model of branching random capacities. I'm not going to mention much, but it's a branching random on a dynamic environment. And that is the first time they did this kind of multi-scale analysis, which here they essentially adapted. So those are two, I don't know, 80-page paper. But today we could do it for that's where things started. Then it turned out, going back to your question, that for this model can say more. And Kesla Prisoner's very amazing paper, they show a shape theorem for diffection. Diffection. To state this, I think it's just right that we should check here. So Ps and this is in weight. This is another of mass. And the short shape is all. So what does it mean? It means the following. So we look at the set of sites that have Set of sites that have seen the infraction up to some point. So let's denote this by A t. A t is the set of sides X such that there exists a previous sign S for which in the S So these are the set of sites that have seen the infection up to time t. Not the one that I infected at time t, but at least they were infected at some point during CD. So this is just a collection of points. We want to make sense of a scaling of this set, but it's better to transform this into a subset of ideas. Does that definition, that specific definition matter? I can think of other possible definitions. And is what you're going to say equally true for any of the reasonable choices I'm going to do? The things that are, you know, the location currently affected things, the problem. Things that will ever be. Things that will ever be get non-infected on things like that. Yeah, so technically it matters because how to show a shape theorem model is not sabat. So what they have to do is they have to prove some sort of near stability. And for this, it turns out that it's useful to have a glowing set. That was very fundamental. So, if you look just of, of course, if you look just of the set of sites that are infected at time t, of course, this has several holes inside. And in the limit, it shouldn't matter because these holes are not that big. But for the proof, to prove this type of subductivity, they really need the row itself. There are several other Shakespeareans for related models in that 10-year period. Why was this unpublished in the Animals of Map? Because it's the only one I know that's not survival. Okay, so is it more for that innovation than for and if we think about the ownership theorems for this passive population? Theorems for first passive calculation from model, those are all sub-validative functions. This one is not. So we take this set and transform it into a subset of Rd just by adding unit cubes around the points of AD so that we get a connected set. x maybe x plus the actual statement they show is that for for any epsilon actually not for any epsilon first it's this subset let's call it Subset, let's call it C D. It's a compact subset such that for all epsilon since this 80 divided by T, this is containing obligation set and contains one and zero. For all I don't know, feel so in some sense it's a kind of law of large numbers for what is said. And once you have large numbers, you can ask a lot of fluctuations. Of course, that's open for all dimensions but one. Then, after this, comments. What's that? That's like 09 or something like this. I don't remember. It's a dumb statement. They show the dimension one operation attacks. You can imagine that this is the case because in dimension one, the particles are moving visibly, then the infection comes, but the infection has positive speed of the road, also has a shape here. So this fracture is much faster. So you find regeneration times. And times where the front of the infection sees some kind of regeneration of the environment. And that's how they show the possible approach. Two questions. I think I mentioned one, I can mention that nearest neighbor and not nearest neighbor they do use it. It's nearest neighbor random walks, then? Yeah, I think so. But that could technically make a big difference. Morally, it shouldn't make a big difference. Different normally it shouldn't make the difference, but that's right, but still, dimension one, I think it is quite robust, and because if you can if it's nearest neighbor, then you can never have that the you can not jump over another particle. So you know that if you see an infected one, then everything on the left up to the last one, it's right. Just for any dimension that's supposed. In hard dimensions, it's supposed to be KBC, or I want computers. I think actually, in the Shape theory paper, they also show that inside this set, if we go a little bit far from the boundary, then you find no set for particle. That's one piece. That's one piece of the argument for the shifting. Anything about that? Besides the obvious things, like that has to be have the symmetries of the lattice and so on, convex and things like that. Convex, but the question is whether. Convex, but the question is whether it's strictly convex. Ah, it's not convex. How far can you can move from the boundary? I don't remember. I think it's polylog, it's not much. So, what did you say about moving in the boundary in the site? What's the point? You don't find the sites that have everything infection, and if you look a little bit further in the bulk of the set, you don't find any susceptibles and no set or path. And no separate buttons jumps inside it and stays hanging there until that's right, actually. And the other tool that if you go a bit inside, then everything is infected. Okay, you said outside, nothing is infected. No. If you look a little bit inside the If you look a little bit inside the set of infected sites, then you find not susceptible particles. So I don't think that the opposite statement is that if you move a bit out, then there is no infect? Yes, that will know by for some time. Yeah, of course. Okay, then there are several other results that we can juice out from this. I won't say much about them, just say that you can show positive speed of growth for the same model, but when you equip ZD with conductance, as long as they are uniformly elliptic, it will be a bit more work. But you can do it. And several other things you want to show. For example, if you have a bias runawa and talk about transients and recurrence of the infection, if the runoff have a bias, the infection, the cloud affected particles can move away and just visit the origin finitely many times. And we know that, you know, transition, phase transition on this for different levels of device. For different levels of device. They start to be fine for our purpose. Okay, so there are some files of this. So this is just SI. As you can imagine, there are some other values of spelling infraction model. And this has also been analyzed. So one of them is the SIS. This is susceptible, in fact, it's susceptible. And to define Susceptible. And to define it to you, I just need to define the reaction formula. The cloud of particles just move in the same way, that's independent signal walks. They start the same way. And here, just we have that the standard infective formula. If I find a susceptible closer infected, I get two infected. And then there is the healing of infected pathways. So infected particles, they spontaneously heal at some. Then just refill at some rate lambda with another parameter and collect to be susceptible. Standard model in the literature. And here you can ask whether the infection survives, depending on the value of lambda. And Cassius and Abyssinis show that as well. They show another paper. That's for more than one death infection survey with the positive logic. If remember is small, that means the infection will go over slowly, so you can imagine you can show the infections around. The other thing is that you could ask whether the opposite holds for large lambda, but that's not really the case. And simply is because if an infected particle recovers at a moment when it shares a site with all the infected particles, it immediately gets back and is reinfected by the definition of the dynamics. It's an instantaneous reaction. So infected particles can normally heal and become susceptible if they are alone at the site. So we can show this and myself that for large enough densities, the infection survives rather than software. Effect of survival rather than a software. They have to keep being sites with lots of particles, they need to sustain the infection for long. So it's perfect and when they get. And spread pain when they get when fluctuation strikes, and then this region gets blown because they already built the infection on arms that can sustain at the back inside of this flow and that's all. Is it interesting to ask about recurrence to the organ in these SIS models? Is that obviously what happens? I'm definitely saying yes, absolutely going. Yes, I think actually I can actually say because this proof I'm sure to survive, then you visit the life. You visit the language. I do in this book to use the link sheet surface that I have mentioned in this talk. Not that one, but I do. Okay, so if I'm not forgetting anything, so there's no shape here. So, there is no shape theorem in this case. There is no shape theorem. No, there is no shape theorem. So, I have to define what we mean by shape theorem. Maybe we would say written here. It hasn't been proved. It probably holds, right? Yeah, that's the thing. It probably holds, but it hasn't been proved. So, you can do this in one dimension. You could also do it with Brownian motion, right? So, and is anything known about the speed? I mean, maybe only numerically. Have people tried to investigate what the real speed is? What is because I actually try pass numerically, but it's not so easy. Yeah, I don't know of any results that are precisely. Or to use a precise state from all the speed. Of course, you can have all the bounds, but a precise state from all the speed is actually. I want to try to simulate this form. It didn't seem that it was actually a nice formula, but maybe we didn't try hard enough. I haven't tried. Okay, so if you are familiar with spread of infection and perhaps in SI model, S model, so the natural imaging let's look at SIR model. And this is the last one I'm going to mention. SIR model, we have a third type, susceptible, infected, and removed. It's the R case. It's the R case. And you can think that it is really like SIS, the same kind of reaction. So S plus I goes to I. But then I at rate lambda goes to this first I called remote. It doesn't become susceptible again, but becomes removed. And you can think of removed as vaccinated, then you get immune after. Immune after the infection, I forget it, or you can think of it as dead, so whichever way you work, and how so you can choose your, but the point of your effects should be removed from the system. That's the very fundamental difference between SIR for all the outputs. In particular, if we look at SIS and SIRS, Look at SIS and SI, and I let this process evolve. And I tell you at some point, an infected particle meet other particles. You know that these other particles will get infected, regardless of whether it's SI or SIS. But for SIR, you have to trace back that history and see if they were infected before. Because if they were infected way before in time, Infected way before in time, it's more likely they are dead now, they're removed. So they cannot be infected, so they cannot contribute anymore to the spread of infection. So the other process, the main characteristic is that we have this nice stationarity of the set of susceptible particles, at least the initial cloud of susceptible particles, which we can control here at the Montscreen Is and then if I have no data. And then, if I know there is a particle there, I know they get infected if I find them to be infected particle. Here it's not guaranteed. So, we need to work much harder. Actually, the proof for SIR just showed up last evening. No, it didn't show up. So, it's not even in the archive yet. But people have probably talked about it. So, I can announce it. You can even find YouTube videos of it. So, I can announce it. Announce it. So Duncan Dovaya's line assumed to come eight prove that if lambda is small, then the infections are right for dimensions too and high. Sorry for the SIR, so you have a renal infection. That's the thing. If you do a simulation of the S. I model, I'm thinking tools is not. That's for the simulation. If you do a simulation of the S I model, you see this cloud of particles. It should have a little shape. So they have a relevant person where they grow like growing standard particles. And they are moving inside here. And you don't see the standard particles inside. That's what the shape says. We see it along the boundary. Says it may see it along the boundary, but not inside. But you see this growth. For SIR, the picture is not like that. You may have a set of infected particles, but inside, you find that particles. And this ring here has all the one. It doesn't grow, it really has all the one. And they also show that actually. They also show that actually you still leave behind a low density cloud of S particles inside. So there are some lucky particles that manage to triple this ring and then stay safe among the removed particles. In dimension one, the infection always dies out. That's a simple proof to make. Just imagine that the dimensional one and what happens? Well, no, the function has positive speed of growth if you want to remove them. So they will, by ID, they row a set of order t of particles. They reach out to a set of order t of particles, but all these particles die time logged in. They independently die at the rate of lambda. They die at the rate of algae. So when you take some time to grow a set of particles, and they all die at anger of t, leaving you with just small piece around the boundary of the effective particles. And this has all the one, but if you have too many, you have a contraction. They're more likely to die apart than to expand. So this has all the one, eventually they die without that. So that's why out of this green has a So that's why out of this green there's another one. But dimensions to a higher, they actually need to make sure. So what I hope is in the last lecture, I'll talk a little bit about mode screenizers that have been developed to tackle this kind of situation where we don't have stationary. I'm not going to talk about all these people. Okay, but I'm going to talk about the work I did in the process, which had the same feature. Okay, so here let me just mention one final result, which is also by the M2 under the slide, which is some people know as the A-B module, but here I call it SI. And it's when S and And it's when S and I particles jump at different rates. So say that an S particles jump, say, at a very different one, and I particle jump at a rate different than one. This breaks stationary, so a similar issue then with SIR. And then I can show that this model also has a positive speed of growth. Yeah. And this is most of the works that I know on that I know inside. At least the main ones that I've decided. Do we know how this feel approach depends on the jump faith of the article? Just proof was this thing. In respect to homotopy? Homogeneous is a big problem. It's another issue. SI and SIS are simpler to aligns, but they're actually monotonous. If I take two configurations where in one I have a set of particles, initial set of one that contains the other, I know the infection will spread faster. And I just do the standard coupling, couple all particles to the same motion, and there is these extra ones that just help spread. That just helps spread. SIR is not clear at all because they have more particles. Maybe you spread the infection quicker in the beginning, but that could be harmful for you, but they all die and then they cannot be used later on, but they could have been more useful. So, Montrealist is not but for the one with the different Jeffreys, is it also that the one in South? Also, that one, and it's also non-clinical at all. For the same reason, if you change your rate but have more pathways, this could become Yeah, I think this results don't recall exactly, but in dimensional one for this change of rate. For this change of rate, at the couple of computers has a paper where at least one case, maybe the infected particles jump faster than the susceptibles, but you can also establish a generational time structure. Questions? More questions. So, what we're going to do, not today, but from tomorrow onwards, we're going to look at the positive speed result and we're going to actually prove today I'm going to prove a simpler result. We're all deadlifted, so it's good to start slowly. So, I'm going to look at a simpler model and I'm going to show in this model, positive speed of infection, via single scale. Try a simple scale analog. So it'll be a really comparison percolation. I just want to mention this model because I hope it helps see why for the SI, the SIS, we really need to at least Moose can I was the only way managed to find a way to prove. So to be a little bit of a difference between the two models. So this model, some people in the audience know much more than me, and it's called the problem model. So, the fraud model at this is nothing else than x i, but to set up a part. But susceptible particles do not move. S particles do not so if we do the picture in one dimension, because then we can do this place in time. We start at time zero. So time is going upwards. We start with We start with a cloud of susceptible particles and replace an infected part by the origin. This infected particle will move over time, but the susceptible particles do not move, so they keep going until the time that maybe this effect goes there and in fact that part. Left, in fact, that particle, and then both move. The one that already moving continues to move, and this one now moves as well. And the process grows like this. If it's here, then this particles start to move as well, and the particles start to move fashion. That's the fraud model. This model was introduced by Caltran Warnette. Correctly exit 99 and they see this as a branching random walk process. You look at the infection part from the origins to a branching random walk when attempts to branch whenever it visits a site for the first time. For the first time it visits a site, it flips a point, see what there is or particle there or not. Aspect of a particle there or not. If there was this branch, and it's a branching random work of first visits to a site, and they show recurrence of this process. So they show recurrence in other images. However, you define the currents. The curves that here could imagine is that the origin sees a particle infinitely often, particle jumps at the origin infinitely often, and it's a current. You could define it as every single S particle eventually you get infected. You can also define it this way. And it should come in all dimensions. So if you don't care about the So, if you don't care about whether particles are susceptible or infected, does the total number of particles stay Poisson at each side? Well, that depends. That's not true. It doesn't stay. This is complicated, but the dependence between the particles doesn't allow for the Poisson matching. I see. But what But what can be said is, and that's a theorem, is that if I start with, you can even imagine a completely packed configuration of one sympathetic path for per site, and I run this process in the limited convergence of Poisson measures. Do you start or some beautiful trick that you actually stay or some? I don't think so, because it's of the dependent. The defect so there is recurrent in n dimension whatever the initial density it's a feature of the z it's not a difficult group If we want to find just a phase transition in this model, then we have to go out of the B and then on trees that has been studied. Matt and Chris have studied on trees and there we can show it. I'm not sure if it's an old case for the trees or some or some trees. Okay, and for this model, it's actually subtractive. And the shady tumor has been proved as well. It has been proved in a series of three works. Let me name some just for completeness. So, let's do it by Albus Machine for Paul. Well, independently, this is all the tree, and independently by labels. And they prove the shape theorem when they. And they prove it effective when the infection starts from a bad configuration, where all sites are at once accepted. And then finally, for a random initial configuration, it has proved by how this addition of the Russia which could easily got published. got published before that's the fact of slow reference so of course the shape terminal already did positive speed of growth and I could try and mimic that proof to prove you positive speed of growth but then go for something different and not prove this by calculation. I'm going to prove this by percolation. So, to illustrate the kind of argument that we're going to see from tomorrow onwards. So now, what I want to show is let's state as a theorem that actually means that I would prove it in, yeah, I would prove it in dimensions two and a half.  Okay, so let's reflect a bit, John, on this. So, what can we do? So, what we can Can we do? So, one thing that we can do with the Frog model, and we do also with the ISI, is I can take each susceptible particle, and each susceptible particle samples a single underwalk path, which is the path that particle will traverse if it ever gets infected. I can do it, but it was independent of my model. They can just say, I'll take this path if I get infected. So, we have a Let's go in two dimensions of particles. Particle, let's give it a name. A particle, just sample the height of the synchron work. It has this type of synchronum walk here. It's an infinite length. If it gets effective, it's. If it gets effective, it just goes through this path. If this path passes through another sector particle, which I don't want to do here, but let's make this path go there. So if it passes through another sector particle, I know that if this particle P gets infected, this one also gets infected. It may be not get infected by people who have got infected before, but the fact that it passed. Before, but the fact that the path passes there already tells me this particle will get infected if it determines, regardless of what this process has on this. In particular, if I know that this particle visits this other one, this location, and within some time B, I know that within time D of its infection. Time t of its infection, that guy gets infected. No more. In particular, if I find a sequence of particles starting from the infected part of the path of this particle with another particle, and the path of that particle with another particle, and so on and so forth, and this path is infinite, I get an infinite sequence of particles that will get effective. And I can control that effect. And I can control that time if I know that each stretch of this single log path up to time t. So I could say let's truncate now. Each path of the simple log up to time t, it's not an infinite path anymore. It's a pathful just as it's truncated. And if this sequence percolates in this sense that one path contains the location of a particle and so on and so forth, I know that each of them will be infected and the And the kth part for the sequence will be factored within time k times t. Not enough to prove positive speed, because I would have to show that this path of locations also have been doing a sphero path. Each of them is being infected within time t from a proof, but doesn't grow. But doesn't grow with positive space, okay? So that's not the way I'm going to prove it. It sounds cool, but still not the way I'm going to prove it because I'm going to do the single scale argument. So I'm going to tessellate space in the box. That's what we do for the okay. So let me erase this drawing and I'll replace it. It's just a little few box. This is enough. I decided space and the side length here I want to always call L. And just for us to keep attention. Just to keep notation, we can write a notation here. I will call Q of I. I'm going to index my cubes by Zd. I is an element of Zd and Q of I is just the cube that's centered at I times L and it has side length L. Just have these cubes here. This cube and we need a little bit more structure, so just need the center part of each clue. So each clue, let me write. I'm not going to do the central part of each of them, but enough. Not for me, right? But you can measure this whatever, and I'm gonna call it Q. The center part is just the same thing. It's the same center, but now it's just side length one-third of the of our six. I was just I just drew awesome I didn't let me produce the last piece of notation which is just for this argument I promise it's the last one okay I won't promise what's the next piece V of i is not a cube It's called a cube i is the first L over three sites from the cube that are visited by infected particles these are not set by infected particles are particles. Diapath was drawn side of the key. Yes, I want me to go out today. But tomorrow, you want to speak. Outside for you, right? Let me try to explain this in the picture. So if we think this Q is our Q of I. Then I can observe the infection as its goals. Eventually, maybe at some point, the infection enters from outside and maybe it exits quickly. Okay, but to still count these sites. To still count these sites as visited by the inflection, it may have infected other particles, but I'm not counting them for now. I keep a look at the infection outside of me. It infects other sites and so on. Until I get at the least L over 4. And this L over 3 will get clear soon, because it's not a coincidence. It's just not a good order. It's going to be clear why I chose. These L over 3 are visited by one if. Are visited by one infected particle. No, it could be different infected particles, but they are from outside. I really don't care what them are actually, because it's not going to be important. I just say if the infection enters from outside, that means it's an infected particle that, when it was receptible, it was outside the box. So it came inside. And I have to count the number of sites. I start to count the number of sites it visits. If another part of it enters, I start to count as well. And I accumulate this counting until it gets to L over 3. And when it gets to L over 3, I declare that we're going to set here. Some of these sides can lie in the central part, right? Sorry? The central part, right? Sorry? Some of these sites can be inside the central part. Yes. In particular, if an affected particle goes all the way to the center, it has completed the DRTI. Because of the choice of L over 3. L over 3 is just a distance between the center and the path. So if I get a path affected by inside the center, I know I have seen L over 3. Great. So Vi is disjoint for the sensors. Vi is yes, Vi is disjoint for the sensors. The distance from the blue to the white is one over six L over six, right? The distance between the blue over the center and the center. This is L over three and this is L. And this is a always signed. So, but otherwise, this VI could be, you know, a little point here, there, etc. I really don't get any case. The thing is that I'm going to get the bound that's uniform, the choice of VI, because this is a complicated set. Then I'm going to, well, after this edit, there is only one thing left to complete a multi-state or a single scale on a model. You should define what it means for a bottom. You should define what it means for a box to be good or bad. That's it. That's the whole summary. So a call QY would let me the definition. And usually these kind of arguments, the argument of the argument. Arguments, the heart of the argument lies on the definition of good. I'm going to occupy good if two events happen. First event, let's call it P1, is that the number of susceptible particles inside the set of GI is large. So, remember, the set of GI is inside the cube and it's this set. Inside the cube, and it's this set that is hit by the infection. There are the list of, let's say, if we get L over three sites visited inside, we have exactly L over three sites in the eye. So we can find that the expected number of left of particles mu times this. And I'm just going to ask this to be smaller than that. Mu L over six. L over 6. So it's likely. It looks like I can do this without knowing what Vi is, because each site of the tuna has Poisson or a number which says which the number of susceptible platforms in that site. So I can just say, okay, I can just get L over three. Get out of the three or some neuron comparables independent, each site has its collection, and just give these numbers to the sites of the eye as they get discovered by the fraction. So I can measure this imaginary even without seeing the eye. And then I speak to the volume. So, if U1 holds, it means that as infection was entered, several particles got infected inside G1. Several of them get infected. Then, what I want is to spread infections. So, I just require that this particle visits the neighbors, but each neighbor. So, I'm going to say as So I'm going to say that complete definition of good. For each jaded neighbors 2i, so this means that what has to be that j minus i 1 to 1. Let me let me give a name to this page. So this is the number of So this is the number of set of particles. Let's call this set something call this set of particles the set of susceptible particles that get infected in this construction from the I. And for each j there exists a particle at least one particle from the eye. Is in the center of J as the time L square of its infection, of the particle's infection. L square means at most L square. Clara? L square means at most L square. Most delt square? Can be at the most L square. But not exactly. It can be exactly as well. As you wish, it's the same. It doesn't change. I'm a little bit confused by this definition of the event. So you're looking at the trajectory up to which time? Because you are defining this. Let's say up to time L squared. So the box has size L, and this part was the I. And this particle's VI can be anywhere inside these angles. So the distance to each of the neighbor center is of order L. Let's say let's run this part of time L square and ask whether it goes inside the center. But even for the first, it was for the first event, sorry, so for the big, so you're when you define this BI, so The i so uh the trajectory that you're uh this trajectory of infections are those that uh so you just look at the the whole system up to whatever time just continue looking as long as you haven't been uh you haven't had L over three sites inside you visited by infections you keep counting because after that time for that Because after that time for that box, your VI is fixed. And then for intransigent additional time L squared to see whether you visit the network or not. Yes. You're assuming some sort of requirements to get the VIs. I don't need to get the VI. I'm just to prove that I don't. That lets go with probability that have boxes with thick spots. We can do this construction. As I said, to know how many particles are infected in this FDI as it gets constructed, you just need to sample L of the three post-on variables independently of one. And just ask me whether some of these are non-variables. Is that the least? Variables is at least mu l of six. Isn't the i only defined if it marks receipts? That's right. That's right. So let me get inside. Let me shut the box here for the moment. So let's fix the box device. Fix a box twice to look at the probability two i's left i don't know if it if the uh if it helps you but maybe i was a little bit sloppy in the definition of this in the notation if you want to make this Which one do you think is more precise? So just say you define an API as a defined here, and each box has L over three independent post-nonal variables of parameter view. As sites are added to the set PI, I give this postnonal variable in order to give the number of successful particles there. And instead of writing these like this, I just say the sum. Things like this, I just say the sum of the L of the three or some of the variables is at least in the right there. Is a little bit more precise for the moment. Then we can say probably that twice fed is just okay. It probably that each event doesn't occur. Probably that u1 doesn't occur. And it probably that doesn't occur, even at t1 occur. This is just chain of parts and puzzle. It's just general parts and possible for large energies. You don't need to do it. Just exponential in UF. The second, just look for a single particle. If I look for a single particle, let's, if we take a side X into I, and I In Qi and the side y in q center of j, j neighboring q y, the probability that a random wall f time l square goes from x to y is what? Just look, use local cell thing, and that is constant divided by the time. Divided by the time the d over 2. Then the probability that a particle starting from X is in the center, not necessarily at Y, but some side of the center, just some dis over Y in the center. And you get the volume of that chi, which is. Which L of the 3 to the D. Particularly, this estimate doesn't depend on L. You have L to the D here and an L to the D. So you get a uniform bound that doesn't depend on L. But the number of particles depend on L. So the probability none of them go to J, its exponential is more in L. Just take the union bound on the neighbors and have only 2d of them, and that's it. So we get the probability. So we have the probability that QR is there, goes to zero with L actually goes to the exponential faster. Plus it's enough that this goes to zero. Okay, it's discrete. Very simple. Once you have this, you know that you can take a large so that this value, or actually the converse We can take a large energy probability at divine smooth is bigger than critical probability for a near-defined probability. So the entry perpolation means a path of oversight sets only move in the positive direction of any of the history. Okay, if we get this, we're almost done. Oh, I have four minutes. Just what I need. So if we get this, this is my two. That's the two. That's when z2, what would be the n dimension? If we get this with positive probability, there is an oriented path of open box starting from the origin, and that's infinite. And that's good. If this happens, what happens? The infection here passes to the center of the next box in Tamil squared. Remember that here, okay, maybe we pay a little bit of price at the first. We pay a little bit of price that the first infected particle moves a little bit around, but that's you pay once. Then an L squared is here, and another L square is there, and another L square is there, another L squared thing keeps going. So it moves distance L each time in time L squared. So you get speed of one over L so we go to the kth position here of the graph in time k times L square for the kth position. times L square with the kth position of this k error from the verge. But this happens only as positive for bit. We want to show more surely that it is positive still. So there is just a small completion of this. We just say suppose this doesn't happen and I can find the distance at which this all paths stop. For example, stop here. Could you mark everything that you have observed? And the way it the initially affected particle to exit when the initially affected particle it's jumping here doing whatever it does when it exits it gets to fresh environment and it repeats does there a path oriented path starting from here that goes into it's all fresh environment so there's a positive probability if it's not we're going to eliminate that bigger picture and do it again that's independent experiments That's independent experiments eventually to do with the final path and the interaction loop. And that concludes the proof for the single step. It's a question environment, but don't have to consider the close anymore. Yeah, but it's oriented perpellation. So in order to perpolate, you only go in this direction. If by any chance your particle has gone down, you just rotate it and look for a path in this direction. It's the same. It's oriented, but you... It's oriented, but you reverse the axis. You have a path that goes in this direction. If it fails, it fails across a finite set of boxes. You eliminate that region and wait the path to expose. It will exit eventually. You will pay a long time for this pathway to exit, but it pays just once. And then it picks up positive speed. Positive speaker. Okay, that's uh so what we're gonna do tomorrow is to approach the FSI model and we're gonna start seeing why it's much more complicated than this group that I've got. So we'll start with the difficulties and then I'll kind of build the multi-scale framework. I'll finish quickly.
