Today I will talk about connected hopper algebra of 5GK dimension. And connected hopper algebra is a classical, a classical, the research of them can be traced back to the early days of the Hobbes theorem. But classical results always assume the commutativeness or co-commutativeness. Over the last decade, Committee commits over the last decades. Um, Professor James Peron and Xin King and Guangding Zhong have made a lot of progress to better understand this class of hub edges without the assuming of community or co-commutativeness. Here's the prime of my talk. Firstly, I will give a rough picture of connect hopper of fan QK dimension, and then I will call definition of Then I will call the definition of ox tensions and present some examples. And in the third part, I will present my loosen program of myself. And basically, it will describe the connect root hopeless dimension. On fine G-dimension will be described in terms by means of our extension. And in the last part, I will. Last part, I will present two questions. One is specific, and the other one is vague. So, in our talk, always assume the base field is of characteristics zero, and a hopeless called connected if its coretical is of dimensional. It means that there are no other simple sub co-algebra, there are no simple sub co-algebra co-algebra other than the base field. Now, it is called connect group. No, it is called connect grid grid. It means that this hub is equipped with a grading which is compatible with the algebra structure and the quadruple structure and the zeros components of dimension one. And it is easy to say that for hop edge, connect grid always can imply connectedness. So the class of connected grid hopeless is a subclass of the class of connected hopper algebras. Connected hopper algebras. There are three sources of connected hopper algebra. The first one is Lie theorem. And by the classical Cartier-Myonomo theorem, we know taking enveloping algebra defines an equivalence from the category of Lie algebra to the category of co-commutative connected hop algebra. And moreover, the decay dimension of the enveloping algebra is equal to the vertical space dimension of the Lie algebra itself. So connected. So, connected hop algebra of fine q k dimension can be viewed as a generalization of the universal envelope enveloping algebra of fine q k dim fine dimensional algebra. The second source is for is the algebraic group theorem. And it is a basic fact that taking coordinate defines an equivalence from the category of unipotent algebraic to the category of connected affine of algebras. A commutative algebra. Algebras, a commutative affine hopper algebra, commutative connected and affine hopper algebras. And the GK dimension of the quadruped equals to the variety dimension of the algebraic groups. So by this year, we know we can view connected hope algebra of fine dimension is a non-communicable counterpart of universal algebraic groups. The third source is of commute. Of coming is of combinatoric nature. So, however, algebra arise from combinatoric are always connected in nature. And they are always locally found, but of infinite decay dimension, and many of them are neither commuting nor co-commuting. The principle is that we can use brought and co-brought to encode the disassemble of the discrete structures. Discrete structures. The notable example includes the hop edge of semantic functions and of permutation and of binary trees. And I list some of them. Although today I will talk about can I help find GK dimension, but our results and techniques are also applicable to these algebra algebra. Now let's ask for connect hop algebra. We know Hop algebra, we know it's called radical field change, it's a hop algebra field change. So the goal actually is a connect group hopeless, and moreover, it is indeed a polynomial, a weighted polynomial, it is indeed a commuter. And so by the so-called Hoff-Lara theorem in the classical Hoff algebra, we know Go actually is isomorphic as great L to a weighted point normal algebra. Polynomial algebra. So by standard technique, we know that connected or fine jiggle dimension always has nice link theoretic and homological properties. For example, the jigger dimensions always are always integers and x shows not so real and the domain is a domain and in particular they are all I think shows regular and the toys collab ya so our talk So our targets do relate to our to the top that one topic of our one of the two topics of this workshop. And now let's start to say to move to the low dimensional case, low GK dimensional case. We know if GK dimension is bigger than or equal to two, then its primitive space is also necessary has dimension. Is necessary has dimension bigger than or equal to two. So connective hope algebra of GP dimensions 0, 1, 2 are all co-commutative. And for GP diamond 3, there are two families of connect hop algebra, which are not co-commutative. And for GP diamond 4, they are classified into 12 families of connect hop algebra, which are not co-commutative. So in each of So, in each of these 14 families, the members are generally not commutative. So, we have infinitely many connective operators which are not of fine GB dimension, which is neither commutative nor co-commutative, nor coconut negative. But as noticed by the authors, they are all isomorphic as algebras with the universal envelope algebra of some Lie algebra. It seems to suggest something simple. Something simple on the structure. But it's a word to be that simple. Brown, Diomadian, and John, they constructed a connected-grid hub algebra of GK dimension 5, which is not isomorphic as algebra to the universal amyloid of any Lie algebra. So as a class of algebras, declar a connected hop algebra. class connected hope algebra bigger than the bigger than Lie algebra than find that the class of fine-dimensional algebra let's have a look it is an inspiring result example let's take a closer look so here you can see we order these pbdel generators from left to right but the degrees is not the out of degrees is not compatible with the out of the pbd generators so it isn't So it is not a, and we can say, we can finally say that this algebra, this hop algebra is an hop extension of the base field. This all is necessary. And it can make us to assure the letters occurred here, occurred in the commutators has can be controlled. Can be controlled. You can say this B is less than W. And here, A and B are less than Z, and C and B, V and C here is less than W. This is not a special example. This is a general phenomenon. We will see later. Now, okay, now let's then talk about extensions. That ABN algebra and the sigma is an algebra automorphism, and the data is a left sigma derivation. And we write, we can formally define an algebra R to satisfy these four conditions. First, we can assume R is an algebra and contains A as a sub-algebra, and the Z is an element of R. And the variable Z and the coefficient A satisfy this rule. A satisfy this rule. And I is a fully left A module with basis with this basis. And we can see that it is also a fully based as a right A module. And yeah, this is the definition of extension. Taking all extension is a fundamental method to construct non-commuted algebra. And it's a Algebra. And it preserves many nice properties. For example, if a set is a domain, then so is R, and taking R extension also preserves Nasurian being of finite global dimension, and particularly in the connect grid setting. If A is regular, then also, so is R. R is also artificially regular. If an algebra can be If an algebra can be constructed from the base field by iterated or extension, then it must satisfies, it must have nice ring theoretic and homologic properties. So typical examples include the quantum affine space and the well algebras. And as mentioned in the talk of Soria on Tuesday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, we know Tuesday afternoon, we know quantum groups also provide interesting examples. Let G be a semi-simple fine-dimensional, and it's a Titan sub-algebra. And let's FR on to FnR be a basis of the loose system. And for any element in the Y group, choose a reduced expression. Then by the loose ticket automorphism, we can construct a sequence of positive root vectors. root vectors and use these vectors we use these sorted products we can construct a subspace of deposited parts and it's can it is well known that this subset is a sub algebra and we can show that and moreover it is can it is a an iterative oxidation of the base field moreover this is independent of the choice of the irreducci only determined by Determined by W itself. So assume of Hadenbaum and Schneider tells us that when Q is a loot, it's not a loot of unity, then the assignment from W, this assignment will define an association between the well group and the possible homogeneous radical ideal subalgebra. Here, W is equivalent with the right Duffel order. Yes. So by this Yes. So by this theorem, we know if A and B are homogeneous coidial subradium with A is a subspace of B, then we can construct B from A by iterated hop or extension. I want to mention that the positive part is not a hop algebra, but it is a great Hub algebra. Okay, now let's turn to the Hop algebra setting. Now let's actually Hop-elge setting. Now let's actually be a hop algebra. And we call an L extension of H is called a Hop-Aug extension if A is in addition to a Hop algebra and contains H as a Hopper sub-algebra. So Brown and Hug and James Sun and Guangbing Zhong showed that taking hop all extension preserves the connectedness of Hop algebra. And moreover, if K is a hop. However, if k is a half-oxant of h, then the value of the coprots as the actual variable has this form. And the juggerna dimension of k equals to the jug dimension of h plus one. In the same paper, they ask, after change of the variable z, does this value has such kind of such a particular form where a is a group-like element? Group-like elements. And Hong Di Wan, one of our organizers gave it a positive answer when I is noturing and the 10th product is a domain. So several years ago, Professor Lu and Yu Shen and myself have showed every connected grid hop edge of finite GK dimension is an iterative hop extension of the base field. Yeah, this is can be field in. In Lie algebra theory, in the Lie theory, we know that every solvable Lie algebra G has four flags of Lie sub-algebras. This result can yield as a generalization of this fact. This fact. And also, in this theory, we know that for a softball edge, every partial flat can be completed into a full flap. So our main result today can be viewed as a generalization of this fact. And there are more examples of iterative examples of F of the base field. So the commute case and the low GK dimension. Case and the low GK dimensional case, this is by the classification result. And but connect hop alge or fine GK dimension are not necessary iterated hop oxygen of f for example the universal enveloping of simple of rank not equal to one are counterexamples now let's as uh to to generalize these facts we need a pbw type basis Fact, we need a PVW type basis, a relative version of PVW basis. Now, let's let H be a connect group hub altogether, and A and B are homogeneous left co-ideal sub-el. Here, in this case, in the universal enveloping edge case, since it is co-commodal, every co-ideal are sub-algebras. So, there are no this, so there are no in the co-competition, it is just a hop sub-algebras, and then we can see. And then we can find a family of homogeneous elements of positive degree in B and put order on this index set such that the following conditions hold. The first one says the sorted product forms a baseline of B, both as a left A module and as a right A module. And the second says for each C in the data set, In the this set, the left and the right is spanned by such kind of such products. Note that this index are all less or equal than to the given C. Yeah, they are equal. And you know, this space by HC. And then the third question is that this sub comma subsidies is a left, it's a coordinate sub-algebra of H. And if we in the beginning, And if in the beginning, at the beginning A and B are both Hopsub L, then this subspace is also a Hops of L2. And moreover, we can express this computation in terms of this sort product. Then in this expression, this expression can be controlled. That means that every index in the expression of this commutator are less or equal. Commutator are less or equal are less than mu. That's my mu. So, and moreover, the GK dim the incardinality of the index set has is related to the qk dimension by this formula. So if A and B are of finite q k dimension, then this index must be finite. Yeah. And the construction of Construction of the index family and the total order is by so-called cartrinko arguments. The essential ingredients of the construction is the so-called combinatorial tool, Linda Wood. So let's move to the let's move to this next page. Now when assume now, this is our main result. Our main result. Now we assume here we don't assume H to be authentic dimension, but here we assume A and B are of antiquity dimension. And then we can say, because in the pb.tag system, this the index set C now is of M minus M element. So we can fill A and B by a four flag of coadios belt. And each one is a Is a hop as an all extension of the predecessor in Greek sense. So B is an iterative extension of A. And moreover, if B and A are both hopper sub-algebra, then each piece, each layer is also a hopper sub-algebra. So indeed, we can view it as a generalization of this fact. And since H is a connected hub algebra, it has a collateral filtration, and this collateral filter is used to a filter to every coordinate sub-algebra. Then we can say Go A is also a, if A is a coordinate sub-algebra, then Go A is also a coordinal sub-algebra or go H. Since Go H is commutative. Go actually is commutative and so it is uh we can sue. So go A is also a commutative, and by the BBW type of C basis, as mentioned, as mentioned, we can deduce that Go A is also a weighted polynomial algebra. So by standard arguments, we can show every co-ide sub-algebra of fine QGI dimension always have nice properties. For example, the just as connected hopeless. Just as connect hop edge or front GP dimension. And moreover, when in the commute case, we can obtain the results in the algebraic group theorem. Means that the first one can be viewed as a generalization of the Hobbit theorem. Here, A and B are commutative coordinates of A. A and B are commutative coordinate sub-algebras. And then B is a polynomial algebra of A. When A is the case, it is the base field and B is H itself. It is the so-called the Hopper Race theorem. And assume A and B are both of finite JK dimension, then we can feel A to B by a fourth flag of coordinate sub-algebra. co-adio sub-algebras. And uh each one is a polynomial extension, polynomial algebra of the predecessor. Finally, I will present two questions. One now as recall that as we have mentioned that connected hop algebra fine juki dimension are not necessarily iterated hop algenda of the basic field. But all known counter examples are the universal envelope algebra of certain Lie algebra. Algebra or certain Lie algebras. But as we have two, then the first question is: let HB connect hop algebra find JK dimension, Juki dimash. Is it necessary and iterated hop extension of the universal enveloping algebra of its primitive space? So the answer is positive in the following case: SGS commutative and co-commutative. SGS connect gradient is our main result. our main result and when the dimension space of the printed when the dimension space the dimension of the printed space is g g dimension minus one and the last one is the low dim low g dimension case it is by the classification by the classification result uh the second question related to our the second topic the personal geometry of this workshop let's actually connect hope address we can define The connected hope edge, we can define a map we denote by eh to be to be by this formula. Here we take this formula is well defined because since h is connected, then when you take in value as each point element, it is a finite sum. If h is commutative or co-commutative, then this map is an adopted adampotent, and it's called the Olarian adommit adampotent of. Variant identity of H. Now, the Hop-Lara theorem can be described in this form. If H is let H be a commutative connected Hop algebra, then the inclusion map can extend to an isomorphism of algebra. And the degree dimension of H equals the dimension of the vector space dimension of this the image space of EH so as so now let's So now let's H be a kinetic hobby of an Q dimension over the complex number field. And let for simplicity, we let V be this image space. Know that H is commutable. This is a polynomial algebra. And let V be denote this space. Then the dimension of V equals to the Giga dimension is a finite number. And we know that the coordinate ring of V star as a manifold. As a manifold, as a variety, as a fine space equals to the semantic space of V, and this is isomorphic to the Go H. As mentioned by Professor Wu in his talk, we know GoH is a Poisson algebra. And it's a mix of this star of Poisson manifold. When H is the enveloping algebra, then there's a canonical linear isomorphism from G to Linear isomorphism from G to V, and it's dual, it's an isomorphism of Pauson manifolds. So in this theory, there are many results and the simpler leaves of G star is exactly the co-adjoint obvious. There are many results on co-adjoint obvious and their relation to the representation of Lie algebras. So we can ask what can we say about the symbolic leaves of V star and their relation. Of this star and their relation to the representations of H. So, as well here, thanks very much.
