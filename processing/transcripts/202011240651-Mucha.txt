Somehow I miss now, but the situation is as it is, so we shall, how to say, enjoy possibility to at least hear each other. But maybe in the future we meet together all, at least the part of us in a banned or in other nice place. What I plan to talk about today. What I plan to talk about today. So since the talk is 20 minutes, so I just will concentrate on description of the results. Techniques are here very tedious. But anyway, as you looked to my abstract, so then you could, how to say, understand the basic ideas and basic, how to say, challenges in this science. How to say challenges in this subject. So, more or less, as we think about, say, move of compressible flow, so we have a volume of gas here. So, here is t equals zero, and then under some flow, it's transported to say time t equals one. So, the question we'd like to The question we'd like to answer here is the following. If this, how to say, initial configuration, so as we think here about the initial density, can be equal a characteristic function of a set. So somehow we want to have the situation where the gas is just, say, in balloon, and then we remove this interval. Then we remove this interface of the balloon, and we have the situation: we have vacuum and something which is more or less constant. And then, of course, it's propagate under the regime of compressible Navilstock system using the full variability of compressibility. And then we obtain at each time some volume of gas in this vacuum. So, question. In this vacuum, so question which is here important. So, question is what we may say about the behavior of interface in time. So, if we somehow can control the regularity of this interface in time, what we can expect from the very solutions, and if we can dream about the uniqueness of such a flow. Of such a flow. So please note that we concentrate about the admissibility of initial density. So velocity is assumed to be, say, in general, smooth. We do not care about initial regularity of the velocity, but we care about the form of initial density. And we, under the restriction, under the regime of compressible navial stocks, Of compressible navial stocks system, we'd like to concentrate on, I mean, analysis of the evolution of such a phenomenon. In general, what we are able to get, so somehow we distinguish two cases, so one is 2D and second is 3D. So usually, as we split our results into two parts, Results into two parts for systems related to navigable stock systems. So we know that here we aim of solving some problems in large data. And here under small data, of course, only so far we are not able to touch 3D case with essentially large data. So here will be data. So here will be the scripture of the solutions will be more complex. What is important for the all my talk, I will assume that the volume viscosity volume viscosity or bulk viscosity sometimes is called is large. Large. So, somehow we are very close to incompressible flow. So, the idea was that together with Raphael, we did some very interesting result for incompressible, inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes. And then, by some magic tricks, it appears that we are able to shift our result into the regime of incompressible case. Regime of incompressible case, but close to compressible case. Okay. So, what we have just to precise our statement, we think about compressible nervous stock system in classical sense. We have just sought two functions: density and velocity v. First equation is continuity equation. This is the law which we cannot change anything. The second is momentum. anything. The second is momentum lavish stock system. We assume that our pressure is of barotropic type and in general is given, it can be given by the just power law. And in case two and three, this solution will be more than weak, so we assume that gamma must be greater than one. There is no extra growth conditions. Is no extra growth conditions. What is important is coefficients are constants, and somehow we think about this mean as a viscosity which is given, can be put one, can be put one, and this part which is responsible for compressibility is put to be large. So this is the basic. So, this is the basic assumption we consider. Okay. I will try to control my time. We start two minutes ago. Pedris. You are really wasting your own time. Sorry to say that. Okay, okay. We finish at 10 minutes after the hour. Finish at 10 minutes after the hour, so you still have exactly 14 minutes. Okay. So, in that case, I will be faster. So, then, as I told, we have the constant coefficient. And for simplicity, we consider the problem on the torus, and we have only initial data. There is no boundary terms. So, just to be rough, what about the state of the art? So, first of all, we have weak solutions. All we have weak solutions. The first and the most famous results are due to Leon's and Edward. It was say more or less 30 years ago. Then some years ago, there was some other attack of the problem by Brecht and Jabin. And somehow, this is the classical weak solutions. And these solutions obeys, do not go into details, a weak. Go to details, a weak, I mean, energy inequality. So, this is one thing. The second, concerning some better properties of the solutions, so this is regularity uniqueness. So, here the theory is not clear so far, in general theory. There are something like weak, strong uniqueness, which says that as we have weak solution and maybe strong solution, so then must be the same. Same. So, this is quite interesting theory, but one slide which is somehow important, I will just note in this summer there appears in a preprint concerning blow-up for this type of equation. And it shows that as we have smooth initial solutions, so then in finite time we can obtain blow-up of solutions. So, this is a very special case, but of course, this is an example of blow-up. An example of blow-up, so we shall take care of it and look for this problem more carefully. Concerning the positive results, so of course the story starts from Nishida and Matsumura 40 years ago. It was the very simple result concerning global in-time solutions under assumption of small data. There is some, how to say, modification. How to say modification of it for the case of vacuum, but somehow what we'd like to aim is the question: what about the irregular solutions? So, we aim on starting the solution to be irregular as this characteristic functions. And more or less, instead of saying precisely the details of theorem, Of theorem, I just will give some description of the result. So, first of all, we have compressed the Bulnavier-Stokes equation. We start that initial data is, say, smooth in H1. And moreover, we consider very large viscosity. And then, this is some structure. This is some structured assumption that initial compressibility, I mean, divergence of Î¼ must be also quite small. So we can think about the solution of compressible flow, which is very close to incompressible one, but in the regime of compressible Navier-Stokes system, and then we are able to show the existence of global, this is important here, at least one global solution. Global solution, but with uniformly in time bonded density. What's the problem? What's the problem with this solution? The problem is the degeneration of the equation. As we have part of Navier Stock system, Navier stock system, so then we have part which looks like this. So, even as we assume that velocity is very, very smooth, so this guy is just bounded, L infinity. So, it means that we are not able to get very high regularity. So, in particular, as we are thinking precisely about the techniques and the result we get. And the result we get, so we got only the divergence of v is in, say, l1 in time l infinity space. So for the phase first view, it looks that this is enough to have uniqueness. But then it appears that in general case, it is not so simple. So we think that this is unique, but we have no idea how to. That this is unique, but we have no idea how to prove. Why? The problem is we've lost irregularity, as we have divergence of the velocity only in L infinity, so then we do not control gradient of V in L infinity. And in order to make the issue of uniqueness simple, we need to go to Lagrangian coordinates. Lagrangian coordinates. This is say the simplest, maybe very technical, but from how to say ideological viewpoint, very elementary. So we do not need to create any special theory. We need to have this guy in L infinity in space. And this is impossible. This is impossible. And to explain it, it is very, how to say, quite obvious at the level of. quite obvious at the level of compressible Navier-Stokes system, because what we know is effective viscous flux. And effective viscous flux is say a bit better. I will call it smooth, of course, this is not smooth, but smooth enough. But on the other hand, as we think about initial density, which is just a character, Which is just a characteristic function. So it suffers a jump, it's only bounded. So then pressure is also bounded. So this guy, even this is smooth, is also bound. So we cannot expect any extra regularity. So somehow this is important. So having this existence result, what we have? We have quite regular solution from physical. Regular solution from physical viewpoint. This is very well physical solutions which obey energy identity in a strong sense. It has global in time, this is important, uniform bound of the density, and plenty other properties, but in general case there is no uniqueness. Okay, so this is the first part which is somehow important. Second is said that situation That situation is not so bad. So, somehow, in the case of perfect gas, as the pressure is given as a linear function of the row, adopting or rather generalizing techniques of Hoff for uniqueness, we are able to show this result, but only in this special case. So, this is quite tricky. It based on It based on analysis of H minus one norm of the difference of the density. And then by duality, we are able to show the uniqueness. And somehow, this is the basic problem that we cannot extend these techniques for the general pressure law as in the first place. So, somehow, summing up, we have the situation we have pretty regular solutions, but uniqueness holds just for. Holds just for perfect gas, and the general question concerning uniqueness is an open problem. Okay, so naturally we obtain local in-time well-posedness, and then we can kick out the assumptions about the largeness of volume density. What is important, so to our best knowledge, and we spent many years working for the inhomogeneous. Working for the inhomogeneous navigation. This is the first example which shows us the rigorous limit of compressible navial stock system to inhomogeneous compressible one globally in time. So we had some results on it. We found many results, but never it was possible to obtain really strong. To obtain really strong, somehow stability result where it's possible to treat compressible Navier-Stock system as a perturbation of incompressible inhomogeneous fluids. So this case includes also the situation of density is characteristic function of some measurable set. So this is quite important. And here we shall remember. And here we shall remember that limit solution is all the time unique. So from that reason, we have some hope that it will be possible to prove uniqueness. Okay, but in the case of density is regular, so it means initial gradient is a function. So then using some very simple modification of Nautil theory, Modification of Norman theory, we are able to use to prove uniqueness of the solutions. And as usual in this case, so what we had for 2D is large data. So 2D is large data, large data provided that this bulk viscosity is huge, but 3D requires. But 3D requires smallness. So here we need a smallness of data just in order to control growth of nonlinear term comes from velocity. And but this is somehow expected restriction. Okay, so what is important? Important is we need to remember that we are not on the level of regular solutions because we are not able to say anything about the gradient of the data. To say anything about the gradient of the density, but we are higher, essentially higher than weak solutions. And at the end, as we show that this viscosity is zero, just to recall, we obtain this nice picture of inhomogeneous navigatoxis. Now, since I have two minutes, probably as I see, there is an answer for very interesting questions. For very interesting questions. So, the question is about the set level. So, as we think about the situation of this, how to say, model case as the initial density is characteristic function, so then we think how evolves this initial set. So, here the situation is not so optimal because compressible navigator systems still is. Personal Navier-Stokes system still is treated as a hyperbolic system. So we are able to define characteristic, somehow Lagrangian coordinates, but in a weak sense. So we do not have gradient of velocity is not bounded. So then we need to use so-called regular Lagrangian coordinates, where only change of the co I mean Jacobian of the change of the coordinates is bounded. The coordinates is bounded. So, somehow this quantity is well posed, inverse, not so much. And then we can put the following question. So, we can think about, say, set where the function initial density is zero, and then we can think what how this set V zero. Set V0 will change in time. So, of course, the formal definition is like that. We take a flow and then we see what is the result of it. And questions the following. So, assume that this initial boundary, the initial interface slips, is continuous. So, then it appears that during the time we lose regularity in that way, that it becomes a helder class function with the following. With the following exponent. And the exponent is given by, say, Locke-Lipschitz norm in the way that, as we control divergence, rotation, and some lower norm, so then we are able to control this coefficient. So somehow for each time, we know that this is finite. But are you writing zero? Yes? I mean, how much time is still need? Okay, I can just. Okay, I can just say thank you. So, it's better just to stop? No, I mean, I'm not just basically, I would like you to draw us the conclusion. So, okay, the conclusion are that somehow the most interesting part from the result is the estimate from the density. So, we consider the following quantity, which is somehow popular in the weak theory, as we take weak theory. So, then we really consider this. So, then we really consider this type of part of the system, and then we consider the positive part of it. And then, thanks to the magic of the compressible Navier-Stokes system, we are able this type of inequality. So, please know that this guy is not important at all. But here is a very nice factor which is positive. So, somehow we have a dumping, and the right-hand side parts are well controlled. Are well controlled. So it means that as we compute everything in precision, we are able finally to get very simple estimates, which at the beginnings look just local in time. But this restriction depends on the viscosity ni. And then it appears that we are able finally put t equal to infinity and got global in time estimate. So somehow this is one element which I This is one element which I'd like to show. Second is the uniqueness. There's no second, Piotr. I said to conclude. And second conclusion is just uniqueness, which more or less based on the fact. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Piotr. Other questions? Other questions? Yes, please. Go ahead, Emil. About this interesting contour dialogue. About this interesting contour dynamics result where you consider the boundary of the vacuum region. Was that for which equation was that? Was that for the incompressible non-homogeneous or even for the compressible Navier-Stokes? No, no, no. This is everything here was for compressible Navier-Stokes. So it was not for inhomogeneous, because for inhomogeneous, we lose no regularity. Okay. So what if you consider an external force like gravity? Consider an external force like gravity, then you would expect some kind of Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Um, but then this is a different story. Yes, this is a different story and uh put me in that way that as we have external force, so first of all, as we are in the whole space, so then we need to have some stabilization. If it is well posed, first, this is not clear if it is well posed as we take external force because maybe more natural would be just to consider free boundaries problems. And we have just water wave equation where we have completely different aspects and story is more unclear. But in the case as we would just put gravity here, say, but Uh, but same we can take Dirichlet data, for example, in a box. So, if we are able to repeat this system, so gravity is smooth, so up to so result definity will stay global in time, but I'm not quite sure what happened about global estimates, if global estimate of If the global estimate of the density will be uniform in time, so the solution can grow in time, but in infinity. Because, but provided this situation that we do not assume that we have some, how to say, that we do not have any bound of the domain. So we do not have free boundary. Because for free boundary problem, it's a completely different story. Thank you. Thank you. But this is a very good question concerning this force, but even without the force, the problem is tedious. So this is the, so there is plenty of techniques. This is the repetition somehow of the case of inhomogeneous incompressible case, which was simple from the viewpoint of techniques, and then appears that as we turn on the compressible law, so then there is a plenty of things which must be controlled. Okay, other questions or comments? Well, there are these solutions that were proposed long time ago by David Hoff, and they had kind of similar regularity to the issue. What Hoff did, because somehow the uniqueness, what we do, is it's hard to mimic. We are using these ideas of H minus one solution. It was for. Minus one solution. It was for small data. I think, yeah, in his case, the problem was that actually uniqueness was in a different class than existence.
