from the University of Maryland speaking about finite conjugacy classes and split exact co-chain complexes. Well thank you very much for the invitation to give a talk here. I'm in the middle of my family holiday so I haven't been So I haven't been able to fully participate in everything here, but been looking at some things offline. Anyway, I won't be talking about the total disconnected local compact group specifically today. I'm going to be talking about, well, the setting here is for discrete groups, but Is for discrete groups, but really, it's uh there's an easy transfer to local compact groups, which I haven't done here, so I'll just be talking about discrete groups. But much of what I'm saying has sort of obvious generalizations to locally compact groups. Okay, and the specific topic I'll be talking about is cohomology of Banach modules. Banach modules, so group actions on Banach spaces and cohomology. And it will give you some, it's a different perspective on some of the work that has been done in this quite active area of analysis, group theory, and topology. All right, so let me. All right, so let me get started. It's going to be quite basic, much of it, because I think it's better to get everyone along. All right, so let me start out with introducing Barnac modules and the associated cohomology of these. So, as I said, I'm just looking at the countable discrete groups, but you can generalize this. Can generalize this rather easily. Okay, so G is always going to be some countable discrete group, quite often finitely generated, but that's not needed in this setting. So a Banach G module is just a pair of a Banach space, so some with a fixed norm, and an action which I will always denote pi. always denote pi so an action by of g on x by continuous linear automorphisms of of x so these are bounded linear operators acting on x okay now the space x can be real or complex but typically in this setting you focus on real spaces and I'll always assume that the spaces are real but again you can that can be That can be generalized. All right, and the module that we have here, so there's no continuity in G because it's a countable discrete group. Of course, if you have some local compact group, you want to have this representation to be strongly continuous. So it's a jointly continuous action, at least in the isometric setting. At least in the isometric setting. So I say that the module is isometric if the action is by linear isometries of X. Okay, now associated to the Banach module, you have the standard co-chain complex defined over it. So this is just a sequence of vector spaces. So Cn. So Cn g of X is the vector space of all maps from the enfold products of G, of copies of G into X. And so in other words, well, we have done X basis, X, and so really the this Cn of G X is a countable product of Banach's. Is a countable product of Banach spaces and therefore itself Frechet space. So that means that it's a completely metrizable locally context topological vector space. I won't be using much of that, but it's just a complete metrizability, which means that some of the basic theorems of functional analysis are valid here. So the open mapping theorem, the closed graph theorems, etc. Etc. Okay, now G0, this is just so the empty product of G has only one element. So that means that C0 of Gx, this is just the copy, it's a product of one copy of X. So therefore, you'll often just denote it by X itself rather than this C0. But that's the first space you start out with in this. Space you start out with in this in our code chain complex, so a copy of X itself. Okay, and we call the elements of C and X, GX, the N co-chains. Okay, so I haven't talked about these boundary operators and the co-boundary operators D are the homomorphisms in the co- Homomorphisms in the co-chain complex. So these are linear operators, continuous linear operators between these Frechet spaces. Okay, the formula here, I've written it out in all details, is of course a bit complicated. So if you're not used to working with it, you won't remember this formula. I'll just state what the two firsts of those maps are. First of those maps are. Okay, so the first, so we recall that the C0 of Gx, this is really just X itself. You identify a map, a constant map with the particular value it takes in X. So what does it do? So it gives you, so I start out with a map with a constant value X. I apply this co-boundary operator to it, and I get now. Operator to it, and I get now a map of a single group variable outputting or mapping into the Banach space X. And what is it defined as? Well, you just apply, so you use apply G1 to X and then to subtract X. So that's the So that's the first co-boundary operator. And the second one is a bit more complicated. So it takes a map phi of a single group variable and outputs now a map of two group variables. Okay, and it's just given by this formula. So D2 applied to phi now has two group variables, G1, G2, and it's given by this formula, pi of G1 applied to phi of. applied to phi of g2 plus phi of g1 minus phi of the product of the two group elements all right now so for all cohomology of course the fundamental property of this co-chain complex is that the composition of two of these is zero okay in other words that the That the image of one is contained in the kernel of the next one. And therefore, you can define the cohomology of the module to be the quotient of two spaces, which are the space of co-cycles, okay, so which is the kernel of one and And so divided out by the space of co-boundary, which is the image of the previous one. Okay, so that's the cohomology of the nth cohomology of this coaching complex, of the Banach module, if you wish. Okay, now I'd like to specifically concentrate on Specifically, concentrate on affine isometric actions and where one cohomology is really a representation of that. Okay, so let's have the concrete interpretation of the first couple of levels of cohomology. Well, again, so I say that the first co-boundary map, it takes A co-boundary map, it takes a single vector x and gives a function of a single group variable, which is just given by this formula. Okay, so it evaluated at g, it gives you pi of g applied to x minus x itself. Okay, so if you look at the coachings, The co-chains, the code cycles. So, this is just the kernel of the first operator. So, which ones are those? So, those are the x's in the Aubanach space that are fixed by all the group elements. So, in other words, the kernel of my D1, it's the space of G invariant vectors that I'll just denote XG. Similarly, we had an expression for the second co-boundary operator, d2. So, and in this case, you find that the space of one co-cycles now is a set of all maps from g to x that satisfy the cocycle equation, which is given here below. It's simply that I have an explicit. simply that I have an explicit equation for phi evaluated at a product of two group elements. So phi of g times f is just pi of g applied to phi of f. Remember, this is phi of f is an element in my Banach space and pi of g is a linear operator on my Banach space. And then plus phi of g here. Okay, so that's the co-cycle equation associated with it. With it. All right, so why is this particularly interesting? Well, we have an explicit interpretation of co-cycles. So let's take a step back and look at a different type of objects, namely continuous affine automorphisms of Banach spaces. Okay, so if I have a continuous affine automorphism, Continuous affine automorphism, so just a continuous affine map of X that is subjective, bijective. You can always write this as follows here. So A applied to X is just A of X plus a vector A, where so capital A is a bounded linear, so linear automorphism of X. So linear automorphism of x and this lowercase a lowercase a is the translation part of my affine automorphism. So that means that if you think if you try to compose two such affine automorphisms, you'll get a formula for how the translation parts and the linear parts compose and you'll find that And you'll find that a group action of G by affine continuous affine automorphisms on X, this corresponds exactly to a pair where I have pi, which is an action by linear automorphisms, and phi, this is the translation part, it measures, it just measures this lowercase a of the translation. A of the translation of the vector of the affine map. And this fulfills the co-cycle equation that I described before. So you just compose two such affine automorphisms and you find this that the translation part just behaves in this way. That of a product is explicit in terms of phi of. terms of V of F and V of G. Summing up, that means that for a fixed Banach G module, X pi, we have a bijective correspondence between the space of co-cycles or one cocycles and the class of all continuous affine actions with linear parts or linear part pi. Okay, so if you fix the linear part Part and then you look at the space of all affine continuous affine actions with that specific linear part, you get just the space of cocycles. Just a second. All right, and this correspondence is, of course, yeah. Yeah. Okay, so now the all right so the also so what are the co-boundaries? So the co-boundaries were particular co-cycles. They were the images of this co-boundary operator applied to X. Okay, so what is that? So those are just the specific cocycles, so the specific So, the specific affine actions where the affine action is really just a linear action where you've translated the origin to x. It's nothing but taking the original linear action, except that you now just move the origin around. So it's just conjugated by this specific linear translation. Specifically, in a translation to X itself. Now, so what does that mean? It means that the cohomology, the first cohomology, it measures the complexity of all affine actions with this specific linear part, pi, modulo those that fix a vector in x. Okay, so we think of all these just moving the origin around in the space and using the same linear. In the space, I'm using the same linear action. That shouldn't really, that should be a negligible collection, negligible, sort of insignificant change of the linear action. And so we modulo, we take those out. So the cohomology measures then the complexity of what remains. This also means that. This also means that we now have both two interpretations of the first cohomology. You can either approach it geometrically by studying affine actions, affine group actions on Barnac spaces, or you can study it algebraically. You have this machinery of cohomology, and you can just sort of study this purely algebraic. Study this purely algebraically without really thinking about what it represents in terms of geometry. Of course, if you study it geometrically, often the geometry of the Banach space will become very apparent, whereas if you study it algebraically, well, it might not be apparent in the same way. You might use it sort of more, it might come up more operator. It might come up more operator algebraically by saying something about the linear operators on the Banach spaces. Okay, there. All right. Group algebra. All right. Now, let me just say a few words about group algebra because this will be the second main tool. The second main tool that I'm using here. Now, so the real group algebra, real because I'm working with real Banach spaces. So this is associated with group G is just a vector space of all formal linear combinations of group elements of G. Okay, so alternatively, you can view each element of the group algebra as just a finite disability. Algebra is just a finitely supported real-valued function on g and therefore you of course so there are two ways of introducing the products in the group algebra either you think of it as the bilinear extension of the of the multiplication in the group or if in case you view it as uh as the group ele the group algebra elements as finitely supported functions Finitely supported functions, then it's really just the convolution products of these elements viewed as finitely supported meshes, signed meshes. So if you just use this convolution product, or you take the bilinear extension of the group multiplication, you get this group algebra, and this is just an R. Is just an R algebra. Okay, so inside of this, of course, you can look at various subsets. So, one that is most immediate for us is group simplex, which is just a set of all convex combinations of elements of G. So I don't look at all, I don't look at the whole group algebra, I just look at this convex subsets of that. Okay, so it's a set of all ψ in the group algebra that are positive as functions and they have mean one. Also, so if I have a Banach G module, okay, then of course this the linear action pi, I can view it. I can view it as a map from G into the algebra of linear operators on X, and therefore it canonically extends to the R algebra, to a representation of R algebras, because this G is a free basis for this algebra. And I'll extend other things later on. Things later on. Okay, so let's just see what we can do with what we have so far. So these are very basic notions that we've introduced. And the first thing we can do is that with these simple tools, we can actually prove a result on complementation of one cohomology. Okay, so let me do it in this specific setting that I have a finite generating. Generating set S for the group G, and I have started out now with an isometric Banach G module. So that means that I have a linear isometric action of G on my Banach space X. Okay, so we say that X has almost invariant vectors. If for every epsilon, I can find a unit vector that's epsilon invariant. Epsilon invariant under all the generators. So that pi g of x is epsilon close to x for all generators g. And then in case you have what is called the uniformly convex isometric Banach G module, so uniformly convex means just that you have That you have that the unit sphere has uniformly positive curvature. Okay, and then the fact of not having almost invariant vectors is in fact the same as the following operator being invertible. Okay, so what is that? That is just, so you define an element in this the group simplex, which is just the average of your generators. Okay, so if you take the average of the generators, of course, you get the element the group simplex. Element the group simplex, and then you apply pi to this element of the group algebra, and you take the difference. Okay, so that operator being invertible is the same as x not having almost invariant unit vectors. So, one direction is obvious, the second direction uses the uniform convexity in an essential way. It's still rather simple. It's still rather simple, but okay. So, if you define ψ as this average of the generators, you can now define a weighted average operator on the set of co-chains here as follows. So, you just evaluate phi as the negative of the error of this. Of this weighted average. Okay, so I evaluate phi of all group elements and then I just multiply with my psi, of the values of psi. Okay, and if you have that, then it's quite easy to compute the composition now of this weighted, the negative weighted average operator, and my first co-boundary operator. First co-boundary operator. Okay, so remember that this first co-boundary operator was the one that vector x simply gave you this pi g of x minus x. So if I just take this average here, well, writing changing summing in here, I'll write that you get this. You get this, that this is just minus the identity operator minus pi of xi applied to x. Okay, so in other words, what do you get? You get that you find that this operator, i minus pi c, this fact is, so this is not. This factors, so this is an operator that goes from x to x itself, and it factors through the space of co-chains, one co-chains, just via the first co-boundary operator and then this operator arcsa. That's just what was written above here. In particular, In particular, if the top, this operator is invertible, so that was the horizontal operator here that goes from x to x itself. Okay, and I just described when it was invertible. That was when the Banach module, the isometric Banach module, did not have almost invariant vectors. Well, then you can get, then you get from that an item. You get from that an idempotent operator, so meaning a projection that goes from the co-chains to the co-chains. Its image, so this projection, a linear projection, will have image that of the first co-boundary operator, which is exactly the set of co-boundaries in. Coboundaries in other set of one co-boundaries. And what is this projection? Well, it's just this composition here. And the fact that it's a projection is just because that the composition of R ψ with D1 is exactly this I minus pi ψ. And so once you have a projection. And so, once you have a projection, you get a complementation of the underlying topological vector spaces, in this case, the Frechet spaces. And so we get a direct and quite instructive proof of the strengthening of a result due to Piotranovak. So, a strong form of it, namely that. Namely, that so you start out with a uniformly convex isometric Banach G module without almost invariant vectors, and from that you get the decomposition of the co-chain, of the space of co-chains into the space of co-boundaries, so B1, and its complement, namely the kernel of the projection. Of the projection, and that turns out just to be the set of phi that are null under the in the kernel of this arc psi. Okay, well, so what can you use that for? Well, if you remember the expression for the cohomology, the cohomology is, so I have, so this is the space of co-chains. Is the space of co-chains. If I go to the co-cycle, so that's a subspace of this C here. It's a subspace Z1. It contains B1. So if I go to the subspace, I also get a complementation result. And from that, I find in particular that the first cohomology has a direct expression as a set of co-cycles, of one co-cycle. Co-cycles of one co-cycles that are null under this operator arcsi. Okay, so in particular, so you get this direct calculation of these objects. Now, this was the first simple result. So, let me go. Very simple result. So let me go further with this. And for this, I need to extend cohomology to a more general setting, a more complicated setting. So similar to extending the representation of G on X as linear operators to the group algebra. The group algebra. You can also extend every co-chain. So, this is a map again. So, if I have an n co-chain, so this is a map from the n-fold product of copies of G into X. And I can extend it uniquely to an N multilinear map on these group algebras. Okay, so from Rg times Rg, etc. Now, this is a bit too Now, this is a bit too much, so I'll just restrict this extension to something smaller, namely to the info product of the group simplex. So I don't get an n-multilinear map because the group simplex is simply not a vector space. What I do get is they are only convex spaces, of course, inside the group algebra, and therefore I get a restriction to an n-multi-affine map. To an n multi-affine map into x. Again, I'll just write the cn of delta g x. This is the collection of all these extensions. These are canonical extensions of the co-chains to n multi-affine maps. As before, you can define co-boundary maps between. You can define co-boundary maps between the space of co-chains, these expanded code chains by the same formula as before. Again, you won't be able to remember the formula immediately, but what it does turn out is that you actually have a commutative diagram with vertical. With vertical isomorphisms here. So the co-chains of G and those of delta G, well, they're the same. They're canonical extensions. And so you've got a commutative diagram. So really, you haven't changed anything. So the extension here commutes with the co-boundary maps, which is why we need to restrict ourselves to the simplex, to the group simplex. To the simplex, to the group simplex, and we can't go all the way to the group algebra where this diagram would not be commutative. Okay, so that means that we don't really need to distinguish between phi and the multiaffine extension of it. So, for example, if I so I'm just gonna conflate the notion of phi and its multi-affine. phi and it's a multi-affine extension and just think of a co-chain as really being defined on the not just on group elements but on the elements of the group simplex so delta of g okay so for example if you look at this operator r  from before well i said it was a weighted average but But really, what that so it was a weighted average, but it's defined on delta of for xi and delta of g. So really what you can write it as is simply that arcsi of phi is the negative of the phi evaluated at this element of the group simplex psi. And again, now using Now, using this extension, you get simple algebraic proofs of other results from the literature, in particular, a result of Bada-Fierman and Galanda-Moneau, which says that if I've got two finitely generated groups and a uniformly convex isometric Banach module for the product group, and I assume again it has no. Again, it has no almost invariant unit vectors. And I also assume that neither g nor f have invariant vectors. So not having invariant vectors is weaker than not having almost invariant vectors. So the the group, the product of the two doesn't have almost invariant vectors and the the individual groups don't have invariant vectors. Groups don't have invariant vectors. Then you find that the first cohomology is zero. So, in other words, every affine isometric action with this linear part given by the module action as a fixed point. Okay, let me just explain a bit about how that. Explain a bit about how that is proved. Well, by the assumptions of the theorem, you can find elements of the group simplexes, xi and zeta, so that i minus pi of the product psi zeta is invertible. And neither of pi xi nor pi zeta have non-zero fixed points on the From before, we get this direct sum decomposition of the space of co-cycles into the space of co-boundaries plus the co-cycles that are zero on the product of xi and zeta. Now, in fact, for co-cycles, ah, sorry, I want to go, I got ahead of myself. So, the conclusion of the theorem is that. Of the theorem is that the cohomology is zero. So, what does this mean? Well, it means that, of course, P1 equals Z1. So, what I have to show is that really the I have to show that the complement here to the right of B1 in Z1 is null. So, in other words, if I have a co-cycle that Co-cycle that's zero on the product of C and Zeta, I have to show that it's constantly zero. That's the goal. Now, so if you start out with one of these fee that are the co-cycle with that is zero on the products, then On the products, then, well, I had C was belonging to delta of G and Zeta belonging to delta of F and G and F, they commute. So I have that these elements of the group simplicities, they also commute. And if you write that out, you get expressions for zero in various ways. Well, phi of this product. Phi of this product, but I can use the cocycle equation for this cocycle here. I can write it in one way, or I can flip the order around and I can write it, expand it the other way. So I use the co-cycle equation in two different ways. And now you just have to fiddle around with this, play around with this equation. This equation, and you can now get an expression of, for example, phi of xi as various things here. And for example, you see that phi of psi is actually equal to pi of psi zeta applied to phi of psi. So that means that phi of psi must be zero because actually the be zero because actually the this invert this i minus pi of psi zeta is invertible and therefore there are no invariant vectors under this non non-serial invariant vectors under this this linear operator and similar arguments then you continue in the same way and you get that actually phi is zero on all f's and all g's All F's and all G's, which is what you wanted to show. So it's a simple algebraic calculus once you have this proper setup. Now, for co-chain complexes, the main thing here was split exactness. So suppose I start out with the groups G and F, and I've got two different Two different modules, a G module X and a G F module Y. Okay, so a co-chain map between the associated standard co-chain complexes is a sequence of linear operators that go from one set of code chains to the other, a space of code chains. So you have a commute. So, you have a commutative diagram here. So, I just go from the G module to the F module. Okay, and you want this to commute. And because it commutes with the co-boundary map, it follows that T induces a map on the cohomology. It maps co-cycles to co-cycles and co-bound. And co-boundaries into the space of co-boundaries. And therefore, you get a map of co-homology that factors through to the quotient. And we say that the co-chain map is non-homotopic if you can find continuous linear operators. These are that take n plus one co-chains down to n co-chains, and you get an expression. And you get an expression for it in this way. So that's the diagram here. It's only that you get, it's not a commutative diagram, you only get this expression here that to go down here, you go, you sum up the two ways, alternative ways of going from one to the other. The other now, the central fact that we'll need is that a null homotopic co-chain map induces zero map on cohomology. Okay, so if I have one that is non-homotopic, then it will map the first one cohomology to zero and the second cohomology. And the second cohomology. Okay, now because I'm working with discrete groups, if I now I'll write the commutants, I'll compute the commutants of G in the group algebra. For local compact groups, you get more interesting objects, but for discrete groups, if I take the commutants of my group, Take the commutants of my group in the ambient group algebra. Well, then I just get the span of finite conjugacy classes in the group. So I take a finite conjugacy class, I take its average, the sum of elements in it, and then I take the span of all such elements of the group algebra. And that's the Algebra and that's the commute terms and now we get the following proposition namely that I start out with a group and a Banach G module and I take some elements in the in the group simplex which belongs to the commutants of G. Then the co-chain map that takes phi and post-composes it with this operator I minus pi xi. Operator I minus pi C is null homotopic. And in fact, this null homotopy is witnessed by a sequence of operators where the that has this expression here. And the first of those is just this arc ψ that I've been talking about. That I've been talking about that have come has come up several times. Okay, and so I need one more fact about the Banach G modules. Okay, now so this is general for a group and a Banach G module that the identity map on the code chain complex Co-chain complex being null homotopic. This is equivalent to there being just one invertible null homotopic co-chain map. Of course, the identity map is invertible, and it's not too surprising that if there's an invertible null homotopic co-chain map, then actually also the identity is null-homotopic. So, more interestingly, is that all these things are That all these things are equivalent to the co-chain complex being split exact. Okay, so not only is all the cohomologies of all degrees, or the cohomologies of all degrees, they're zero, but in fact, the image of the space of co-boundaries is complemented in the space of co-chains for all n. For all n. So I showed that this happens for the first, so in C1, that we had this complementation of one cohomology. We got that it was split exact around C1, but now we are talking about split exactness of the whole code chain complex. Complex. Okay, and so now observe that. So if I have this ψ in the group simplex and the commutant of g, okay, where this operator i minus pi of psi is invertible, well, then I find that the corresponding co-chain map, well, Well, on the one hand, I knew it was null homotopic, that was the previous proposition, but it's certainly also invertible because the operator i minus pi psi is invertible. So how do I get the invertibility of the co-chain map? Well, I just post-compose with the inverse of this i minus pi xi. Okay, so I have a null homotopic and invertible co-chain map. All right, so let's take a simple instance of this. Okay, for example, let's take the FC center of my group G. So this is the set of group elements with finite conjugacy classes. Okay, and then I get the following theory. Okay, so suppose you have a group and a uniformly convex isometric Banach module, so that X does not have almost phi invariant unit vectors. So I use, so I ask that as an as a module for the FC center, I don't have all Center, I don't have almost invariant unit vectors. Well, then the coast chain complex here is split exact. Okay, so not only do I get vanishing co-homology, but I actually get much more, that split exactness of the whole co-chain complex. And I've used too much time, so I think this was the end of my talk. Okay, okay, so in pass. Talked about today. Okay, so in particular, you have vanishing of cohomology. Now, you can get various more refined results by looking at more complicated setups, but this is the main situation I wanted to explain. Okay, well, thanks for your attention. Thanks, Christian. Any quick questions? Yeah, could I ask about the last theorem? Yeah. The FC, I got the impression the FC center came in somehow, but I don't see where it's in this statement of the theory. Invariant unit vectors. Okay, so the FC center is phi. Okay, right, yes. Okay, so I have, so I have the, so I have the group. I mean, if you have an FC group, then of course you can just think of that case. It's a bit trivial, but if you have an FC group and a uniformly constant, And a uniformly convex isometric Banach module without almost invariant vectors, then you get the split exactness of the co-chain complex. But you have a group and its FC center. So I have the uniformly convex Banach module. And then I assume that just A and then I assume that just the FC center does not have almost invariant unit vectors. All right, yes, okay. You need the FC center to be finitely generated to this there's no finite generation of the FC center. Yeah, that's actually things a lot a lot easier if you just Well, I mean okay. The it it's you're right in some sense the the FC sensor doesn't need to be finitely generated, but what you're using to say that the FC sensor does not have almost invariant June effects is that there's a finitely generated subgroup of the FC sensor that does not have almost invariant June. Have invariant, almost invariant unit vectors necessarily. Okay, so really you could just pass to that subgroup and right. Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, you just need something there to give you the operating. Yeah, I wonder too, is what about, well, I have a couple of other questions, but perhaps I'll only ask one of them. You talked about the group hours just being a thing. algebra just being the things with finite support but what about uh say L1 group algebra is that considered at all is that coming into the picture here well if in this specific case I I'm not doing it because I'm working with the discrete groups you could of course extend this but you have to be a bit careful because you want to You have to ensure that well, I would rather say that in the local compact case, of course, you want to go to some Banach algebra, enveloping Banach algebra that comes from the set of representations that you're looking at. Okay, if you're looking at unitary representations, you take the full C style. You take the full C star algebra of the group algebra of the group C star algebra of your group. Okay, and if you look at other types of Banach spaces, uniformly convex, etc., you'd want to take some completion of the group algebra with respect to this set of representations. Respect to this set of representations. Right, so you go to some natural completion for the representations rather than just say L1 convergent. Yeah. Yeah, right. Okay, thank you. All right, so we should probably leave any more questions till after. Leave any more questions till after the next talk. So, thank you, Christian, again.
