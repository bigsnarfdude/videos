25, 30 minutes, but that includes five for questions. I'll give you a five-minute warning before the question time. Please go ahead. Gavin will be talking about levitating nano-diamond experiments. Thanks very much, Rob, and thanks to the organizers, to Lucian and Flaminia, for this putting on this great show and for letting me tell you. Letting me tell you about some of the work that we've been doing. I'm gonna talk about. So, I'm an experimentalist and we're building an experiment that we want to use to test quantum gravity. And it's a long way, it's a long journey, but you know, I'd like to describe some of the ideas that we're proposing and how we're getting on with building it. So lots of people have contributed to this as part of a collaboration. Sagata Bose in UCL has been very key. He's a theorist. He's talking in this meeting. Along with Anapam is another collaborator who's talking in this meeting, who also has helped out with all the theory on this. Myung Shik Kim, his group in Imperial, my groups in Warwick, also. My groups in Warwick, also Martin Plenio and Julian Pennalis in Ulm, and Ollie Williams, his work is highlighted later on in my talk. And this is, of course, what my research group looks like these days without the, you know, since we've started this terrible pandemic. So let's get on to Get on to the stuff I actually want to talk about. Now, we all know from quantum mechanics that there can be a superposition such as this. This is supposed to represent an atom in a superposition of being on the left and being on the right. And think about a Stern-Gerlach here. I'd like you to think about a Stern-Gerlach that starts with a spin in a spin superposition and then the inhomogeneous magnetic. Then the inhomogeneous magnetic field gives us this supersition of the atom being in two different places. And then in 1935, Schr√∂dinger was telling us about his cat. And obviously, that's a much more massive thing. And this is a supersonic of a cat being inside a house and outside of a house. Obviously, this experiment hasn't been demonstrated, and we're not using such large masses. Using such large masses, but it turns out that we can work in this space in between. We're quite happy with much lower masses. And I'll be talking about masses that you get from a billion or 10 billion atoms. So I'm talking about a nanoparticle with about 10 to the minus 15 kilograms in mass. And we want to have that in a superposition of being in two different. Superposition of being in two different places. And this superposition distance here between the two possible places is important as well. It's not just about the mass. And a third important thing is the time, the time that this superposition state is maintained for. So to do something exciting with all this stuff, we need to have a large mass, superposition distance, and time. But let me be more specific about all this later. So, I won't talk about the history too much, but people have thought about this stuff for a very long time. This drawing here comes from this famous 1957 conference in Chapel Hill, where again Feynman was thinking about a Stern Gerlach, where you could have a superposition created here. A superposition created here, and then these interconnections are supposed to turn that superposition into a superposition of a ball, like a one-centimeter ball, being in two different positions. So, this is just what I was talking about. And Feynman goes on to say, wouldn't it be great to not just create this superposition of the mass in two different places, but then to interfere it? So, starting up at the top and So starting up at the top and the Stern Golak splits this particle into a superposition of being on the left and on the right, but then by bringing them back together to interfere them, then you really evidence the quantumness. And so this is exactly the sort of thing that we're targeting in my lab. And there's a lot of history to it. So, this is the question: What is the gravitational effect from a mass in a spatial superposition? And obviously, this gets to the heart of this is a question that's been talked about a lot. And the interesting thing here is to actually try and do the experiment. And so, should gravity be quantized? Do you get a supersonic of two different curvatures of space-time when the mass is in two different places? Do you instead get some curvature? Do you instead get some collapse, some objective collapse, when the superstition gets too macroscopic? So, these are all great questions, and we need experiments, I think, to help us out. So, this is a whole great series of experiments that people have done with cantilevers or oscillating masses that are tethered, things that are attached to other things. Attached to other things. And here you get very large masses, you know, compared to the sort of stuff we're normally talking about, but a very small superposition distance and a very small time. And so this stuff is very cool, but is not such a macroscopic superposition as this work from Marcus Arnst group, where there are these molecules, they have about two thousand atoms in them. About 2,000 atoms in them, and they go through effectively a quantum two-slit experiment. It's actually a grating, but that's not too important. So these 2,000 atom molecules are in a superposition with a superposition distance of about over 200 nanometers. And so this is really impressive experimental work. But 2000 atoms is a lot less than the sort of 1 billion, 10 billion atoms. Of 1 billion, 10 billion atoms that I want to get into a spatial superposition by using nanodiamonds. So here's an overview of the kind of thing that we're proposing, the kind of experiments that we're proposing. So we're proposing specific things, specific numbers, and specific methods of doing this. And so this Nana, this This particle, this nanoparticle, is going to be a diamond, a nano-diamond that's maybe a micron across. It's going to have a single spin in it. And the reason that we like this system is because we can use nitrogen vacancy defects in diamond because we know that we can polarize the electron spin and we can read it out and we have long spin coherence times. And so I'll come on to all that in a minute. And want to just do a Stern Gerlach and create this spatial superposition. In the first paper, here we introduced the basic idea. In these second two papers, then we said that instead of just trapping the nanodiamond and having it levitating in vacuum and traps, what we need to do is to release the trap so that the nanodiamond dropped because that allows the superposition distance to It allows the superposition distance to get bigger because the trapping was holding it together. And I'll come on to those other papers in a minute, but let me just say something more about the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamonds. So obviously diamond is a lattice of carbon, and this defect is where we have a nitrogen atom replacing one of the carbon atoms, and it's next to a missing carbon atom. And then if you have a diameter. And then, if you have a diamond like this one is about a millimeter across and it's full of these NV defects, and then when we send in green light, then red light, red fluorescence light comes off. And the green light polarizes the electron spin of this defect. And the amount of red light that's coming off tells us what the spin state of this defect is. So we can do a spin readout. And indeed, at the end of our protocol, then a spin readout is how we. Protocol, then a spin readout is how we get the information. And here, this is sort of from the quantum computing effort in my lab, where we've been studying these single NV centers, where you've got a five by five array of single N V centers. Now, like I said, the spin coherence is really important. We want this spin superposition, it has to survive the whole thing, and then we're going to. Whole thing, and then we're going to interfere at the end. And the spin coherence of NV centers is excellent. So, in this paper, they showed that the spin coherence time T2 can be half a second or more. And that gives you enough time to do some quite that would, in principle, that would give you enough time to do some quite dramatic stuff. But look at the x-axis here. So, this is saying that. Is saying that to reach such large spin coherence times, you need to send in 10 to the 4 pulses, pi pulses, to the spins. So in order to refocus the decoherence, you need to send in 10,000 microwave pi pulses and you keep flipping the spin backwards and forwards. And this is a standard trick in magnetic resonance called dynamic decoupling. But it's something that we need to incorporate into our To incorporate into our schemes. And just in case you haven't heard much about dynamic decoupling, it's just an extension of this Spin Echo, which is a bit more famous. And as a movie here, oh, the movie doesn't work. There it goes. So the different spins here are spreading out because they're in different environments, but the 180-degree pulse refocuses that and gives us. Pulse refocuses that and gives us an echo. The dynamic decoupling just means we want to send in 10,000 of these pulses to really suppress decoherence. And this paper from 2020 is a proposal paper where Martin Plenio was pointing out a way of getting this dynamic decoupling into our scheme because otherwise the spin coherence would have been limited to one millisecond. Limited to one millisecond or so. And the idea in this paper is really great. So the green oscillation here is showing that the nanodiamond would oscillate back and forth. That's just due to the diamagnetic trapping that we get from this inhomogeneous magnetic field that we need to apply. And so that would limit the spatial superposition distance quite a lot. But it's just like a child on a But it's just like a child on a swing. This is, you know, simple harmonic motion. This is a child going backwards and forwards on a swing. And what we want to do is, in this paper, then Martin's pointing out that we can flip the spin at the extreme points, and then we build up a bigger and bigger amplitude as we do. And so the blue is one superposition component, the red is the other. So we start in a spin. The red is the other, so we start in a spin superposition, and then this scheme lets us increasingly build up bigger and bigger superposition distances. And this is called motional dynamic decoupling because not only are we decoupling the spin, but we're also decoupling the motion because the particle is moving backwards and forwards. It means that it's sampling both sides, and so a lot of decoherence that could be present in the environment. Coherence that could be present in the environment will get refocused, and we just won't suffer from it with this great scheme. And then also in the archive version of this paper, then there's a great description of all the decoherence sources. And some of these we've looked at in previous papers, some of these other people have looked at in previous papers, but there's really a lot of boring decoherence sources to worry about. Decoherence sources to worry about, and you know, we've made a really good effort at trying to worry about all of these things and look at which are the most important tilts comes out to be an important one, but luckily I'll show you the solution to it in a minute. But before I get onto that, let me talk about this new paper that we've just put on the archive just now. This is work with Sagato Bose again, and Ben Wood is a PhD student. Um, Ben Wood is a PhD student in my group in Warwick, and we're suggesting a design like this. And so the diamond starts at the top, it falls for about a meter, and then it with not very much happening, except that it speeds up because of gravity, and then it falls for another meter or so. And in this region, the diamond experiences these magnetic teeth, and they're much smaller than than shown here. Smaller than shown here. And here's a sort of a zoom of these teeth. So they're sort of 200 microns or so across. And Ben suggested that what we need to do is to have them offset like this, so that this tooth is opposite this gap. And that has a really valuable effect, which you see here. So this is a finite element simulation of what you get. Of what you get. And the blue is the magnetic field gradient dBx by DX in this direction. And it's oscillating backwards and forwards. And so what we want to do with that is to flip the spin each time the magnetic field gradient goes from being positive to negative. We want to flip the spin. And that lets us do dynamic decoupling. Let's us do dynamic decoupling on the spin, and so you might be then wondering. You know, I thought that you just said that we had dynamic decoupling in the previous paper. In here, so here you've got, you do have dynamic decoupling because we're sending in these pipulses here. This is time going down the slide, and here's these pipuls. But in this paper, the pipulses must come in. The pi pulses must come in resonantly with the natural frequency of the oscillating diamond in this magnetic field inhomogeneity. And it just turns out that this is just too slow. So this green oscillation is unavoidably too slow with the sort of magnets that we have access to in, you know, on Earth, unless you've got a neutron star handy. So, you know. You know, you can send in these pi pulses every 10 milliseconds or so in this scheme. But if we look back at the here, then and you look at the number of pulses that you need to send in, then if you're only sending them in every 10 milliseconds or so, then you just all the spin coherence is lost after one or two milliseconds. So that's, it just doesn't end up the The numbers end up not working. And so the point of this scheme here is that we can control how often we're sending in these pipulses. And so now we can send them in every 10 microseconds or every 50 microseconds or so. And that's then enough that we can maintain the spin coherence and we can hope to have this half a second electron spin coherence time. Coherence time. So, this is something that I'm excited about. And then, also in this paper, we're talking about using this design. And this is motional dynamic decoupling, as suggested by Martin Flenio in the PRL. But we're just doing two lobes of it. So, this first lobe is the spin being in a superposition. The spin being in a superposition of going off over here and coming back, and while the other superposition component is doing nothing. And then we flip them so that the component that was doing nothing does one low. And this is the smallest sort of motion or dynamic decoupling you could imagine, that I can imagine anyway. And it's brilliant because this gets rid of the most low-level. The most low level, the most basic types of motional decoherence. And in particular, it gets rid of the tilt sensitivity. So, without this, then we were worried that we would have needed like pico radian control of the orientation of the tilt of this experiment. But using this motional dynamic decoupling, then we totally get rid of that. And we only need sort of tens of. You know, tens of micro-radian, which is routine. Anyway, so you know, these sorts of many of these sorts of mundane details that are just really important to the design in. But I think that's working for the tilt now. And I promised you some gravity, and so this is how we'd like to access that. So I've been talking so far about a superposition, a spatial superposition. About a superposition, the spatial superposition, and an interferometer, like a Stern-Gerlach interferometer with the closed loop here. But to try and study quantum gravity, there's this suggestion from these papers that what you want is two of these interferometers, and then you look for the gravitational interaction between this component and this component, which is much bigger. Which is much bigger than the gravitational interaction between any other pair of components. And so, then, if you find that there is an interaction here, then that is evidence that whatever gravitational effects were going on, then they must be quantum mechanical if they allow you to see some entanglement here at the end. So, you run the two interferometers, and at the end, you look for entanglement. Parameters, and at the end, you look for entanglement of this spin, with this spin. And if you've set everything up right, we suggest parameters, then there's no way that these two can interact except by gravity. And so then if there is entanglement, then we would infer that gravity must be a quantum thing. It's a standard thing in quantum information that you can only entangle two things using a quantum mediator. Gavin, you're fine. Gavin, you're five minutes till questions. Thanks, Rob. So here's a photo from my lab. This was a system for levitating nanodiamonds. Here's a zoom of it. And this is optical tweezers. So here's a nanodiamond levitated in optical tweezers. And what we found here was that the nanodiamonds overheat in optical tweezers, they get burnt up. They get burnt up or they graphitize, and that's because there's not enough air to take away the heat. But we've got to get rid of the air because otherwise the gas atoms are going to collapse the spatial superposition. So that's a problem. And we suggested getting around that by using much more pure nanodiamonds. So everybody had been using these nasty yellow nanodiamonds. Nanodiamonds, but by using a thousand times pure nanodiamonds, we made some progress. And so Ollie Williams' group milled these, crushed them up into nanodiamonds. And then when we look at those in the optical trap, we find that they can stay at room temperature. So that was a bit of progress. But still, for the testing quantum gravity, we're going to need the nanodiamond be at more like five Kelvin, not at really. Like five Kelvin, not at room temperature. And so for that to work, we're going to need a magnetic trap because it's not going to heat up the nanodiamonds in the way that the optical trap does. And so even in this magnetic trap, we're going to benefit from these much purer nanodiamonds because we're still going to send in light pulses to control the spins. And so here's a scanny electron. And so here's a scanning electron microscope view of our nanodiamonds. And this one here is our favorite. And this is SEM, but we can overlay our optical microscopy. And I love switching backwards and forwards between them. And you can see the fluorescence coming off from some of these diamonds. And that means that we can study the spin coherence of just this guy. And we find that the spin coherence is 460. 460 microseconds when we're using this dynamic decoupling. It's half as long here with just a spin echo and no dynamic decoupling. But this is really similar to, this is close to the values that you find in bulk. And that's good because normally nanodiamonds, you have worse spin coherence inside the nanodiamond than you do in bulk diamond. So we're pretty pleased with this, but we're going to need to call these diamonds. With this, but we're going to need to cool these dimers down and see how they work like that. So, in conclusion, I think that I've hopefully shown you that it's exciting to think about using these levitated nanodiamonds to test quantum gravity. Here's a sort of a, I would call this an artist's impression. I actually made it with Povre. I'm not an artist, but this is another picture. This is another picture of this scheme for testing quantum gravity with two interferometers. And experimentally, we've developed these nanodiamonds that are a thousand times purer. They are much more transparent to the optical light that we need to send in. And being purer also means that they have less magnetic noise, that means they have much. That means they have much longer spin coherence times. And the next step, the big next step, is to mean that we're building a magnetic trap, a diamagnetic trap. I do have a slide of the magnetic trap. I think I must have hidden it accidentally. There's it gone. So people have looked. So people have looked at magnetic traps before and I did have a slide slide with that in. So it's the groups of Jason Twomley and Brian Durso have demonstrated nanodiamonds levitated in diamagnetic traps. Here's a slide showing something like that. And so we're building something like this to Something like this to avoid the heating that we get in optical traps. So that's all from me. I think I'll just leave it there and happy to take any questions. Okay, thank you. I see we already have a question from Dan Carney. Go ahead, Dan, please. Hi, Gavin. Thanks for the talk. Thanks for the talk. I have actually, I think this is a really basic question. I'm sorry, this is a dumb one, but with the pure diamonds, are you decreasing the number of NV centers in there? And then does that have an effect on your ability to control, say, the motional degree of freedom? Yeah, that's a good question. So the key thing that we're doing with the purity is that we're getting rid of nitrogen impurities by going from, so this yellow colour is coming from the nitrogen. Yellow colour is coming from the nitrogen impurities. And these nitrogen impurities have an electron spin, which is disturbing our spin coherence. And obviously, it's yellow, which is absorbing all the light that we send in and heating up the nanodiamonds. And so by coming over to here, then we have less, we do end up having less NV sensors. But that works out totally fine in the end. The numbers work out fine because what we want is to have one. What we want is to have one NV center per nanodiamond. And so, in here, then you know, we have one NV center in this nanodiamond, it's about 250 nanometers across. This is with our purer material. And so, yeah, basically, this yellow stuff has too many NV centers anyway. And so, if you have, if you try and do the experiment with loads of NV centers, in principle, well, I mean, you know, it should. Sentence in principle, well, I mean, you know, it should still work, but it's like doing a, um, you know, instead of doing a two-slit experiment, it's like doing a sort of a grating experiment with many slits, and it just gets more complicated to analyze. And we've tried to look for some benefit to it, but it seems like it's just there's no benefit to having lots of NV centers, and it's a pain. And so, yeah, we're happy with the level of NV centers that we're going to get in this sort of material. Centers that they're going to get in this sort of material. Okay, Marcus has a question. Yeah, thanks. Hey, Gavin, thanks for this great talk. I really look forward to seeing the next steps here. So I have a question and a fun fact to add. So the question concerns the magnetic field gradients that you showed in your recent proposal. So you said that you need something on the order of 10 to the 9 Tesla per meter or so. To make that work. So I'm wondering, the graph that you show here is this a simulation of the actual structure that you have? Yeah, so this is a finite element simulation of this structure, but we don't want 10 to the 9 Tesla per meter. So here we have about. Oh, it's millimeter. It's not nanometer. I see, I see, I see. Okay, now, okay, now things are clear. Okay. Yeah, so it's funny. So in our early papers, So it's funny. So, in our early papers, then we were saying in some of these early papers, we were saying, oh, we want this magnetic field gradient of 10 to the 6th Tesla per meter or more. And it turns out that that just doesn't help. So having a super high magnetic field gradient. So it was this paper here from, you know, with Martin Pleniac, which was showing. Yeah. So it doesn't really help to have a huge magnetic field gradient. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That it feels great, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay, great, thanks a lot. Let me just quickly add my fun fact number, which shows how relevant the experiments are that you are doing, actually. So you said you showed these cantilever superpositions, right? And the relevant number for the gravitational coupling is, yeah, this one, exactly. So the relevant number for the gravitational coupling in the end is the superposition size delta x times the mass. Okay, and if you compare now delta. Again, and if you compare now delta x times mass with the next slide that you have, so with these huge superpositions of the macromolecules, it turns out that delta x times m, which is the relevant coupling, is the same for all of these types of experiments. It all turns out to be 10 to the minus 29, which is many, many, many orders of maintenance away. But no matter what you do at the moment, so either you do candy levers with small displacement or macromolecules with large displacement, you always are at the small, tiny number m delta x 10 by 20. Tiny number m delta x ten minus 29. And so only your approach is going to be the one that will push us in the right direction. Yeah, well, your stuff is awesome as well, Marcus. I look forward to your talk later on. Okay, thanks. I see, although there's another question, unfortunately, we have to stop. Maybe Daniel Braun, if you could save it and we'll put it in the discussion part. Let's thank Gavin again.
