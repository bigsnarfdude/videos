Yeah, it's here. Okay, so the next speaker is Claire Lajas, and she will be talking about road networks. Yeah, road networks. Thank you. So, hello, everybody. I'm Claire Lajes. I'm ambassador. I'm Claire Ages. I'm an assistant professor in the University of Franche-Pointé in France. And I came here to talk about road networks and see how they can look format and understand from the pattern we can see on those networks, how we can deduce some uh rules to uh to be able to model their evolution. So first, do you recognize that? We recognize that. What is it? Yeah, we are here. And here is the channel mountain trade we did yesterday with some of you. So yeah, it's about. So the first question we're going to ask is why world networks? Why is it interesting to look at those networks? If we try to fly a little bit around about cities, Of cities, I start with an easy one, but I like this game, especially when I talk after lunch, because I will ask you to help me what is it, how manage all your reading. So, this one was easy. So, you see a very particular shape of our network. We know this shape to be the one of North America. Another quite easy one. Another quite easy one, Paris, of course. Here the shape is more uh typical of European cities, so uh really organic shape uh with uh many streets and we reve history through this organization. Let's try a less easy one. I don't speak. You know the cities? Pittsburgh! No, Pittsburgh, okay. It's in France? Little bit more in the south. Avignon. Avignon, good. So another typical European city, so shaped by the rivers, and we can see the city nature here and many layers as an onion growing. So we are speaking for those. So we are speaking for those kind of shapes of network of organic cities. And for this one, this example is to show you that this kind of organization can be found in Europe even if it's more likely to be American shape of cities. And the other way here, this one is the hardest I should find it here. All my concerns. Is there a prize for them? My my my admiration. Now, so we are in North America here. Yeah. Is to show you that organic organization could be found there also. Yeah. Santa City, yeah. Uh so one of the most ancient cities of uh North America is an old uh uh church and we see here the organization to be more organic. So we can expect a world network to share information about the story of the city and its use. And this is what we are looking for. So we are considering just a road network without Just a world network without any other information, so no congestion, no reads, no actors, politics, just the structure of the world network. And we will try to read it. And to read it, I did my PhD with Stéphane, and we try to find what kind of tool we can use to read those kinds of networks. So we are here on the side of So we are here on the side of description and we gonna try to reach cities. This is the part of my PhD thesis, who was some years ago, not that much. And all the exercise was to take the network, build a graph from it, so by putting nodes at the intersection and making arcs between those nodes. Seeing the angles between arcs and pairing arcs according to the minimum deviation angles between them. And so, by doing this, we did one object we call ways. So, from this little extract of network, we had 55 arcs, and now we have 14 ways. So, a way is an aggregation of arcs who can cross the entire network. Cross the entire network or just a laser, a small part of the network. So it's a multi-scale element which allows us to read the cities. And we will see that it's quite interesting. So it's equivalent to a street, a way? Not exactly, because the street is given by the name, and this name can change. And here it's just structural. Structural. So it's a an hypergraph we put on the initial graph to be able to compute some indicators on it and to try to get some information on cities through it. So what determines away is the minimum deviation from at each node, sorry I went fast on this one, but at each node we are looking at the angle of deviation between arcs and we are pairing arcs if We are pairing arcs if the angle is minimum between them and according to the maximum Trojan angle. We put at 60 degree. So we have weights and we are seeing that it's quite interesting to work with weights because for instance for closeness centralities, so computed on edges, we have this kind of results. So we can picture that it focuses on the center of That it focuses on the center of the map, so not very interesting. But when we do it on the edges, on the ways instead of edges, we have this kind of results. And so we can see a real hierarchy in the road network, and we can read the most ancient streets, the ones that are here, just to deserve more locally the territory. What does it mean two ways are closed? What does it mean two ways are close? Oh, so the closeness centrality is um you know the inverse of uh topological distance. So from each way we are looking if we can get to all the networks easily or not. Sorry, I was assuming that this one was okay for recognity, but maybe not. So, if something is green, what does it exactly mean? If it's green, it's white. Quite not as much accessible. And if it's red, it's really accessible. Okay, if it's red, it's on the way. Yeah, you are easily passing by the streets. So the green parts are the old parts of the cities that are like labyrinthine kind of medieval stuff or what? The red parts are the green. I I reverse your your question. Your question, so it is actually the red part which is the most ancient part of the cities. Because when a cities is built, each new part is made to go quickly to the city center, so to minimize the number of the topological distance to the main structure, which is the red one. And so, this is the first indicator I developed during my PhD, and the big advantage of The big advantage of the way is whatever is the choice to make to cut your network, your result will be really stable. Because if you compute it on the edges, it will change the result according to where you choose to cut your own network. And with Stéphane, because we did this work together, we tried many indicators and we focus on the We focus on those bringing the most interesting information here is the degree centrality. So the degree is the number of other ways a way is crossing. So this gives us an attaching hierarchy as well. This is the orthogonality which looks at the angles of waves between them. And this is the spacing. Sorry, I let the Spacing, sorry, I let the title in French. The spacing is looking at the distance between intersection on the ways. So you have the very dense part of the cities here in red, and in blue, the streets which have not much intersection. So this was part of my PhD. So I was wanting to show you a little bit how. Wanting to show you a little bit how we read cities, but I want to explain you from this how we can model the growth of the cities. So, to go to the simulation, we have to go by the motifs. Let's go back on a plane. When I arrived in Calgary, I looked at the airfield, and just before arriving in the city, we saw those big lines, those streets. The streets going through the territory without any obstacle on their way. And when we arrived closest to Caligary, we start to see appearance some motifs on the ground. And some of them are really interesting because in those kinds of cities, which is planned, the motifs are. The motifs appear at one time, they are think at one time, or it is not an organic element. So we saw, maybe you did as well, many really interesting motifs arriving in Calgary. And actually, if we took a satellite image of the place, we see this is Calgary. This is before coming to the city. Before coming to the city, so with a big straight line here because it's all flat, here we have the city and here the rocky mountains. And we can see that with the road network, we have very different kind of shapes. So on the flat ground, the big very straight road. Then in the cities, a variation of motifs. And in the rocky mountains, then it's a very similar road. Very simple roads because they are more shaped ground. So, this is a road network of the place, so you can really see the cut made between the flat land and the rocky mountains. So, through the structure of the network, you can really see the topography of the place. And our challenge in the PhD, I was supervising. I was supervising those last four years was to characterize those motifs, to be able to put them in a simulation and to be able to characterize the growth of cities with them. So with Philippe Bonin, who was part of the Morphosity team with Stéphane as well, we were thinking with two other master thesis students of Of selection of motifs. And here you have them. And with those motifs, my PhD student who is a doctor now, Anna L. Gush, tried to understand what kind of combination of indicators can characterize each motif. And she sees that with degree, when you have a low for 2 high degree, you have a very large and arborist. The very large and arborescent tree-like motifs. She sees as well that when high degree and high orthogonality is bad, you have large squared motifs. And when you have low degree and low orthogonality, you have narrow uh tree-like motifs. And with uh low degree and high orthogonality, you have uh squared narrow motifs. Narrow motifs. But the main information here is with a combination of indicators, we are able to characterize some kind of motifs in the cities. And this is interesting because we can, from that, define some morphotypes. And so from cities, we get the motifs, and we will now define the morphotypes. And what Anai did is defining eight morphotypes, so Morphotite, so radialinear, concentric, convergent, divergent, familiar, octogenal, diagonal, transversal, intercalar, and cellular. Those eight motifs, she characterized them, saying, okay, what is the elementary motif, what is the performance location, the size, the process of evolution, the process of uh retachment, uh and the And the with the alternative, spacing and degree, well uh what kind of uh value uh does uh characterize those motifs. And from that, she was able to characterize the growth of the city. So this is her drawings saying, okay, from city center, so you have first the radials going through the land, then the orthogonal. Through the LAN, then the orthogonal and diagonal pattern emerging, then the cellular ones, and then the intercolor and ramified, transversal, the concentric, ramified, and from this you have a global pattern emerging on the ground. And this is what we want to simulate. And to do so, we have finished with the description part. With the description part, and we go through the modeling part. And we will have, we will need a model, so we worked with Toma Kocha model. Toma Kotta was a PhD student of Stefan as well. He did his PhD just before me, and he defined with Stefan on the round a potential field, saying, Okay, this is my round network, and I would. My raw network, and I will define some preferential spots to put my nodes and to make my network roll. So, this is the formula you use with the spurring parameters, rejection radius, scaling parameters, and a cumulative minimum distance here. And quickly, so he initialized the network. He initializes the network, sets his parameters with n the total number of nodes, and calculates the program factors. He generates nodes according to this potential function, selects a new node, connect this new node, and so he has he had his new network and repeat this process. So from this model developed by Toma Coota, with uh he With NAE, we went further because the model of Tomat was about to create the radial and linear shape, the ramified one, intercalar one, and orthogonal one. And with an array, we developed the Waymorph model with some kind of additional parameters. So to connect a new node, So, to connect a new node, there are new options. So, one parameter, OP saying, okay, I will connect orthogonally to the past my previous network, the EPP, which will connect to the end nodes and the WP which will connect to the s uh uh the existing network according to the Existing network according to the degree centrality value of rates. We also added parameters according to the angles of the new segments created. So either a minimum intersection angle between a new segment and all the segments in the network, either an angle here of separation between each pair of possible segments. Between each pair of possible segments. And by setting those parameters in the Waymoth software we developed in our lab with Eugene Didel, who is a research engineer, we were able from an initial network to set the parameters we wanted to make the network work. So in the software we can see the generated filter layers and the Generated data layers and the metadata. And so the challenge was to reproduce some of the morphotypes first, so Waymorph was able to reproduce those eight morphotypes that Anna defined in her PhD. And from those morphotypes to recreate city motifs. And so you remember those motifs that Philippe Those motifs that Philippe Bonnon draw. There were 14 of them, and 8 are doable with the model Anna created. So, for instance, this shape of CTIF is in LMOX, and from this initial network, we see that with several steps, each step with some different set of parameters. Different set of parameters, we can recreate the looking light network like this one. Almost. This is the example of Medina in Mahrakesh, so with another set of parameters. This is Catagen, so squared uh kind of own network and uh Brive Lagalliard. Uh Laguillard, who some of you are really well known, so with radials and concentric networks. So, bad news, Waymorph is not able to connect to the loop. I'm sorry, I'm Nick. But this is one of our perspectives. So, yeah, so from our description of cities, we want to decompose things and To decompose things, and we were able to recompose in the modernization to simulate the city growths. And the aim is to be able to take the ancient world network of really dense cities and to see if we are able to simulate their growth and what the model will give us in front of reality. So, those research are research are I just presented are made from 2009 I just can with the beginning of the thesis of the Macorta with Stefan to now with the end of the PhD of ANA and Stefan was in the morphosity research group at the origin of the PhD of Tomar Of the PhD of Toma and mine. And then at the end of my PhD, I was really frustrated to not have been able to simulate the presence of the growth of nitrogen. So when I had the position, I say, okay, I want to supervise the KG to do so. And I did that. And we were able to, she defined the motor type. She defines the morphotypes of ways, develops the way morph with Gilles and Cecile, Tanier, another colleague. And there's plenty of perspectives emerging from them, going from soft mobilities to a scenario which includes more some part of the networks to make from those kind of beautiful networks. Beautiful networks to create more information. Thank you very much for your attention. Does not planarity play any role in road networks or code being up uh not really uh are in a code embedded on the plane? Or does things need to be Yes, of course. Actually on those house nodes on those beef hubs, when you have two threes going one above the other, we do not put a node space. So it's not really planned out. Thanks for the talk. Is it with the model you've made, have you sort of found like investigated if there's some sort of optimal road network or optimal motif? And again, how would you define optimal whether anything needs to be done? Optimal with it to be better places, or you know, we looked into sort of which motifs are better than others. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, you have to define optimal first because the optimal could be really different. Here, this is the picture I propose to admit for the art exhibition, because I really like the idea that you see two cultures on it, you know, there's this one and this one, and you feel that the optimal is not the. You feel that the optimal is not the same on both of them. And actually, I supervise an internship right now of students trying to see the resilience of each kind of motif. And so by trying to remove edge and saying, okay, when how do those react my indicators according to each kind of motif and some attacks on them? And some attacks on them. So maybe we can answer the question after the decentralization. Alex, one more. If I give you a map of the road of a city, how well can you fill it in? I'm not sure to understand. I gave you a map of the city, and then I erase all the roaching in the center, but I ask you to draw a vacuum. Can you do that? I think not exactly of the. I I think not exactly as they were. It depends also on the city. You see there are many organic cities and many planned ones and the logic is completely different between the two. So if you erase some part of the network which is really located and you want to rebuild it, I guess if you define well the set of parameters to shape the thing as they were, so do you need So do you need it to be squared or random or anything? You will have something. Not the exact thing which was erased, but you'll get something. You might have a central part, but I guess because they don't mind half. Yeah, so if you only look at the statistics of everything around those particular rates, then you have a model for how to connect things. Like how it seems, right? You should be able to enter a reasonable guess. After a reasonable guess for whatever possible talk. I think that there are a lot of cities that are built up like close to bulk waters, like close to rivers, and there are others that were constructed around mountains for this. Constructed around mountains for defense purposes, or others that like spontaneously arises when you make a big road and then people want to be close to the road. So I am wondering if there are different motifs that characterize these different cities. Which are the motifs that are close to a river, which ones are close to the mountains, which are the ones close to the main roads? If we take the motif of Philippe here, Here. I think here there's no constraints of topography, actually. He draws those according to one point and saying, okay, here for this one, you can imagine there's a river here. I think, according to topography, if you have a river, you will have a blank in your city and it's like a resource. So it will concentrate a lot of access around Around it. If you have a mountain, it's not a resource, it's a constraint. So you will minimize the access and because it will be more sharp to go through. During my PhD, we talked about it a little bit, and even after, during the building of the simulation, by saying, okay, here we simulate on a flat floor with no constraint. On a flat floor with no constraints, and the next step is maybe to say, here it's a mountain, here it has a C, here it has a resource, and putting some set of parameters according to this, saying, okay, if there's a mountain, we won't pick new nodes there, or very few of them, and we will try to minimize the distance through the slope. And if there's a river we want to connect it. And if there's a river who want to connect it, see, it will. It's the next step of the simulation to integrate those kind of information, I guess. Thank you. Yeah, so you have also historical information for some cities. But if I understand correctly, your model, which tries to recapitulate what the networks look like, does not include the fact that maybe some motifs were more likely to be done in medieval times. Be done in medieval times versus modern times, right? So, did you incorporate any of that? Actually, I did a whole ton of research. I did not have time to speak here, but about those enchant maps. I am currently working on a serious game where all the people are invited to see the actual network on the map. actual network on on the map and select the world network who which is still here to rebuild the data through time because analyzing those kind of evolutions the real one is very time consuming because we do not have the vectorial data for all maps so Anna at the beginning of her PhD we chose three cities and she did uh the work to uh digitalize uh all maps Digitalized roadmaps and to understand how those three cities move through time. And it is also through this reflection that we determine the motifs and the parameters linked to the motifs. But it's really true that we didn't already say, okay, this motif is this period, is from this period, and so to rebuild the network according to real historical period. And I think I will. I think we'll have to collaborate with some historians to do so because I'm not historian myself. And I have the second question, which was very, you partially answered it already. How do you get your data? Do you, do we, I guess now you can use also Google Maps, I guess, right? No, Google has. No, actually, my challenge is to be as generic as possible. I want my computation to be. I want my computation to be working on every city as long as I have the data. And for geographical information, we have OpenStreetMap, which is a kind of Wikipedia for geographical data. And the data is not really clean, and I am also working on some kind of pre-processing on those kinds of data to clean it before putting ways on indicators. But with OpenStreetMap data, it's kind of magic. It's kind of magic. You see, I wanted to see Calgary and the surroundings, I just had to download the data, clean it a little bit, and I can have the map of Calgary and the surroundings. And also, I just take the chance because this is what I proposed for the art exhibition, and the game is to find what it is. The game is to find what. The game is to find what CD it is. And this is OpenStreetMap data, yeah. But I clean it. Because we in OpenS in OpenStreetMap you have many stairs, there are some private things and very pollution maybe. This is a city with a lot of spare gaps. Sorry? This is a city with a lot of holes. Yeah, all of those holes. Yeah. But we still have a lot of money. I I made a a a s a chip uh tip slide. I don't know if I have to show it, but you you're one where it is. I have a question which is related to the previous question. At least for dense cities, the pattern of streets is roughly the negative of the constructions. So what is the relationship between the kind of habitat and the kind of motivation because you have skyscrapers or little earths? Okay. Skyscrapers or little hurts. You don't expect the same motives, I suppose. So there must be some energy between the construction and the rows. It's through entities, but see here, there's nothing. You know, my plane pictures, it's just huge. So it's not constrained by any of the buildings here. That's where the city or dense cities are. In the cities, right. In the cities, right. So, the only rule, I think it has been a lot of discussion through the Morocco City research team with that. And what I remember from the discussion is the main constraint is to have two slots per second two plots between Two plots uh between two roads. So to have at least two houses, two buildings between two roads. And it's uh one plot, a minimum size. I'm not sure myself, I don't want to say uh something wrong. Maybe Stephanie, you can complete it, but in some old African cities or or in Venice, okay, you have the houses and then the free space is is where you can walk. So very quickly it gets structured this way. It gets structured its way, and then the priority is not the housing, it's housing that you can go through.
