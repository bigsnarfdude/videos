And table of significant and GPUs.             To uh spec okay for every g torser uh e to spec k and k is a little k field. Uh there exists some map f from spec capital K to X such that Such that if I pull back, I just get, okay, this should be E prime. Sorry. This is E prime. So basically, every for view is a specialization of my forser E to G. There is a stronger notion of this, which is we say that it is versal if for every Again, the same thing computer sorry prime to spec k. Now I have a family fi from spec k to maps, a family of maps, such maps. Well f i upper star E is uh E prime. E prime and this family is dominant and the family of I from stack k to x is the moment. So it has a dense image. And there is a third notion, which is okay, I think I will. Okay, I think I will erase this table here so that it is strongly versal if again for every g torsor E2 step K, again, same story, E prime, I'm sorry. So now there exists So now there exists a morphism f from a to the n times f k to x such that when I pull back I get I get eight n times prime and f is nominates. So, just to kind of explain what is the rational behind these definitions. So, first of all, this means that somehow E sees all tursors over spectra of fields, right? And in here, I just have one specialization. Okay, so I will use color. I hope this is fine. So, this is one specialization. He specializes to every tourist over a field. Here, you could say that I have many specializations. Specializations. And here you could say that I have many specializations, but moreover, I have an affine parameterization. Right? Okay, I think, I'm sorry, this should be a rational. Yes. Okay, it could be definitely. But basically, I have an affine parameter. Parameterization. So these are first all torusors. The notion was introduced. I think it was developed by... I'm not exactly sure what is the history. I think there is a paper by Zino Brivschin and Alex Duncan which introduces all sorts of variants of these properties, but this has been developed much earlier. It goes back to the generic collision algebra. Yes, yes, the history is a little complicated. So I will appear. Yes, but the map is Russian. What is the meaning of F star? What is the poll back if the map has actually? Oh, uh then I could just say you know what? Let me just say I have an open, a dense open. Open, a dense open. This is contained in, I'm sorry, let me do it like this. So you have a map F from U to X and U is a dense open subset of this. And here, of course, I will get U. This is precise, I'm sorry. So, first of all. So, bristle torsors have a number of usages, so let me just name a few of them. You know, let me give an example just to kind of highlight how this works. And let me use G, I'm going to take G to be the orthogonal group of this reference form, and I will assume that the characteristic is L2. The G-torsters are sitting as Same as quadratic spaces. So, what might be a versal g-turser here? Well, you could take x to be the space a n minus the axis, which is basically just the spec of the Lorentz series, spec T1. T1 and plus minus 1. And you can take a quadratic space. Okay, let me work with quadratic spaces. These notions make sense also for any type of equivalent object, so I can talk about the versal quadratic form. Let's take this quadratic form, and let me call this string R. So this is a quadratic form over R. And the idea is that if Q prime is a quadratic, form over some field K, then I can always diagonalize this form, right? And now I can just specialize these variables to these variables. But actually, I can also, when I specialize to A1, I can specialize to A1 times X1 squared, and I can specialize T2A2 times X2 squared. Can specialize t2 directly times x2 squared. So we actually have a lot of specializations, and they're even parameterized by an affine space. So this is actually so that we can just sort of specialize. You can say Ti goes to Ai xi squared, some point of an affine space. And from this, we see that if we do this, then we get that q in the this is a map phi from r to k. I have many such maps. And if I just take q and I base change it, k I need q prime. And this tells us that q or its equivalent. Hue or its equivalent torsor is strongly personal. Okay, this is a simple example. I should say strongly versal torsors always exist. I will not go into this now because I will say something about it later. Just a few things about why should we look at versal torsors. There are some applications of personal forcers, which I hope will motivate the generalization of my budget present. So, first of all, they are, in some sense, the best candidates for counterexamples for properties preserved. Preserved under specialization. Notable example is that the generic division algebra of degree n corresponds to a PGLN torsor, which is Versal. This is an example of a non-visual for some values of n, this is a non-cross product. Being a cross product is preserved under specialization. So these are the best candidates in the classical constructions of non-cross products. Classical constructions of non-first products usually use that. Also, you can use them to get, again, upper bounds on invariants that, again, are preserved under specializations. For example, symbol length. So it's finiteness of the symbol length. You can use You can use Versal Torsors to get this. The essential dimension of G is strongly related to Versal Torsors because it's a proposition, not so difficult to show that it is the minimum number of group of all the X such that X has Versal G torsor. So if there isn't, okay, just Is just the minimum possible dimension of a k-variety supporting aversal p-torser. And they're also important in the theory of comological invariants. Because, I mean, if we have a comological invariant of the group, well, since this thing, since everything specializes to a verisal torsor, then that torsor somehow controls. somehow controls the homological invariants. Okay, so for example, you could say that there are no invariants beyond a certain dimension, which are cron-dimension. Okay, so now I'd like to introduce a generalization of this definition. I call them highlyversal torsors. I don't know if that's a good name. The word highly was used earlier. That would have been a slightly different meaning. Different meaning. Okay, so I will give the definition and then I will talk about the history of that. I should also say that it works over any base scheme, but I will stick to the base field. Okay, for simplicity. So let me, let's see, be a class of base schemes. E.g., the affine case schemes, or Ethereum affine case schemes are induced as n, or the quasi-projective ones. Examples like this. So let me adapt the definition. So again, I have a g-torsor. I will allow x to be a k-stream. And I will say that e to x is equal to. Uh E to X is equally versatile, so people told me not to use colors. Uh I'll just say four. Orange is fine. What? Orange is fine. Orange is fine. Here it is. It is weakly versal for C, for that class C, if every time I have a torsor E prime to X prime over an object of C, I can specialize too. Okay, that's all. And I will say, okay, let me, I know how to make it. So this should be x prime now. It is versal if, again, every time I have a torso over some object of C, I have a bunch of specializations. So, okay, now I have to be a little careful. I have a bunch of specializations. Bunch of specializations. And okay, it seems like I should write here something like that: this family fi is dominant, but that's not exactly the right thing to do. For instance, if x prime is empty, this will never be dominant. But I want to include it, but the right thing to do here is actually to look at this morphism. This is the identity, from x prime to x. to x times x prime k. So kind of base change x. So experiment saying that this panel is dominant. And this becomes critical when you work over a scheme rather than a field. Over a field you can always see this problem when it's empty. And I'll say that it is strongly versatile if for every same thing I can find okay so here Here, let me not. So, there is no good notion of what you can do here. So, I will just insist on having an affine space. Okay, I'll just say I have an affine space. Take the strongest notion possible such that this holds and Uh and again, not f itself is dominant, but rather uh f and the uh second projection from uh an times x prime to x times x prime is dominant. And I should actually I'm sorry, schematically dominant, because I want to acc account for unrelated schemes to be schematically dominant. Okay, so this is a natural generalization. And one more piece of definition. This is definition one. And definition two, I say that E. So no, I don't want an open set because I will talk a little about this in a moment when I give the next definition, okay? So I'm gonna take it in the strongest sense possible. I'm going to take it in the strongest sense possible. So e to x is a d versal for c. And here d is some positive integer. D is greater. Some non-negative integer. If I'm sorry, this should be. Well, weakly or strongly universal for scene this year, if exactly the same thing holds, but you You may replace X with X minus C for some C containing X closed off codimension greater than D. Okay, so maybe you may remove. Okay, so you may remove a piece which is of codimension greater than D. And what do I mean by this? So, well, here it's clear. You can specialize away from something of codimension greater than D. Here, okay, you can take this in the most restrictive sense. Oh, this is X prime. So it's always the X prime. You can, from each of these, you can remove something of codimension greater than V. Of codimension greater than D. And here you can remove something of codimension greater than D. Okay, this is basically the idea. Let me not, I don't want to write the whole thing again. So this is the idea of being diverse. Also, now we have a series of notions. So just kind of a comparison. So being weakly versal Well, this is the same as being a weak universal for the class of fields over k. I mean I could choose this class, right? But this is also the same, this is more interesting, being weakly zero or something for varieties like k. Right? Because Right, because why is this? Because I can always take my variety and I can look at its generic point. I have a specialization, right? And then I can extend it to some neighborhood of the generic point, and its complement will be of codimension greater than zero. So this is equivalent to that. But the other ones are not exactly equivalent, it doesn't work so well. So they're just resembling points in a strongly personal is not exactly the same, it's just to being weakly and strongly zero universal because. Because okay, maybe I should say because I have this thing x times x prime versus x prime. So when I made that change, I kind of ruined the immediate equivalence because of this. So it's similar, but not, I'm not sure, I'm not, I don't know. I don't know if these are cool plants. And I should say that these definitions make sense for other objects, or maybe word Mark. Definitions 1 and 2 make sense for vector bundles, Zumai algebras, alpha extensions, etc. Extensions, etc. Every time you have something, uh, a type of object in which you can base change, more precisely, a fibrid category over schemes, you can make these definitions and talk about these gadgets. So, I will tell you about existence and in-existence results about these things. Uh so they always exist uh for the right classes and then uh I should say I I've removed the motivations but I've removed the motivations, but you can. I will talk about a little application to SymbolAng. And this sort of opens the door to what might be thought of as higher essential dimension. So that's another chunk of motivation. But I will not talk about it because equivalence on universal C is the class of spectral fields. Oh, uh I'm sorry, for varieties. Varieties. Just for varieties. So it's not, a priori, it's not the same. Okay, I don't know if it's the same, but let us see. No, this is the classical definition. This is here, it's just strongly versal in the usual in the classical sense. So that corresponds to the class of fields, k fields. Yes. Yes. Basically, the class of k fields. Okay, let me give an example. Let me give an example, and this will see what might be the implication of the existence of something like that. So, suppose I have, consider a GLN torsor over the spectrum of some ring. So this thing will always correspond to a rank n vector bubble over this, but this is the same as a rank n projective. Let me call it piece. So, what happens if such a thing is versal from is versal for some class then E is versal or weekly, let me note weekly versal weekly. weakly versal for Ethereum alphonic schemes of dimension at most d over k. This happens if and only if. What does it mean? It means that for every Ethereum hearing A of four dimension at most this is my class C. Class C and for every rank M projective A module P there exists some phi from R to A such that if I take my V and that and I tensor it with A, I just did. Okay, and so it specializes to all. So it specializes to all projective modules over something of four-dimensional t. And just note that, so here, what would the implication of such an output imply? I'm sorry, what does this imply? Well, if this holds and V is generated by M elements as an R module. As an R module, then every such P is generated by M elements, because it's a specialization of that V. And then we get a uniform upper bound on the number of generators of every projective module over a ring of cool dimension at most V. So this would imply such a uniform bound. And this is what I said that you could use versal objects for the Universal objects to get such bounds. And such a bound is known. Okay, this is not something this is not new. So there is a theorem of very old Ethereum Forster, which actually gives that count. So Ethereum which says that, well, every rank and Rank and project module over an Ethereum frame of all dimension plus D is generated by M plus D elements. Okay, so there is such an upper bound. I think when I think when I first thought about, just started thinking about that, this was the first thing we checked that such a result is known. And actually, okay, this is very cool, this is from 64, and there is work with Michelle Vanab from 65, and she studies a generic, there is a generic Rank M objective module generated by M elements. There is a generic such construction. Let me not go into this. She studies that. And so it means that there is it's generic in the sense that it will specialize to every other rank N module generated by M elements. And if you put these two things together, And if you put these two things together, you get that there exists a G of a courser, which is a weakly versus for Ethereum schemes. So this is basically the earliest construction I know of. It is implicit. You need to combine these two results. Now we will tell you a bit more history. Yes? So there has been this notion has been glimpsed upon in other instances. So if the characteristic of K is positive and G is a key group, then Saltman 78 showed that there exists a very good Showed that there exists a GL1 extension of characteristic earrings that specializes to every other all cheekal extensions of uh characteristic P. Characteristic V rings. So this basically corresponds to a G tor G torsorvers mic diversal for all F9 schemes over F. That's basically what it is. Okay? And you can also, there is even an example in a paper of mine. In a paper of mine with Ben Williams and Usher Owell. But I think I will skip it. See if choose PON or STN. We, this is English from 2019. You've got a family of torsors, you can interpret it that way. GI2XI EI2XI. EI2XI which are jointly we were solved for all affine schemes over C this time. So this corresponds to Azumaya algebras with both Fogonal involution and seplective involutions respectively. And there were examples of Azumaya algebra as a countable family of Azumai algebra. A countable family of Azumai algebras becoming more and more complicated that together specialize to all Azumai algebras with both thermal convolution in respect of a symbolic convolution. This is an example, another example, and I think that the first real breakthrough systematic approach to this appeared in a recent paper with Zimili Reichston. And we have Williams, which says that if V is G representation and C is some closed which is stable of codimension greater than V such that V minus D is a G torsor. Then this torsor is with difficult salt for varieties because um we should say well affline case schemes, finite type affline case schemes of dimension of most or variety. Okay, so this means that these things are actually common, at least in the weak sense. And what I want to tell you about, now I can actually state my results, this is almost the end of the lecture, but now I can state some results. Talk about them a little. So third R. Okay, so G, I'm going to say. are, okay, so G, I'm gonna set up, G will now be an FTPF group scheme of finite type. Actually, group scheme over a scheme S. I'm going to this generality. And GLN will mean just GLN over S, okay? Right? GLNS or just GLN when I'm lazy. Lazy and okay, theory and morning. Suppose G is a subgroup of G of M and then for every D greater than zero, one, we can look at the following. First, our G Ln plus D and divide it. Plus d and divide it by a subgroup that looks like this: identity zero something gl d and you send it to glm plus d and now divide it by g, something zero g l d okay so g acts on this from the right via this component, and this is a g torsor and this This is a G-torser, and this is strongly diversal for the class of Netherian affine schemes over S. Okay, so every Netherian affine scheme over S, if it has a detourcer, you can remove something of codimension P plus one, and you will have many specializations to this. This. So these things exist, and this is an explosive example. And also, G Ln plus D over something similar. This term of a zero here. G ln plus d over some g is zero, zero, g l d is a strong reversal for. For this time, it's weaker for an Ethereum alpha and schemes of dimension at most D over S. So this looks weaker, and it is. This is basically containing this, but there is a small hiccup here because we're in shock. This is a priori, not a scheme, and this level of generation. In this level of generality, this is not affine and possibly not a scheme. So maybe. Okay. And this thing will be affine if G is reductive or finite. Okay, so this thing, if you want something affine, then this is the better construction. Construction. This is actually, this is in general an algebraic space. This is one theorem. Next thing is that if you work over a field, you can do better. If you work over filters, now Edgy. So now G is an algebraic group over a field K, which is infinite. And for every D, there exists a G-torsor that is strumbling G-torsor over a smooth quasi-projective Writing that is strongly worse for all the quasi-projective schemes. So it is explicit, but it is a bit complicated. So this is nice because you have a quasi-projective variety and it's dversal for answer, strongly dversal. Answer is strongly diversal. Yes. Strongly diversal for all quasi-projective schemes. So somehow sees everything that would happen here away from codimension. Third theorem, which is actually the easiest one, and that's about what can we have something which is infinity versal or versal for all affine schemes? And the answer is yes. I mean, I thought I gave you an example. You an example. Well, we see that such a thing exists. And what's so special about this example is that this G, it's a P group and the characteristic is P. So this means that G is unipotent. And this is a general phenomenon. Every time you have a unipotent group, you have such a torsor. And so let me state that. So if G is a subgroup of the upper unipotent matrices over, works over any scheme, S. Over any scheme, S, I think S has to be a fine. No, it doesn't. Then you can just consider the G torso Qn to Un over G. This is commonly versal for all the F ends K over S. And this is actually not, this is very easy. And this is actually not, this is very easy. Maybe if I have time, this is an exercise. If I have time, I will give the proof, but I don't think I'll have. But what is surprising is that beyond unequivocal groups, you don't have such examples. And that's theorem four, and this is with T.F. Lawrence and Sir Rosengarten. So there is a limit to how Well that there is a limit to how how good things are uh if uh if G okay, so G is here, is an altarbright group over a field, enough an altarbright group over a field K. If there exists a G torsor X and X is quasi-compact, so that's very, very Plus very, very general, even infinite-dimensional, just be quasi-compact. That is weakly, first of all, for the finite type affine schemes over Q, then G is unipotent. So except for unipotent groups, you don't have such Such a phenomenon. Okay, this is impossible beyond minimum groups, at least overthrow it. And I have about four minutes, I think. So I will tell you about what you can do with these results. So, one thing that you can use this then is for the symbol length. Um so I'm just uh so application is simple and so let me fix a pair of integers, a pair of natural numbers m and n, and r will be a ring. Be a ring with, well, basically, it's going to be a ring with, sorry for writing this so sloppily, 1 over n is an R and a premium n for unity. Otherwise stated, this is an algebra over Z when you adjoin 1 over N and a premium n for unity. Then we have Mercurial system showed Hubbler generalized in Mercuria system theory. Computering computer so that if R is semi-local, then Mercurial system holds for R, meaning that every Azumaya algebra of period dividing N is r equivalent to a product of symbols. Symbols, some number, and the maximum possible number that is needed for an algebra of period M, period defining N. And degree M is known as the, this kind of gives us the NM symbol n for R. And now you can use these results. And now you can use these results to show that it's finite. So the corollary, you need to work a little, but let R B have a semi-local ring. Not necessarily an Ethereum. In Ethereum M and M integers, then first thing is that for every natural number S, there is some constant, some natural number M depending on N, M, and S, such that if the number of maximal ideals of R is at most S, then the symbol length of R is damaged by S. In particular, the symbol, yes. What is M? I don't see any small M, I don't see it in the description. I didn't use it until now. I didn't need it. Yeah. I mean, I used it here. Yes. Okay, I was. I didn't cover it. So it was degree, right? It's, yeah, this would be the degree, and this would be. And this would be the period. That's kind of the max possible L. Okay, no, that's the cell. I'm sorry for being quick. So this is uniformly bounded. In particular, this gives kind of a neat proof to the fact that the symbol length, the NM symbol length of all fields, is bounded, uniformly bounded regardless of the characteristic. Uniformly bounded regardless of the characteristic. And also, okay, I didn't, for every there exists another constant M prime which depends on nm and r such that for every semi-local r algebra r prime. Are prime with infinite residual field, the symbol n of R prime is again uniformly bounded, so now it doesn't depend on the number of maximal ideals, but you need infinite recipient fields, and it has to be over my particular R. And I should say this uses, maybe I'll say a word about the proof. Maybe I'll say a word about the proof. I mean, this uses, you can get this probably from classical methods, but this just use weekly first of all GLN1UN the torsor is but over specs C. So here it's just So here it's useful to have a general base scheme so you can somehow get all rings together. And this thing requires strongly so you really need the affine parameterization, strongly versal GL and not even forcers. I don't know how to work around. You use the upland parameterization to allow you some freedom, and this is why you need the infinite. And this is why you need the infinite residue fields. And let me take another minute just to say: so it spoke about Galois extensions and how in characteristic D we have this kind of universal Galois extension of G is a P group. Well, in this case, G is unipotent. In any other case, if the characteristic is zero or G is not a P group, G is not unipotent. So you will never have a unipotent. So you will never have a universal Gala extension. So this kind of gives a conceptual explanation why we don't have such constructions. Thank you. Any questions? Do you have reasonable estimations for your constants or is it purely nothing is known. I think that the same bounds for field. I think that the same bounds for fields will work for semi-local rings. In your theorem two was the G-torcher that you got, a scheme? Theorem two was the base is smooth, smooth. It was a scheme, it was a quad quasi-projective scheme. Yes. The base was, but the base was uh the third sir was also a scheme. Torsor was also a scheme. Yeah, there is no need to use shift torsors, if that was your question. It's simply assumptions, which is like algebraic group. For any algebraic cheese. G was an algebraic group. Yes. Actually, Ethereum 1 works even if G is not just locally affine. I know like group could you could use groups like this and then you can embed them. You can GL. Yeah, sorry. So, in the statements where the category you review for which it's universal is affine over some basic, why is affine coming up? I mean, technically, it prevents you from having more general decisions. So, it's the okay. Actually, the way of the proof is so remember I told you about Forster's theorem and Forster's theorem and the construction by Michel Anamo. So, actually, the proof actually uses that. So, you just strengthen this theorem significantly. And it only works in the affine case. And I'm not sure that there exists torsors which are versal for all schemes. I mean, quasi-perjective is as far as I could go, but I don't think it's true. I don't think it's true. Maybe it's not true, but I was just wondering if you could see where you're using it, like I don't know, some geographical trick or I don't know something. So I would say that the trick is actually to build on Forster plus Ranald. So these constructions, use more elaborated constructions and more complicated theorems. And that would give you weakly versal GLN torsors for affine schemes up to some dimension. But you can work harder and see that they're dversal. See that they're dversal. And basically, when you have, if E G L N X is weakly versal and you have a subgroup, then this is also weakly versal, but this time it's a G torsor. And you have to work a little more to show, under some assumptions, when this thing is very, very symmetric, it's strongly versal. There is a way to kind of make something which There is a way to kind of make something which is weaklyversal into stronglyversal for free if you have some group acting transitively on that. So, this is basically how it's showing. So, but anyway, because the core is this theorem of Forster, I only know how to build in Gaffine case. Except for that result, it was a bit of a specific case. You could probably ask him during the break, but we have a very tight schedule. Very tight schedule. So let's resume five past two again.
