All right, so welcome to our last talk for today, and it's by Sichi Hur, and he'll tell us about the compactness problem for the Hitching-Simpson equations. Okay, thank you for the invitation. It's my great pleasure to speak here. My title is the compactness problem for the Hitching-Simpson equations. Basically, I'll talk about the compactness problem for like for some kind of equation which we will introduce later. Introduce later. So, um, okay, so here's our schedule for today. Like, I will first talk about the background and motivations, then I'll talk about what is the Hitching-Simpson equations and Higgs bundles. Then I will talk about the main theorem for the equations, and we'll talk about some applications of the compactness theorem. So, we start with introducing something which we call the Z2 harmony one form. Harmony one form. So we begin with m and g to be a smooth Riemannian manifold and sigma to be a co-dimensional two closed subset of m. A z2 harmonic one form is just a two-value one form, where this two-value we denote as plus or minus v, which defines over just m minus this sigma, such that it satisfies the following three conditions. The first is that it's harmonic. Basically, like even its plus or minus valued. it's plus or minus valued like you can still talk about it's harmonic or not basically d plus or minus v is equal to d star plus minus v is equal to zero and the second condition is that the absolute value of v actually can be defined and extend over this singular set sigma like we assume that it's continuous and also also the inverse zero set of this absolute value is equals to this sigma and third condition is that we require that the derivative We require that the derivative of this v is actually lies on L2. So basically, this is a Z2 harmony one form. So let's see some examples of these Z2 harmony one forms. For example, like we start with the manifold to be a complex plane with a holomorphic quadrate Z, then this Z dz tensor dz will be a quadratic differential. So if we take the square root of this So if we take the square root of this query differential, then we get a two-value one form, say, which is like z one half dz. And the real part of this square root will be just a z to harmony one form, as like this z one half has two valued. And also with a singular set, sigma is just z equal to zero. In general, over a Riemann surface, the square root of the correlative differential will always give the z to common one form. So this So, this is a big source of examples. But let's move to where we consider M as a Kayla manifold. For example, like if we're given a Kayla manifold, and we let like omega M10 to be the vector bundles of one, zero forms, and we denote S2 of omega m1, zero to be the second symmetric power of this one, zero form bundles. Then we consider the space, actually, the space of symmetric. Actually, it's a space of symmetric differential of rank one, which is the sections of this holomorphic sections of this second symmetric power of this bundle. And we assume that the rank at each fiber is less than or equal to one. So the rank means the following thing. So on each fiber of this, like S has rank one just means that S can be locally written as a form of S is equal to V tensor V. And S has rank 0 just means S. And S s rank zero just means S vanishing at that fiber. Then for such kind of S, like the real part of the square root of it will be a Z to harmony one form. Just as the same as the Riemann surface. Like the inverse is also true. Like suppose V is a Z to harmony one form. Then if you take its one zero part tensor with its one zero part, it will be a symmetric differential of rank one. And as you're taking a square root, And as you're taking a square root of previous like square root of s actually, you will always face a nominee of this z two. Okay. So it's pretty easy to understood if it has a complex structures. But actually, like when we think of it over a generally many manifold, like the z2 homie one form is actually not so easy to construct. For example, like when I first look at this concept, I just think the existence At this concept, I just think the existence of a zeta-human one form will just be another type of Hart theorem. However, it's somehow much harder than a Hart theorem. The existence of Zetham1 form is a free boundary problem. Like it's a PDE for both unknown one form and unknown singular set. For example, like given a closed manifold M and given a co-dimensional two subset, you don't expect you'll find a solution with the right regularity. Like the co-dimensional two subset itself will be something that needs to be solved. Solved. So there are some many known results about this Z2 Harmony 1 form. For example, one of the most motivation for us to study this is due to TOPS, is that the Z2 Harmony 1 forms will arise from limits of solutions of various coupled equations for connections plus like additional fields over three and four manifolds. And people have different understanding of these z2 harmony one forms. Of these zitohammin1 forms. For example, like the work of Takahashi and the work of Donaldson, they build up cranitious structures of this zitohamme one form in different settings. And also, like in the work of Donga and Wapuski, actually they prove that existence of Z2am1 form over three-manifold with first beta number bigger than one. And even in our assumption, like our singular set is a close. Our singular set is a closed subset. Actually, like the work of Bo Yang, like he proved that singular set is rectifiable. So, in some sense, it's very good news for people who want to do applications. Okay. So, now let's talk about like TOPS communication and the main motivation for us to study this. So, basically, like the main motivation for me to study the Zeto-Hammer 1 form is coming from the low-dimensional topology. Dimensional topology. Since the 1980s, like gauge theory, especially SCO2 gauge theory, become a very successful tool in the study of the low-dimensional topology. In 2009, Witten proposed possible new invariants for 3 and 4 manifold, which is related to the SL2C connections. So one of the most important things to know for Witten's program is that we need to understand the behavior of the flat SL2C connection. Note that the model space of flat SL2C connection can be identified with a crack variety. Can be identified with a cracker variety, which is representation from pi one of your manifold into SL2C modules the conjugation class. So, as SL2C is a non-compact group, so you expect that the model space of flat SL2C connection is also non-compact. So historically, there are many different computations of the Keraker variety. For example, like Surston complication, Morgan-Schaden complication. We are looking for a complication in the We are looking for a competition in the gay series stance. So, since 2013, like Taubes in his series of paper makes Whitton's program approachable, like Toppes proved a compactness theorem for the SL2C connections, a flat connections. I'm missing something. And the Z2 harmony one forms will be the ideal boundary of Toppes complication. Okay, so now I will explain more details about what Topps. More details about what Topps proved. So, before we talk about that, we talk about how do we set the setting of this SL2C connections. So, we start with M, a closed manifold, and P to be a principal SU2 bundle of it. And SL2C connection just consists of two parts, which I denote as A plus A, phi. Well, A is the SO2 connection, and phi is a Lie algebra value, one form. So, the reason why. So, the reason why it's called the SL2C connection is because that the Lie algebra of SL2C is SCO2 direct sun I SCO2. Thus, like this A pass i phi defines the SL2C connection. So a connection is called flat if the curvature of A pass i phi vanishes. Or equivalently, like we can wrote as like FA minus V y phi is equal to zero, DA phi is equal to zero, and pass. dA phi is equal to zero and plus a gate fixing turn dA star phi is equal to zero. Where F A is a curvature of connection A and D A is a covariant derivative. And after fixing the automorphism of bundle, these equations are elliptic equations. So here's the statement of Top's theorem. So if we start with a three and four closed four dimensional closed manifold, and if you're given a sequence of flat connections, You're given a sequence of flat connections. So, suppose that the L2 norm of this phi goes to infinity, then there exists a codimension 2 singular set sigma such that this Ai and you need to phi i rescaled by this phi out 2 norm convergence to a z to harmony 1 form outside of this codimension 2 singularity. So, basically, like it's a code, this is a real codimension 2. This is a real codimension tool, and this is a real manifold. So, if this L2 norm is bounded, then the statement will be followed by the wooden bed compactness. So, the goal of today's talk is following. So, we are following the following two problems. So, first, it says the deformation problem. So, when a Z2 common in one form can be realized by Harmony one form can be realized by a sequence of flag connections. Here, the word realize just means there exists a sequence of flag connections that will convergence to it. And the second thing we are interested in to talk about is that could we generalize top result to SLNC and to high dimensional manifold? We should mention that some known result was these two questions. Over Riemann surface, these two questions are very These two questions are very successfully answered. First, by the work of Maziel Sawoboda, Wis and Witt, they studied the deformation for generic ends of SL2C flat connections. And also by the work of Machizuki, he studied the asymptotic behavior and compactness for the SLNC connections and many different settings. And by the work of Laura, he studied the deformation of generic ends for SLNC flat connections, basically. Connections basically. So to solve these problems is too ambitious if we look at how long TOPS papers are. Like TOPS proof heavily relies on the structures of SL2C and the dimensions 3 and 4. So the goal of today's talk is to discuss these problems over a Kayla manifold. So there are two huge advantages when we consider a Kayla manifold. First, like you have many complex geometry tools that will make your computation calculation Will make your computation calculation easier. Second, and probably the most important things is that you have the Kubayashi-Hitchin correspondence for the flat connections that enable to use some algebraic geometry method to analysis what behavior of the PDEs. Sichi, can I ask a question? Yes, sure. So in the equation, can you go back to the slide of the equation just for me to see? Yes. Yes. So in the four-dimensional case, So, in the four-dimensional case, do you know what happens if you, instead of the equation on the left, you have the self-dual component of that? That would be some sort of complex self-dual SL2C connection. Yes, if we take the first equation self-dual part and DFE anti-self-dual part is a serial tops, there exists a co-dimension two-singular set, and also there exists a Wooden Merc-Bubble phenomenon. Okay. And up to these two kinds. Okay. And up to these two kinds of singularities that it converges. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yes. But like if this DAP part is also both is self-dual part is not nobody proved that. They're both self-dual? You don't know. We don't know nobody proved that. But like I see, I see. So plus and minus on the other. Plus and minus on the other, yes, plus and minus on the other, yes, okay. So now we'll keep on going about like talk about like what is the Hisch-Simpson equations. Um, so we start with a Kayla manifold, and we start with E to be a complex vector bundle with fixed Hermitian matrix. So, for fixed for a pair like A and Phi, we have the following splitting due to due. The following splitting due to the kilo decomposition, like we split into the holomorphic part and anti-holomorphic part, and phi we wrote as this phi and phi dagger, where we always say this lies on omega 1, 0. So Hitchin-Simpson equations are generalizations of flat connection equations over a Kayla manifold for A phi, and which can be written as the follows. The follows. The first one is like the contraction with the Kayla class of this FA plus phi dagger is equal to zero. And the second system is that the curvature is zero, two part is equal to zero. And this phi one, zero part is holomorphic. And the actual condition is that this phi watch phi is equal to zero. So when m is a closed Klaus surface, like the work of Tanaka. Surface, like the work of Tanaka shows that the Hitching-Simpson equation is just the same as the Cop-Simita equations or some kind of dimension reductions of the spin-7 equations, spin-7 instances. So let's look at these equations. Does the second line of this equation have more symmetry than the first line? So if we start an automorphism element G inside the automorphism E, we can define We can define an action of g as like we send the partial a bar to g inverse partial bar g and phi to g inverse phi g. And this preserves the second line, but not the first line as it doesn't preserve the Hermitian matrix. And the first line, both the curvature and this phi dagger relies on that. So actually, like the second line of this system implies we get a Higgs bundle. So FA02. So FA02 is equal to 0 means we have a holomorphic bundle with a holomorphic structure we denote as this script E. And partial bar A phi is equal to 0 just means that phi is a holomorphic sections of this even phi is an endomorphism value, but it's a one, zero form. So it's a holomorphic section of this bundle. Okay, actually this is a definition of Higgs bundle. So give a definition of Higgs bundle is just a pair of this holomorphic bundle and pair of this holomorphic bundle and phi such that e is a holomorphic bundle and phi is a sections of sections of this this bundle and with actual condition that phi wedge phi is equal to zero so actually like you will see that over Riemann surface like this phi wedge phi is equal to zero is automatic automatic automatically satisfied but in higher dimensional actually this main difference in higher dimensional comparing to the Riemann surface that we have To the Riemann surface, that we have these actual conditions. And we will see this later. So for the Hitching-Simpson equations, like we have the following Kubayashi Hitching correspondence. So this is proved by Hitching in 1987 and later by Simpson for high dimension in 1988. Say there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the solutions to the Hitching-Simpson equations and actually it's a polystable Hitching equation. Actually, it's a polystable Higgs bundle. Even we don't introduce what is that, but it's just a generalization of stable bundles definition. And we won't use that so much. So the model space of Higgs bundle is the algebra object. And our philosophy is that we could use them to understand the behavior of the PDE systems. Okay. So let's talk about. So let's talk about how can we take advantage of this Kubai Hitching correspondence. So actually there are two properties we are usually used. So our settings from the Higgs bundle side, we focus on the SL2C Higgs bundle, which we denote as EMP. We just for presenting simplification, we just consider this SL2C once. And we assume that like the rank is equal to two and the chase Is equal to two and the trace of phi is equal to zero. Then, like, let's as phi is actually a holomorphic section of this bundle, and we can define what is a eigenvalue, basically, like because phi has its endomorphism value. So we say lambda is a is a one-zero form is an eigenvalue of phi if there exists sections such that phi s is equal to numbda s. And like the condition that phi y phi is equal to zero will. phi y phi is equal to zero will guarantee that this eigenvalue is well defined. And note that for SL2C Higgs bundle, the eigenvalues will always come into pairs like namda, a puzzle minus namda. So from here like you see that for example like if we one choose a base of the manifold and you can define define the eigenvalue for each components but actually the phiway tree phi condition will tell you that each component the matrix commutes so that the eigenvalue will be well defined. So actually this condition is very important conditions. Okay. So another part of the of the of the like peaks bundle we will introduce is a hitching morphism. Probably a more familiar word is a hitching vibration which introduced by hitching in 1987 and the hitching 1987. And the hechimorphism is a high-dimensional generalization. And that's the paper studied from Eigo and Chen two years ago. Okay. So basically, what is a Hitchimorphism? So we start with a model space of Higgs bundle, we do M Higgs. Then we can define a map, say, which we denote kappa, which sends a model space of Higgs bundle to these holomorphic sections of the semantic. These holomorphic sections of the symmetric tensor, we just send e phi to the determinant of phi, and the determinant map will let you forgot about this bundle. So you only get something on the Kayla manifold. And the image of this kappa is not subjective due to the actual condition that phi watch phi is equal to zero. And actually, this condition means, just means that under the Hitching morphism, like we obtain. Like we obtain a rank one tensor. Or in other words, like as we see in the previous page, like the eigenvalue of phi will come into pairs, lambda and minus namda. So basically, like the image of this kappa will be a rank one tensor. So we define the Hitching base, we know as Bm. It's just a rank one tensor of this second symmetric power. Second symmetric power, then the Hitching morphism becomes a map from the Higgs bound maps, the model space of Higgs bundle to this Hitching base. And actually, like this Hitching base will be the same coincident with the Z to Harmony 1 form as we introduced at the very beginning of this talk, is that for given any sections of this, any elements in the Hitching base, the real part of square root of it will be a z to hominid one form. And the singular One form, and the singular set will be equals to this s inverse zero. So, in some sense, like the Hitching morphism will connect the Z21 form and with the Higgs bundle. So, is there any questions? So, suppose you have a set to harmonic one form, does it have to be of this form? Yes, like if you take the one zero part tensor, it's one zero part. zero part tensor is one zero part, then the z2 anomaly will cancel and it lies on here, lies in this set. Well, I guess what I mean is, suppose you start only with the Z2 harmonic one format as an assumption, so it has to arise in this way. It has to, it lies in the hitching base. Yeah, it has to arise in this way, yes, as you say. Arising this way, yes, as you say. Yes. Like, it depends on the regularity, your assumption of that z2 harmony one form. For example, if you assume that the durity lies on L2, then it has to lie in this space. Are you happy with that? Well, I guess I was puzzled by how you pinned down the singular set in the first place. I mean, I can believe that. Okay, okay. I think that YouTube. Um, I mean, I think that Yuji Tanaka sort of had a regularity result for the singular set in that case that it had to be a divisor. Um, in KL manifold, it has to be a complex analytic sub-variety. Exactly what I was saying, yeah. Yes, um yes, I will come to a come to let you, yes, because like the singular set is just a zero set of the holomorphic sections. A zero set of the holomorphic section, so it's a complex identity sub-variety. Okay, yes, I will let's discuss it later. And I will talk about like now I will talk about like the main theorem. So before we introduce the main result, we will try to describe like the main difficulty. try to describe like the main difficulty in proving this kind of theorem. So if you have Ai and φi be a sequence of solutions to the Hitching-Simpson equations, if we denote like I to be the phi i L2 norm and phi i hat to be i inverse of phi i, then the Hitching-Simpson equation can be written as the following form. The second line we don't do anything and the first line we just Put i inverse 2 in front of the curvature part. But actually, it will give us some trouble. It's that like this I inverse 2, this wedge of FAI is somehow the elliptic part of this equation. However, when this i goes to infinity, the ellipse system becomes degenerate. And you can think of this problem as like this epsilon i square of Laplacian fi is equal to some Launcher. Plausion of fi is equal to some non-linear low-order term. And we were trying to prove our compactness when this epsilon i goes to zero. So, this is somehow some kind of things we need to figure out how to deal with. So, here's the main theorem. So, if we start with a sequence of solutions to the Hitching-Simpson equations, and if we denote this i to be the L-tunal of phi i and phi i phi i and phi i had to be the rescaled l to rescaled and suppose that this ri goes to infinity then there exists a co-dimension for singular set which i denote as sigma u h for simplify for ulenbeck and co-dimension two singular set sigma t t for tops such that this first under the hegemorphism like this coupled phi hat will converge smoothly inside of this homologic class and second And second, like this Ai phi i hat will convergence to this a to an A infinity phi infinity hat over this m set minus of this two kind of singular set sigma t union sigma Ulenbeck inside of in the in the sense of W1P and the third is that this sigma t will be this the norm you can talk about like phi infinity phi infinity hat norm and will be the zero set. hat norm and will be the zero set of this infinity hat norm and fourth set the limit will satisfy equation which which which is the decouple equation first this a infinity will be homogeneous mu's and second like you will face like this phi infinity hat where phi infinity hat is equal to zero so this uh the statement so is there any questions Sorry, what's yes? Thank you. What's P? Any number bigger than one. Oh, so you're in, so you're in, are you in dimension two now or no? I'm in any Killer dimension, killer management. So just anything where you have an Ice LP theory. Yes. Okay. You don't need it bigger than half the dimension. I think. I think I don't need that, yes. In the weak sense, yes. Yeah, yes, please. May I ask where does the co-dimension for a singular set come from? Oh, I will expand, expand, expand later, yes, in the next few pages. Okay. From the permission on your singularity. I guess, Professor Machsuhi, you tried to say something, but we couldn't hear you. Probably the internet problem, or probably due to my internet problem. Internet power. Okay. Now I will expand that how can we prove this. So basically, let's look at the equations again. So the Woodenbeck compactness theorem tells us that, say, these are our equations. The Woodland compactness theorem tells us The Ruhmmeck compact theorem tells us that if we control the curvature, we can control everything outside of a codimensional forward set, which in our case is this F A. But the enemy is that this Ri inverse 2 goes to zero. And we need to compare the decay rate of this Ri inverse 2 and the term of this phi i hat vehicle phi i hat. Basically, this is what we are trying to do. And given any point of p Given any point of p inside of this manifold, if we wrote dp is the difference between different eigenvalues of this phi, then we can show that like the size of this vi hat where vi hat will be have this following bounce, which is bound exponentially, whereas this constant depends on manifold. But the point is that this dp is inside of this exponential, is inside of the exponential here. And as i goes to infinity, And as I goes to infinity, this term will be exponentially smaller when this dp is positive. And actually, this estimate can be hold over a size, roughly it's like RI inverse dp size bore. So with this bound, like, so that will give you exponential decays and definitely it decays much faster than this inverse tool. So the geometry meaning of this talk. So, the geometry meaning of this top singularity, like Zt, will be the set, like for example, for SL2C, or in general case, it's also true, is that will be the set that the eigenvalue of this phi coincident. In addition, the L2 norm I become larger and larger, like the flat connection A plus I phi will be more and more looks like a diagonal connection in the direction of eigenvalue outside of this top singularity. Top singularity. So that's a main way we prove it. Sorry, this is eigenvalue of what? Eigenvalue of this zero part of this phi. Where does this exponential bound come from? It will come from some estimate, like identity. Like you can get an estimate for these projections of VI. Could you remind what Ri was? If you have I, it's a like if you have a sequence of solution AI and phi. R is L2 norm of phi i, yes. Thank you. Phi hat is you rescale phi by its L2 norm. Yes. And the point is that, like, you can get it exponential decay, exponential small in the size of R inverse DP bore. And also like when DP positive in this size of bore, you can control the decays. Okay. Mm. Okay. So let me let me give some remarks of the Baus theorem. So when M is a Killer surface, this recovers the result of tops. So the exponential decay property of this Vi hat is first find by Machizuki in the Riemann surface. Actually, it's his insight to observe like this term can be estimated by the eigenvalues. Just to think. Just to think in the previous slide you said that the flat connection, but this connection is not flat. You are making a comparison with what Taubs does for this equation? Yes, so the equations like Taubes studies is a Hitching-Simpson equation in four-dimensional, which is equivalent to the Kafsi-Witten equation, which is equivalent to what you say about this FA minus VY3 passes. A minus v pass is equal to zero, dA phi minus is equal to zero, that equation in this scalar surface setting. Okay, but the flat connection you mentioned is a comparison only, or is there really a flat connection? It's a subset of that Hitching-Simpson equation. You assume the second chunk character is equal to zero, then okay. Okay, okay, I see, I see. Yes, it's uh just. Yes, it's uh just it's uh so can you interpret this as um you have a yes, you have a trivial loop around some set. Yes, um it's trivial if you include a set, but it's non-trivial if you take out a set. And you are getting non-trivial allonomy around it as you take this sequence. Um, this depends on not necessarily, this depends on like Necessarily, this depends on the multiplicity of this z to harmony function or z to harmony one form. For example, like if you face like z dz time tensor with dz when you take a square root and it becomes z one half dz and you have monojomy monoja me negative one around that loop. But what you might face is that z square dz times tens of dz. And when you take a square root, Bz and when you take a square root, you do get a plus or minus sign. But in that case, like the monodromy is plus one. So the monodromy totally depends on the vanishing order at that singular set. So if the vanishing order of a quadratic differential is odd, then you really get a monojromy minus one. But this process in the limit, like you don't necessarily get a monojromy minus one. You don't necessarily get a monogram in minus one's case. Okay, okay, thank you. I got it. Okay, so in this sense, this recovers the work of TOPS. So the exponential decay property of this phi hat-what phi hat is first find by Monochizuki when he studied the asymptotic behavior on the Riemann surface. And also, the proof works for. And also, the proof works for SLNC connections. Basically, like the previous statement in the ideal proof, it's just difference between eigenvalue. And also, the co-dimension for singular set, actually sigma-Ullenbeck, is a classical singular set which appears in the Hermitian Amios equation. And which naturally appears when you apply the Ullenbeck compactness. So that's why the co-dimension for singular set. The co-dimensional singular set comes out. And so the co-dimension two singular set, like sigma t, is a new type of singular behavior that's found by TOFS, and which doesn't appears in the Hermitian-Mills equation. And actually, this kind of singular set it comes from the source of actual Higgs fields. Okay, so now I will. Okay, so now I will try to try to like talk about the applications. So we can say the deformation of realization problem for Z2 Harmony 1 form. So a Z2 Harmony 1 form can be realized if and only if it lies in the image of the Hitching morphism of a polystable Higgs bundle. So this is the proof will follow by the compactness theorem. So the natural So the natural part is the if part. Like given a polystable Higgs bundle, E and phi, and because like actually like the Higgs bundle, you have a semi-linear properties. Like for any T lies on R, like this E T phi will also have the same polystability. And by the Kubier Shi Hitchin correspondence, it will give you a family of solutions of 80 and 50. ATM 50 and the claim follows by the previous compactness theorem. So, basically, like the previous compactness theorem will tell you that this ATM50 will converge into the desired z2 harmony one form. Okay. Yes, applications. So, for example, like one could compute many things to analysis, like what kind of z2. What kind of z2 harmony one form can be realized? For example, one could compute what is a hitching base and try to compute what is the hitching morphism to see like how can we how can we realize the z2 harmony one form. For example, like when this x is m is a rural surface, like if we take like pi to be the math from x to sigma, be a vibration with p1 fiber, then the poor. Fiber, then the pullback like will be isomorphism. So, basically, it will pour the quadratic differential inside of base Riemann surface to the space of second symmetric tensor of this omega 1, 0. So in this case, like the hechomorphism will be subjective, and all possible top singularity that could be developed as like, say, Zt, it looks like 4g minus 4. 4g minus 4 of pi inverse of pi, where this p of p1 p4g minus 4 are zeros of a quadratic differential over sigma. Okay. Okay. So basically like one can try other examples, for example, Riemann surface times Riemann surface and study the hitching morphism. So I'm actually I'm actually much faster than I thought. So I actually prepared the questions. So in 2009, like Tanaka and Thomas defined the Waffle-Witten invariance using algebraic geometry method in K surface, actually. From the algebraic geometry side, Higgs fields for Hitching-Simpson equation are not well behaved comparing to the Higgs field for the Waffle-Witten equations. Like the Higgs field for Waffle-Witten equations, which I wrote as beta, I wrote as beta, which is lies in the endomorphism of bundle, but with values in the canonical bundle, which is a two-zero form. And therefore, like there will be nothing conditioned like beta, which beta is equal to zero. So the Wacher-Witten equation roughly looks like this. And so from the Higgs bundle side, like it's it's it's quite easy to um it's easier to understood the buffer. Easier to understood the Waffle-Witten equation six bundle comparing to the Hitching-Simpson equation. Basically, there's no conditions beta wer. But from an analytic point of view, Waffle-Witten equation looks harder to me. Like, for example, the compactness problem for Water-Witten equation is harder because, like, even you can prove that this beta and beta star will be very small, you have no idea to control the L2 norm of the curvature. Control the L2 norm of the curvature. So this somehow confused me, so I left this as a question. Okay. Okay. And I'm 20 minutes ahead. So I think I will stop here. So with two photos. So this two photos is taken in 2017 of the BIRS workshop. And many of you probably also there. Also, there. And this is a welcome page in the lobby. And this is a deer and the back of the deer here. Like I took, I took in front of the VIRS work center. And I think I will stop here. Thank you. Yes. Thank you so much, Sichi. Questions? Can you maybe say something about where this exponential of decay comes from? Well, maybe that's very technical. I mean, you say some. Yes, so basically, like that's how you can do this. So basically, like you phi will looks like, will have a decomposition with respect to eigenvalue. But you are trying to study the You are trying to study the, but your matrix will not be diagonal with respect to the eigenvalue decomposition of phi. So that exponential decay somehow turns out to be an exponential decay of the projection of your matrix into the eigenvalue space. And that projection will satisfy some equations, will let you let you can control the projections, the decays of that projections. So that's how we get exponential. So that's how we get exponential decays. Her questions? That, yes, I think the one of the part is that that term, phi by phi, is not a function. So basically, it's So basically, it estimates the communication, communicator of two matrix. And basically, like the diagonal part, it doesn't influence. So what influence is that how far you are from the diagonal part? So that's somehow the estimate goes. Yes. Cichi, don't don't you get an error? Get an energy formula in the Waffle-Witten equation that tells you that the energy needs to be something? Yes, but the problem is that there's no not such a good energy identity in the Waffle-Witten equation. You do get exponential decays for beta star, but this exponential decay is only obtained outside. decay is only obtained outside of a co-dimension outside of a co-dimension two subset so outside of a coordination two subset you can control the f a pass of that term but that doesn't give you any control of the whole energy basically because the energy will will can happen is that the energy will will will will escape in that or will become more in that singular set generates exponential in what parameters Exponential in what parameter? In the size of the eigenvalue exponentials, like previously, in the size of eigenvalue difference of this beta. In what parameter? In the L2 norm of beta? Yes. The L2 non, the L2 norm of beta will go to infinity. Other questions? Does the Laplacian of beta, beta star satisfy some equation of the norm of that or something? La partial beta norm satisfy the equation. of beta norm satisfy equation like laplacian or beta beta norm square will satisfy equation which will tells you that l2 norm of beta will controls l infinity norm of beta but um laplacian of beta comma beta star i don't i don't get something probably i i don't try very hard to get something i was just asking because it it you equated to the scalar part of the curve Part of the curvature here. Yes, I haven't. I don't know. Yes. Okay. Thank you. All right. Let's thank Sichi once more. Thank you. And I want to remind everyone that at half past, we'll have another discussion hour. We'll have another discussion hour, probably on Sokoko. So we can continue asking questions to the speakers there. And we'll resume tomorrow morning with the talks. Just a reminder that the discussions will be happening in other Zoom sessions, and they're in corresponding rooms on Sokoko, or you can access them directly. Coco, or you can access them directly through the links sent to you.
