All right, so for our next speaker this morning, we have Hernandez Ribero, who will tell us a little bit about an overview on four-dimensional gradient shrinking salt, freechi salt. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you, Elki. Thank you, Arganized, the invitation. It's a great pleasure for me to be here, the first time in Canada. And with this view, it's a fantastic opportunity. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. So, I'd like to discuss a little bit some open problems on four-dimensional gradient shearing riches. But I let me try to start the talk, show you some basic facts about this subject. So, I try to explain the motivation of Rich Historic very quickly, just a few minutes, and then explain why you are interested in dimension 4, specifically, why dimension 4. Y-dimensional flow. And then I discussed some classification results in the undoestimate. The idea is to try to show at least four open problems of this subject. So let me start history reaches sultans. There are many, but one of them is that they are natural. Ah, it's here. I'll be losing with this. Okay, let me start with the definition. A gravity which is solved as a remaining manifold together with a potential function f satisfying this extended Einstein equation. This often spoke too much about Einstein manifolds, the rich becomes proportional to the metric. And here we have a theorem, the Haitian F here. Okay, so this can be seen as tennis Eisen equation. So example. Equation. So there is a marginal version of this equation when you assume there is term here, one half of the new derivative of n vector field proportional to the metric. And when this vector field is a gradient vector field, we have covered the equation one. But today you are interested in the gradient type. You will be clear in a few minutes why you are interested in this specific equation one. So when lambda is positive, you call shrink type, like a rich soil, spend when lambda is equals to zero and spend Is equal to zero and span lambda is negative. And after we scan of the metric, we may assume that in the shrink case, lambda is one half, in the span case minus one half. And I will consider this normalization in our talk, okay? When you talk about shrink, I will assume that lambda will be one half. So the motivation to study rich results are many, but of course, a natural extension of ISM end folds when you can see ISM and When you can see an isomanifold as a trivial example of which is solid. But the main motivation comes from this model of singularities in the flow. But interesting is that they also appear at clinical points of certain enzymatic functional. For example, the new entropy functional produced by PERP. It's another interesting motivation. Of course, we don't have time to discuss each one, but let me give at least one idea for the students, say for someone we will see it. Say for someone who will see the video in a light. So the first, it's easy to see, it's just this theme four here. Okay. But the minimum motor ratio comes from the rich flow. Rich flow is this system, essentially the reflecting of the mercury equals to minus twice the rich curvature. It's similar to the heat equation. The idea of the heat equation is to get some reformization of the temperature. To get some reformization of the temperature, and here the idea behind is trying to get some reformization of the curvature. Okay, so, but a lot of this process can be appear some special features. For example, we can develop symbolat. If we start the bridge flow with a round sphere, for instance, the sphere with the round metric, along of this process of the flow, when you change the met along with the flow, Change the bed along the flow, this sphere becomes small, more, small, and goes to a point. But we know, for example, in dimension two, if I take a sphere, the curvature is a one divided by the highest squared. And if this becomes small, the highest goes to zero and the curvature goes to infinity. And then we have a blow-up of the curvature in the finite time. We give a lot of singularity in the finite time. The curvature blows up. Okay, it's exactly what I put to here. Exactly, what I put to here. Capital T is the maximal time of the existence of the flow. When this time goes to this maximum, this capital T, the scale just goes up. A similar thing can happen if you take something like a neck. If you have a solution of temperature flow, and you can see here in this neck, this temperature just goes up because this neck goes to a line in a finite time. And again, you have. Finite time. And again, you have finite time singularity. And Hamilton divides the type of singularity in three types. And the type 1 singularity is when the equivalent blows up proportional 1 over the time remaining of the existence of the flow. It's equivalent to say that Linux here is finite. And now we know by combining By combining results of these autos here, that the blow-ups around top one singularity, this type one similarity here, converge to a gradient through infriended software. And then there are models of singularity in the field. This is why it's one of the wheels that are interested in gradient and true influence. So if you look for the compact case, In compact case, we have more motivation to consider shrink and gradient type. For example, we know by Pernon's work that every compact rich result is a gradient type. Essentially, what he proves is that if you have a gradient-rich salt, we have the general equation with one half of the reader achieved, we can replace that vector field by a gradient vector field. And then we can assume that the And then we can assume that the compact case in which the salt is gradually tight. And also, you know by the paper of Hamilton and combined with Ali Ray that if you have a head in span it reaches salt, it must be Einstein type. But if it's compact and the rich solitones becomes einstein, it's easy to prove that the potential function must be constant. Just use a mass movement. And then of course it's trivial in the sense that the function is constant. Not trivial in the sense this Not to be out in the sense disease because I think it's very difficult as well. You know, dimension of water is complicated. So then, if you are talking about compact rigisorals, of course, non-eyed, non-trivial, must be shrink-top. But I need to show an example. Let me start with non-compact examples, but let me put here 3VR1. The 3VR1 in the case of compact is a sphere or the core. Of compact is a sphere or the coefficient of sphere. Take CP2, project expanding, something like this. But here with positive lasting constants, we will be like, we need this positive constant in the compact case. So, and this example is trivial in the sense that the potential function is constant. But we are interested in the examples with non-constant functions. Interesting is that the Gaussian solute. In the Gaussian salt, pin space, of course, is which flat, but there is a potential function which is not trivial, not constant, and satisfy the rich solid equation. Remember, from now on, we are only considering gradient and trigger. Then, these three examples here are gradient and trigger. So, as I Christoph spoke, if you have If you have an einstein with lambda positive, it must be compact. And here, the Gaussian solutions show that the geometry is different because you have lambda positive, but not compact. So, and another example is the product, the product of, for example, filter and isolate here. We have positive curvature, and a product with the opinion factor. And here, the potential function is just take some functional. Just take some functions which only depend on the obtained effect. Okay, we have example can go more. So, what we know about the geometry of this guy, before I do that, let me say that we know that in shrink case, this calculator is always non-negative. In fact, if that is a point P such that this calculator 2 is zero, it's possible to prove that it must be rich flat. That it must be rich flat and there must be the Gaussian salt. And then, if you remove the Gaussian salt after this, we can assume the scalar curvature is strictly positive. This was proved by three Italian mathematicians, Iglo in Boltz, in SERTS, by combining this result of the long shank. And this equation, this inequality here, tree, it's very important for us. This was proved by, I don't have. was proved by I don't file the ten two around 2010 and what it proved that the asymptotic behavior of the potential function exactly the same asymptotic behavior of the Gaussian solitude the distance function squared and this result this inequality here is sharp achieved but it's exactly the same of the the the Gaussian solitude and this was proved initially by Feldman by assuming the Fermi, by assume the rich bound condition here. Essentially, they remove this condition. And in particular, this implies that the weight and volume of a gradient shrinkage solar is finite. This is fundamental to use some argument with integration by parts and non-compact manifolds, put some cut off functions, something like this. So the problems is essentially try to classify the Try to classify the knowing examples or try to understand or obtain new examples, which seems very difficult, but very recently there's some progress in this direction as well. Try to understand the classification, but we start to have the classification looking for the dimension. Interesting is that, remember, we are in this equation now. Now, this talk always assumed this normalization. Assume this normalization. And we know that by the Hamilton paper, that if you have a two-dimensional right-hand cross-solute, and then it must be a right coefficient of the Dausen solitum by sphere. And in other words, two-dimensional gradient solids are full classified. The same thing holds in dimension 3, but here I have another guy here, see the problem. It's a concept. It's a consequence of the apex. This guy hammered on a very paramount evolux, and finally, I don't saw what they removed the covert conditions using the previous papers. And then we now know that in three-dimensional granulation sort of it must be the finite coefficient of the sphere R3 quester cross R. And again, full cross. So if you Full curvature. So, if you sorry, if you say they remove curvature assumptions, you always mean they do not assume bounded curvature. No converted curvature. There's no assumption here. They remove it the lesson. So, what about dimension four? Okay, but you know that dimension four is very special. Many futures dimension four comes from the fact that the bond of two fonts can be divided. The bulb of two forms can be invariantly infused as you like to sum. In particular, this decomposition is conformally invariant. And when you're looking for the decomposition of the curvature tensor, appear guy here, this guy in the red colour, the trace three parts of the decomposition of the room tensor. It's called a violent tensor. It's not appear in dimension 2 and 3. Dimension 2 and 3, this guy is zero. And now, this guy appears here and put D515 in your chalk. Put D50 in your job. Okay, but if this guy appears here, he becomes a natural target in dimensional form. Interesting is that when you're looking for this guy as in normal theme of the body of two forms, we can confuse the self-dual and self-dual part. Remember that dimension four, if there is uh this vibe tends to be zero, it's equivalent to say that manifold is locally conformally flat. 4 is locally conformally flat. And the interesting is that if you have indimension 4, with this decomposition, I can assume just one P is zero, which is half conformally flat. For example, the complex projective plane is an example of a half-conformally flat manifold, but it's not locally conformally flat. So another interesting is the curvature can be expressed in this matrix, and here appear the self-law part. The self-walled part of the ball tensor is character term, and the reachable here, the ball up here, is this term, the first slash reach tensor. And when this reachable is zero, we obtain the reach proportional to the mat, then it becomes ice thing close related. Here is a thing that says that I like. It's interesting that because I stay information for seen is very interesting and the richest order as well. And the richest oil as well. So, another interesting thing is that in the calculator 4, there was instant proof around the 80s that the self-dual part squared is equal to this calculator squared divided by 24, specifically because we are information forces. This will be interesting for us in three minutes. So, how about examples? Okay, but now you can are comfortable to discuss another examples. When you talk about When we talk about compact, we know that must be gradient, must be shrink type, and you know in dimension two and three can be the finite coefficient of a sphere, type classifier, and trivials. But in dimension four, the first example was obtained around 1991 by Hayon Sao in Abu Poizu by solving ODM on incaladas. On in collaborators, we essentially the CP2 grow up to one point. And 13 years later, up here the second example by Wanzu by solving a Mojang-Perry equation. And here is the CP2 got two points. And now it's very few people know, but I think some experts know that if you have a calorie which is solid, it must be. Reaches solidum, it must be, in a compact case, it must be one of these. But if a sunkeler is a consequence of the Chianzu result proving to us, so but here I will leave the first problem. This problem was proposed by Haidong in 2006, but he asked about the existence of a new example, a non-Kell example. This problem is still open. Of course, you Still open. Of course, if you assume Keller, but we still example in compact case, okay, in the situation here in compact case, but it's still open for a non-Kell. It does open in higher dimensions. True. Not only in 40. So 4 dimension. Yeah. But in higher dimensions? It's also open. No, in high dimensions, they say. In the compact case, it's open for high dimensions as well. But you know, in dimension four, the topology and geometry is very close. And what you know is about which solitons in dimension four when you talk about photogeometry in topology is that the all characteristic must be positive. This is equivalent to say that a gradient which is soliton. That gradient reaches solitum, four-dimensional gradient solitum, must satisfy the Beige inequality. This is a topological abstraction for the resistance of itself. It's a weaker construction, but it is one abstraction. So, but a very useful abstraction was obtained by the disease, Fernando, Lugar Siah, and finally, Liber Wai proved a very general result that which implies that a compact which is soft has finite. That a compact which is solid has finite fundamental group. And this gives an interesting topological obstruction to the existence of a geometric structure, which is a multi-solid as well. But we know a few things about compact. It's interesting because in compact relative solitons, I don't know why, but seems to be more intriguing. So, but it's well known that dimension four we have these two formulas which involve the These two formulas which involve the Euler characteristic and signature to topological invariance. And this is the Gauss-Wonne-Schen formula and the Heisenberg formula. And interesting is that this theme in the right-hand side only depends on the metric, but the theme of the left-hand side is a Papaji invariant. And when you combine these two guys, we know that we have this equation here. Here, okay, and this reach evolved. Sorry, they get some from the what is the talent? Signature. Signature is, yeah. What do you mean by signature? It's another topological invariant with the paints of the other point kind of duality. So then when you combine the Then, when you combine the signature and the oulcarpets of a given manifold, we can obtain this expression here. And then we can obtain the Richie-Tofin-Aquai proof in 1974, which essentially uses that the Einstein condition, because if you have iron, the rich becomes proportional to the merge between this. And then we prove that the orator risk is bigger than equals to 3 half the norm of the signature. Have the norm of the signature. This is a topological structure. So I have a candidate to be isometric. If this inequality is not small, then I can give up. So, and the equality holds, if only if it's finitely covered by a total zero-catalyst surface. It's a question, is this condition, this inequality eight, is sufficient to prove that manifold designs then? But the answer is no. But the answer is no. The room proved that there are if you didn't many compact synchronic men could do not admit isometric, but satisfy the hitchetop inequality. For instance, the two examples that I mentioned here, the two examples of which is solitons, satisfy the hitchetop inequality, but not asymmetric, not neutral asymmetric. So for the reason, if you back to the combination between the only single combination between the Euler signature and the the the Euler characteristic and signature we can record this and then this guy becomes a target here and when you compute the integral of this guy you use the formulas involved which is so you can put this one and then we can obtain this expression. If a four-dimensional comparable soliton then this expression holds. In particular in a calic situation Particular in the calic situation when double plus square is equal to calico to square divided by 24, if you plug this here, you can conclude that this integral is non-negative. Then the heat top inequality holds for this guy on the Kell assumption. For the reason I don't conjecture in 2006 that the Hitchtop inequality holds for compact rich solids, which provides a topological structure for the existence. Topological structure for the existence of new examples. In the last years, there are some partial answers, but just few partial answers. There's not too much progress in this. It's very easy to understand the problem, but very few progress in this. So, and some partial answers were obtained by Fernando Pegasia Hill, Ima, the Japanese mathematician, Umari Tadan, and others. Than in others. Always assume some conditions involve the norm of the reaching curvature or the diameter of the map. Like this, I not put here because it would be obvious. So, but very recently, the Tanzu and Shu Shen and myself, we proved this partial answer to eigen conjecture by assuming that the range of the potential function is less than two log five. Is less than 2 log 5. This value log 5 is very specific because we are assuming the rich solitone is normalized, lambda is 1 half, and of course the dimension is 4. When you compare this additional log 5 with the example, we know that log 5 is approximately 1.6, and in the example, we know this range is 1.06. Another example is the same. Okay, we Okay, we believe that this is a technical assumption. We spent a long time trying to remove, but we are not able to do that. But we know that there's assumptions can be replaced by scalar curvature maximum minus scalar curvature minimum. It's the same thing folks. So, but we believe there's a sub that can be removed. And then this is the third problem that I like to leave here. Problem that I like to leave here today. Move the hitch-top inequality and also show that every callback with soil to most satisfy, there's inequality here. Okay, but the variety in the targets, we know. You mentioned four, I mentioned the last statement up for us. Sorry? Can you show the last slide for another second? Sorry, what is the f mid and the f max? Sorry? What are the f mid and the f max? Yeah. It's the maximum value of the potential function. Minimum value. So it's e to the minus f, but it's the weight. Okay. It's the function that pierces number that has to give it, though. Yeah, yeah. So is that going to be? Exactly the functions and the retaliate equation. Will you say something about the proof one minute? Yeah, half a minute, maybe later. I can do that, yeah, I can do that. The proof is inspiring some arguments of co-jummy quality digital recently in the paper candidate. Sorry, which inequality? Sorry? You said there are proofs inspired by some arguments. Some argument by co-gene inequality. Mini quality. Yeah. So, okay, but as I said, the violins is on the target. It's on the target. And it's natural to think about assumptions involving the value tensor. So, and the first assumption, natural assumption is to assume double is equals to zero. These are the targets. Okay, but combining the papers of name. Combining the pictures of Emmett, Lana, Montegazen, Iwalaki, Chad Mozall, Peterson, Biden, Tiano, Pierre, etc., we know that local conformally flat for dimensional gradient shrinking solved must be the finite coefficient of S4, R4 plus 3 cross R. The same result holds for high dimensions, okay? This one is because we are focused in dimension 4, but the same result holds for high dimension. But in the specific dimension 4, But in the specific dimension 4, this result was improved by assuming just that half-run form of the flat condition by Shen Wong. And they proved the same classification, but here included the CP2. So there are another assumptions considered in 2013, inspiring some arguments involved in the formal relativity. Relativity, and Adong Sao and Kin Shen assumed that the bar flat assumption, which means that this tensor here is the second deviance of the biotensor in a contract between the Vinci and the Viotensor, where in this guy, zero, we call Ba flat. And by assuming the Baffler condition, they prove the same classification result. Interesting is that the Baffler assumption is weaker than locally conformally flat, alpha-conformally flat. Flat, out-conformally flat, or locally conformed to a eye stand in dimension 4. These assumptions is very interesting in dimension 4 as well. So the same result holds for high dimension. Exactly the same, just change here the dimension. So, and there is another way to look at this: by assume a divergence of the violence of condition. Not that vanish condition divide, but consider by. Vibe that's considered by finite log that say U multiples and high dimension and bigger than this to four, but in dimension four, it comes like this. You have some condition, then has to be eigenstate or finite coefficient of this guy here. And now we have an example S2 plus R2, which not appear in the previous classification. So back for the classification here, I'll be S2 plus R. But I mean it's a trivial story, bro. Huh? Sorry? It's a trivial one, no? S2 plus 2? No? No. I show. In the next episode. Okay, so this result also holds for high dimensions, as I said, but in dimension 4, specific dimension 4, this result was improved by assumption. Among self-worth. Assume a more self-worth test condition by Pengu, Wu, and William Wine in 2018. And interesting is that it can also take the or if derivative of the violation, this was considered here by Latino, Mastrolia, and Monselli in twenty seventeen. We prove that if the if divergence of the violence is zero and another from point of view, this classification is exactly the same. Classification is exactly the same. It becomes weaker than the assumption. So, this example SQ plus R call more attention in the last years. It's essentially this guy here. I put the square root of 2 here in the hardest just because while looking for the normalization to lambda b comes one half, okay? Have, okay, just to this. So, with this, we take the product metric, it is the potential function. It's not trivial. And an interesting fact that I like to call attention is the eight values of the reach privatized, which becomes one half, one half, zero, zero. This information will be useful. Okay, there is another way to look for. There is another way to look for classifications involved in the vial, but instead assume some vanishing conditions in the vial, you may assume some control in the violence. In Giovanni Cacinio proved in 2016, I assume this control in a compact case, compact which is solid in dimension 4, I assume the integral of divided by squared is controlled by this another terms. Then I have Then I have this result must be the quotient of the sphere. It's like a sphere theorem proved by young Shang from Princeton to Eisenhower. If you're looking for the general case, when you say complete, I'm saying compact and non-compact, okay? And we're looking for the complete case, I assume the rich non-negative condition. Achin also proved that I assume this control on the value here. Control the value here, it's control in the norm of the value, then must it be R4, S3 cross R or S4 S2. So that first condition you could simplify it by using the order characteristic to eliminate at least one of those. Yeah, yeah, you can use it for what does it look like in terms of the order characteristic? I need to do the compation. Yeah, if you said. But yeah, if you said right away, of course it's possible. By using the Shen-Gausmunner formula, you can. Yeah. Okay. And this which non-negative condition was later removed by Beng Wu and Wai in 2018. There is possible to see that they removed this which non-negative information. So, and very recently, Zen also obtained a classification, assume a Classification. Assume a control on the value tensor, in dimension 4. This is specific here, but also assum that the width character is non-negative and bound. And prove that must be all flat. In flat case, it must be the Gaussian soliton or two positive OH cage. But I said that the eigenvalue of S2 cross R2 is 1 half, 1 half, 0, 0. Half zero zero, then it's not too positive because if you take a del S2, a values in sum must be zero. And it turns out that this species conditions 10 and 11 before do not recall S2 cross R2. And then one of the questions asked me about this kind of result by Adong is the possibility to prove result, classification result include S2 cross R2, not assume the reach boundary. Not assume the rich bound conditions, but only involve the self-law part of the virus tensor instead of the full value tensor here. Because dimension four, I can only look for appears. And then we did this in 2021. We proved that four-dimensional complete dragging through input is solid. By assume this control in the value, it's just the self-small part, then we More parts, then we obtain the classification include S2 cross R2. However, we, I don't know why, but we don't like this term here. This term is the Kukaine Mizu prod. For us, it's an ugly guy. And we try to remove this guy, but we were not able at that time. But let me say a few words about this field. The first thing is, now we're going to. The first thing is no witchy curvature boundaries are zone. The control is only in the self-dual part of the biotensor. And moreover, their quality here is exactly in S2 cross R2. And this term here, I have a power square and power 3. But I have a minus here. The natural term is positive. And in fact, it's 1 divided by 48. 48. It's funny. I suppose. Okay, but we try to improve this theme, involve the Kukahinimisu prods. If you apply directly the Koshishua's inequality, we obtain this guy here. It's quite of six, but it's not sharp. If you put this guy in the assumption, we lose S2 cross R2. It's why the reason that you keep Is why the reason that you keep the economy is a product there. Okay, but one more so we prove recently that we have another sau, now shadon sao. Before I don't saw, now shadong sao. In Brazil when you say sao, it's the same sao. Wang is the same one. They don't know the difference it's called. They don't know the difference, it's complicated, president, but it's why I put X Sal and H Sal. Okay, Shadon Sao and Hun Tran from Texas Tech, Shadon from Cornell. We improved some estimates in the proof by using some new arguments used by then in a paper with Figersky in the proof of Nishigawa conjecturally, and they were able to assume only this assumption. Assume only this assumption and obtain the four classifications, including as two classical items. Okay, it's very pretty simple. Okay, interesting is that the proof is essentially based on the idea of the second kind, the curvature of second kind. Also, by then, we have got the resolution of the projector of Michigan. And if you go back, And if you back the assumptions, look at that. I have a p square, 3, and the guy here. He's not wrong. Let's divide. If you do that, and you can do that, we only assume there's a condition. But the problem is we lose S3 cross R. Because S3 cross R is not Einstein, but it's half conformative one. If you want, you can do it, but we remove another number. So, okay. So, okay. But how about curvature estimate? It's another way to look for four-dimensional microphones. Okay. If you back to dimension two and dimension three in gradient-ranked sort, we will know that must be essentially S2, R2, S3, R3, S2, plus. as to most sequentially the curve has to be the negative in dimension two dimension in dimension three but into but in dimension four becomes different but there is this experiment by neighbor of 2010 it proved that you have a four-dimensional complete non-compact non-flat non-flat and put out the gaussian soliton we have curvature non-negative We have curvature non-negative inbound, and then SBS3 cross R plus 2 plus R. Okay, this is after that, 15 years later, oh sorry, five years later, Biden Mundano and Japan has great progress in this direction. Let's be so first that in dimensional two and dimensional three. In dimension 2 and dimension 3, we know the curvature is non-negative. However, in dimension 4, that is this example by Fieldman-Eulman in Art of 2003, that the curvature change of sign. Then we cannot say that the curvature is negative in dimension 4. This result not remains true. And moreover, in dimension 4, you know, for example, that the Wikipedia no longer preserves the... That the richer form no longer preserves the positive of rich curvature or sexual curvature in general. Then the behavior must be different. And then we don't know this cannot be proved, but what they say about the norm of the Renaissance church. And interesting is that Internet in Japan were able to Japan was able to prove that if you have small mediums for the scalar curvature is bound, then the curvature is also controlled by the scalar curvature. This result is interesting by many effects. But for example, if you assume that this calculator goes to zero in infinity, that implies that the curvature goes to infinity, goes to zero at infinity as well. And as a Montiano one proof, also, if the scalar curvature goes to zero, the scalar curvature decays quadratically. And consequently, the curvatures decay quadratic. And then must be asymptotically canonical. And then the problem of classification of four dimensional rich solitons becomes equivalent to study asymptotically canonical with solitons in machinery. And then you go into salt intunation. Okay, so but we know the current is not non-negative, but now I assume that this cut code is on us to be controlled. And there's assumptions very natural because if you're looking for the example that I mentioned here, they have scalar curvatures bound. In particular, most of them have a constant scalar curvature. A constant scalar curvature and few human human enough example has bounded scalar curvature as well. Excuse me, that C depends on what? Sorry? C depends on what? C only depends on this 8 E. Okay. The intimation for where the current is not longer facts that. Curve is not longer fixed as sign. They show that the control-13 still holds and the curve must be bound. So this result was very important as well in our recent classification obtained by Lee Wong, where they proved that in the Kell assumption, under the Kell condition, this Kelly capital is always bound. And this, combined with the result by Japino and Montenano, implies that the implies that the keratus is always bounded when you assume no assume the cavity reaches solid. Then what they did was they classify four-dimensional gradient care riches altogether in general. But non-caddy situations still work. Okay, if you looking for If you're looking for the new Salter equation, this term here, this equation is well known, knowing a Hemter equation. This is general true. And of course, this curvature becomes controlled by a potential function. And we know by the paper of Haidon Saoi Tan Tzu that the function is controlled by one quarter of the distance function squared. In other words, in general, the scale characteristic. In general, the scale character is controlled by the distance function squared. But we don't have an example with this behavior. Our example has bound the scale character, but we don't know, maybe. Yes. Okay. And then we can replace the assumption of scalar coverage bound by the assumptions that we know the scalar computer is always. Its character is always controlled by the potential control F with the number one, which applies here. If you assume that you have an epsilon less than one and your epsilon less than one, and you can also obtain the estimates of the meaning curvature with the payments of this semi-epson here. In particular, if epsilon is taken to be zero, because can be taken to be zero, take over the computer estimate obtained by. The current estimate obtained by Japan in Newton. Oh, Japan, Japan in Montenegro. Okay? He only assumed that this epsilon is less than equals to 1. We also believe that this assumptions can be removed. But here, we have a problem. This guy here, F squared, this is the problem. Let me explain why. As I said, this state. As I said, this standard result by Mutiano, but we believe this can be better. We believe this guy F squared can be removed. Because if you're looking for the flow, recently Ben Shao, this time here, very recently, Ben Shao, Friedman, Xi, and Zhang proved that they go up limits of finite times in light of the flow. Let's have this symbolic behavior here. We have to square the distance. Square the distance. If you back to our estimate, if you use the time zoo with high domain estimate of the potential to become faster. And we need to remove this square there, and you need to prove this base estimate. So as we have this argument involved before, okay, this will be a Okay, this will be a point-wise proof of this flow result. These are another questions. And finally, let me show the last question. This is the problem proposed by Haidong as well in 2019 about which sort of constant scalar curvature. We know there are many examples with constant scalar curvature. There are many examples with constant scalar curvature, and then it's natural to us about the neatness of this example. And I don't conjecture in 2019. I believe this problem was moving back then, but the first time that we mentioned in a conference was in 2019. So, but the problem is essentially proof that if you have a That if you have a rigid salt combination picker than equals to four, the constant scale curvature must be rigid, which means that must be approved, essentially approximate. So interesting is that intimation will fall, which follows by the paper of an antler of Garcia, with Pitts and why they did a very interesting contribution in this public here. Here, that if you look for dimension 4, if I assume this character of this constant, then the possibility must be 0, 1, 3, or 2. Just this possibility. And if this character is equal to 0 or 2, it's no must be iced. And if this character is 3 half, it must be the finite quotient of street crossing. But the question is still here is. But the question still here is calculus equals to one to remain case. And then we're looking for S2 cross R2. Remember, the eigenvalue is one half, one half, zero, zero. The rich character. Take the trace, square calculus equals to one. Then the spectral case here is S2 cross R2. Exactly what the time that Fushenko recently, in the case of dimension 4, the scale of equals 2, must be exactly as 2 costs. Must be exactly S2 cos R2. And this proves the Saus conjecture mid-dimensional medium transformation. However, the problem is still open quite dimensionally, bigger than the stream. And this is the last problem that I like to leave here today. Thank you. Are there any questions?
