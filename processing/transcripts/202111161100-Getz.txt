Thank you for the introduction, and thanks very much for the invitation to speak. It's a pleasure to have gotten to know Bill in the past few years and also to be influenced by his work and his clandestine lecture notes and his editorial work. So, we owe him a lot, and I wish him many happy returns. Wish him many happy returns. So, I was asked to talk about the relationship between Beyond Endoscopy and the Braberman-Kajdan proposal. And so, this is what I came up with along those lines. So, I'm going to start with that. So, beyond endoscopy, and I'll call it PS. So, there's enough names now that are attached to this Bergman-Kajnan program that I like to think of it as just a Poisson summation conjecture. It is just a Poisson summation conjecture. So, F is for me a number field, G is a reductive F group. And I'm going to give myself, and you might as well take it split for this talk. I mean, I won't be working in that much detail. So I'll give myself some representation of its L group. And let me just rapidly remind you. Remind you of Langland's Beyond Endoscopy proposal. And I'm going to incorporate some simplifications that are basically ideas due to SARNAC. So for F, some compactly supported smooth function on the idelic points of my group, I want to study the sum over pi of the residue. Of the residue at s equals one of L S pi r times trace of pi f. So let me just call this star. And here I'm just going to sum over the cusp forms. Okay, so why would we want to do this? I mean, this has sort of already played a role in A role in Dependra's talk, sort of implicitly. You might want to isolate certain representations of GAF that are lifts from particular groups. So let me make that precise. I mean, maybe a little bit more precise. It's still a little bit vague. So the idea is that poles of this thing, poles correspond to parameters. From the hypothetical global Langlands group to some group, which may not be an L group, but it will be close to an L group, where H hat fixes a vector in the representation space VR. Okay so um what is that first symbol before H hat? Before H hat is that is that the V group this thing this is supposed to be a Language Language hypothetical group. It's the mythical V the mythical group. Yes. So what you think about H hat as being as being essentially the algebraic envelope of this parameter and then it's not quite L group of some group but you L group of some group, but you know, it's close enough. And what you'd like to be able to say is that H hat is morally the L group of some H. And then you'd want to try and compare star with corresponding. Sum over automorphic representations on H. And of course, this is I mean, this is too simplistic because you want, I mean, these things are going to, you're going to have to sum over a family of H's, but let's just take this as a sort of a touchstone or some vague idea. Sort of a touchstone or some vague idea of what we want to do. Okay, so then the next piece is the Poisson summation conjecture. Okay, so I got a message. Am I supposed to stop talking because of this live stream is not working? Or should I keep going? That's just for people who might be interested. I think you are meant to continue. Okay. You are meant to continue. Okay, all right. And you can keep going. Anyway, we will upload this information after. All right. So, the Poisson summation conjecture, I mean, I started calling it Poisson summation conjecture because there are too many names. So, Braberman Kajdan originally wrote this down. Go put it in a different framework in terms of the trace formula, the related ideas of Laurent LaFourgue. Of Laurent LaFourgue, and there's a nice extension of these ideas to spherical varieties that was suggested by Sakhalarides. Okay, so these are the names that are attached to it. So I'm going to refer to what I'm about to talk to as the Poisson summation conjecture. Although I'm not going to be talking so much about spherical varieties, they will play a role later. So 2R, we can associate a reductive monoid MR. And this played a role in Jillen's talk, and it'll also continue to play a role in several other talks. I think also Cho will talk about this. And this thing will have the property that its unit group is just G. And then there should exist some short space, MRA. MRAF, which is supposed to be a restricted direct product of SMFV, which is contained in smooth functions on the group. So it's important to note that these short spaces are not going to have functions that extend to the whole monoid in general. There should be a Fourier transform and a Fourier transform. Fourier transform F from the Schwartz space to itself. And I guess Cho might be suggesting a formula for this in his talks, but that's exciting, at least in some cases. And such that the following hold. First, there should be a Poisson summation formula. So the sum over points in Gf of F. Points in Gf of F gamma plus some boundary terms is equal to the sum over gamma and g of f of some Fourier transform of gamma plus some boundary terms. The Fourier transform, let's call this one, the Fourier transform should be twisted equivariant. Oh, let me pull it up here. Let me pull it up here. Twisted equivariant under the action of GAF. What does twisted equivariant mean? So what I'm saying is that in the case of, say, I mean, I'm only going to be really worried about the case where I look at the DLN. So what you want is you want that the Fourier transform instead of being equivariant, it sends the usual action. It sends the usual action to G inverse transfer. So that twisted equivariance is supposed to powers the problem. And for F equals F S B away from S in the short space, where this is some basic function. The function has to be a basic function outside of finally many places. Pi of F S B S is pi S F S L Pi S R times just the pi 1 B O half. All right, so here, I mean, I'm not going to be specific about what normalization of the L factor I'm supposed to be. Of the L factor, I'm supposed to be looking at here. So it's supposed to give you the L functions. All right. So if this is true, then Gaudemont and Jaquet, their argument, which, I mean, in this sense, this argument goes back, I mean, the same argument that's used to prove the functional equation of Tate. We can follow their argument to prove functional equation. functional equation of L S I R and if we vary R and apply converse theory you obtain much of language functions All right, so what's Cho's idea? So, Cho's idea is to integrate this Poisson summation conjecture to study beyond Endiscott. All right, so what does this mean precisely? So, if I take f to be a Schwartz function and And f equals fs basic function away from s, then sum over gamma and g of f of f g1 inverse gamma g2. Well, at least formally, let me assume that this thing has cuspital image or whatever you'd like. Then this is kÏ€ F S times you know the unit element outside of S. You know, the unit element outside of S of G1, G2. All right. So if you integrate this over the diagonal and take a residue, you obtain the star. Star. Okay, where star is the expression that I wrote at the beginning. I shouldn't move this around too much because it gets annoying, but star is this expression here. It's the, sorry, that's not it. Star is this expression here. It's the sum over residues. So the idea is if you integrate over the diagonal and you take a residue, then you're supposed to get this. You're supposed to get this sum of residues that Langlands suggests studying in the beyond endoscopy proposal. But in order for this to make any sense and to be of use to study the beyond endoscopy proposal, you need some sort of geometric interpretation of the residues. In effect, you're proposing to But in effect, you're proposing to apply non-compactly supported functions on on an automorphic form. Is that correct? Yeah, I mean, they're almost compactly supported if you'd like. They don't look almost compactly supported to me. Why do you say that? So in the sense that if you restrict to any, say, determinant equals, let's look on GLN. If you restrict to determinant equals something or in some range. Yeah, then it's certainly okay. Yeah, right. Yeah, then it's certainly okay. Yeah. So, what this is, is this in what's going to happen with this expression is that it's only going to convert in some plane, right? The whole idea is you have to shift and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right. So, I mean, I'm just sort of right. This is just the vague idea. I'm not the things that actually cause it to mess up at this point. Okay. Okay. So, I mean, what this suggests is that we should try to be looking for some geometric interpretation of the resonance. And the vague idea is that these should correspond to boundary terms. So, all right, so what I mean by this is I'm going to be just sort of Ad hoc about this at the moment. In our summation formula, we have sum over gamma and g of f plus star, right? And by boundary terms, I mean the star. So as an example, if we look at the monoid for the standard representation, mapping to GLN, then the monoid is just n by n matrices, and then the boundary terms. And then the boundary terms are M n by N minus G L M. It's just everything that's not invertible, right? But I'd like to point out that in the general case, when M n cross N is non-smooth, the boundary The boundary terms are not just sums over M, well, the monoid minus the open orbit G. And I can give some examples, and I will in this talk to illustrate this case. So this is not the whole story. All right, so now I want to focus on a particular case where I can actually say something. So, this is the Rankin-Silberg model. All right, so I'm just going to focus on the simplest, well, one of the simplest cases. So, I'm looking at Simplest cases. So I'm looking at gr being a set of G1 and G2 and GL2 squared of R. Sorry, I should make this such that the determinant of G1 is equal to the determinant of G2. And I'm going to take my representation to be the tensor product. And of course, you can generalize this. And of course, you can generalize this to all pairs of. I mean, for this talk, let's just focus on the case we're talking about: pairs of GLM cross GLN where the determinants are equal. So in this case, the monoid is really easy to write down. And I'm going to write it for reasons that will be apparent later as D4. So this is MR of R, and this is just the set of X1 and X2. X2 in GL2R. So this, I just mean the Lie algebra here. I mean two by two matrices. Maybe this is bad notation, but such that the determinants are equal. So just pairs of two by two matrices where the determinant is equal. And so I want to refer to this as a Rankin-Selberg model. Okay, so one thing to observe, and this is special. One thing to observe, and this is special to the case at hand, is that this is the zero locus of a quadratic form, right? So I want to put this in a tower of quadratic forms. So how do I do that? I'll take V4 to be GL2 two copies, V3 to be GL2 direct sum. Direct sum all of the anti-diagonal matrices, which I'm thinking about as living inside GL2 squared. V2 is GL2 direct sum zero, and V1 is diagonal matrices in GL2 direct sum zero. So all these things are subspaces of V4, and for each of them, I have the determinant. As a quadratic form. All right. So now let me take XI to be the zero locus of the determinant restricted to VI. Okay. So in this setting, So, in this setting, we have a notion of short spaces, and this is very closely related to something that, I mean, there's a couple different ways you can define it. Maybe one nice way to define it is to use something that's related to what Gurevich and Kazdan recently wrote down. But let me take this as my definition. So, what's my short space? Short space is I take S of VIAF, and I take the dual of the standard representation, and I take co-invariance under SL2AF, where I let on this factor I'm acting via the V representation. Okay. Okay, so this may have seemed like an odd way to define the short space, but it turns out to be very convenient. Okay, so now I'm going to define my Fourier transform as follows. I want to send F1 tensor F2 to F2 to F1 tensor F2. Sorry. Where I take this to be the Fourier transform that is the SL2 equivariant Fourier transform on a two-dimensional space. Okay. And this descends to the coinvariant, so this is well defined. And I want a relationship between these two, these all of these short spaces and All of these short spaces, and this is given by XIAF maps to SXIAF. I send F to, I'm going to be a bit vague about this, but I'll give you the idea. So I take the last two rows of my function and set them to equal to zero, and then I take a certain Fourier transform. And then I take a certain Fourier transform in this variable here. I take essentially the last coefficient, and I take a Fourier transform in that. And I'll need two other things. The first one you can, I'll write down to make it explicit, but you can sort of ignore it. Well, maybe I won't write down the, maybe I won't write down the definition of this. For Z in C, I need certain functional. A certain functional sorry And I need let me be explicit about this I need a way of getting functions actually on the physical spaces so this is as follows And how do I do this? I take F1 tensor F2. This factors through the SL2 co-invariance. I map it to the function that sends C to integral over N to AF mod SL2 AF. I just integrate over the actions. That's all this is. I have to choose a base point to make this sense out of this. All right, and here the row denotes the Bay representation, rho equals Bay. Okay. All right. So then here's the theorem. And I apologize for the notation and also for my horrible handwriting, but you know. The theorem is which, so I obtained this sort of to answer some questions that came up in joint work with David Kajdan, but sort of we never wrote up the full version of this because there's some issues with lower rank quadratic spaces, but anyway, so if I give myself some Anyway, so if I give myself some Schwartz function in this Schwartz space, so remember x4 here is determinant equals determinant. So gl2 cross GL2 determinant equals determinant. And if I assume that D4 following D3 of F is equal to D4 following D3 of Fourier transform. Of Fourier transform with respect to x4 of f equals zero, so it doesn't have terms there to degenerate. Then I have a Fourier transform with boundary terms. So f negative 2 plus c d4 f negative 1 plus the sum over x c in x 4 of f of i of I F C plus the sum over C and X three zero of I F sorry I of df is equal to this sorry the same thing. Same thing only with the Fourier transform added to the colour of the colour. I should just say that this expression is invariant under the Fourier transform, and I'd have to write less. Okay. All right. So let me move this up a little bit. So the point of this is that there's Of this is that there's this is a Fourier setting where you have a Poisson summation formula with boundary terms, and the boundary terms correspond to quadratic forms that are slightly smaller. And you could continue. I mean, this really has nothing to do with the case at hand. I mean, you could make something like this work for any quadratic space of even dimension. There's some problems with the lower dimension quadratic spaces, but they can put Quadratic spaces, but they can probably be handled. Right? So, what does this get you? Well, this gets you a geometric interpretation of the residues in the case at hand. So, as a corollary of this, under the assumptions above, move it up. If you If you, if R of F has cuspidal image, then the sum over pi of residue at S equals one of L S S pi R So, this thing that we might want to study is equal to some constant. It's just a volume of the depends on how you normalize your measure on AF plus the sum over C and X. Over C and X three circ of F I D four F X four F evaluated at C right so apart from the case of matrices I think this is the first example well I this is the first example I know of where somebody's worked out you know what these Where somebody's worked out, you know, what these boundary terms actually look like. Okay, so I'll pause at this point, ask if there are questions on this. So the nice thing about this is that this is a geometric expansion for the sum over residues. So this, I mean, we get a sum over some space that has geometric meaning. Actually, early. Meaning. Actually, earlier I proved something like this. There's a paper in AGM where I proved something like this using the circle method of all things. But the expression that I got was a difference between two sums, and it wasn't clear how to make sense out of it geometrically. It's not clear to me how R occurs here. What is special? What's R? I mean, I know what R is, but what's special about it? R is, but what's special about it? How does it occur in the discussion? I don't know which R we're talking about. Representation, I guess. Oh, the Rankin-Stollberg? Yeah, yes. Is that right, Bell? I have a little R and I have the rest of the discussion, but I don't understand where little R is introduced. So little R. Okay, so maybe the best way to think about that is. Way to think about that is if you go back up to this definition of the short space and you compute this i. So there's a I mean there's a natural notion of the basic function then you just take the image of the you take the image of the obvious basic function upstairs. What's far though? So just just wait. So then if you take the image of that and you take it You take it and integrate it against an unramified representation, and you get exactly the basic function for R. What's R? R is the, okay. R is the tensor product. R is an arbitrary finite? No, no, it's something. No, it's the tensor product. Oh, it's this. Oh, I see. I see. Right. Yeah. Oh, it's very it's very special. Oh, it's very special. It's very special. Okay. But despite that. Does this work for n by n matrices? So I want to say something about that at the very end. Okay. This method will not, but I think there's hope to fixing to getting something that works. What does it say about GL2 and arbitrary art? Oh, it just says nothing. But I have one. But I have one more trick, which is that I want to say why, even though we know everything we want to know about this L function, this additional information still gives you something non-trivial. So that's the last bit. So the last bit is where this non-abelian nonsense comes in. So very bizarre. Non-abelian trace formula. All right, so let's assume that we start with this field F. I'm going to say that, let's say that it lives over a subfield K, and I want this to be a Galois extension generated by two elements, tau and sigma. All right, so this is, if you haven't seen this. So, this is, if you haven't seen this before, there's this remarkable fact that any non-abelian simple group can be generated by two elements. So, this is a quite general situation. So, we could, e.g., any non-abelian simple group, right? So, then the pi on my group GAF. AF inside GL2 squared AF that appear above are of the form pi isomorphic to pi knot, it's the pi knot wedge restricted to my group GAF for some pi knot on PI not on GL2AF. And I mean, the restriction could be, what I should say is that they're a constituent of this. And then my sum looks like the sum over pi naught of the residue at S equals 1 L S S pi naught tensor pi naught wedge, K pi, G one, G two, G three, G four. So we have four variables that we can integrate over here. Four variables that we can integrate over here. What we have is we have a sum. This thing is equal to some term that corresponds to the zeta plus the sum of I D4 F X4. And let me just write it as G one inverse G two applied to F G three G four of C. Of C right, and then the sum is over X C in X three circuit of F all right and the observation is that you can integrate sorry can integrate over a pair of twisted diagonals. And this gives you a geometric expression for cuspital automorphic representations of GL two AF. That are sigma and tau, well, they're fixed under this group sigma and tau. Right? So unfortunately, I'm happy for this invitation to this conference because it got me thinking, especially with my, I was, I had a request, like I said, that I was. I had a request, like I said, that I was supposed to talk about the relationship between beyond endoscopy and the Raymond Kajan proposal. So I'm happy that it forced me to think about this, but I haven't written down what the precise definition is. And my hope is, so He Kang and I have a student from Korea coming over to visit who Kai Kang. And I'm hoping to get him to help me. Get him to help me compute these geometric expressions that are happening in this integral. But it's quite interesting because it is a geometric expression. And the hope, which is sort of, I mean, there may be some problem that comes up is that we can relate to a corresponding Expression over K, the smaller field, and study non-soluble waste change. But even if you can't sort of establish some comparison, I mean, you could at least do softer things like study or study the number. Or study the number of representations that are fixed under the Galois group of F over K. And I don't think even, except in the case of, say, holomorphic forms, I don't think there's a good understanding of, I mean, we know what the answer should be, right? It should be essentially the things that come from the smaller field. It's not quite true. There's some not everything that's invariant should be a lift. Everything that's invariant should be a lift. And I worked that out pretty carefully in an old paper in the Journal of the Hermonogen Society. But despite that, I mean, it's essentially true and it's essentially expected. And then you could try to establish that we have the right number by taking an appropriate limit. So the point of this, I guess, is that even when we know When we know, I have a question. You're using two generators of a simple group, but is that? I mean, can't you write down an expression by taking averaging over the group? What's so special about the fact that you have two generators in whatever you're doing? Because we need to have... So, the whole point of this is that there's two diagonals that we can integrate over. And you need to use both the diagonals and integrate over them to isolate things that are. You're trying to build a twisted trace formula of two twists. Okay. And so that's why you need the, yeah. And, you know, I had things like this before, but the expressions that I was able to obtain, they seemed, they didn't seem geometric enough to be able to finish the dot. To be able to finish the job, I mean, I mean, do you see there are many pairs of generators? In fact, there's a very nice problem about the action of the outer automorphism group. I haven't studied the free group on pairs of generators, as you know. That's one of my favorite topics. So that should be. I haven't studied at all what these things look like. So what's going to end up happening? This looks brutal. It looks brutal when you just choose sigma and tau. When you just choose sigma and tau, yeah, yeah. I mean, the only thing is that there's something that can be computed, okay, and that's the nice thing is that there's something, there's maybe a step more that one can take. And then maybe, okay, so that's that's 45. So the, um, I'd like to, so you had an earlier question about GLN cross n. And so I'd like, maybe I can finish with that. That so okay. So, the point was that even when we know the L functions, we can obtain potentially transformative new information. All right, so then let's talk about the case of M cross N. So for a long time, I thought the case of M cross N here was just completely hopeless. But, you know, so there's two points to point out. First, Wen Wei Li back in Singapore, this is the first time I heard somebody suggest this. Wen Wei Li suggested studying. Suggested studying instead of the spaces that come up in Braverman Kazdan, studying the space that's formed by taking SLM plus N and modding out by the unipotent radical of the Borel of type MN. And he said, well, why don't we try to do this? And then because we sort of know the spectral theory via language he. Theory would be a language Shahidi. And Fredeman asked him, Well, what's the application? And there, I mean, he said, Well, I mean, it would just be nice to sort of see how things fit together. But I think this gives a fairly convincing application for why one might want to try to look at this case, because it's very similar to what Raberman and Kazdan study. And we know the spectral theory already. So, if any of this is going to work, we should be able to. Any of this is going to work, we should be able to devise some sort of geometric theory. And another thing, this is almost what we need for the general case that Peter asked about with the n cross n. The correct thing for that is rather than just this quotient to study SLN plus n mod up mn. Maybe you take the affine closure of this and then you take the GI. And you take the GIT quotient by the opposite parabolic. And Jonathan Wang studied this in an old paper. It's not that old, but one of his earlier papers. And this was probably known before, but he studied and discussed how this is the Rankin-Selberg monoid for GLM cross GLN. So I think this is a case that, I mean, it seems I mean, it seems to me to be more accessible than the general theory. We at least have a spectral definition that we know works. And with, you know, in view of this non-abelian base change stuff, there is sort of, you know, a reason, apart from academic interest, to try to work out what would happen in this case, and specifically to work out what the boundary terms look like in this study.
