Online conference. Okay, so today we will talk about the Jaiski dense orbit conjecture. Here is the plan of our talk. We will first introduce the Jaiski-dense orbit conjecture. Then we introduce a new topology and we call it the idyllic topology. It is the idyllic topology. Using this topology, we propose an idyllic version of the Jaiski dense orbit conjecture, and we call it AZDC for short. And this version implies the original version. Then we give some historical notes and present our results. Present our results. Next, we will give a first application of the idyllic approach: AZDC hence Z D C for split polynomial endomorphisms. And then we prove AZ DC hence Z D C for endomorphisms on projective surfaces. And in the end, we will give some further problems. Okay, now we began to introduce the Zaiski-dense orbit conjecture. Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic z. Let X be an irreducible projective variety of K, and F a dominant rational self-map on X. x we denote by kxf the field of f invariant rational functions the jaiski-dense orbit conjecture zdc was proposed uh by midweder for scannon uh by americ bogomonov khominsky and uh also by zhang in the polarized case In the polarized case, this conjecture says that if there is no non-constant F invariant function, rational functions, then there is a point in XK whose F orbit is well defined and is staristic dense in X. So I think this conjecture is quite natural because while we have one dynamical system, maybe the first question is to ask whether this dynamical system is sensitive. And this conjecture is something to say that the whether algebraic dynamical system is Break a dynamical system is transitive on its key points. And the assumption that there is no non-constant rational function is necessary. Otherwise, every orbit will contain it in some fiber of this non-constant rational function. Okay, this conjecture is mainly interesting when k is countable. For example, k equal to q bar. Because the main difficulty in this case is that when k is countable, then xk is covered by a countable. K is covered by a countable union of proper sub-varieties. So, for me, one of the most important case is for endomorphisms on the projective spaces. Okay, so we note that there is We note that there is a phenomenon. So in this conjecture, we only ask for one Jai-sky dense orbit. But a phenomenon is that if we have one Jaiski-dense orbit, we expect that the orbit of almost all points in XK is. point in XK is Zariski dense. So one may ask what does almost all mean? Usually in algebraic geometry we have two notions to speak of almost all points. One is general and another is very general. We say that some properties We say that some property holds for a general point, means that this property holds in some non-empty open subset. And we say that some property holds for very general points, means that this property holds for all points except countable unit. Countable union of proper sub-varieties. But these two notions cannot be used for this problem. For example, if f is an endomorphism of q1 of degree at least 2, then the set of periodic points of f is storage dense in q1. Dense in Hiwan. So the notion of general is too weak for our problem. And when K is countable, which is the most interesting case, there is no very general point in XK. So we need a new notion to get To get this new notion, we need a new topology on XK such that this topology is stronger than the Jaisky topology, and XK is irreducible in this topology. Okay, so now we will introduce this new topology and New topology, and we will call it the idyllic topology. Here we assume that the transcendental degree of K over q bar is finite. Let x be a not necessarily irreducible variety of k. Okay, we will introduce the idyllic topology on x k. XK. Okay, to define this topology, we first pick a subfield KZO of K such that KZO is finitely generated over Q. Its algebraically closure is K and X is defined over KZ, which means that there is a variety. which means that there is a variety x kz defined over k zero such that x is the base change of x k zero by k we first pick such a subfield but in the end we will show that the definition of the idyllic topology does not depend on the choice of this kz Okay, so now let k be any finite extension of kz and we denote by xk the base change of xkz by k. We denote by ik the set of field and bendings tau from k to c p tau where p tau C p tau, where p tau is a prime or infinite. Here we denote by c infinite to be the view of complex numbers. For every tau in ik, we denote by i tau the set of field and bendings, tau bar from k bar to From K bar to C p tau, whose restriction on K is just the given ambanding top. So it's just all possible extensions of the given ambanding top to its algebraically closure. For every tall bar in ITO, we have Tau. We have a natural unbanding. Phi tau bar sends the k point of x to x kcp tau. On x kcp tau we have the p-tau etic topology. So when p tau is infinite, this topology is just the usual oxygenidian topology. Okay, so for every tau in IK and U is a p tau etic open subset in X C P tau. One P tau is infinite, it's just some complex or open subset. We denote by X K tau U. x k tau u to be the union of all tau bar in i tau the preimage of u by phi tau bar this is a subset of x k and we call it the idyllic subset associated to u and tau it uh uh it it seems a bit uh complicated but um uh but indeed it's not so uh indeed it's it's simple in fact it's uh all the points uh in xk such that you have some extension of top which is sends this point to the given open set. Open set. We define a basic idyllic subset over K to be x k tau i u i from i to m, which is a finite intersection of some x k tau i u i. UI and we define a basic idyllic subset to be basic idyllic subset over some finite extension of KZO. So using this, we can define the idyllic topology. The idyllic open subset are the The union of basic idyllic subsets. They form the idyllic topology, and the basic idyllic subsets forms a base of this topology. And this topology does not depend on the choice of KZ. Now, I want to explain why we consider this subset X K tau U. So let S be an algebraic structure on X. For example, a rational self-map, which is divided over K, and let P be an algebraic property. An algebraic property for points of X, which depends on S. For example, the property for a point X can be the z closure of the orbit of X is irreducible. So this statement is purely algebraic. And we say that if P is satisfied for all Is satisfied for all points in the p-tau or complex open subset U of X C P tau because P is purely algebraic. So it does not depend on which you use to send this point to X C P top. So So key is satisfied for all points in the idyllic open subset. Okay. So here is some basic properties of the idyllic topology. First, it is stronger. First, it is stronger than the Jaisky topology. Two, it is T1, which means that for every distinct point XY in XK, there is an idyllic open subset U of XK such that X is contained in U but Y is not in U. Shay, morphisms between algebraic varieties over K are continuous. Varieties over k are continuous for the idyllic topology and a tomorrows are open. And fine, let K be any subfield of K which is finitely generated over Q such that X is divided over K and K bar equal to K. Then the action of the absolute Galois group. root Galois group of K on XK is continuous. And six, the irreducible components of XK in the Jaisky topology are exactly the irreducible components of XK in the idyllic topology. So we see that all these properties That all these properties are satisfied for Jaisky topology. So we can think that the Adyalic topology is something very similar to the Jaiski topology, but it is stronger. And I think the first five properties are not difficult from the definition. And the most For me, the most important property is the last one, and we will use it many times in this talk. Okay, so when X is irreducible, the last property just says that the intersection of finitely many non- Of finitely many non-empty ideal open subsets of X is still non-empty. When the dimension of X is at least one, then the idyllic topology is not host off and it is strictly stronger than the Jariski topology. Than the Jariski topology. Here is an example. Let K to be Q bar and X to be A1. We denote by tau the unique embedding from Q to C. We denote by U1 the open unidisc and U2. Unidisc and U2 the set of X in C with norm at the strictly larger than one. Then we can show that one over two, one over three, blah blah, this set is contented in the idyllic subset associated to U1, but To U1, but not associated to U2. And 2, 3, 4, blah, blah, each set is contained in the idyllic subset associated to U2, but not the one associated to U1. And the set of N plus minus the square root of minus the square root of n square minus one for n at least two. This is an infinite set and it is contended in the intersection of the idyllic subset associated to U1 and to U2. So we see that even when here the Here, the intersection of U1 and U2 is empty, but the intersection of A1 tau U1 and A1 tau U2 is not empty. There's a question whether the idyllic topology is not Eryan? No, I don't think it's North Erie because because uh because you you see that uh uh for example a1 call u1 this is uh idelic open subset so uh its uh complement is uh uh is what can we say is I think it's not uh Northern because uh Nordarian because you can take a sequence of open subsets, something like U1 contained strictly contained in U2 and strictly contained in U3 and so on. You take the unit disk larger and larger. Then you consider A1 and tau UI. Then you get a strict increasing open subset. Open subset. Open subsets. So this is not a node area. It's okay? Yeah, I guess so. Thank you. So we cre uh we Also, we get the third notion to speak of almost all points in XK using this idyllic proposition. Assume that X is irreducible, we say that the property P holds for an idyllic general point if there is a non-empty idyllic open subset U of X K such that Such that P holds for all points in U. So this definition is very similar to the definition, to the notion of general. To define general, we use a Jaisky topology, and to define Adaelic general, we use Adaelic topology. Using this topology, we Using this topology, we propose the idyllic Jai-Ski dense orbit conjecture, AZDC for short. Assume that the transcendental degree of K is finite, then if Kxf equals K, then for an identic general point X in XK, its orbit. Xk, its orbit is well defined and the expeditions in X. We see that this conjecture is stable on the birational conjugacy, which means that if AZ DC holds for a pair XF, then for any birational model of XF, Uh therefore uh the conjecture still holds. AZDC is stronger than Z D C, the original version of the Jai-Sky densorbit. Maybe you see that there is an assumption on the transcendental degree. Transcendental degrade in AZDC, but this does not cause a problem because you can always pick a subfield, capital K in K, which is algebraically closed and whose transcendental degree is finite, such that the X K is defined over this field. So A and D C should if A and D C If AZ DC holds for X K F K, then it's not difficult to show that Z D C holds for X F. Okay, now we give some historical notes. First, America and Campana, they proved that DC1K is uncomfortable. Is uncomfortable. Medewidoff and Scannon, they proved ZDC for split polynomial endomorphism, which are the endomorphisms f from a n to a n taking from f1 x1 to fn xn where fi is one variable polynomial. Polynomials. I proved that DC for endomortisons are very true. Giotta and Scannon, they proved that DC for endomorphism of Albanian varieties. There are also many works on this conjecture. On this conjecture, for example, the work of Hu Satyano Taka. Okay, so now we present our results. The first result is proved by myself in the smooth case and with Jia. Jia and Zhang. So we prove H and D C for endomorphisms of projective surfaces. And with Tarker, we proved AZ DC for split endomorphisms, which are the endomorphism from P1N. From P1N to P1N. And we also proved, I also proved the AZDC for endomortison of albania variety. The last two results generate and yards new proofs of the result of Medelido for scanner and Gyoka scanner. In Medewida, Scanner. In Medewedoff scanner, they proved the Z DC for split polynomial endomorphisms. And in Georgia scanner, they proved the Z DC for abelian variety. Okay, now we want to give a first application of the ideal topology. We give a new proof of the theorem of Of the theorem of Meta-Wedoff and Scannon. We recall that their result is that DC holds for split polynomial and modifications. In their original proof, they used a very deep result in model theory and polynomial decomposition theory. And here we give a quick proof using the idyllic topology. Indeed, we prove it's idyllic version. So we prove AZDC for split polynomial and morphisms. So it implies Z D C our idea is very simple. So If properties Pi are i equal to 1 to m holds for idyllic general point, then for idyllic general point, all these properties together holds. So this gives us a way to split a problem into problems that are easier to tackle. are easier to tackle. So now here is the sketch of the proof. For the simplicity we assume that the degree of Fi are at least two and k is just a q bar. Using the following claim we we conclude the proof by induction. Conclude the proof by induction. The claim is the following: if Az D C holds for Yg and for Kg and H is dominant endomorphism of P1, which has a super attracting fixed point. Then, AZDC holds for the pair XF, where X is the product of X is the product of Y and P1 and F is the product of G and H. So for a split polynomial endomorphisms, each factor is a polynomial, so we can view it as an endomorphism of P1 because the degree is at the least 2. So you have an super attracting fixed polynomial. Super attracting a fixed point at the infinity. So you can induction by the factors. So we only need to prove this claim. Okay, now we prove this claim denoted by pi 1 from x to y the first projection and pi 2 from x to p 1 the second projection. The second projection. By our assumption, there is a non-empty idyllic open subset A in Y such that for every point Y in A, the orbit of Y is well defined and Jaiskidens in Y. And there is a number of k such that everything are defined. Are defined over K. Okay. We only need to construct three non-empty ideal open subsets, A1, A2, A3 in XK, such that after replacing f by its iterate for every X in A1, x in A1 Z G pi 1 x which is the Zariski closure of the orbit of pi 1 x this one equal to 1 and for every x in A2 the Z culture of X is irreducible and for every X in A3 Z Z G pi one tenth O is contained in Z F X. Why? Indeed, for every point X in the intersection A1 intersect A2 intersect A3 and intersect X minus Y tens Z. Y tens zero and the zice closure of the orbit of X is X. So here this set is idelic open because A1, A2, A3. Because A1, A2, A3 are idyllic open. And X minus Y times O1 is Jaiski open subset. So it is idyllic open. And all these sets are long empty. So the intersection is still long empty. And because X is contained in A1, so we know that Z G pi 1 X pi 1 x equal to y. So because x is contained in a3 we know that this one z g pi 1 x equal to y so y times all is contained in z f x and because x is contained in a2 so this z f x is irreducible. Is irreducible. So ZFX is an irreducible subset in X which contains a divisor, but it also contains the point X. And we know that X is not contained in this divisor. So Divisor. So an irreducible sub-variety which contains a divisor and a point outside this divisor can only be the whole space. Okay. So okay. So it's change. Okay. So now we only need to now we only need to construct this set. Factor these sets A1, A2, and A3. So we only need to construct A1, A2, and A3. And A1 is easy. You only need to define it to be the pullback of A by pi 1. And for the construction of A2 and A2, Construction of A2 and A3, we need the following lemma. This lemma is quite standard in arithmetic dynamics, and some version of it appeared already in the work of America Bella, Gyoka Taka, and Pulan. It says that Uh, it says that there exists some m at least one, a prime key at least three, an unbending tau from k to cp, and a non-m key open subset V in Y Cp which is invariant by Gm and there is an analytic action phi of the analytic. Of the analytic additional group of CPO on V, such that for every positive integer n, phi n point equal to gm n, the restriction of gm n on V. Okay, this statement just says that Just says that on this non-empty open subset, you can think the tense of iteration as a variable, as a periodic variable. So in particular, this implies that the restriction of TM or PN only tends to identity. tends to identity because in theoretical topology Pn tends to zero so M on P n tends to zero so G zero is identity so and for every point Y in V the Jaisgi closure of the orbit of Y by G m is irreducible. Irreducible, okay. So, what's wrong with the prime two? I think for the prime two, it's uh um I think for prime two is okay also. So, in fact, if you So in fact if you pick uh uh prime um uh P at the least trade the proof is uh slightly uh easier. So so I write uh string. Yes. Okay, thanks okay. So Okay, so uh I I don't know what's the uh problem of this. Maybe I should now we apply this lemma for the pair YG and apply. And apply replacing G by some iterate. The line marks say that the restriction of GP on the open subset V tends to identity. Now apply. Now, apply this lemma for the pair xf and replace f by some iterate. There is a prime there is a prime key prime at the list three and I'm banding. And I'm bending top prime from K to C P top from K to C P prime and known M here open subset V prime in X C T prime such that for every X in V prime the seismic curlure of the orbit of X is irreducible. Then we simply take A2 to be the idyllic To be the idyllic subset associated to the restriction of tau prime on k and v prime. And for every x in A2, ZFX is irreducible. And since H is super attracting at the point O, there is O, there is a periodic open neighborhood U in P1 CP of O such that the restriction of H on U tends the iterator of it tends to the constant map sending everything to the point O. So there is L Dere is L at least for every L at least zero and X in W. and X in W. W is defined to be the intersection of the prime one minus one U and pi two minus one V. We can see that the F L plus P n X equal to G L plus P n pi one x. Pn pi 1x and h l plus pn pi 2x. For the second factor, because h is super attracting, so if n tends to infinite, then this factor tends to o and for the first factor one n tends to infinity, t n tends to. To infinity, Tn tends to zero, so we get Gl of pi one X. So this implies that for every X in W Z G pi one X times O is contained in Z F X so we can So we can take x we can take A3 to be the idyllic subset associated to the restriction of tau on k and w and for every x in A3 Z G pi one x times O is contained in Z F X Companied in ZFX. So we have constructed A1, A2, and A3, and this finish our proof. Okay, now we want to talk about the AZDC for endomorphism of projective. Projective surfaces. If X is a projective surface of K and F from X to X is a dominant endomorphism, then Az B C holds for the pair X F. And this result is proved in two papers. In the first paper, I prove it for the smooth case. And in the second paper, with Jia and Zhang. Jia and Zhang, we proved the singular case. When X is singular, the idea is to use a geometric argument, in particular the equivalent MMP, to reduce this problem to either the smooth case or the case where F is in the amplitude. Uh, where f is in the amplified, and this case can be treated in the same way as in the smooth case. So now we assume that the x is smooth. The idea of the proof is as follows: We say that the f is empty. We say that F is amplified if there is a nine bundle L on X such that F star L tens L minus one is ample. And if F is amplified, then we have the following two properties. One is the isolated fixed point property. The fixed point property which says for every n at least one, the set of fixed points of Fn is isolated. The second one is a constraint on invariant curves. Curves, assume that x, f and all fixed points of f are defined over a subfield capital K of K. Then we can show that there is a integer, a positive integer BF, such that every irreducible F invariant cross C is divided over a field Kc such that Such that the degree of the extension Kc over K divides some power of Bf. So which means that maybe the degree of the field extension can be very large, but its primal factors Prime factors are bounded. Okay. Recall that the dynamical degree, the dynamical degree of F is defined to be D1F, which is the limit of F and pullback L times L. Pull back L tends to L one over n and n tends to infinity. Where L is an ampoline bundle on X, it converges and does not depend on the choice of the M for Lie bundle L. The topological degree D2F is defined here to be the degree of the field extension. field extension Kx over F star Kx, which is the number of the pullback by F of general point. We treat this problem in the following two cases separated. Case A is the Case A is the in the amplified case. In this case, F is amplified and D2 is strictly larger than D1. Case B are the cases not in case A. For case B, we use a geometric argument. Basically, we use classification of surfaces and the work of Fujimodo, Lakayama, Masuzawa, Sano, and Shibata on endomorphisms of surfaces. For the proof, For the proof of case A, for a fixed point, we denote by lambda 1O, lambda 2O, the eigenvalues of df at O. And we say that O is good, it's a good fixed point if df at O is invectable and And either lambda one, lambda two is multiplicatively independent, or there is a field and banding tau from K to C P where P is a prime such that such that the norm of lambda one and lambda two with respect to this unbanding are both less equal to one and One and at least one of it strictly less than one. Shunji, can you try to finish the talk in like three minutes? We have another talk at 10. Okay, so okay, so I think I will finish very soon. So Finish very soon. So we say that XF has R property if there is an ambanding from K to C such that and fixed point and repairing fixed point. So the proof of case A is splitted in three steps. In step one, we use Step one, we use a work of Getch and Dean Nei Guyang Tung in complex dynamics to show that after replacing F by some iterate, it has R property. And in step two, we showed that the R property implies either A Z D C or DC or the existence of a good fixed point for some FM. Here we use a product formula and the study of multipliers of known post-critically finite and models of Q1. And in step three, we use local pietic dynamics. Local pietic dynamics near a good fixed point and isolated fixed point property and constraint of invariant curves to prove A and D C. In the last section, we give some further problems if X is a variety of an algebraically closed field and S is an algebraically algebraic field. is an algebraic algebraic structure of X. We denote by PKX algebraic property for points in XK. So we introduce a class of problems. We call it the realization problem. What is the minimal transcendence degree RPKXS of a fuel X? x s of field extension k capital k of k such that the property p holds for at least one point in x in the big field uh here uh x k s k are just the base change of x s by k basically this problem ask uh for example uh if we ask whether rp we ask whether rp equals zero then it just asks whether a property holds for a general point for a generic point holds for a closed point okay the first example is the zaisky dense orbit conjecture uh here the structure uh algebraic structure is just a dominant rational map f and rational map f and the property is the f orbit of x is streisky density x and in characteristic z we ask whether rp equal to zero and it's not hard to show that even in positive characteristic rp at the most the dimension of x okay maybe we have no time to talk about the second To talk about the second example. And okay, in the end, using idyllic topology, we propose, we may also ask some idyllic version of the realization problem. So replace instead of ask one point satisfy this property, we may ask an idyllic general. Ask an idyllic general point to satisfy this property. And so the idyllic version of the realization problem is stronger than the original one, but in many cases, it is easier to handle. Okay, thank you. Thank you for the talk. So, do we have any questions, quick questions? Maybe not we can discuss in the coffee break later. So yes, let's thank the speaker again. Okay, thank you.
