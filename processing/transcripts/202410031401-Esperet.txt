I'm going to talk about some joint work with Vida, Pat Morin and David Wood. So I'm going to talk about the clustered HD conjecture. It's about clustered coloring. Sege mentioned the notion earlier on Monday. So what's clustered colouring? So we said that the coloring as clustering k is every monochromatic component has size at most k. So every color class. So, every color class, all the connected components have size at most three. So, here is a three-coloring, and you can check that all monochromatic components have size at most three. So, it's a three-clustering, three-coloring is clustering three. When you have this relaxed notion, you want to try to see if you cannot prove improve on classical theorems in coloring. For instance, for color theorem, can now that I have a cluster coloring, Have a clustered coloring. If I allow myself some constraint clustering, can I pit the four-colored theorem? So, for instance, can I obtain a two-colored theorem? That would be nice. Unfortunately, the answer is no. And the nice example is using the Hex game. So, Hex game, you have two players, white and black, and they alternate, they pay with their white and black tokens, one after the other. One after the other. And the goal of white would be to connect its two sides with a white pass. And the goal of black is to do the same. So you would like to connect black, these two sides with a black pass. Looks like that. And it's clear that they cannot both win, but you can prove that exactly one of the two players wins, which means that at least one of the two players will be able to win. One of the two players will be able to create a monochromatic path connecting the two sides. In terms of graphs, it tells us that for any two coloring of the n by n triangular grid, you have a path on these n vertices which is monochromatic. So you can't beat the four colour theorem with a two color two colour theorem with one cluster. And what's very interesting is that this graph, in addition to being peddled, it has maximum degree six. It has maximum degree six. It's a quite a strong example. And if you go to maximum degree five, you can actually show that even if you don't ask for a panel graph, you have a two coloring with bounded clustering. This was proved by Penny with T-Ball Sabo and Gebert Tabrash. Okay, and if graph of maximum degree five, not even planner, has a two coloring with bounded clustering. So this this example that we have seen is quite tight in Example that we have seen is quite tight in all right, so two coloring didn't work, so maybe let's be a bit more modest and try three coloring. So again, the answer is no. This was observed by these two groups of authors. So first group of authors introduced custom coloring with an application to databases. It's in CS confirmed, so confirmed it has some applications. Applications. So, what's the example? So, you can take a Degent union of many, many, many of these fans, and then you add a universal vertex. And I claim that this doesn't have a three-coloring response clustering. So, let's prove this. So, this vertex certainly has a color, and this this is color one. But then I cannot use one on all of these fans, because otherwise I would have a huge star made of ones. Made of ones. So at least one of these copies doesn't have color one, maybe this one. This is color two, and now I cannot use color two on too many of these vertices. So I will end up with a long pass colour three. Okay? So you cannot even find a three coloring with bounded clustering. And what's interesting is that this graph now it has a a vertex of very large degrees. It doesn't have bounded maximum degree. So, it doesn't have bounded maximum degree as the previous example. And what you can show is that any such example, any graph that doesn't have a three-coloring bounded clustering, any penograph that doesn't have such coloring must have a vertex of very large degree. It's a consequence of one thing that Aigilos mentioned in his talk, that the penographs have asymptotic dimension two. It's a direct consequence of that. And it's also related to what Chun Hung will talk about uh in the next We'll talk about the next. Okay, so three coloring doesn't work, so you're left with just exactly the same number of colors as the four colours here, and we cannot improve on that. Okay, so what about Heidi Gauss conjecture? We'll see in a minute that we cannot improve the number of colors, but since we don't know how to prove Heidika's conjecture, perhaps if we consider clustered coloring instead, we can at least improve on the number of colors. Is it easy to prove to? Yeah. Is it easy to prove you can for clustered colouring packages? Yes, yes, you can just with a matching. Each colour class would be a matching, and this is proved in the 90s, I think. So okay, so uh conjecture by Edward Skankim Uman Simo. Every KH minus free graph is H minus one colorable with bounded clustering. Minus one colorable response clustering. And exactly, as in the same of the four-color theorem, you cannot improve on this number of colors, even if you allow yourself some rounded size clusters. And this is exactly the same example. So take a huge number of disjoint copies of this graph, add a universal vertex, and repeat. Every time the number of colors increases by one, and the Having a number also increases by another. You're never going to beat the happy number. You're never going to be habitable. And that's it's actually why it's interesting. I mean, you your relaxation doesn't make your problem too easy. You will still be competing with habiter success. So what's known about this? So it started with a result by Kenichi Kawarba, Yashin Boyan in fifty fifty point five. 50 point h and it was dependent probably h by fun room and baby and then h minus one so this is what the result is what I'm going to talk about some joint work with Vida Pat and Didi but also Demiak and Sergei announced the results a few years ago so but I mentioned somehow the different Uh so but I I mentioned somehow the difference with uh our approach and things are I I I'll go back to the differences beyond the fact that this is publicly available. Okay, so but yeah, there are some interesting things. One thing I would like to mention is the story of this. So our initial goal was not to prove this at all. I mean we had a very modest goal when we started this project. It was to be able to prove h plus a constant with a simple proof. h plus a constant with a simple proof. So 2h minus 2, there are very nice and simple arguments that are combinatorial using caudal partitions. It even gives a very nice function for the cluster. And this edge by David Etrum, that proof is really very, very difficult. Many pages and many technical arguments. And we just wanted to have a nice simple argument for H plus sequencing. And we found one for H plus four, and I'm going to show it to you. 4, I'm going to show it to you. We're very happy. Then we realize that you can make h plus 3, h plus 2, h plus 1, h, and finally h minus 1. But this was completely unexpected. And I'm pretty sure that if we had started by proving this, we would have never obtained anything. So, lucky yes, I think. So, now I'm going to talk about the proof. And also, I mean, more important perhaps than the proof of this result is the techniques that we use. And we're pretty sure that the techniques. Pretty sure that the techniques can be reused for other problems. But I really want to, like, more important than the results are the techniques and the theorems that we prove. All right, so the proof is just using the graph-minor structure theorem, which says that any kh minor free graph can be obtained, has a tridic composition in which every torso is almost available. And so, what is almost available? So, we have a perhaps non-standard. So, we have a perhaps non-standard view of what an almost embeddable graph is. For us, an almost embeddable graph is something that has two parts: the top, which has bounded three widths, and the bottom, which is just a graph of bounded genus. And it's really an embedded graph. So, you really see the bottom of this as a surface, and the graph is embedded. And what's the connection between the top and the bottom? Well, you have a certain number of boundary vertices that are both in the top and on the surface. Both in the top and on the surface, and all edges between the top and the bottom either go through one of these boundary vertices or they come from one of these very few major edices that lies in the top. Okay? But very importantly, you only have h minus 5 of them. Not f of h, h minus 5. And this is really going to be crucial for all our arguments. Okay, so almost the middle. Okay, so almost unbelievable. You have a top which has bounded treatments, bounded always bounded by a function of h or s. The bottom has bounded genus, and we have this very annoying h minus 5 major APCs and these really, they could be universal to the graph. They can see anyone. Okay? This is almost unbelievable. So fast to graph. Sorry, can you repeat what's the property of this mark? Of these marked vertices that they're just boundary vertices, they are both in the top and on the surface. Okay, but any number of them. Sorry? Any number of them? Any number of them. And you don't have edges that go from here to here without going through the boundary vertices, except these edges. Okay? So any KH manifergraph can be obtained as a 3D composition. Then it has a 3D composition in which all torsos are almost embeddable in this sense. So, this is a version, I mean, this is a, you can extract this from a version of the structure theorem by Deniek and Robin Thomas. This specific statement here that you only have h minus five major equations. I haven't seen this before. I haven't seen this version before. The blue vertices are not. They meant you on the boundary of the topic, but it's the down boundary. Please notice that they are on the boundary, yes? Okay, and you're assuming the boundary is sort of down to the number of holes? I'm not assuming anything beyond the found the boundary for us is abstract, I would say. So this is. Tri-width is bounded. Yeah, but I'm wondering about the surface part. Is the surface just a closed surface with some district? The bounded number of physics, right? So it's just a bounded number of voltages. I'm just putting all vortices and edices in the top and I might do some more adding some more things at the boundary distance from the clean picture. I just haven't seen it before. I mean it is very convenient for us. I'm never going to mention the name of the vortex type during the talk. We don't even need to know what it is. All right, so Alright, so you so what now kh minor free graphs obtain them from doing click sums of these graphs. Okay, this is the same as saying that you can have a 3D composition, where every torso is something like this. This is the same as saying that you repeatedly do click sums. But importantly, in the version of Zenik and Robins, you cannot do any click sum. So you only allow to do two specific type of click sums and the small click sums and the nice. Flick sums and the nice click sums. And small click sums means that you are doing your click sum on a click of size at most h minus 2. Really, very, very small, h minus 2. And so whenever you consider a tree decomposition, it will be usually rooted. And this somehow means that in the tree you have parents and children. So whenever you do a click sum, you really have the parent and the child. And the child. And what's important for us is that in the child node, you can always make sure that your click sum is in the top. But it's not difficult, you would always put this in the top. Okay? So small click sum, it's first type. And the second type of click sum is just a nice click sum. So here you don't really control the size of the fig. I mean, you know, it's bounded, but you don't know that it's bounded by something which is very close to edge. But importantly, for the nice fig sums, the two For the nice click sums, the two clicks are on the top. So, nice click sums, you just do things on the top. Right? So, either it's small or it's nice. All right? We'll see why it's important in a minute. So, any case minor free graph has a 2D composition in which each torso is almost available. And we have seen that we have two types of pixels: the small ones, the orange, and the nice ones. ones, the orange and the nice ones. But we really prefer to consider the nice ones. So it will be convenient for us to imagine that we remove all these orange edges in our tree of the trading position. And this splits the tree of the trading position into sub-trees where all clicksums are nice. And we're happy about that. We like nice clicksums. Okay? So if you read Okay? So if you regroup all these trees, you have a tree decomposition into objects that are these green things here, and the click sums are only small clicksums. Okay? So let's call this a curtain, this object here. So it's something that has a trade composition in almost a mediable graph. The torsos are almost a medible. And all click sums are nice. Let's call that a curve. And we'll see in a minute what a curve is. In a minute, what a curtain looks like. Okay? So, the structure theorem, the one that we are going to use, is that every kh 3 graph has a trade composition in which the torso are curtains and all peak sums are small, h minus 2 vertices at most. This is exactly the structure theorem that we're going to use. We won't use more than that. Okay? So, let's see now. So let's see um an application of that. So now that I have this uh 3D composition, this this view of this, I would like to somehow get rid of these uh small fixings. So assume I'm able to color a curtain. So this is, I mean, we'll see why it looks like that. Assume I know how to color curtains with few colors and bounded clustering. So I go to my root bag, I have a curtain, I color it, and I will try to extend the coloring to the children. To the children. So, but the point is that when I'm coloring my curtain, so this there is some fix on here. So, when I color this, I want to colour that, but this set of vertices has already been colored, right? This is the same set of vertices. So, when I color a curtain, if I want to extend, I need to know how to color curtains when a given set of H minus two vertices is pre-colored. Okay? But I have to be very careful. So, if for some reason I So if for some reason I color one of these vertices with the same color as the color that you see, I will have a huge number of problems. Because possibly this vertex here is this one and maybe it glides in some monogrammatic components. And I don't want this monogrammatic component to propagate to the children. Because here I have one bag, one child bag, but I could have a thousand of chi children bags that all are glued on the same click. That all are glued on the same click. But I don't want the to have neighbors in this click. And the only way I can stop the propagation is to make sure that each of these three-colored vertices, their neighbors in the almost optimal graphs, are given different colors. So I want a proper extension. And a proper extension means that for every vertex u, which is pre-colored, all the neighbors of u that are not colored yet are going to have a color which is distinct. Are going to have a color which is distinct from the color B. This is the only thing I can do. Otherwise, I would be propagating things. Okay, but now assume for some reason I can do that. Give me any curtain, any set of pre-colored vertices, H minus two pre-colored vertices in the top, because we can make sure that the pixel is always in the top. So give me H minus two pre-colored vertices in the top. Assume I know how to properly extend it to a coloring of this graph with quantity. Coloring of this graph is one clustering. Now I can color all kh minor free graph, right? And this is just going from the root bug and extending to the children. So if I want to colour kh minor free graph, the only thing I need to know is how to colour curtains, given a set of pre-curved vertices. Okay? So from now on, we we really completely got kx minor free graph. We will only be interested in curtains. And with okay, now we always have to be careful. Always have to be careful because we have this H minus 2 free graph vertices. But we reduced all Kg minus free graphs in just the study of curtains. So what are curtains? So here is a curtain. So, and I mean this is really perfect story. So what's a curtain? So you have the top of the curtain, which is there. Certainly has bummed through it, and it seems so. And we have lots of different drapes in our curtain. And all these drapes. You know, cut. And all these drapes are only stitched together in the top, right? And you can see something interesting here. You have some vertices in the top that has possibly some neighbors all around the, but there are very few of them. So this is the curtain. And but yeah, but this is, I mean, I don't know if you can see from here, but it's a painting. So it doesn't exist in reality. Physical objects, the best example of a curtain is this object. So I was never able to use this any token all my life, but now I'm going to be able to use it. So this is a curtain. You have all these different drapes, and they all stick together on this very specific vertices here, and they're all independent. So this is really the curtain. And we have to be careful. So every curtain, you have this small set of vertices that possibly see. Of vertices, the possibilities everything. Okay? This is a curtain. For each drape of the curtain, you have these few vertices in the top. Few vertices that see possibly. And the top is common to every leaf. Sorry? And the top is common to every leaf. So yeah, that's a good point. So we'll see in a minute. The way we have obtained it, so all the things were glued on some small clicks. So we'll see. We'll see, yeah. So it's not completely you made click sounds, but you live in a world of bounded truets, so the clicks have bounded sides. They're not H, just some F of H. So yeah, it's a good question. Let's maybe see a cleaner picture. I claim that if you take the top of my curtain now is the union of all tops of my almost but all. Tops of my almost embedded all rocks. So they all have some top. Now I take the union of all tops. And that's the top of my curve. And I claim that the top has boundary widths. Why? Each top has boundary tree widths. And you have obtained them by gluing, doing click sums on the top. So if you take lots of graphs of boundary tree widths and you glue them on the top, doing click sums, it has boundary tree widths. So the whole thing here has bounded tree widths. So our company is really. So, our curtain is really a graph of body truets and some drapes sticking out of this graph, like that. And these are real graphs and some surfaces of body jets. And even if I don't draw them, you really have to think that for each one, you have some nasty set of H minus one notices that possibly C is on the draw. Okay? That's okay. Does it answer your question? Does it answer your question? But they're they're not glued, they're only good on such it's a bit like in this picture here, by this augment here. Like, usually, I mean, they're not completely good together, they're only good on these two things. But this H minus one, in every part of the curtain, there could be different subsets of. Exactly, so for each one of them, I have some set of at most H minus five vertices that can see everything in this set. But these are private to each of these. But these are private to each of these traps. Well, some coins side. Yeah, some might coincide with. Possibly they are the same, but we don't know. Okay, so now that we have this nice view of the curtain, let's see a quick proof of H plus 4. And this is already, I mean, I mean, we were very surprised when we obtained this. So, how would you colour this curtain with few colors? So, it has two parts: a bunch in three widths, and a bunch. Of bounded tree widths and a part of bounded genus. So, you, I mean, you better know how to call out graphs of bounded tree widths and graphs of boundary genes. So, what can you do? So, oh yeah, remember that we have this H minus two preclude versus in the top. Okay, so for the trivialist part, we are going to use this very nice theorem of Trunhung and David. So, the theorem says the following: so it's about KST subgraph frequency. So, it does no minus here. Graph three. So it has no minors here. So you just take a graph that doesn't have KST as a subgraph. And you assume that it has bounded triggers, any constant value. And the result is that you have an S plus one coloring with bounded clustering. So KST subgraph means S plus one coloring. And the very nice aspect of the theorem is that you can even start with a set of pre-colored vertices, and what you would be able to obtain. And what you would be able to obtain is a pre-coloring extension of vertices. So start with any set, pre-colored set P of vertices. You're going to be able to properly extend the coloring. There is one natural condition on the set P, which is very natural. So if you had a vertex here that has S plus one neighbours, there are absolutely no way you can guarantee that this vertex might have a graph which is different from all its neighbours there. A colour which is different from all its neighbors there. Possibly, all its neighbors are colored with colours one up to s plus one, and you won't be able to colour this vertex. So, the natural obstacle for this pre-coloring extension is that you have vertices that have too many neighbors in the pre-colored set. But incredibly, if you prevent this, so you want that no vertex has too many neighbors in the in the set in the set P, even if P is very large. The set P, even if P is very large, you will be able to extend the coloring of P to the coloring of the graph. So it's a very nice theorem, and the proof is not very hard, but it's quite intricate. It's a five-page proof. It's a very nice divide and conquer technique. So we really use this heavily, yes. This pre-coloning, they have an already unbounded clustering. So how can you extend to something that is bounded first? So you do the yeah, so the function. So the function that you get on the on the clustering will somehow depend on p. P should have bounded size, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, bound, yeah, yeah. The boundary clustering here will be bounded by the function of p also, the size of p. So you have to start with p. Yes, yes, but uh in the application we always take p to be at most h minus two or something like this, so this will be fine. What we prove is the case when p has probably size. I don't want to have too many parameters in the bounded means bounded yet. So yeah, that's true. P could already have a huge component, so it's clear that the bounded clustering will have to depend on the size of P. But for the application, P is small, so I claim that this directly implies that for KH minus round, Directly implies that for KH minor free graph, you have an H coloring with bounded clustering, even if you start with H minus 2 pre-colored vertices. You want a proper extension. So why is the case? Well, if you're KH minus 3, you certainly KH minus 1, H minus 1, minor 3. Because if you have a Kh minus 1, H minus 1, you can select a matching of size H minus 2. So it's H minus 2, and add these two vertices, and you get a Kh minor. So if your Kh minor 3, your Kh minus 1, H minus 1 minor 3, and your Kh minus 1, H minus 1, subgroup 3. So you can use this theorem with S equal H minus 1. So you get an H coloring, this one clustering. And can you use this? Yes, because you don't want to have evolved it as at most. You want all vertices to have at most h minus one neighbors in P. But P has at most h minus two. So clearly all vertices have few vertices, few neighbors in P. So I can directly use this result, P has bounded size. So I get that for any KH minus three graph with bounded tree width, I have an H coloring with bounded clustering, and I can even start with a set of H minus two precurved vertices. And I and I will get a proper extension. And I will get a proper extension. And this is what we use for tributes. But you also need to do things about the surface part. And here we're going to use this very nice result of Steniac and Sergei, that graphs of bounded genus are four-colorable with bonded clustering. So this is the four-color theorem, but it works for any surface. It's really nice. I remember Daniel made a segue made a proof of this eight years ago in Banfin, Corbett Hall, a few meters. In a COVID hole, a few letters away from here. I found it very nice. Okay, so now we have all we need to prove H plus four colors. What do you do? You take your scissors and you just separate all the sheets. I won't do it, sorry, I don't have a person with scissors, it'd be nice. So clearly, when you cut here, like all these sheets they fly away and they're all disjoint. So when you cut here, you have one graph upon the three widths. One graph about the tree width and a bunch of graphs upon the genus. So the part about the tree width using the theorem of David and Julhund, we can color this with H colors and we can even start with our set of H minus 2 pre-colored vertices and we get a proper extension. And each of these things is a graph of one of genus, so we can use four colors that are disjoint from these H colors and colour each of these traits with four colours. Drained with four colors. Okay, they will they will have a genus. And in total, I'm using H plus four colors. So this is H plus four colors for all KH minor three colours. Okay, because we only need to colour colours. So the colours are disjoint between these two parts. Yeah, so th they they can have many neighbors, but they are in the top. The colours will be disjoint from these four colors. Four colours. They can spoil the bounded tree widths, on the top. They can spoil the boundary tree widths? No, I mean, they are included there, but why would they spoil? I mean, the subgraph induced by this has bounded three widths. But for now, I mean, I'm using these joint sets of colours. So you could have a unique I mean, you could have a complete bipartite graph between the top and the bottom. What if you need that layer on the A joints to the next one? We will need that later. For now, it could be anything. All right. Okay, but now, I mean, it seems that using disjoint sets of colors here and here, this is not optimal. Perhaps we could just be a bit more clever when we colour, maybe reuse some colors over there. Again, I mean, you might have bad datasets with bad neighbors, but there are only h minus five of them, and we have quite a number of colors. And we have quite a number of colors, so maybe we can do something. Let's see how we can input this H plus 4 to H plus 1 using one single new ingredient. But everything is clear so far? Okay, what's the new ingredient? New ingredient is the product structure theorem of Vida and Gwynard Jauvet, Chopini Shek, Pat Morin, Torsten Uckert, and David Rudd. So, what does You cut integrals. So, what does this say? So, sorry. So, in each of these surfaces that stick out top, take a break-first search layering. So, you look at all the vertices at distance one from the boundary, all the vertices at distance two, three, four, five. So, this is a layering of your surface, basically. And you do that for all drapes. On each of them you have this red first layering. This red first layering, and the product structure theorem tells you exactly the following. You can find a family of vertex disjoint vertical paths in gray. Vertical meaning that every pass intersects every layer in at most one vertex. You can find a family of vertical paths like that, such that when you contract each pass into a single vertex, the graph you obtain has bounded tributes. The graph you obtain has bounded tribes. This is the product structure theorem. You have a family of vertex-disjoint vertical paths. You contract each of them into a single vertex and you get a graph of boundary choice. So what does it mean contracting every vertical path? So the way we view it is that basically what we do is that we erase the curtain. The whole point of the curtain, that you can erase it. This is exactly what construction is. Contractions. Okay, so you raise your curtain and suddenly you have bounded tributes. Okay, but that's great. So we know how to color graphs of bounded tributes. We have been doing contractions. We were kh minor 3, we're still kh minor 3. So we can use again the theorem of David and Chunhung. And we have a coloring of our raised curtain with edge colors and bounded clustering. That's great. At some point, That's great. But at some point, unfortunately, we also have to lower the curtain. Lower the curtain, and every time one of these vertical paths was contracting into a single point, it received some color. We assign the same color to all the vertical paths. Okay? So we transfer the coloring of our raised curtain to the colouring of the whole thing. But now, I mean, you see, the monochromatic components don't have bounded size anymore. Possibly a single vertex became a huge vertical pass. Huge vertical path doesn't have boundic space. But what you can notice is that all these components, monochromatic components, they are very skinny, meaning that each monochromatic component intersects every layer in a bounded number of vertices. Because before the n-contraction, they had bounded sides. And every vertical pass intersects every layer in a single vertex. So when you n-contract, each of these monochromatic components is super skinny. Is super skinny, so it has very bounded widths and species. Okay, so what do you do? I was promising the proof for H plus one colors, and I've only been using H colour so far. So I have one free color. This is great. I'm going to use my free colour as the breaking color. And I'm going to use my single breaking color to break all these components into constant size pieces. I'm going to slice all the components. So, how do we do that? So, let's look at the orange components first. I'm going to recolor all orange vertices at layer 10, say, with my red color. So, everywhere in the graph, all the orange vertices at distance at layer 10 are recolored with red. And then I leave myself some space, so I go to layer, say, 2H plus 10, and again I recolor all orange vertices at this layer with my. That is in at this layer with my new color rate. And I keep going, like after layer 4H plus 10, I recolor everything, and so on. And I do that for all the orange components. So clearly, if I do that, I have redisliced my component to constant size distances. And I can do that for all the other colors, but I have to be a bit careful. Let's say for the pink one, I don't start at year 10, I will be clever and I'll start at year 12. Then 12, and then 2h plus 12, and so on. Then 2H plus 12, and so on. And this is okay. I don't want to have an edge between these two things. But if I take layer 10 and layer 12, I won't have any edge. This is breadth first edge. So I do all this pink and then all the turquoise. And since I left myself at this two edge, I can really do all colors at different depths basically. So with a single color, I was able to slice all components into bounded sides. So it gives me H plus one. It gives me h plus one. And the only single ingredient was the product structure theory. Okay, so you can complain that perhaps it was not so clever to use the same breaking color for all these drips. Maybe you can be more clever. And indeed, you can. You can use different colors for all these drips. And using the fact that you only have H minus five major APCs and incorporating. And incorporating this into the lemma by Chun Hung and David, and being a bit careful. You can always make sure that you save one color in each of these drapes. And you will be using this color that you have saved as a breaking colour. But it might be different for all the drapes. So this gets you down to H. And when we obtain this, we are already very happy. I thought that we will never be able to get to H minus 1. And now, I mean, there are a number of No, I mean there are a number of structural obstacles to go to H minus one. Let me explain you what are the problems. So, but are you convinced by the proof? I'm hiding a number of very annoying technicalities here. I'm always lying a little bit, but just are we considering sorry, I guess we have a question about a place that was probably where you're just. Place of the problem where you're just adding something. I guess, in order to get the product structure, if you need a brother first, you have to say something about where the boundary vertices are on the surface. Yes. So this is almost fine, I think. So one of the most annoying technicalities, what are we really considering here? Are we considering induced uh g like the graphs induced by the bags? Or are we considering torsons? The graph induced by the bags are kH by three. The graph induced by the bags, they are KHO3, and this is really what we want to colour. But if I look at the graph induced by the bags, these vertical paths here, they they're not connected. They are connected in the torso. But you have to be careful, are you considering the torso or the inducer graph? And if you consider the torso, the torso are not Kh minor 3. They are F of H minus 3, but they are not Kh minus 3. So you have to be careful, are you considering the torso or the induced? We consider something which is in between, but freedom. Which is in between, but it really means that we have to be extremely careful everywhere. But fortunately, everything is packaged into, we have proved everything carefully. And if you really want to reuse it, I mean, everything is quite safe. At your own risk, that's quite safe. Alright, so now I want h minus 1. So what would go wrong? So let's look at a single drake. Forget about the whole curtain. And to make things easier. Whole curtain. And to make things even simpler, let's completely forget about the top. And we only have this h minus five major essays in our surface. So remember, we take our vertical path, we erase the curtain, and we have a graph about the genus and bounded tree weights. And we colour this graph. And so say we are only h minus one colour stuff. minus one colors now. So I mean out of these h minus one colors, h minus five might be used by this logistic perhaps you know also. So it only gives you four colors. And out of these four colors you really want to keep one for breaking your monochromatic components. So if you keep one color you only have three colors remaining. Okay, so it means that you would like to color this object, which is a graph of pondigenous bound truits. Band tuit with only three colors in band customer. Can you do that? The answer is no. We have seen an example at the very beginning. Remember that lots of these run fans and you had a universal vertex? Well, this has three widths three. And this is planar. So it's a planar graph with three widths three, and it doesn't have a three coloring with one interface. So it's hopeless to this. This whole thing is completely hopeless. And this is what I thing is completely hopeless and this is what I kept to everyone but in the end it's so fun so we want to use this theorem of Trunohung and David and remember what the theorem was saying if your KST subgraph free and you have run it through it so it means that we would like to be k h minus two t is the perfect okay T sub graph 3. Okay? You want h minus one power, you have to add one power. So we would like this thing to be k h minus 2t sub graph 3 in order to be using the lemma by David Enterhung. So how can I find, what kind of KST can I find in my graph? So we are on the surface, so possibly we have some big K2T, for instance, it's on the surface. We can add up H1C. Uh we have we can add our H minus five utices, now it's a K H minus three T and we we have to add our blocking colour. So our blocking colour cannot be used anywhere on our surface, so it's exactly like adding a universal vertex. So so if you 2 plus 1 plus H minus 5, it's exactly the K H minus 2 T. So I want, in order to be able to prove that I can correct with H. To be able to prove what I can correct with h minus one product. I want my graph to be kh minus two t subgraph free. But there are some kh minus two t's. I cannot avoid them. But if somehow I could, if I could kill this k2t, then I would be kh minus two t's a reference. And I could use the bambai to move the data. So the idea would be to kill those k2ts. How do we do that? So we will be pre-processing. So we will be pre-processing our graph before doing any curtains and railing and everything. We will be cleaning our surface completely. And we will clean the surface using the notion of islands. What's an island? So an island is a small set of vertices deep in our surface, such that every vertex has at most three neighbors outside of that. That's an island. So, why are islands interesting first? So, if you have at most three neighbors outside of the island, in total you have at most h minus 5 plus 3, h minus 2 neighbors. So, each of these vertices has at most h minus 2 neighbors outside of the island. You can remove the island, colour your graph with h minus 1 corners, and add these vertices back. So you have h minus 1 colours. So you have h minus one colors, you have h minus two neighbors. So for each of these vertices, you can pick a color that doesn't appear on its neighbors outside of the island. And I claim that this is a coloring with boundary clustering because where are the monochromatic components? Well, they were outside of the island, they're small, or they are inside of the island. You don't have any monochromatic component that crosses the island. But if you take a small island, then all the monochromatic components are small. So if you have a small So, if you have a small three island, you can safely remove it from your graph by induction. So, you start by cleaning completely your surfaces by removing all three islands, one after the other, and then only you start the proof. Okay, so the fact that you have three islands, this is proof by Diniak and Sage, and this is the reason why there are four colorable disbounded clustering and four in the surface. So, whenever we have an island deep in the surface, we don't need to touch the boundary. We don't need to touch the boundary, but whenever we have some, we remove it. And this is completely okay to do that, to colour them at the very. Okay, so why was it interesting to do this? Now, assume you have a K2T in our room. So what I will do is I will only keep the boundary force I have here, and I will remove everything which is inside. And I will replace everything which is inside, the whole component, by a single vertex. And now I claim. Vertex. And now I claim that I'm K2T free. I do that for all K2T's. I remove the inside and I replace everything with the side by the single vertex. So if I do that, I don't have any K2T's anymore, which means that in my whole raised curtain, I don't have Kh minus 2T's anymore. So I can use the lemma of Chun-Hung and David, and I can color this with H minus 1 colors. And I would lower my curtain and see what I have. So this is my C4 that used to bound my K2T. And when I will lower the curtain, each of these vertices, there might be just a long vertical path. So the picture is looks like that. So you have this four cycle that corresponds to four vertical paths, and you have everything which is inside. Have everything which is inside. And now, what you can prove is that using the fact that we have removed all three islands from the surface, we can prove that everything which is inside, everything that we have removed, is skinny. But this is using some isoperimetric inequality that's used in what Sergei and Stinek have done. So if somehow the component was intersecting one of the layers in too many vertices, then we Many vertices, then we would be able to find a three-year unit, and we would be done. So the fact that we have removed all three islands before doing everything implies that which is the component that is here, when we lower the curtain, it's skinny. But then we can, I mean, it's exactly what we want, to have skinny components. We will be coloring our graph, and then we will be breaking this skinny component exactly like we have broken all the other skinny components. So we we're completely safe. So we we're completely safe. So again what we do is we remove the inside, replace this by a single vertex, colour the graph and then we see what we get. We have this vertex is now a huge component but it's skinny. So it would be broken into small pieces like every other component. And that's all. That's the proof for H minus 1. So let me conclude. So we proved that K minus requires our H minus 1 colorable, whose bounded clustering, and the exact same proof. With bounded clustering, and the exact same proof gives that if you are KST minor 3, you s plus 1 voluble with bounded clustering. Exact same proof. But at some point David said, oh, it's the exact same proof. Maybe we should factor the paper to just decrease the number of pages. And let's try to prove a result that implies both results. And actually, this is what we do. We prove that our J. Your JST minor 3, your S plus 1 colorable with one eclipse. So what's JST? JST is the set of all graphs that you can write as the concloin of a clique of size S and a tree of size T, antibiotic size T. All graphs that that are the complete joint of a click of size S. Are the complete joint of a clip of size S and a tree of size T. We call that JST. And what we prove is that if you avoid all these graphs as minors, your S plus one colorable is bounded clustering. So why does it imply these two results? Well, if you take t equals two and s equals h minus two, you have a single graph in this family. Just a click of size h minus two plus an h, it's just a click of size h. So s equals h minus two, so you get h. So H minus 2, so you get H minus 1 colorable response cluster layer. And for this result, you just observe that all these graphs have KST as a subgraph. So if you are KST minor 3, you are JST minor 3. And then you are S plus 1 plus 1 plus S plus 3. So yeah, so we proved this. It's great because it saves at least maybe 15 pages of the proof. But more importantly, it's completely. More importantly, it's completely surprising because by discussing with Sergei during the lunch break, so what Sergei, okay, let me conclude by first saying that what we have proved and what we do not prove. So we do not prove that Kh minus three graphs have H minus two islands. We would have liked to prove that. If you always have these islands, you can remove them and you can color graphs with H minus one colors. Graphs with H minus 1 colors. We do not prove that. So, this is what Zenik and Sergei prove. And in particular, this implies H minus 1 traceability. But what's really surprising, and we discovered that during Lunchbreak, what Sergei and Zenik prove is that for minor closed class, being H minus one choosable or having this H minus two islands is equivalent to being the JST minus three. JST minus 3. That's the same. And the way they obtain this, it's completely different from us. It's just very convenient because we have less pages in our paper. But for them, it's really crucial for their proof. And it's amazing that we have no, I mean, it's completely independent, but we end up with the same obstacles. For them, it's completely equivalent. For us, we only have one direction. If you're JST minor 3, then your S plus 1 colour. They true that it's equivalent to B. To be accusable and having these accounts. All right. So, thank you very much. So, this this paper would and tell you this two thousand nineteen. When did it appear? It's still under review as far as I know. So it's split into three papers. First one is on the review. Second one says it's the first one subtitles. Third one is already published. So what I should say is that we don't use any result of, I mean, we use some of the ideas of the paper of David El Juneau, but we reprove everything. It's just a few. Reprove everything, it's just few few parts. We don't use any of the results of this paper, it's independent, but our result doesn't depend on the different papers editing. But we really reuse heavily the ideas for boundary true rates. This is a completely crucial for our proof. And the fact that the proof is the divide and compare proof is so versatile, we can really add lots of constraints to it and and things still work, and we already reuse that a lot. We already reuse that a lot. So, if you only have one thing to take away, use curtains. Every time you have some problem for KH minor, you're 40 seconds, I don't understand what's use curtains. Usually, completely sufficient. Okay, but thank you. Another question, like also did you have a particular motivation for looking at KST? Uh KST? Yeah, I mean the motivation natural natural extension of the fact that on on surfaces you The fact that on surfaces you just need four colors. So surfaces are K3T minus 3, and you guess that, okay, if you generalize that, and KST minor 3 would only need S plus 1 colors. But the interesting thing is that things do not depend on T. This is what's really striking, in some sense, for this result and also for the JS theories of the system. But yeah, maybe the fact that this class of graph appears in these two different Graph appears in these two different contexts. I think there might be something interesting to that. So, JST minor free graphs. What are they? What can you say about these classes? They pop up for very different reasons, but I think it might be interesting. Funny thing about subdivisions? Because I remember that actual number of colours depends on the subdivision. So as most of the tools we use is this curtain and raising the curtain, everything is very sensitive to contractions. So I don't think we can leave the world of minor plus classes for, at least with the techniques we use, I don't think we can leave this world at all. But yeah, maybe we can. Or with the current techniques, I don't think we can make some divisions. And in the same way, I don't think we can do anything about islands and choosability, because like contracting things and uncontracting things, we build any hope to do things about choosability. But also islands, because like contracting things, you have maybe many, many neighbors outside of the island after contraction. So I think this is pretty orthogonal to what uh Sergei and Stinek uh do. But yeah. But very surprisingly the same objects appear. Objects are key. There was another type of higher. So the small hicksums, they are completely killed by considering that you have a set of H minus 2 pre-colored vertices. So once you prove this, then you have your 3D composition. You can colour the root bag and then extend the coloring to the children bags and so on. So we completely kill all. So, we completely kill all small fixums by only considering curtains with a set of pretty good vertices. How are you sure that you don't create a big thing of the vertical? Because each time it's a proper extension. Okay. So, this is what we prove each time is that you have to break outside the vertices and you want a proper extension. But this is exactly what's guaranteed by David and Trunholm-Schemer. I have one question from speaking. What's up to your group?
