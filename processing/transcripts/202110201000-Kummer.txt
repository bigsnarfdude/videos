Let me recall some concepts from that you have already heard in previous talks. So this, for example, in Petter's talk. So if we have a multivariate real polynomial, it is called stable. If it does not vanish on the product of the upper half planes, so it's non-zero, whenever we plug in only for each variable, only complex numbers with positive imaginary part. Yeah, so. Yeah, so for example, you have seen in Petter's talk that if you have a univariate polynomial, then this just means that all the roots of the polynomial are real. Of course, whenever you have a non-real root, then also its complex conjugate would be a real root and would be a root, and one of them lies in the upper half plane. So then a matroid. Then a matroid M is said to have the half-plane property. If its space is generating, yeah, so I will abbreviate this with a HPP. Yeah, it has the half-bin property. Uh, yeah, test the half-bin property if its basis-generating polynomial is stable. So, the basis generating polynomial denote by H sub m is a sum over all square free monomials that correspond to. Monomials that correspond to basis of the matrix. So here B of M is the set of bases of M yeah, so yeah, I don't introduce matroids again, so this is one of the advantages if you speak later on in the week. So a lot of matroids. So, a lot of Metroid stuff has been, for example, introduced in Suntia's talk and also in Peto's talk. Yes, so Metroid has the half-bin property if its basis generating polynomial is stable. So, in Peto's talk, we have, for example, seen that if we have any homogeneous multi-affine polynomial, then the support of such a polynomial. The support of such a polynomial must be the set of basis of a matroid. So, this is one reason that makes this notion natural. But I also want to point out the difference to Petter's talk. So, he was mostly talking about matroids with the weak half-plane property, or he called it hyperbolic matroids. And this meant that matroid has the weak half-plane property if there is. Half-bin property if there is any stable polynomial whose Fouquet is the set of basis of this matrix. So, this would mean that instead of having all the coefficients to be equal to one in this formula here, we could also allow for arbitrary positive coefficients. So, examples. So, this is this notion is. This notion is stronger than the notion in Petter's talk. Okay, so some examples. So, for example, uniform matroids have the half-bane property. So, uniform matroids are those matroids on n elements. Matroids on n elements where all subsets of at most size k where k is fixed are independent. So these are have the half-build property. So the reason is the basis generating polynomials are just the elementary symmetric polynomials and it's not hard to show. There are many ways of proving that these are stable. Another example is minors. Example is minus of matroids with the half-plane property. So minus of, yeah, so this is a minor closed condition and also regular matroids. So, in So, in particular, graphical matroids. So, regular matroids are matrix that are representable over any field. They include the graphic matroids and why do they have the half-band property. So, this can be seen easily. So, there's a characterization of regular matroids which says that. Which says that matroid is regular if and only if it can be represented by a unimodular matrix. So unimodular means that it has only entries 0, 1, 0 and plus minus 1, and all the minors of A are also 0 or plus minus 1. zero or plus minus one. And represented by this matrix means you have a matrix, a rectangular matrix on, say, n with n columns. And then you can define a matriarch on n elements by claiming those subsets of the columns to be basis or to be independent when these rows are, when these columns are independent as vectors. Independent as vectors. So, for example, in the graphic case, you can take the incidence matrix of the graph. So, then one can look at the following matrix, the following polynomial given as a determinant. Take A times and the diagonal matrix with the variables as entries times A transpose. Suppose. And this is the basis generating polynomial of the matrix represented by A. So this can be. So, this can be calculated rather easily. So, this has been also mentioned in Petter's talk. So, if you expand this determinant, you can use the Cauchy-Binet theorem, and then you get some expression. So, you get a multi-affine polynomial, and the coefficient of the monomial corresponding to, say, x1 up to xd is equal to x. One up to xd is exactly the square of the subdeterminant of the matrix A corresponding to the columns one up to D. And since the matrix is unimodular, all these coefficients are one, and this shows that this is in fact the basis-generating polynomial and not just any other polynomial with the support given by the basis of this matroid. Yeah, and we have seen in Petter's talk that such determinants, polynomials that you can write as such determinants, are stable. And therefore, regular matroids have the half-bin property. It's have the half-bin property. So, this also shows in Petter's talk, so he gave a similar proof for the fact that all matroids that are representable over the real numbers or even the complex numbers have the weak half-plane property. So, this is not true for the half-plane property, because by looking at this determinant, one could get different coefficients other than. Different coefficients other than one. So, why do we look at these matroids with the half-band property? So, in Petter's talk, he already explained that stable polynomials satisfy a lot of nice inequalities. And if the basis generating polynomial of a matroid satisfies is stable, then these inequalities can be interpreted as some. Can be interpreted as some combinatorial inequalities on the matrix. So, one example is the following. I think originally due to Joey and Wagner with the matriarch M Has the half-blane property, and for all i, j, and e, so say matroid m on the ground set E, and for all i and g, we have the following inequality. So the number of bases of m times Times the number of bases that contain both I and J over the number of bases in M that contain I times number of bases. Basis of M that contain J. This fraction is at most one whenever the matroid has the half-pin property. So this inequality is interpreted as this matroid being negatively correlated. So this can interpret this as some correlation coefficient. Coefficient. So this fraction is the probability that a basis contains. So this part is the probability that the basis that contains J also contains I. And this one is the probability, the reciprocal of the probability that it Reciprocal of the probability that it just contains i. So the event that the basis contains i and the event that it contains j is negatively correlated by this inequality. And in general, this is not true for any matroid. So there are also matroids that have positively correlated. That have positively correlated elements. But I think one cannot be too bad. So I think there's an upper bound of two on this fraction. And I think the worst example is eight over seven. So in the spirit of this inequality, there's in fact a characterization of Of matroids with the hard plane property. So, one part is due to Petter-Brendel, and the other one is due to Wagner and Y. So, let M be a matroid on the ground set E. Then the following are equivalent. So, So M has the half-plane property if and only if for all i and J the polynomial delta i j h m, which is the following mixed derivative of the Derivative of the basis generating polynomial. This should be non-negative on the entire R to the N. And yeah, so the connection, so this equivalence was proven by Petter. So this the connection to the previous To the previous one, is so if you plug in to this polynomial the all ones vector, so you yeah, then this polynomial being non-negative exactly means that this fraction is at most one. So, like we have seen in Suntia's talk yesterday, taking the derivative somehow means conditioning on containing the element i. Containing element i. And yeah, so Wagner and Y refined this or extended this criterion. So if we already know, so we mentioned that the half-brain property is preserved under taking minus, we already know that all proper minus of M has the half-blame property, which is necessary for it to have the It to have the Half-Me property itself, then it's only sufficient to check non-negativity of one of these mixed derivatives. Yes, okay, and using this criterion, we were able to characterize all metroids on. All matrix on at most eight elements that have the half-bin property. So let me phrase it like this: so there are 22 matroids, so exactly 22 matroids on eight elements, all of whose minors. Of whose minors have the half-blame property, but which do not have the half-blame property themselves. So, this gives a characterization of all matroids on eight elements with the half-life property because matroids on Because matroids on at most seven elements with the Half-Lane property were already characterized. So it's all but 10 very special matroids, including, for example, the Fano metroid that Peto mentioned on Monday. Yeah, so one would, if you have a matrix on eight elements, you first check if all the proper minors have the half. Check if all the proper minors have the half-bin property by looking at this list of 10 matroids. And then, if it has one which does not have the half-bin property, then you can exclude it and otherwise you check whether it's one of these 22, where you have an explicit list. So, let me say something on the proof. So, this was computational. So, we used the Macaulay two-package matrix that. That is developed by Justin Chen, which, for example, contains a list of all matroids on eight elements. And then we go through this list. And in order to prove that a certain matroid has the half-plane property, We first, of course, check the minors. And then, if all the minors have the half-band property, we use the Macaulay two package sums of squares by Sifuentes, Carle, Parillo, and Calle, Parillo, and Pao, which is able to, given a polynomial, able to check using semi-definite programming whether it's a sum of squares or not. And if it's a sum of squares, then it actually is able, or in many cases, is actually able to produce a sum of squares decomposition with rational coefficients. So then having such a representation as of Such a representation as of one of these mixed derivatives as sum of squares of rational polynomials, we get the symbolic certificate, so symbolic proof that it has the Halfman property. So the finding these decompositions is a numerical process, but we get in the end is a real symbolic proof. So then, of course, there are some. So then, of course, there are some of these matroids where none of these mixed derivatives is a sum of squares. For those, we try to disprove that they have the half-blink property. And this we have done by using the We have done by using the Julia package homotopy continuation.jl by Paul Preiding and Sasha Timmer. So, how did we use that? So, we How did we use that? So, we by using this criterion, it suffices to disprove that the matrix M has the half-man property, it suffices to find one single point and one pair ij, where this mixed derivative is negative. So we using this homotopy continuation package, we computed all the critical points of these polynomials and plugged in some close by rational points. Some close by rational points, and then we found some where it's not, where it's negative. So, and basically what we found is that Matroid either has one of these forbidden minors as a minor, then it does not have the Half-Win property, or one of these mixed derivatives is a sum of squares, then it has the Half-Win property, or Half-blind property, or if none of these mixed derivatives is a sum of squares, then we can find the point where it's negative. Okay, so yeah, so let me say some words on these 22 matroids. So there's a also yes, we also um We also, on some of these matroids, we also checked directly the definition of the being stable to exclude them. Yes. Okay, so let me say something on these 22 exceptional matroids here. So they all are sparse paving matroids. If this says something to someone, and yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. So we have an explicit list that can be looked at once the paper is published. So let me switch gears and maybe look at another motivation for studying these. Studying these matrix with the half-blink property. So, if we have a homogeneous and real stable polynomial, then we can look at the following set with a connected component of the complement of the real. The complement of the real zero set of f that contains the all-once vector. So this is called the hyperpolicity cone of the polynomial. This has been mentioned at some point. Convex. Convex open semi-algebraic sets. And on the other hand, so we call such polynomial as F spectrahedral if this hyperpolicity cone is a spectrahedron. So we have seen spectrahedra in Klaus' talk. Klaus talk earlier today. So if this open and semi-algebraic convex set C sub F can be written like this, so set of all points where a certain matrix pencil is positive definite, then we call F spectrahedron. So for some PSD matrices AI and a matroid is called spectrahedral if its base is generated. If its basis generating polynomial is spectrahedron, so there's a big open question in this context called the generalized Lags conjecture, which states that for homogeneous real polynomials, stable implies spectra etching. implies spectrahedral. So it's not hard to show that every spectrahedral cone, so set written in this form here, is in fact the hyperbolistic cone of some stable polynomial, but the converse is not true. So this would give some characterization, if true, of both of these hyperballistic cones and of spectrahedral cones. Heatrop points. Yeah, so if this is true, then of course every operation that preserves stable polynomials or stable or atroids with the Half-Lin property should also preserve this spectrahedral property. So this motivates this result where we show that. We show that minors of spectrahedral matroids are themselves spectrahedral. So this is a kind of good sanity check for this conjecture. Now, if one conversely wants to prove If one conversely wants to prove this conjecture, then historically there was one class of polynomials for which it's always true. So let's call polynomial weakly determinantal if f to some power r can be written in this. Be written in this determinantal form like this for some AI PSD and similar definition for matroid. So, matroid is weakly determined if its space is generating polynomials weakly determinantal. So, the point of this definition is that if you have a weakly determinantal stable polynomial, then it's automatically spectrahedral. So, this so the describing matrix in the middle of the matrix The describing matrix inequality is just given by exactly these matrices AI that appear in the determinant. So then there was conjectured at some point, okay, maybe every stable polynomial is weakly determinedal. This would solve the generalized Lex conjecture, but this is unfortunately not the case. So, countex. Not the case. So, count examples coming from matrix theory given by Peter Prentin, who proved that the War-Mosch matrix has the half-win property, but is not weakly detrimental. So, in fact, the fact that it has the half-win property was proven by Wagner and Wey by using the same criterion that we. Using the same criterion that we use, but Petter's contribution was that it's not weakly determined and thereby proving this stronger conjecture. So the methods he was using was he proved that whenever a matrix is weakly determined, then it must be representable, and then it must satisfy so-called Engelton inequalities. And this is some inequality on the rank function of a matroid that must be satisfied for all matroids that are representable over any field. And Vermosh matrix is a standard example of a matrix that violates this inequality and therefore is not representable over any field. So, in view of this conjecture, it might be now desirable to have more of these. Desirable to have more of these examples where the half-brain should have the half-brain property but not weakly the tonantal. And Amini and Brenten found some more and also Sunja Vincent and co-authors found some more, but all of them on more than eight elements. So we wanted to find more of those. To find more of those on eight elements now that we have this classification of those with the half-brain property. So it turns out that this being non-representable over any fields does not give any more counterexamples because we found that the Varmos matroid is the unique Matroid on eight elements, which has the half-bane property, but is not representable over any field. But there are some other criteria that you can use to. You can use to prove that something is not weakly detrimental. So there's some older result to myself and Daniel Blaumann and Sinja, which says that if polynomial F is neatly determined Then these mixed derivatives of F must all be a sum of squares. And this is very convenient for us because we did check these differences for being sum of squares, anyways. Being sum of squares, anyways. And so we found that some of these differences are sum of squares, so they have the half-bin property, but some of them are not, so they are not weakly determined. So there are at least 13 more matroids. Matroids on eight elements that are have the half-line property, but are not weakly determined. So these are all also all sparse paving matroids, which I haven't introduced, but maybe can give. But maybe you can give one more, one example of these so you look at the following look at the following heptahedron. Um so this is a a polytope on on eight with eight vertices and seven um and seven faces and one of these 13 matroids is the matroid on eight elements. The matroid on eight elements, all of whose of rank four, where the dependent sets of size four are exactly those that correspond to a quadrilateral phase of this polytope. Yeah. Okay. So maybe in the last few minutes, one more thing that maybe relates to the previous talk and to others relating to the So let me consider the Newton polytopes. So the Newton polytope of a polynomial, as you know, it's a convex hull of the support of Rn. And let's take a phase of this Newton polytope. Then, if can be written like this as sum of monomials, then we define f sub f to be the polynomial that we get by throwing away all the monomials that are not contained in this phase. In this phase that we have chosen. And this is also an operation on a polynomial that preserves the property of being stable. This is not so hard to show. And so, in particular, it should also be if the generalized Lex conjecture is true. Generalized Lex conjecture is true, it should also preserve spectra heutrality. And this is, in fact, the case. So if F is spectrahedral or stable or weakly Determinantal, then this facial polynomial has as well. Okay, so yeah, I think. Okay, so yeah, I think time is almost up. Yeah, so yeah, now it's up. So yeah, thanks for the attention and I'm yeah, it's all that I wanted to say. Thank you very much. So are there some questions? Yes. Yes. So do you have any characterization of the matrix polytopes associated to these 22 that you found? Some combinatorial characterization? No, not. It's a good question. Not, you mean like, yeah, so like a characterization on the level of matroid polytopes for those matrix? No, no. Matrix? No, no, we have not. But it's a good question. But I'm not sure if this is really, really possible to find it. But yeah, it would be really a nice result. And what happens if you go below eight? Yeah, below eight. So every matrix on six elements has the half. On six elements has the half-plane property. And for seven matrix on seven elements, there's every matroid except for 10 matroids, I think, has the half-brain property. So this is the Fano matroid and three of its relaxations and one more matroid. So these are five. And then you take also the duals of these five matroids, and then you have a complete list of matroids on seven elements. Matroids on seven elements that have not the rough property. Thank you. Other questions? May I ask a question? Sure. You said you found at least 13 matriates on eight elements that are not weakly determinedal, right? So do you know anything about them? Them or which of them are spectra etrial? No, um, yeah, that's that's actually a good question. So, this is yes, so this is, I mean, this is more or less the motivating question. So, this, these are the candidates that one should look at and check whether they are spectrahedral or they could be possible counterexamples. So, I mean, for BAM. So, I mean, for BAMOS, you showed some years ago that it's spectraetral. Is that right? Not exactly. So, actually, so there's another polynomial that you get from the Warmosh polynomial by setting like you can partition it in four groups of two elements. And if you set the corresponding variables equal to each other, you get a polynomial of degree four and four variables, which is also not weakly determinable. Which is also not weakly determined, and for that, I proved that it's so. This, even the Warmosh matrix is still a counterexample, but I think this kind of indicates that it might be spectrahedral. Thank you. Sorry, Mario, can you? Yes. So could you please explain again how you prove that this How do you prove that this mixed derivatives, some of the mixed derivatives are non-negative, but not sums of squares? Yeah, so it's also using, I mean, okay, so this so far, I think it has to be treated with caution. So we so far we only have the result that the numerical solver says that it's unfeasible the progress. The program. But this can actually also be made into a symbolic proof by giving... So I mean, if you, a polynomial is the sum of squares if and only if it's a cram made its cram spectrahedron is non-empty. So if the cram spectrahedron is The Gram spectra hedron is maybe given like this by positive semi-definite symmetric matrices Gi. Then if you find the, then you can, in our case, these are all rational matrices because the polynomial has integral coefficients. Now you can Now you can. So, if this is empty, this spectrahedron, so it's empty if and only if you find the positive definite matrix, say x such that a trace of x times A trace of x times gi zero for all for all i's. And finding such a matrix can again be done by doing semi-definite programming and then rounding to the next rational number gives a rational certificate that something is not a sum of screens. So you look at the dual, so it's a hyperplane that separates us. Exactly. Okay. Okay. Exactly. Okay. Okay, thanks. Another question? I'll, I'm right. Okay. Nice talk. Thanks. So is it right that in all the all your examples, either the polynomial was not stable or there was one of these delta ijs as a sum of squares. That's what you. That's what you exactly, yes. So that made the characterization actually more or less possible because otherwise would be more difficult to certify the non-negativity because the semi-definite programs would grow very large. Have you looked at any Metroids? Have you looked at any matrix on 90? Have you looked at any bigger ones just for the moment? Yeah, I think Bushra is currently doing that. Are you? Yes, so that's also the problem is on my colleague to the classification so the list of matrix on eight elements is there, but not the list of matrix on nine elements. So for that, I need to. Elements. So, for that, I need to get data from another database and then take the Metroids and apply the tests. So, it's my plan to do that. And I already got the database, but I haven't started yet. Yeah. Ask Justin Chen to very nicely put them in. Yeah, of course, it would be nice to have that also implemented in Nacauli, too. Yeah, great. Yeah, great. Very cool. Thank you. So, no other question, I guess. Oh, no? Okay. So, resume in the side.
