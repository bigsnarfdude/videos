I'm going to be talking about natoids. Much of this work is joint with Nestle Han Gogun Su. And a natoid is like this stevedorous knot, this, excuse me, this bowline that you're looking at here. It is a knot with two ends. With two ends, and if represented diagrammatically, the ends are in different regions in the diagram. And this can be done. That is, one can consider knot theory with ends to the knots and not worry about the fact that if the ends were to slide, then it would become unknotted by making the By making the rule for the diagrams that the knots shall not, that things shall not pass across the ends. And of course, knotoids come up when you are actually tying a knot or when you're looking at a knotted line in space. Because if you were to take a knotted line in space and project it in some plane, then that's what you will get. You'll get a naughtoid. The end points will. Get, you'll get an autoid. The endpoints will not necessarily be in the same region in your projection. So, this provides a possibility for studying open-ended curves that are knotted in space by restricting the projections to a given knotoid direction and then allowing the topological movement within that direction. And so, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to talk about a little about some applications. About a little about some applications that have surfaced about this idea and about the mathematics of it. So, the term knottoid and a first paper on it is due to Vladimir Turaev. And as I said, it's a knot diagram with two ends. The ends can be in different regions of the diagram. And we'll study them as one does study knots diagrammatically up to Reidemeister move. Up to Reidemeister moves, but you're not allowed to pass an arc across an end. So, otherwise, you're allowed to do whatever you like, and you find that you can do many of the things that you ordinarily do in knot theory. It's really a classical knot-theoretic object. So, here are some images of a few knotoids up here. Of course, a A rope that is simply knotted in the middle with two ends out in the same region, that's allowed. And when you're in the plane, you may find that you have two ends in the same region and then something happening around them. And if you're restricted to being in the plane, this is an autoid. So there are lots of variations. Here's a standard one with the two points in the With the two points in the same region, which we call notite. The Reidemeister moves, I recall for you, are these moves on diagrams done locally. And of course, if you have two diagrams that are related by Reidemeister moves, then that means that they're isotopic. That is, there's a continuous family of embeddings that correspond to them that take you from one to the other. You untwist that, you pull this one. Twist that you pull this one apart and you pull this one up or down. And what's forbidden is to slide an arc over the end, as I said. Now, these guys have perfectly good interpretations in terms of three-dimensional space. And one way that Nestle Hahn and I worked on for this is to put two perpendicular lines. Put two perpendicular lines to the plane, call them rails, as Sophia and her collaborator do. And then you are constrained now to move the end points up and down the rails. And otherwise, the rope in between can move any way it pleases, up the isotopy, not allowed to go through itself. And that's equivalent to doing an autoid in the plane. Doing the nautoid in the plane. So, with this idea, you see that it really is a three-dimensional theory. It isn't just some diagrammatic theory that only works in the plane. What you're saying is you have an open-ended entity up in space, and you choose a planar direction, and you thereby choose two lines perpendicular to that plane, and then you say, I shall. And then you say, I shall keep the endpoints on those lines. And once you do that, then you can consider the spatial isotopy class of what you've got and analyze it topologically. And of course, that requires a specific choice of plane of projection, but you can, if you have an open-ended object in space, you can choose all possible planes of projection. All possible planes of projection, and then among them there will be a finite family of them that have specific anoptoid properties, and examine this mapping of all these different planes. So you could map to a two-sphere or you can map to planes, you can choose different directions and thereby analyze an open-ended line in space for its topological properties. Properties. And as you see, this will depend on the projection. But if you had somebody that was unknotted, then it won't have any interesting non-trivial topology in any of its directions if it was just a straight line on knot. But on the other hand, if it's not a straight line on knot, then there will be some projections in which it might be a non-trivial natoid. And if it had knotting in it that was concentrated. Knotting in it that was concentrated, then that would tend to occur in all the different projections that you used. So you see that this is a fruitful way of thinking about it. This is for the plane. If you want to do something similar, and I didn't make a slide for it, if you want to do something similar for the notoids that are living on the surface of a sphere, then imagine doing the following. Take this. Doing the following: take this vertical line and connect it up over the top to the other vertical line, and take this bottom end of the vertical line and connect it down along the bottom to the bottom of the other vertical line. And now you're looking at a graph embedded in space with two unknotted arcs, the upper arc and the lower arc, and the middle arc possibly knotted and circling around the other two arcs. So that's a theta graph. So that's a theta graph embedded in three-dimensional space. And Torayev originally points out that the natoid is equivalent to the topological equivalence of theta graphs embedded in three-dimensional space. So that's another way of thinking about what this strategy is. You have the open-ended line and you form a theta graph and that again. Graph and that again could be done in many ways. But you form one way of making a theta graph with two unknotted lines, and then you examine the topological type of that graph in three-dimensional space. For our purposes, we rather like the rails for thinking about moving it about. So here's an example of that. I have this guy here, and I could. I have this guy here, and I could push this up, or I could push this down like that. And in fact, you can see some things about that. If you were to draw a nautoid in the plane here, well, actually, this isn't the best diagram. I think I'll skip this slide rather than explain it. Let's look at Let's look at a nautoid that occurs in practice. I just want to point this out. You know, if you were going to make, probably you can see this, if not, you can see the slide. But if you were going to make a bowline, why then you take the knot in hand and you make a twist and you push through the loop and around and back down through and pull it tight, and then look at what you have in your hand. Then look at what you have in your hand, and you see that indeed you have, in fact, produced an autoid. The way it can reconfigured, one end is near or inside the loop that you produced, and the other end is far away. And then when you start to think about, well, what knot did I produce? Then it's quite natural to say, well, I quite natural to say, well, I want to close it up. I would like to close this up and see. Like to close this up and see what ordinary knot I produce. So I may take the end point that's in the middle of the loop of the bowline and I may pull it this way and attach it to the other end, in which case I get this knot. But I might have decided to pull it across the top of the loop the other way, and I'll get a different knot. So in one case, I get an eight crossing knot, in the other case, I get a six crossing knot. But those are both operations that you can perform on a nauto. That you can perform on a knotoid called under and over closure. You can take a point in one of the regions and just take it underneath the whole knot and connect it up to the other endpoint or over the whole knot and to the other endpoint. And so one way to get information about the knottoids is to form these kinds of closures and then examine classical invariants of the knots that. Classical invariance of the knots that you obtained. So, as I said, it's quite a reasonable enterprise to take a projection and get a nautoid and examine those nautoids. And this has been done and is being done by various people. And it's quite an interesting question to see what is going to happen. What is going to happen and how that will reflect on, say, protein folding topology. So I'm just giving you a flavor of that with a couple of slides. And now I want to talk for a little while about the basic mathematics of these gadgets, just to show you that it's interesting and you might want to use it. And you might want to use some of these ideas if you're interested in applying naughtoids. So, one key thing that happens quite differently from classical knot theory when you're looking at nautoids is parity phenomena. Consider this little nautoid here, the simplest one I know, and look at its Gauss code. Now, by Gauss code, I mean that you walk along the knot and say the name. And say the name of the crossing as you meet it. And I won't worry about over and under here. I'm just looking at the simplest part of the Gauss code. So I walk along and I say one, then I say two, one, two. And the Gauss code is one, two, one, two. And you will notice that between one and one, I have one, two, an odd number of them. And between two and two, I have one, one, an odd number. In general, In general, when you're working with a classical knot, the number of symbols in between the reappearance of one symbol is even. But here it can be odd. And in fact, you can see why it can be odd. Look at one coming all the way back to one. And you see this other line entered the region generated there, that little loop from one to one. It entered, but it didn't leave because. It entered, but it didn't leave because of the endpoint. And that's how you could change the parody from even to odd. If you were in an ordinary knot, whatever entered would have to leave. And so that makes the parody even. So we have this odd parity. A crossing in a knotoid will be said to have odd parity or be odd if it's interstice between the repetition of that is odd. And then you can define arrive. Can define a ride just like the usual ride, except that we sum only over the odd crossings and take the sign of the crossing, plus or minus one, where my convention is that this is a plus crossing and that's a minus crossing, and you can compute the rithe. So the ride of this is two. But if you had a classical situation where there aren't any odd crosses, where there aren't any odd crossings, the ride would be this odd ride would be zero. And so you see that if something is classical, why then it would have zero ride. If it were standard, it would have zero ride. If the endpoints were in definitely in the same region, or if it was equivalent to something, well, we'll get to that. If you take the mirror image switching all the crossings, of course, you get the negative as usual. And it's non-zero. And its non-zero implies that the knot couldn't possibly be standard. It couldn't have its endpoints in the same region. So what I haven't proved on this slide and shant is that this is an invariant, but that's a nice exercise and probably a good first exercise if you want to get used to nautoids. Go to the Reidemeister moves and prove that this is invariant under the Riedermeister moves. Invariant under the Reidemeister moves, given that you don't move things across endpoints, of course. And let's go back to the Reidemeister moves for a moment, just to be clear what's involved here. Here's the Reidemeister moves. You're going to need to verify that it's invariant under this, and you will find that either both of these are odd, and then they contribute opposite signs, or both of these are even and they don't contribute at all. That's what you'll find. Contribute at all. That's what you'll find. And something similar here. And this doesn't contribute at all because there's nothing in between this symbol and when you return to it. So the first Reidemeister move is automatically not changing the ride. Quite different from the usual ride. All those little first Reidemeister moves are even, in other words, and they're ignored. Words and they're ignored. So we have this invariant, the odd ride. Perhaps I have another example here. Yeah, I do. So here's a more complicated Gauss code. And I look in this Gauss code and I check and find out which ones are even and which ones are odd. This one was odd and so on and count them up with the signs that are in the diagram. That are in the diagram, and I get this Rive. So, Rive being quite a useful index for thinking about knots, you can consider the RIDE. And of course, you can consider average RIDE and other things if you want to. Now, I want to show you a little bit about how we get invariants of. Invariance of nontoids by using the concept of virtual knots. So I'm going to quickly remind you about virtual knot theory. In virtual knot theory, I allow a crossing which is neither over nor under, and it satisfies the usual Reiter Meister moves among itself, and it's allowed to take a detour across an ordinary crossing. In fact, what a virtual crossing is, What a virtual crossing is, it's an indication of something being connected to something else, but not necessarily in the plane. So it's like this. Suppose that you had a knot which was drawn on the surface of a torus or drawn on some higher genus surface, or if you like to say it that way, embedded in a thickening of that surface. In a thickening of that surface. Knots wrapped on surfaces. And I want to say it here as knots wrapped on surfaces because perhaps as the DNA gets wrapped on histones and things like that, one might want to think about long open-ended curves that are wrapped on some surfaces that are related to a biological or molecular situation. So it's natural to study. So it's natural to study knots that are wrapped on surfaces. And if you do study knots that are wrapped on surfaces, why then you can take a projection of the diagram that you have up on the surface into the plane. But when you do, you have to make a discrimination between the weaving that's really on the surface and the weaving that is happening in the planar diagram that actually has to do with lines being across. Lines being across the surface from one another. So we'll call those crossings that hit in the plane virtual crossings. And so it turns out that one can go back and forth appropriately between diagrams with virtual crossings and representations of knots in thickened surfaces. And the going back and forth involves. Going back and forth involves things like taking a neighborhood of the knot in the surface, a ribbon neighborhood like this, and then taking it and flattening it as much as you can, and then taking a nice projection. And then you can go back and forth in a systematic way. Another way of thinking about the virtual crossing is you can think of it as a handle detour. You decided that you were going to put a handle in the plane, so you boosted the genus up by one and you. Is left by one, and you have the knot taking a route through that handle, and the other one is just going on along, and that can be thought of as representative of a virtual crossing. And as I said, the theory of the virtual knots as a diagrammatic theory looks just like the other theory. You have Reidemeister moves, and then you have the flat Reidemeister moves, and you have the basic detour. And you have the basic detour that is allowed. So, having said all that, and I won't worry you about it too much more, we can do the following to an autoid, you see. Instead of taking the underclosure, which would give you a classical knot or the overclosure, we take the virtual closure. And that gives us a mapping from knotoids to virtual knots. And what it means, if you think about the geometry. Means, if you think about the geometry of it, is that the knotoid now has been mapped into a knot which is on a torus. Because you can think of this virtual closure as equivalent to adding a handle to the plane that starts at one endpoint and goes all the way over to the other endpoint, and you just continue the knot up through the handle and back down into the plane. Handle and back down into the plane, and now you're looking at a knot in a torus. And the constraint of having the knot in the torus is very similar to the constraint of not moving anything across the endpoints. And so one can think about the topology of that virtual knot that is related to the nautoid. Well, when you do that, you can get the same thing from two different naughtoids. So, for example, here are two little nautoids. For example, here are two little nautoids, and they're different. I won't go into how I know they're different. That has to do with the labels on them. But they are different. You can't move this nautoid into that nautoid. But if you take the virtual closure, you get the same result in both cases. So it isn't a perfect correspondence, but it is a way of understanding nontoids by understanding the corresponding virtual knots. And furthermore, the virtual Furthermore, the virtual closure map is not surjective. Here is a knot on the torus, which is not the image of any virtual knot. And how we prove that is not a good subject for the last few minutes of this talk. So I will skip that. And I'm going to skip quite a bit here, if you don't mind. But I want to tell you about a basic invariant of nautoids that is not hard to do. That is not hard to do. And that is the generalization of the bracket polynomial to nautoids. The bracket polynomial originally is a model that lets you get the Jones polynomial in a very direct way. And it has a number of different variants, which are useful in virtual knot theory and in notoid theory. Here is the basic bracket polynomial with the usual expansion, the usual skein expansion of smoothing in the two different Expansion of smoothing in the two different ways at a crossing. And then we will take a little unknotted line to be equal to one and a little circle to give a multiplier, which I didn't write down the value for here, but no matter. And you calculate by expanding and getting your answer in that way. It is, in fact, a conjecture that the bracket polynomial detects the unknotted notoid, our conjecture. Our conjecture, and maybe it's true. There are virtual knots with unit Jones polynomial, which the bracket can't see. Again, I don't want to go into that. I'm just giving you a little flavor of how things work here. But the slides will be available in case you want to go further. There are other invariants of natoids, such as a combinatorial polynomial that we like called the affine index polynomial. That we like called the affine index polynomial, and that's really a generalization of the odd ride and not hard to compute. And a generalization of the bracket polynomial that takes into account the oriented and peculiarly disoriented structures that occur when you smooth crossings that are oriented. And again, just not. Again, just not going to do the details here. But a question about nontoids: well, yeah. And then you could have nontoids with vertices, singular vertices or vertices that correspond to protein folding. So here is imagined bonding here happening along this part and bonding happening along this part. And bonding happening along this part, which we can think of as a singular vertex or a graphical vertex in this nautoid. And then we're looking at a folded molecule. And we can get invariants of this of a nautoid kind by expanding the vertex into different ways of removing it. You could just remove the binding, you could put in a tangle, and you can choose to put in some set of. To put in some set of tangles and things that you happen to be interested in, and then compute a sum of invariants across that. And this gives rise to lots of invariants that you can make, some of which may be of use to you, depending on what you had in mind. And then you can think about moves that would extend the moves that you already have to include the singular crossings. The singular crossing. And I'm going to end with one more recent family of invariants that we've been studying. This is a recently published paper, which we call quantum invariance of natoids. And the idea of quantum invariance goes back to the Jones polynomial era as well. You take Era as well, you take the diagram and you set it up with respect to a direction so that it has minima and maxima, and of course the end points. And then every time you go through a minimum, a maximum, or an end point or a crossing, a certain operator comes into play, a linear operator or a matrix, and you amalgamate all that together. You can think of it as the amplitude for a particle to be created from the vacuum and then go back into. From the vacuum and then go back into the vacuum, if you're thinking in terms of the yoga of quantum calculations, but it isn't necessarily restricted to unitarity or anything like that. So it's beyond physics, it's mathematical. But the constraints are that things should be topologically invariant, of course. So then a nautoid would be mapped to a certain kind of abstract tensor, which becomes a certain partition function. Becomes a certain partition function or specific evaluation, depending on what valuations you decided would be the ones that you would choose. And those have to satisfy what corresponds to the Reitemeister moves all over again. So this is a story that is well known in classical mal theory and it generalizes here. And we have quite a large family of invariants that come out of this. That comes out of this. So, there are many questions related to the quantum part, including going on to fancier invariance called categorifications of these polynomials and many questions like that related to algebra and to Vassiliev invariance and so on. And then getting back to our general theme, there are many questions about the closure maps that I've discussed. About the closure maps that I've discussed and questions about the behavior of the Jones polynomial and about how far apart do the end points of the nautoid have to be and whether one can in fact make good link homologies out of the nautoids. And obviously, many, many questions about how to think About how to think about curves in three-dimensional space through this lens and whether the mapping of natoid properties of a curve in three-dimensional space or of a folded protein will be of use in the actuality of scientific practice. So I'll stop there and I hope we have time for a few questions. Thank you very much for the beautiful lecture. So we'll have time for a So we'll have time for maybe a couple of questions and then we can resume at a later time with the working groups. Any questions? Let's see, the first one. This is Ken. Lou, I was distracted here by the delivery of a dinner because it's almost dinner time here. Did you say that this theory of naughtoids can now is equally extended or discussed? Extended or discussed or described for links for multiple components? Oh, yes, you can, certainly. You can have as many endpoints as you like, and you can have closed loop components also. Do you have a reference for that? Well, we discuss that point in our paper. And in most of the papers, And in most of the papers that are being written, examples arise in which we may be considering that. I think, I'm sure that Turayev himself mentions the fact that you could have multi-nautoids. There's no problem with it. It's just easy to concentrate on a single pair of endpoints in many cases.
