Thank you very much. Can you hear me well? Yes. Okay, great. Well, first of all, I would like to thank the organizers of this very nice conference, to thank Pedro, Bruno, Mateo, and Mateo for the kind invitation to speak here. It is a pleasure to be here today. I'm going to talk about stability properties. About stability properties of traveling fronts, traveling front solutions to reaction diffusion equations for which the non-linear diffusion coefficient is degenerate. And the main idea that I want to communicate in this talk is methodological. I mean, I would like to speak about some spectral techniques that can be extrapolated perhaps to the case of systems, which remains open. Systems which remains open. I hope you find it interesting. Okay, so this is joint work with Paco Leiba, my former PhD student. He's now working at the Penemerita University of Puebla and Luis Fernando Lopez-Rios from my department from EMAS. So let's start with the model. The simplest model is a scalar reaction diffusion equation. scalar reaction diffusion equation, the typical one, the standard one in one space dimension, but with the particularity that the density dependent non-linear diffusion coefficient is degenerate. And f of u, the other non-linear function involved, is the reaction or production term. So this is the simplest case, this is the scalar equation. Equation and the idea is to develop some techniques and later to extrapolate these two systems. So let's talk first about the reaction functions that we considered. The first one is of Fischer-KPP type, which is the typical monostable reaction function in which you have two equilibrium points. One of them is stable, the other one is unstable. And the typical example is a logistic. And the typical example is a logistic function. So it models the production term in a population model, for example, with limited resources. So the population starts to grow exponentially at first and then stabilizes into some carrying capacity. The second reaction function that we consider is called Nagumo, also known as bistable Alenkan, etc., in which you have In which you have two equilibrium points and a third one, which is unstable. So you have two stable equilibria could be taken as one or zero, and one unstable equilibrium point in the middle. The typical example is a cubic reaction that models the L effect in which you have a threshold value above which population grows and below which population decays. So these models. So these models in particular how a population can interact and help to survive in a community. Okay, so in this conference, there's no need to introduce these density-dependent degenerative diffusions. I mean, this is even in the title of the workshop. So you know that in many situations, In many situations, for example, in physics and engineering, there are many models in which the diffusion coefficient should be density dependent. There are many applications. One of them, one of the most important, is the Polaris medium equation, which is a degenerate diffusion coefficient because it vanishes at zero, for example. And there are other models, for example, in binary alloys, thermal grouping, etc. Thermal grouping, etc. In biology, they are important as well because the diffusion coefficient is related to the motility. So, the motility, for example, in bacterial aggregation models, as we have heard in previous talks, is also density dependent, but also vanishes at some value of the density, usually zero. Okay, so this. Okay, so this is in order to fix ideas. We're going to consider non-linear density-dependent coefficients that vanish at one point. This is going to be zero, for example. The rest of the domain is going to be positive. This is a fourth assumption that is not necessary. I mean, this is just for technical reasons. That means that d prime at zero is also positive. Obviously, this is not satisfied. Satisfied by the polarized medium equation, but this can be taken into account with extra bookkeeping in analysis. I mean, this is not necessary, it's just a fixed idea. One example from biology is this she has had a function modeling dispersive effects of mutual interference in which you have degeneracy at zero, zero motility for zero population. zero population. So what are the mathematical features associated to nonlinear diffusion? Well, in general, you have a finite speed of propagation of initial disturbances for the solutions of these equations. And in the context of traveling fronts, you see the emergence of traveling fronts of sharp type, which are important in applications. From the technical viewpoint, you have lots of Viewpoint, you have loss of hyperbolicity of the associated ODE describing a wave at the degenerate point. So what are the traveling fronts? As you know, traveling fronts are traveling wave solutions that have this form. They can be expressed in terms of a profile function phi, which is a function of one variable, and depending on the Galilean variable of translation, which is x minus ct, c being the wave speed. C being the wave speed. So this profile function satisfies an ODE determined by the PDE, and you prescribe asymptotic limits at plus or minus infinity. Usually these asymptotic limits are equilibrium points of the reaction. For example, can be zero or one in the Fischer-KPP case, zero, one, or alpha in the bice table case. So the existence theory of the generate fronts, I call Of the generate fronds, I call them the generic fronds because they reach at the generate point of the diffusion, it's very vast. I mean, there are many works. I call upon your attention to the works of Philip Meini and Faustino Sánchez-Garduno. They apply dynamical systems techniques, central manifold, etc., to prove the existence of these traveling fronts. There are many other There are many other techniques, Conley index or integral equation techniques by Gilding and Kirsner, etc. And I'm going to be, our analysis is based on the works by Maioni and Sánchez-Garduno. For example, in the Fischer-KPP case, you have the existence of a sharp front, that is, the existence of a critical speed C star. Critical speed C star for which you have a sharp front, which is of is not of class C1, and then a family of monotone smooth fronts for every speed greater than C star. So this is in the Fischer-KPP case. These fronts connect one, which is the saturation density, and zero, which is the degenerate point. In the Nagumo case, there are more fronts. The situation complicates a little bit because you have an A little bit because you have a new equilibrium point. So, Maini and Sanchez Garduna, for example, proved that there is a unique critical speed, C star, which is between zero and C bar. C bar is a typical Nagumo speed that you are familiar with. It's two times the square root of D F prime, right? And there is a family of smooth monotone fronts traveling with the speed C greater than C bar, but there are even Even degenerate fronts which are stationary with the speed t equals zero, and there are many other combinations, for example, non-degenerate fronts connecting one and alpha, which is non-degenerate, and this increasing monotone front connecting zero, which is a degenerate point, and alpha. And there are even also oscillatory profiles in the middle. So the situation is more complicated. More complicated. There is a lot of works in the literature concerning behavior of solutions to reaction diffusion degenerate equations. But this is a bridge list of references, but these works pertain mainly to the attractiveness of sharp fronts with respect to solutions to these equations with initial conditions with a certain problem. Conditions with certain properties. For example, Bilot and Medvedev and collaborators proved that in the case of porous medium carbon fusion in the Fischer-KPP case, if you have initial data compactly supported, they evolve towards the front, the sharp front with a critical speed C star. Camin and Rossonau extended this to the case of fast decaying initial data. Even though some of the works here Though some of the works here have stability in the title, this is not the stability that we are interested in. I mean, what they do is to consider compactly supported, for example, initial condition for the equation, and then as t goes to infinity, the solution evolves into the sharp front. What we're interested in is in the stability of the traveling front as a solution to the PD. So, in this case, what we have to do is to perturb the To do is to perturb the traveling front and then see how this new initial condition evolves in time. So, what we expect is to have an initial condition that cannot be compactly supported because it has to be a perturbation of the profile and the profile has an asymptotic limit equal to one, for example, in minus infinity in this picture. And then what we expect is to have this solution evolving into a translation of the traveling wave. Of the traveling wave. So, in this case, the literature on the stability of this traveling front is very scarce. I don't know these two works besides our work. These are the only ones that I know. A first paper by Hosono in the 86, they consider the Nagumo reaction, I mean the bistable reaction, and the porous medium diffusion, and he applies comparison principle techniques. Applies comparison principle techniques, I mean super and subsolutions, in order to prove that for initial data close to the sharp front, then the asymptotic converges to a translated sharp front. There is a very new, brand new preprint by Anne-Lorge Dalibak and her PhD students. They consider a polis-medium equation with generalized fissure-KPP reaction, and they proved non-linear stability in L2 weighted energy space of smooth fronts. Weighted energy space of smooth fronts. This is a particular diffusion, it's porous medium, but they go all the way to the non-linear stability result, and they actually use the weighted energy norm that we proposed. This is a very interesting paper. It's very new. Okay, so these are the two works that I want to talk about. In the first one, we studied Fischer-KPP reaction. Fischer-KPP reaction, stability of smooth fronts. And in the second one, we studied the Nahumo reaction case, again, stability of smooth fronts. Our analysis is different from the other works. I mean, the natural thing to do is to consider maximum principles for scalar equations. Our analysis focuses on spectral instability techniques. So these techniques are related to the spectral theory of the operator linearizer on the wave. The operator linearizer on the wave. The idea is to generate some new methodology that can be extrapolated to systems. So, this is set into the general program in which you prove spectral stability, and then you use this information in order to prove later on linear or even non-linear stability. Okay, so let's start with the setup of the problem. So, as usual, you have your solution traveling from solution. Your solution, traveling front solution, and your linear as the equation around the front. So now in the following slides, x will be regarded as a Galilean variable, x minus ct. This is a views of notation. But if you consider perturbations of the form exponential of lambda t and u x when u in a proper appropriate banach space, then you have a natural spectral problem. So you have a linearized operator. Is the linearized operator around? Is a linearized operator around the traveling front acting on a banach space. Usually, in the theory of stability of traveling waves, you work with L2 perturbations, which means perturbations with finite energy and decaying at plus or minus infinity. So these are localized perturbations. So you have, for example, in the case of a densely defined closed linear operator between two banana spaces, the natural definition. The natural definition of spectrum and resolvent resolvent is defined as a set of all complex numbers for which L minus lambda is invertible and the inverse is bounded. It's a boundary operator and the spectrum is the rest in the complex plane. So you say that the traveling front is X spectrally stable when you compute this spectrum with respect to certain Banach space X. This slide is perhaps the most important of my talk because what we Because what we did is to propose this partition of the spectrum. So the spectrum is going to be partitioned into three disjoint components. The first one, we call it the extended point spectrum, is the set of complex values for which L minus lambda is not injective. The delta spectrum is going to be the set of points for which L minus lambda. The set of points for which L minus lambda is injective, the range of L minus lambda is close, this is very important, and the range is not the whole codomain. And the next one is the one for which L minus lambda is injected, but the range is not closed. Okay, so the observation is the following. In the typical analysis of a spectral stability, what you use is biased. What you use is vials partition of the spectrum. The essential spectrum is the set for which L minus lambda is either not a Fred Home operator or the index is different from zero. And the point spectrum is the points for which L minus lambda is a Fred Home operator with index zero, but it has a non-trivial kernel. This is a very easy to compute partition of the spectrum, mainly because the fronts have asymptotic. That the fronts have asymptotic hyperbolic states. So, in our case, we called the point spectrum as the extended point spectrum, which is a subset of the vial point spectrum. And usually, lambda equal to zero always belongs to the point spectrum because you have a translation eigenvalue associated to the degree of freedom that you have by translating a traveling wave. The eigenfunction is the derivative of the profile. function is the derivative of the profile. In our case, this pi spectrum is contained in what is called the approximate spectrum. And the approximate spectrum is defined as those of complex values for which you can find a sequence in the domain, which is with a norm equal to one and L minus lambda u n tends to zero. And in our case, this holds because the In our case, this holds because the range is not close, so you can extract a vial sequence. This is important in the proof. The delta spectrum is contained in the compression spectrum because when you compress and you close a range, in our case it's already closed, this is not the colon, the whole colony. So why this partition of the spectrum? This partition of the spectrum that we introduce is designed to overcome the difficulties associated to the degeneracy at zero. So in the typical, in the standard In the typical standard theory, what you have is a first-order system. You rewrite your equation as a first-order system. And in the strictly parabolic setting, for example, the asymptotic limits are hyperbolic. And you can compute the bile essential spectrum very easily. For example, in the constant diffusion problem, you rewrite the spectral equation as a first-order system, you compute asymptotic limits of these coefficients, and what you have is a set. Have is a set of hyperbolic matrices. This have no center in space. So the freton properties of the operator are the same as the phreton properties of these first order operators. And you can compute the essential spectrum very, very easily. In our case, since we have a degenerate problem, this hyperbolicity is lost. Okay, so the idea of our technique is to first to take a parabolic regularization, I mean, to add I mean, to add perturbation with Laplacian, right, in order to make it parabolic, strictly parabolic, and then compute the essential spectrum, devise the essential spectrum, and then take the limit when epsilon goes to zero. The problem is that when you take the limit when epsilon goes to zero, some points in the essential spectrum escape, and you cannot control them. You can only control some of them for which the range is. Some of them for which the range is already closed. So that is why you have to divide the central spectrum into these two components: the delta spectrum and the pi spectrum. The pi spectrum is controlled using bi sequences, and the stability of the point spectrum is based on weighted energy estimates. And the spectral stability that we can achieve with these techniques is on a weighted exponentially weighted space. Exponentially weighted space, okay, and you can compute it by conjugation. So, if you consider the conjugated operator multiplying by exponential of a of x, you penalize how fast decay is the perturbation at plus or minus infinity, then the point spectrum is invariant under conjugation. That doesn't happen for the essential or I mean for the rest of the spectrum, the essential spectrum. Okay, so these are the main reasons. Okay, so these are the main results that we have in these works. For a monoton traveling front, a smooth front, in the case of Fisher KPP, if the speed is greater than a certain threshold value, then you can find an exponentially weighted space, L2, in which the front is L2A spectral state. In the case of the Nagumo fronts, all of All of them, or the whole family that travel faster than the threshold value, are spectrally stable in a certain exponentially weighted energy space. So, let me, in the five minutes that I have left, let me give you a panoramic overview of how the proof goes. So, as I mentioned, you have three sets that comprise the whole spectrum. So, for the delta spectrum, you use a parabolic regularization technique. Use a parabolic regularization technique and take the limit when the regularization parameter tends to zero. And then you use that information to choose the weight that you need in order to achieve stability. The second part is a control of the pi spectrum and you use singular or vial sequences. And the third part is to control the point spectrum using weighted energy estimates. So the regularization technique means simply that your diffusion means simply that your diffusion, which is degenerate, you add a certain epsilon parameter. So you have a regularized conjugator operator, which is strictly parabolic. And in this case, it's strictly elliptic. And then you define the region of consistent splitting, which is a half space, the real part of lambda greater than some number that includes the resolving set. And first, you prove that for every positive epsilon, the operators are fretted with index zero. Here, the hyperbolicity of the endpoints, which is already true because of the parabolicity, is fundamental. So you use while essential spectrum term plus exponential dichotomies, etc. And then you prove that for each fixed value of lambda, these operators converge. Lambda, these operators converge in generalized sense to the unregularized, I mean the original operator. This is in the sense of cato, okay? So you have to use the distance of between the graphs of the two operators, and this distance goes to zero. This is convergence in the generalized sense. Then you apply classical Katos stability theorem to locate the delta spectrum. And in these cases, this is very important, and the range is close. Is very important and the range is close because it's part of the assumptions of CATO stability theorem. So, with this information, you can locate the delta spectrum, and then you choose A appropriately in order to stabilize it. For example, in the case of the Fisher-KPP, A has to be between this, in this interval, and as a consequence, you stabilize the delta spectrum. In the case of the pi spectrum, In the case of the pi spectrum, you use while sequences. If you write the operator in general form, this b2 is precisely the diffusion coefficient evaluated at the front, okay? And these coefficients depend on A, as usual. Then, since the range is not closed, then you can extract a singular sequence. If you work in a reflexive space, this singular sequence converges weakly to zero, and then you can extract a sub-sequence such that Such that this sequence tends to zero in L2 lock. This is by application of Relish-Kondrashov compactness theorem. So with this information, and given that your coefficients have independently of the general diffusion, have some asymptotic limits, then you concentrate, let's say, the mass into an interval, a compact interval, in which you apply your. In which you apply your bile singular sequence property and then take the limit when n goes to infinity. And in this fashion, you can obtain a bound for lambda and you stabilize the pi spectrum. Finally, the point spectral stability. So in this case, for each fixed lambda in the point spectrum, you have an eigenfunction. You have a solution to your spectral problem. So the idea here is to use this spectral. So the idea here is to use this spectral transformation. You write w equals this exponential function times u. And then you can prove that for the appropriate a that you chose in the previous step, for every lambda in the set of consistent splitting, if u is an eigenfunction that solves your spectral equation, then this w also is in h2 and satisfies. And satisfies some modified spectral equation. This is a lot of work, actually. This is not trivial because you need detailed information about the decay structure of the eigenfunctions u and on the traveling fronts. So, for example, in the case of the featured KPP, you don't have exponential decay of the front, so you have to use central manifold techniques. This involves Manifold techniques, this involves a lot of work. But it can be done in the two cases that I mentioned. With this information, then you can apply the same lemma to the translation eigenvalue lambda equal to zero with eigenfunction like this. And then the transform eigenfunction satisfies this equation. You combine This equation, you combine energy estimates on both equations, use monotonicity of the front to obtain this actually this equality. So this means that not only that lambda is real, but also is stable. So if lambda is in the point spectrum and in the set of consistent splitting, you obtain from this energy estimate that the real part of lambda is less or equal than zero. Lambda is less or equal than zero. If it's not in the consistent splitting, that is already automatically in real part of lambda negative. So this implies point spectral instability. I call upon your attention to this energy here, this weighted energy norm, which is actually the L2 norm of the square root of B evaluating in the front times U. This is, in my opinion, the right norm that encodes the degeneracy of the front. The degeneracy of the front. So it causes all the information that you need. And this is the norm that was used by Talibart and collaborators in order to prove non-linear stability in the particular case of the porous medium equation. Okay, so with this slide, I end up my talk, and I thank you for your kind attention. Thank you very much, everyone, for this nice talk. Can you hear me well? Yeah, there's no noise behind or something. Okay, great. Is there any question? Probably I just have a quick question. So you're studying this. I have seen some works about the like stellar analysis of this type of equation by the microscopy. This type of equation, but at the microscopic level, so methoscopic level, let's say, like the kinetic transfer equations with some reaction term. Have you done some work on that direction? No, no, no, we have not. Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay. I was just wondering if, because you know, like there, when you do a, when you perform a scaling on time and space, then you can obtain the microscope equations. So I was just wondering if you had some. No, no, we have not. Okay, okay, okay, good, good. Yeah, so is there any question so far? So, okay, so Lynn, let's thank again, Ramon. Thank you very much, Ramon, for your nice talk. Thank you very much.
