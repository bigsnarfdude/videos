Personally, I've been given more online talks than in-person talks and what that. So it's a pleasure to be here listening. I'll be talking about work in progress with Man Sanders Ekran, Net Anglo-Hart, and Sebastian Pachetti. And the outline of my talk is very simple. In the introduction, I'll give some background and motivation for the computation of a specific quantity in quantum gravity. Quantity in quantum gravity. This quantity is the free energy. And in the second part, I'll be explaining a general prescription for how to compute this quantity, taking into account contributions to the gravitational path integral from Euclidean walls. And then, as an unwritten rule in quantum gravity these days, anything you do, you have to apply to JT, otherwise, no one cares. So we then went ahead and So we then went ahead and tried to apply this prescription to JT. And this is going to be an open-ended story because this is a work in progress. But I hope I'll leave you intrigued and looking forward to stay tuned. In the discussion, I'll give some of the near-term goals that we're pursuing and also some of the questions that will remain and would like to pursue in the future. Soon in the future. Okay. So, in recent years, we've been learning a lot about quantum gravity from this mysterious object, which is a gravitational path integral. We usually think of it as some integral over metrics and generally over manifolds of different topology, subject to boundary conditions. Say here, for example, the boundary conditions would be some manifold B, which could be connected or disconnected.   I guess we lost audio. Okay, so I don't know if that perspectives satisfactory. We're good? Okay, so these computing some sort of partition function, and I'm being vague here because we don't quite understand the details of what kind of partition function function is. The details of what kind of partition function this is computing, and this is related, for example, to the ensemble average story that Alex discussed before. And so usually the rich properties that the gravitational path integral has are related to the fact that we can include connected topologies when we perform this path integral over metrics. These are some crucial consequences. These have some crucial consequences in some of the recent discussions. In particular, a remarkable one is that these connected topologies give contributions to the von Lyman entropy that are able to recover the unitary H curve of black hole vaporization. But they also raise some puzzles like the factorization problem, where when you are considering a priori decoupled CFTs, but you ask about a holographic computation of the gravitational path integral, you seem to Gravitational path integral, you seem to run into a non-factorization issue. There's another interesting object that was looked at by Engel Harficheti and Maloney in a recent paper or last year, considering free energies in quantum gravity, where you can also see that there's an interesting and important role that long holes play, a simple and perhaps compelling argument to see. Perhaps a compelling argument to see why workballs should contribute to such a quantity is that if you're looking at Reni entropies for a pure state, you should expect an identical vanishing of all the Rennies. And the only way you can possibly get that all orders is by considering or taking into account contributions from replica wormholes or from Euclidean wormholes to the free energy, not only to the volume or the Remy entropies. So the way that we can distinguish whether we are accounting for or not, whether we're accounting for replicable orbitals or not in a computation of a free energy is by talking about two different objects, which are the annealed and quantum free energies. And for a moment, let me take the or use the language of ensemble average, and even though I'm not a theory in a particular interpretation for a gravitational path integral. Gravitational path integral. But let me talk about the anneal free energy as the situation in which you consider an average over theories before you compute the logarithm that gives you the free energy. This is a situation in which we would be allowing for the random variables in our ensemble to equilibrate, or that's the language that we would use in condensed matter theory. And in the Point's case, what we are doing is not allowing for the random variables to equilibrate. For the random variables to culibrate, but computing the free energies of every member of the ensemble and then averaging over all of those. Now, the interesting object for us will be precisely the second one, the quantum free energy. And now the question becomes, it's easy to compute the annual free energy, right? We have already defined what we mean by the partition function. But what do we mean by this overlined algorithm of z? Of Z. And so that's the question that in this paper Netta, Sebastian, and Alex trying to attack, which is how does the gravitational path integral compute this logarithm? We can make uses of a simple mathematical identity, which tells us that the logarithm can be computed in this limit. This might be reminiscent of replica tricks. Tricks, except there's a key difference with the replica trick for the Leyman entropy. Here, this limit is going to m equals zero, not to n equals one. And it's in that sense that I'm calling it that null replica trick. This is a much more subtle limit because we don't have the privilege of working near n equals one geometries or theories where we have some control. But we are taking a limit to m equals zero, which is a rather Which is a rather obscure corner. Now, a natural thing you could try to compute then the overline logarithm is to just take overlines on both sides of this equality. On the right-hand side, what you have then is a gravitational path integral with a replicated boundary, replicated boundary conditions. And in principle, you're done, right? You just have to take the limit, m goes to zero, and you're going to compute the quench. And you're going to compute the quenched free energy that you are after. The problem is, this is not a well-defined procedure. This analytic continuation is not unique. So in general, there's no Causal theorem here that is going to guarantee uniqueness or anything. So the answer we'll get will be, at the very least, ambiguous and potentially unphysical. So we need to do better and to find some more general prescription for how to compare. General prescription for how to compute free energies. So that's where we are going to head now. And the way I'm going to try to remove this ambiguity of the analytic continuation is by going to a regime over which I have a little bit more control, which is a classical regime. If I'm talking about ADFCFT, this is a limit of large N, where I'm basically suppressing complicated contributions to the path integral in JT. Contribution to the path integral in Jt, there will be a S not large, in which case we then suppress higher genus contributions to the path integral. And once we are going to this classical regime, there's a natural assumption we can make, which is to assume replica symmetry of the configurations. Essentially, we are constraining the path integral to replica symmetric manifolds. Of course, it's logically possible that replica symmetry is broken by replica symmetry is broken by solutions, by saddle point solutions, even though the boundary condition is respected. But that's something that we have to live with. And this is basically what Lucoit's Manelcina taught us how to do or how to exploit in order to perform an analytic continuation to real number of replicas. Once we assume replica symmetry, we can take a quotient and work with a quotient theory and with quotient manifolds. And with quotient manifolds, we just account for the pre-quotient geometry in the form of conical defects that appear after quotient. Once we are in the quotient theory, conical defects don't have any preference for particular choices of opening angles or excess angles. So we can take a continuation to M real. And so that's the approach that we are going to do, we are going to take, which is work with. Which is work with quotient theories so that we have a well-defined continuation. In particular, the gravitational pattern growth and the classical limit will localize to saddle points. And so the way we are going to compute this average log or overline log is to just localize to the saddle point. Then the evaluation of the action for the replicated manifold would be equal to just. replicated manifold would be equal to just m times the action for the quotient manifold which we don't include contributions from mechanical effects and so on and then the limit just becomes an evaluation of the action for the m equals zero cycle or rather you might want to keep the limit there in case this is not such an obvious object to deal with um just as a an observation Observation: The situation that we would encounter if we were computing the annealed free energy here. In other words, if we were not accounting for replicable wormholes, but just considering these connected phases, what we would get here would be the action of just a standard m equals one geometry. So, a priori, it looks like we're going to very easily get different answers if we compute this quantity, the anneal quantity or the Quantity, the annual quantity, or the quantity, so long as we have contributions from replica or a wormholes that are dominated. Okay, now there are a couple of interesting aspects about this. You might say, okay, this is nothing but the usual LM recipe. So what are you doing here that is new? I'll say that there's something remarkable here, which is that if you order the names of the authors in the appropriate way, it is actually. Authors in the appropriate way, there's a sanction of the chef recipe. So I think it sounds a lot better than the Ellen recipe. But if you don't want to buy that, let me say something that I believe is more intriguing, which is the privileged role that this prescription is given to the M goes to zero saddles. At least I haven't encountered a situation in which n equals zero saddles become important for any reason, but here the Them, but here they seem to be even the answer to what is the quenched what is the form of quenched generating functional in quantum gravity. And so I believe this tells us that these are important or interesting features that we should try to understand better. The prescription works for any theory in principle, so it's now a matter of trying to explore it more in depth and theories that we can handle. That we can handle. And the simplest theory I can think of, and we could think of, of course, is JT. That doesn't mean it's simple, but it's the simplest we could find. So that's where we're going to head next. Let me first give a brief review of what the geometric picture of JT is. When we perform the path and roll over the dildon, we localize The dildon, we localize the geometric part of the path integral onto Riemann surfaces of constant negative curvature. If we are further localized into just replica symmetric configurations, then the situation for replica computations of geometries gives us very few possibilities. If we are computing a trying to find geometries for, say, M replicas, For say M replicas, we will have just two options: either a connected phase or a disconnected phase. The disconnected phase will consist of just M disks, one for each boundary. The connected phase will consist of a fully connected wormhole of this sort, which by replica symmetry will have the same size of every throat. And in general, when computing the coincident free energy, in order to get interesting results, we will. In order to get interesting results, we will hope that it is the latter, the connected phase that dominates, so that we get interesting results that differ from anneal quantities. And so that's the kind of configuration we're going to focus on. And I'm going to forget for now about this contributions. Now, when we take the quotient of a geometry like this, what we get is something that is conformally is conformally related to just a ponchara disk with two conformal sorry with two conical defects the defects have an opening angle which is given by two pi over m and the way the throat sizes or the yeah as i should have mentioned the connected phase has a one parameter family of modulus which is given by the proper length proper size of the throat Proper size of the throat that gets translated into the quotient geometry, into a proper distance between the defects. Now, as you probably know about JT, JT doesn't like saddle points. You know, pure JT doesn't have any interest in saddle points for any number of replicas greater or equal to two. For m greater or equal to three, you don't even have solutions. Greater or equal to three, you don't even have solutions for the dilaton, or m equals two. You might have a solution for the dilaton, but then you cannot stabilize the modulus. In other words, the double trumpet wants to shrink to zero size. So in principle, it's tricky to expect anything interesting about subtle points for pure GT, but there's nothing preventing us from trying to look at the Portian geometry picture and look for solutions in JT gravity. In particular, Gravity, in particular for solutions or situations with where m is non-integer, which in principle are not explored. So that's what we're going to do now. And in either case, it will serve as a warm up for what we will do next. Okay, so since we want to evaluate actions, let me write the action for JT. Take is a familiar form where we can easily begin by evaluating some terms. Begin by evaluating some terms like out one net the topological term because it's just an Euler character, and then the path integral over the dilaton localizes them to constant negative curvatures, so we get pretty much rid of all the pre all the terms except for the last one. And all the interesting dynamics about JT lie on these boundary terms. The usual way we handle or keep interesting dynamics in JT gravity is by imposing a specific choice of boundary conditions. In a specific choice of boundary conditions, we basically define a cutoff boundary by a level set of the dilaton and prescribe that the proper length of this cutoff boundary, or rather a ratio with the value of the dilaton, be fixed to be beta. And beta usually becomes the inverse temperature. This curve now becomes the dynamical object, and the description of the The description of the dynamics of this wiggle is what is going to give us the interesting behavior in JT. Those of you who are familiar with the story in JT, the kind of action that you get as a description for this wiggle, this is for Shan action. In our case, because we are working with general n and not just, say, n equals one or n equals two, we break some symmetry, we're going to have u1 symmetry, and so we get a slightly richer theory that we'll see. I'm calling this interacting torsion. Calling this interacting version just because we get some extra terms, not just this version. Since we are just interested in this boundary term, let me introduce some metric where we only care about the near asymptotic behavior. Here is C is some kind of radial elliptic coordinate. And the sub-leading term is the one that will be preserved. Preserving some interesting properties about the geometry, in particular the modulus, A, which here will be the proper distance between the defects, and also the actual size of the conical defects, which is encoded in M. When you did the exercise of parametrizing the wheel by some angular diffeomorphism between circles, here phi, the result you get is. The result you get is, as I promised, something like a short term plus an extra term. And that extra term is basically encoding this extra interaction, if you like, of the dylaton with the geometry where we've put it in. For n equals one and n equals two, you recover the usual fact that you just get the short term alone. But more generally, you do not. You get something extra. Extra. And now that we have the action for the wiggle, we can obtain the equations of motion. The wiggle equations of motion look complicated, but it turns out quite amazingly that if you plug in some patients, you can get solutions and you can evaluate the action. And so that's what I'm going to show you next, which is the evaluation of the action for wiggle solutions. Action for wiggle solutions for arbitrary values of A and M. It looks like this. The expression is not too complicated, but if you look at the title, you might be afraid of what is going on. Let me first at least say that this expression recovers usual known results for m equals one. You don't get any dependence on the modulus that's expected because there's actually no conical defects. So the proper distance. No conical defects, so the proper distance between them doesn't mean anything. For n equals two, you also get a standard result that you get some dependence on the proper distance between the defects, which is related to the size of the throats. And now that I've told you kind of the reasonable parts of this object, let me show you the insane parts of this object. So here I'm showing you the action that I have here as a function. As a function of n for some choice of proper distance and some choice of beta. What I'm showing here, the red line is the actual value of the action if you evaluate it on actual solutions for the wiggle. What I'm showing in blue is other branches of the inverse arcsage. So that you at least have some idea of why this red line looks the way it looks. Looks the way it looks, looks like a frame wreck. And the reason this is worrisome is that as we go to n equals zero, we're actually getting a divergently negative action. That would seem to say that for some reason, connected topologies are going to dominate regardless of anything, and also with an infinitely negative action. But in fact, if you look at the stability of the Wiggle solution. Solution, what you find is that all the solutions that we were looking at are actually unstable for m smaller than one. We can show this in this plot. These are the eigenvalues of the stability operator, by which I mean the operator on quadratic deformations away from solutions of the wiggle. And so the eigenvalues are all negative for n smaller than one. So there's no need to worry. The problem here is simply. The problem here is simply that we don't have stable tiles for m smaller than one. So, pure DT is not something that's going to give us something interesting enough for our description. Plus, the modulus is also not stabilized, but that's the least of our problems here. Okay, so we don't have to lose hope. So, we can try to see what happens if I take JT and add matter to it. Can we get an interesting subtle point that we can? Can we get an interesting subtle point that we can track towards n equals zero and get interesting quantities? So let me add the simplest form of matter we can think of, which is just a scalar field that is massless. The simplicity of these kind of matter will allow us to basically integrate the whole matter and express it as a boundary integral in terms of a boundary profile. In terms of a boundary profile, that we are free to choose. Was your previous instability compatible with computing the average of logs in a matrix model or something? Sorry, can you repeat that? Was it compatible, this divergence and effect, with computing the average of logs in or in the matrix model? What I would say, I mean, in principle, I mean, in principle, JT doesn't even have saddle points for even for integer m's. So the saddle point approximation doesn't just doesn't make sense. You need to perform some complete path integral. Yeah, that's not something you tried. We didn't try it. So in fact, that's something that I think we could try, which is I projected onto replica symmetric configurations and so on, but I could. On, but I could presumably still consider an integral over wiggles in this geometry and also an integral over the modulus and see whether what I get sensible or not. Because all the assumptions that would go into that would just be replica symmetry. And I think that's an interesting thing to try to look at. And we have not, but yes, I think it's So we just tried to focus on finding subtle points for simplicity, but we'll definitely try to pursue that. And so in the search for saddle points, that's why we treat this matter. You can get the action for the scalar to be just a boundary term. This is convenient because we already have a boundary treatment of the wiggle. So it's good to have all the action in the wiggle, in the boundary. Here, S. Here, S, well, final is some binary profile that we specify for the scalar field. We are free to choose that. We're introducing scalar sources. S is just some integral kernel. Looks ugly, but we know it explicitly. And so now we get a modified equation of motion, right? We get some interaction between the dilaton, sorry, some interaction of the wiggle with the matter that we introduced. And now this equation looks a lot more complicated than the... Looks a lot more complicated than the previous one because we have an integral differential equation, and that's not something we're going to be able to solve just by hand. And we'll have to use some numerics. Perhaps the appearance of this non-local term is not surprising. Basically, in JT, what we have is that the level sets of the dilettant specify where the battery is. The interaction of the scalar with the dilaton will change where the boundary lies. But where the boundary lies will also determine where we're imposing the boundary conditions. So that kind of explains at least heuristically why we get such a non-local term in the equations and motion here. But anyway, we can try just to attack this numerically. And so let me do that beginning with some m that is not too crazy. That is not too crazy, n equals 2. And so for n equals 2, we already see some super language. For pure JT, as I said before, n equals 2 cannot even be stabilized for the modulus. Here, it turns out we do obtain a saddle for the modulus. Here, I'm showing a plot of the action against the modulus, the proper length, or rather, you can think of this as an inverse, is related to an inverse of the properties length. Related to an inverse of the proper lamp. And so if I have zero amplitude for the scalar profile, well, no saddles. As I increase the amplitude of the scalar, this is looking better. Looks like it wants to develop a saddle. And indeed, it develops a saddle. So we get saddles for the modulus as we increase the scalar profile. This is because of the competition between the topological term and the contribution for the scalar. And the contribution for the skater. And so now the question is: okay, we get these variants too, but we're interested in a place far away from that, which is m smaller than one. So the question is, will these saddles of the modulus survive that journey? And the answer is yes. Surprisingly, the answer is yes. And here's where I'm introducing you to the legal setup that could. Introducing you to the little saddle that could. We were super happy when we found this object because it means that we have a theory and a setting in which we have saddle points for n smaller than one that we can travel the way down to n quiltago. We find two branches of solutions for the wheel for n smaller than one. One is stable, one is unstable. This is the action for the two branches. This is the action for the two branches. Again, modulus. So we see that there's a saddle in the branch on the bottom. Importantly, the branch on the bottom is precisely the stable one. Here's the stability analysis of the eigenvalues as in some previous plot. So the positive eigenvalues are precisely those for the lower branch. So we see we have some saddle here. Importantly, we also find that this saddle can be made. These saddle can be made to dominate against the disconnected phase. So we suggest that we are going to get interesting results for the quenched quantities. And okay, these plots are for n equals 0.75, but we can do the exercise of tracking this saddle down to smaller values of m and see whether it survives because in the end we want to take over the limit and goes to zero. So this is a picture as we. So, this is a picture as before. We see that the little saddle has been spotted there. It's been spotted at 0.7, same 0.65. It seems to stay strong as we go to M smaller. Here we have it up to M equals 0.55. And the story ends there because we haven't had time to continue this. But hopefully, we can continue tracking the legal saddle and see if it can make it. Osaro and see if it can make it to m equals zero. So before you go on to the discussion, I have a question: was m equals 0.75 the first place you found it as you were going down? Oh, no, you can find it for larger m. So does it seem to exist starting just below one or does it seem like it exists only for some general limit? So m equals one is a very special place where, for instance, the modulus doesn't matter. For instance, the modulus doesn't matter, so you get no dependence on it. I believe this particular saddle exists as soon as you go to a smartphone. Sebastian says, yes. Yes. So yeah, okay. Okay, so in the near future, of course, we want to be able to do that. In the near future, of course, we want to keep tracking the saddle down to an equal zero. It's not a super complicated exercise, but we should be able to do. If it survives all the way to angle zero, we expect it will, then we would like to analyze what the coin generating functional that we get can teach us. In particular, it'd be interesting to compare it to the anneal result because effectively what we're going to do. Effectively, what we're finding is that the generating functional really is receiving contributions from these connected topologies, and the results are going to differ. And we can then ask what are the effects that these contributions have on scalar correlation functions. So those are questions that seem to be in the scope of what we've been analyzing in this model. We've been analyzing in this model. But more generally, there are more broader open questions about what these quenched generating functionals mean, what they look like, what properties they have in quantum gravity. And so some of the questions that we would like to attack in the future are the following. It seems like a difficult exercise to go all the way to n equals zero. M equals zero, and to know whether interesting saddles will dominate in that process, you'd be nice to know if there's a way of anticipating whether the quenched results for the generating functional will differ significantly from the anneal ones. It would also be good to explore whether there's a correlation between dominance of connected geometries for m integer and m smaller than one. This is because M smaller than one. This is because we know that connected topologies are interesting for the computation of the vonyman entropy of Rennie entropies. Is there a correlation between when those wormholes dominate and when wormholes dominate for the quenched free energy or quench generated functional? As I said before, the m goes to zero limit seems very obscure. Can we get some universal properties of what this object looks like in a general theory? In a general theory, that would be great. And perhaps a way forward would be to just investigate other toy models that could teach us additional properties that may not be obvious from just looking at JT. And I'll end there. Thank you very much. Questions? Let's first start with the personal audience. Front of the person audience. So, this is kind of an extension of your first question, or maybe a basic version of it. When they differ, what does that mean physically? Well, it's just an engineeric system. What does it mean when the clinched versus a nail and saddles differ? Stick. I mean, at the level of the subtles, is which geometry wants to contribute? For example, in JT, it would be whether you have this punk error disk with defects or just a punker disk because they're in the disconnected phase. I think I'm asking more on the other side because you get some results when you include the contributions from these extra sides. How does this difference in the two results between mentioned and anal show up in what you get? I would love to know that better myself. And in the von Neumann entropy, we know what happens, for example, in black hole vaporization. You get a unitarity if you include these objects. If you don't, you get the same classical result that violates unitarity. So it would be very interesting if there's a sharp situation where you get either a physical or an unphysical result when you compute the quenched versus the anneal. When you compute the quenched versus the annealed objects. Perhaps some related to the work by Sebastian, Netta, and Alex, in that situation, they were finding that the free energy was non-monotonic in the temperature. That's a problem if you're computing a thermal canonical partition function, because it gives you negative entropies. So that would be an example of perhaps something pathological that you. Perhaps something pathological that you would expect in the annealed the energy that the quest free energy would be able to fix what's the local what's the local picture of an n equals zero it's a bit of a singular limit it seems so aesthetic because it would be nice to have something like a cosmic brain or some other thing sitting there so that you could go directly to this point so do you have a bit Directly at this point. So the F a bit of the local geometry. So if you try to do this exercise with just say ADS with a defect in the middle, I believe in the limit where you like it's dr squared was some number times r squared and d phi squared, where the number goes to infinity, right? Where the number goes to infinity, right? Locally, yes, but there's some reparametrization of the coordinates you can make to try to get something more sensible. And I believe we can end up looking like I don't want to say something wrong. Okay, perhaps the more straightforward picture that I have is that the end goes to zero. Is that the end of the zero limit will look like if you take a stripe, and one side of the stripe, you identify all points. So that's kind of a pretty singular limit. I'm trying to remember something better, but There are no other questions. I don't see any hands up in the virtual audience. Thanks, Arian. Can we please don't have nobody to share screen?
