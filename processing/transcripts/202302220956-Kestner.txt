We're happy to welcome generalized measurable and biennial forms. Hi, thank you very much for organising this. It's been a lovely meeting so far, lots of interesting new stability, so it's really nice to see everything. So this is work that I've done kind of jointly with Sylvie, but there's also some stuff that I was doing with Stuff that I was doing with Zanya, although I'm not really going to go into detail about any of that in this talk. Okay, so let's start with MS measurability. So this is something that's been around for 15 years or so, and it was a definition that came out from kind of counting in pseudo-finite fields. So we say that a So we say that a structure is the slide looks slightly different. The structure is MS measurable if you can find a function that goes from the set of definable sets, does that work, to a sort of a dimension and a measure that has various nice properties. So firstly, you want that if you look at a A family, the set of measured, well, the set of dimension measured pairs on that family is finite. You have some sort of definability of that, in fact, zero definability of that dimension measure pair. Singletons have the obvious dimension measure, right? Dimension zero. Right? Dimension zero, measure one. And that you have some sort of sensible additivity. Okay, so if two disjoint sets have the same dimension, then their measure is just the addition of their measure, their individual measures. If one of them has slightly larger, well, has larger dimension, then you just take the measure of the larger one. If the measure of a point is the measure of a point is small, but you're saying that. But you're saying above that the measure for zero there is only zero or something? Maybe I'm not. This? What? The measure zero and measure one. This is for inconsistent definable sets. What? Empty sets, right? Does that make sense? This is only for empty sets. Is that the question? What's the measure of a point? It's asking you about the singlet. What's the measure of a single point? Its dimension is zero and its measure is one. Zero and its measure is one. Yeah, this is a singleton. Yes, okay, and then you've got a Fubini. Okay, so that says that if you've got a definable set and a function, so you've got two definable sets and a definable function from x to y, which is onto with constant fibers, then your dimension. Your dimension is of the thing you started with is just the dimension of the fibre plus the dimension of the thing you landed in, and the measure is the hopefully reasonably sensible definition. So, this has been kind of, I mean, it started actually this paper came first. They show that you have nice control of the sizes. Of the sizes of definable sets in finite fields. And then, if you take an ultra product, you then get kind of very naturally a dimension measure pair. Vector spaces, you can use Morley rank and Morley degree as your dimension measure in a kind of very obvious way. Random graph, the kind of you can use U rank as your dimension and then your standard measure. Measure. So sometimes I think non-examples are more illuminating. So as great and closed fields, why aren't they measurable? Well, if you look at the function that goes from C star to C star, X to X squared, well, that has constant fibre, so two. 2 of size 2, but it's on 2, so then you would get that the measure OC star is twice the measure OC star, which gives you a contradiction. Okay, and the same for the proof, this is the proof group, right, because you can have an onto P to one function. And SOP. And SOP, kind of similar idea that if you've got your shoulder doing this one before, if you've got your indiscernible sequence with a strict order on it, then let's say AI is indiscernible. Because the measure is definable, you need, you can then, because we're in SOP, Because we're in SOP, we have a notion we can define an interval on this intersectable set. Say a, let's say, y1 less than x less than y2. And think of this as a formula phi, x, y1, y2. Then because it's indiscernible, you'll have the h of phi x ai. AI AJ is constant for I and S and J. And so if you think about it on the the how would you how would the measure work say if you've got all these AIs A1A etc you would have that the measured You would have that the measure T here is the same as this. You'll have probably one point in here, so you get the t is equal to t plus t plus one. And that shouldn't be zero, right? So doesn't work. Okay, and that these are sort of the These are sort of the fundamental ways, the most obvious ways of showing that something isn't measurable. Okay, so there are various kind of results. It's been around for a while. So all measurable structures are super simple, of finite SU rank because the dimension forking is Forking is if your dimension goes down, you fork, is a thing. Is it one base? No, pseudo-finite fields. But in stable, right, this is this one, right? Yeah, so if you know you're in stable MS measurable structures are one-based. This is all stuff from kind of my thesis, so it's quite old. In strongly minimal, these are exactly. In strong and minimal, these are exactly unimodular structures. Okay, so the problem with this is that this almost seems like a sort of slightly artificial, I guess, construction. What you're really interested in, I'd say, is these finite in families and kind of definable measure. The fact that these turn out to be super simple. Super simple, finite rank is kind of less fundamental to the definition. Okay, so Charlie and Douglas and well, there are still lots of open, sorry, I forgot this slide. There are lots of open questions on just MS measurable structures. So, for example, are all MS measurable fields actually pseudo-finite? So by So, by result of TOM, they're going to be quasi-finite and perfect, but this PAC, what is quasi-quite, unique extension of size n for everyone. Sorry? These two conditions don't no, as in, like, if you wanted to prove that these were pseudo-finite, you would need that's the missing one. That's the missing one, right? And the hard one. Well, the hardest one, always. Okay, and how about just if you look at Omega categorical structures? So I guess all of the known MS measurable omega categorical structures are themselves one-based. The obvious place to look for counterexamples, Havshovsky construction, so David Evans and our student Paolo Marimon have not kind of Has lots, kind of two or three different ways of showing that various Russovsky constructions are not MS measurable. Paolo has some nice ways of counting in finite structures that show you that. But this is still open. I should say that in the case of pseudo-finite field, Kaushovsky showed that basically the counting measure is the only measure that satisfies. Yeah, the axioms are the you know the one yes but that's in you already know that you're pseudo-finite, right? But I'm just saying that in the case of pseudo-finite there is such a measure and it is unique. Unique. Okay. That's all about the measurement. But that doesn't yet show that all fields. Yes. Anyway, so there was kind of an idea to try and generalise this notion to include natural examples of two-sorted structures, but also to kind of get rid of the condition that you had to be finite rank. But to But to do that, you essentially have to stop measuring dimension in the natural numbers. You have to do something slightly different. Okay, so what you do is you replace this natural number n cross r with this, which is a measuring semi-ring. It's that should have an That should have an addition. Right, this should be addition and zero. Sorry. So, you know, natural semi-ring, and then you want some sort of order, and then you want various conditions on how addition and multiplication interact. And this kind of you can quotient out by this, and you get a notion of dimension. Of dimension. Sorry, multiplication one set would be greater than zero. Oh, yeah, here, yes. Yes. Yeah, these ones, yeah, yeah. Do they have cancellation? No. But they have this. But they have this right so there are there is um they have a kind of this gives you some form you want a strict inequality yeah so this is yes this should be strict yeah yeah I feel like I use these slides already once and this this stuff Already, once and this still hasn't come out. Sorry, yeah, this needs to be strict, yeah. But I thought it's not very natural. If you just look at the definition, it's not very natural. But the kind of things that come up are polynomial rings, really. So example, you can use, if you use something like Rx, you can Like Rx, you can then lexicographically order the dimension of your polynomial, leading coefficient of your polynomial. And that gives you an order. Right, do this legs. And you could do the same with. The same with polynomial rings with 2. You have to decide, you have to decide x1 is on x1 and x2. But those are kind of natural examples. Okay. So essentially, we're just enriching the place where you're measuring. measure it right and then you have the same you have the same condition so you have finds cream there's a green one green green little box cream but there's a green view view go down above the track go down bounce down Okay, but yeah, then you have the same conditions, so finite in families, this zero definable, finite set, finitely additive, and this is a Fabini. I mean, it's exactly the same conditions, but you're measuring in a different space. And then that allows you to extend to kind of two. To extend to kind of two, naturally two-sorted structures. So any MS measurable structure is going to be, that should be an R, is going to be generalized measurable. You just use monomials with the leading coefficient being the measure and the dimension being the exponent. So the monomials should have positive coefficients, but the monomials have positive costs. Monomials, one that has positive coefficients. Yes, positive coefficient, monomials, and then you do what is kind of standard monomial addition, right? Which is exactly what you did in the first slide. And then you can also deal with things like two-sorted structures with a field and a vector space and a scalar multiplication between. Kind of escape the multiplication between the two. And what you do is you essentially measure the field elements in one of the variables and the vector space elements in the other variable. And then you can kind of work out any connections with. It turns out if you're just a vector space over a field, you don't need the fracture. Need any, you don't need the fraction field here. If you add a bilinear form, which is what I'm going to talk about in a second, you do need the fraction field. This is close to the notion of surgicality of cosine and pdi, but so you allow different your functions need not be in a biquivalence classes functions, and you do these finite to one correspondence. I mean the condition that you're putting, right? I mean, there's no there's no continuous. I don't know what your talk the lay. Like the, what did you call it? Surgical notion of dimension. But do they have the beehi? Do they have this? No. A weaker version. This is gives you quite a lot. No, but so they have a weaker version. You cannot have uh basically you cannot have infinite fibers if Have infinite fibers if both things have the same. Yes, we continue with the target. So, none of these are going to be SOP for exactly the same reason. You can argue it. But that's essentially the only restriction we know. Well, I mean, algebraically closed fields. Okay, so I wanted to go on and talk about pseudo-finite. And talk about pseudo-finite bilinear forms. So, this is an example of a structure that is generalized measurable. So, how do you set this up? You take a finite field and a vector space over that finite field, and I've got a linear form between them, and you take an ultra product. Okay, and Yeah, what I'm calling a pseudo-finite field with a pseudo-finite bilinear form, and anything that models that kind of common theory of all of these different ultra-products, I'm saying models this. Okay, so you need some extra notation to deal with this. So, this is all stuff that was done with a guy called Grange. A guy called Granger, who was a student of Mike Prest's. So if we fix a monster model, we let X, how do you say these brackets? I mean, I usually just say the F span of X to be denoted by this. And we want to think about, so any set of parameters will have some elements coming from the field and some elements coming. And some elements coming from the vector space. So we just use AK for those coming from the field and AV for those coming from the vector space. And we need this kind of slightly funny object, which is basically the trace. So if given a set of parameters, the kind of the trace in the field of that set of parameters we call Ka. That's kind of how you should think about it. All the information that you How you should think about it, all the information that you get from those parameters in the field, right? So, because if you've got two vector space elements and there's a bilinear form between them, A1 and A2, then you'll get a field element from there. So, you need to kind of, when you're thinking about independence, you need to take those into account as well. So, there are various results on this structure. It's not simple. So, without the bilinear form, the structure is simple with u rank omega. If you add a bilinear form, you get infinite forking chain, so you're no longer simple. You get quantifier elimination once you add a formula that says this set of vectors is linearly. This set of vectors is linearly independent, and you need a coordinate function. So, I think this was something that was missing from Grangers. So, if you've got a set of dependent vector space elements, you want to be able to take out those coordinates in the field. It's NSOP1. This essentially has a Essentially, is has the same proof. So, in the Kaplan-Ramsey paper, they show this for the field being algebraically closed. Is that right? But the proof essentially you're shaking your head. Oh, is it you? Oh, yes, that's true. Okay, yeah, for the algebraically closed field, right? Because, sorry. I'll take a time not too. It's a bit like cautious, right? And we had a conversation about this yesterday. So, yeah, so actually, for the algebraically closed field, So yeah, so actually for the algebraically closed fields, but you don't do it with Kim Faulkner, right? You show it through having an independence relation with certain axials, right? So this is this is funny, sure, still. Okay, but sorry. So what was the is it is if the field is simpler than the if the field is algebraically closed. Closed is pseudo-fine, yes. Yes, so I'm gonna but the king-forking is symmetric is the same. It's generalized, measurable. I haven't really gone into the definition of max, but there's so the measurable any ultra-product of what's called an asymptotic class. What's called an asymptotic class is measurable. So, kind of the original idea from these is coming from ultra products of finite structures. There's a similar notion for this. You have to be something called a MAC or a MEC, and it's relatively easy to see that the finite fields with bilinear form, finite field vector space pairs with bilinear form form a MAC and thus. And thus, the whole thing is generalised measurable. You can do this measuring in two variables, one for the field, one for the vector space. But you do need the fraction field. In fact, Sylvie has a result that says if you can do it without using the fraction field, then your structure is simple. And it has fine, pseudo-finite dimension. This follows essentially. This follows essentially from the dimension being definable. So it doesn't matter what kind of ultra product you choose on a complete theory. You have to do this. Well, I mean, sometimes the counting, if you don't know definability, right, the counting is... Yes, yeah, because, well, so because we know it's generalized measurability, we have definability, and thus the pseudo-finite dimension is kind of stable on the. Finite dimension is kind of stable and it's different definable. Yes, yes, sorry. Yeah, it doesn't depend on the particular model. Okay, so we have various independence relations. So this is how Kim independence works. Again, that's just essentially the same as in the example where you have an algebraically closed field. Field and you also have this pseudo-finite independence, and the kind of maybe the interesting thing is that these are not the same. Why are they not the same? Well, this essentially, the Kim independence doesn't really tell you much about how the bilinear form interacts. Right, so if you think about the structure, If you think about the structure, say you've got a set of parameters A and you've got some B that's not in the span of A, and you look at C and you want to choose C that's not in the span of AB, but say the bilinear form on these is some element of A. Is some element of it. See, not in the span? Or in the span? Is not. Thank you. Yeah? So here you would get Kim independent, right, because you're not in the relevant part. So you would have A chem independent from B A. Those are C. But if you look at But if you look at the pseudo-finite dimension, you get extra information on this C coming from B. And essentially, you end up having to, in terms of sizes, you end up having to quotient out the size of the field. And so we get they're not the same, but But Granger, as part of his whole thesis, developed this kind of third notion. How much when do I go to? I've loaded three or four. Okay. So this is a known notion of independence on these structures developed by Grainger and he uses it. Uses it but anyway, it basically says that your type C doesn't fork, C over B doesn't fork if the kind of relevant information in the fields is independent, and either you're an element of the field already, so this is a singleton, let's see, or you're kind. Or you're kind of already in the span of the A's, or this funny thing here, which is essentially capturing this idea that if you look at the bilinear forms on your C, you won't get any extra dependencies. And then you can extend that to non-singletons in the standard way. This works as a nice notion. This works as a nice notion of independence. Oh, that's what Granger works. So, Granger works over an algebraically closed field and shows that this notion has various nice properties, independence properties. And what we show is that, although it does need some checking, that these properties still hold if you. If you start with the pseudofinite field and forking in the pseudo-kninet field, the only one that's kind of different to what Granger did was this independent amalgamation because obviously we don't have he has stationarity and that's kind of much easier. This involves some limbs. Sorry? No, no, because well then it would be then it would be simple, right? So no, we do need base monotonicity. I think even to do independent amalgamation. In fact, what we prove is slightly broader than this, we can do it for any field with a good notion of independence that has these, that has, we need finite square classes. We can't get rid of that because the algebra. And finally, we also need to checking that this range of independence is actually pseudo-finite independence in this example. Define independence in this example. Okay, so what else? Okay, so I guess there's questions about this generalised measurability. What structures are generalised measurable? So I think I might have said the wrong thing, but Sylvie has a paper that shows. Is that telling me to stop? Okay, that shows that free amalgams are all generalised, measurable. Me, Sylvie, and Zanya have been working very hard on the Eurosalt. Have been working very hard on the Euroson sphere and still haven't managed to prove it either way. Every so often, we think we have, but it's a very complicated structure. And generally, I'm really interested in knowing how this works in fields. The only example I know of is human finite fields. You know, can we even just prove that generalized measurable fields are measurable and how far can we go in this? Um and how far can we go in the NFP? That's the Euroston's fit question, maybe. So, could you just explain a little bit how the measuring is assigned between final sets in the group? You said that the measuring scenario was a R T1 T2. So, if you don't have So, so if you don't have any bilinear forms in there, it's probably easier to do an example. But you can do it through just looking at the counting, right? So, for example, if you've got beta X V equals right, this is fine. And this is fine X, this is your parameter, then I think what you'll get is this essentially gives you the freedom to choose this anywhere in your vector space, except say this was the kind of beginning of a basis, you would have to, you're kind of controlled. To your kind of controls on that. So, this ends up having, if you think about it in terms of pseudo-finite size, this set ends up having the size of the vector space divided by the size of the field. So, then it gets h of this is going to be whichever one you've chosen as a vector space is, let's say, t1 over t2. And this turns out to be, you have to use the fractions. Right, and it is a result that if you don't. Don't essentially need the fractions, then you'll simply does that make sense? Does that answer the question? Okay. What's the ring? So this is the ring come from generalized measure or so for this particular for this particular example, you can use R T1 T2. So by this you mean actually number of breaks. Um half an hour break. So it's then I actually got the same as
