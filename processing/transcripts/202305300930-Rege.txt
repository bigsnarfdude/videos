So the last talk of today will be given by Alexandre Rechet from EPH Zurich and he's going to talk about propagation of velocity moments for the magnetized blast of Poisson system. Thank you very much. So first of all, thank you very much to the organizers for putting together this really great get-way conference and of course for the invitation. So yes I'm going to talk about propagation of velocity moments for the magnetized blasphemy poisson system. So this is just magnetized blasphemous poisson is just a fancy way of talking about the Is just a fancy way of talking about the Blazo-Poisson system with an external magnetic field B. So here's the plan, quite simple. Yeah, just I know it's late, so I'm really going to talk about the simple stuff. I think the only thing that you really need to know is a Gronwald inequality to follow the talk, so no worries. All right, so yeah, representing the magnetized Blazov-Poisson system. So, a Blazo-Poisson system with an external B. And so I'm going to present two works. So very simply, in the first case, where I considered a constant external field B, and second, so where I considered a non-constant, so more precisely a time-dependent uniform B. And so, of course, this second case includes the constant B case. What's interesting is that I use two different methods to prove. Different methods, methods to prove these two results. And there's a common feature in that, in both situations, I used an induction argument that depends on the infinity norm of B to show propagation of moments for all time. So that's the sort of, so I'm going to talk about it more later. So, first, the magnetized result of Poisson system. So, it's very similar to what Megan presented yesterday with, so highlighted in red the extra. With so highlighted in red the extra the term corresponding to the external B. So instead, so we have this transport equation on the so yeah, important point, this is the magnetized Blazov Poisson system for electrons, so we're not describing ions here. So yeah, so this is first the transport equation called the Blazov equation on the distribution function of electrons, so depending on time t, position x, velocity. Time t, position x, velocity v, which are both in R3. And here you have the Lorentz force that appears, which is the sum of the self-induced electric field, which satisfies the Gauss law and derives from an electrostatic potential phi, which satisfies the Poisson equation. And you have this term highlighted in red here, which corresponds to the magnetic part of the Lorentz force, and here where B is a completely external magnetic. A completely external magnetic field that is independent of the system, more or less. So, the motivation behind the study of this system is that let's say it's the simplest kinetic model that can describe the evolution of fusion plasmas. So, here we have a very nice representation of a tokamak where the idea is to put some hydrogen, some hydrogen isotopes. Hydrogen, some hydrogen isotopes here, and to heat them at really extremely high temperatures of the order of 100 million degrees. And so, when you have this matter at such temperature, an important question is how do you confine it? And you do this using an external magnetic field of V that is generated by these magnets here that make up the Tukamak. And so, some real world. Some real-world information that some of you must know that in the south of France at this moment, there's the largest tokemak that's ever been built that's under construction. And so in the context of the international ITER program, with the objective, of course, to see if it's possible to harness nuclear fusion. So that's for the physical. So that's for the physical motivation. So now, very quickly, going back to the system. So it verifies the same. So both magnetized and unmagnetized Blazov-Poisson system verify some conservation laws. So you have the conservation of LP norm, because you can write the Blazov equation in conservative form. You have the local conservation of charge and the conservation of the total energy, which is some of kinetic and electric energy. And so to Um, so to finish this introduction, I'm just going to give a some brief history on the existence of solutions for uh so the blaso-poisson, so unmagnetized case. So a paper that was mentioned by Megan yesterday, existence of weak solutions in dimension three, which was proved by Arseneff in 1975. Then 10 years later, Bardos and Le Gom managed to show existence of smooth solutions in dimension free. In dimension three for small initial data. And in the beginning of the 90s, in fact, for I think for this, so this is this, I refer here to the paper by Pafel Mozart, but in fact, this was done in his thesis a bit earlier. So that's why I put Pleiffel Mozart first. So around the same time, it was shown the existence of smooth solutions for Lazov-Poisson in dimension three using two very different approaches. So the first paper here. So, the first paper here, so the first result by Papel Mozart, where he really used the Lagrangian approach, so where he studied the characteristics of the Blazov-Poisson equation very carefully to show this result. And so, as I said, around the same time, a result by Lyonce and Partam, who showed a property concerning the weak solutions that have been built by Arsenef, propagation of velocity moments. Propagation of velocity moments using an Elyron approach, already where they studied directly the velocity moments of this weak solution. And in fact, through propagation of regularity, this implies the same result as Buffalo-Mozart, so existence of smooth solutions. And so more recently, Palar slightly improved this result by Lyons and Partam using this time the approach by Pafele. Using this time, the approach by Fafelmazo, so using this Lagrangian approach, so by studying the characteristics of a blazer fossil. And so I've highlighted these two results papers in color, because as you can imagine, I'm going to show how I adapted these results to the magnetized Basel-Poisson system, first in the case of a constant B and then in the case of a uniform and time-dependent B. So that's for the introduction. So now onto the constant B case. So here the result by Lyons and Partam. So you take an initial distribution, F initial, which is in all the DLP spaces, and you assume that this quantity is finite. So this will be the velocity moment of order K0 of the initial data. Of the initial data, and you assume that this quantity is finite. So, in terms of physical meaning, this corresponds to saying that you don't have many particles at high velocities, which is a physically reasonable assumption to make. And you can show that if you assume this, and then you have weak solutions, that also have a velocity moment. that that also have velocity moments of of the same of the same order and that are uniformly uh bounded in terms of of so t and t zero which are parameters of the of the so the of the of our problem uh conserved quantities and the initial velocity data and so the simple question i ask myself is can you do the same for the magnetized reserve poisson system in the simplest case so in the case of a constant uh constant d in fact so you obtain uh So, you obtain, so the result is the same. Where here, in fact, the only difference is that this constant depends on omega. And what's interesting is really the fact that you obtain the same result is what happens in the proof. So, I'm going to give a sketch of the proof. So, how do you start? So, you want to show that this quantity is bounded. So, what you want to do is. So, what you want to do is write the Gronwald inequality on Mk. So, Mk is the velocity moment of order K. And what you notice after a few manipulations is that on this line here, you lose the contribution of the magnetic part corresponding to the added B. And what this means is that you obtain the same initial differential inequality as in the Differential inequality as in the unmagnetized case. Where here, so the derivative of mk is bounded by, so mk at the power of k plus 2 over k plus 3 times this k plus 3 norm of the electric field. And so what you want to do to show a Gronwald inequality is to bound this normal electric field by a power of mk with worst situation, alpha. situation uh alpha here uh equal to one over k plus three and in fact this is what you're going to what you're going to obtain uh so in in some sense this this proof is is very this this approach is very very sharp um and so how do you how do you so now the objective is to is to study this this quantity how do you how do you how do you do this you um you get some information from the blazov equation which you rewrite as a linear uh transport uh equation Transport equation where you consider the nonlinearity as a source term. And so then you use the classical theory on transport equations, on linear transport equations to solve this. So this means solving the characteristics of the left-hand side. So I'm going to refer to the left-hand side as magnetized free transport, which is not exactly free transport. You have the extra VM. And in fact, And in fact, in the case of a constant D, you can solve this exactly. And so here's your formula for your characteristics. You can show, in fact, also a small comment that if omega goes to zero, you recover the characteristics of free transport. And so because you have explicit formulas for your characteristics, you can, so using this form of the Using this form of the Blazov equation. So rewrite your solution in terms of the initial data plus the term corresponding to the non-linear source term. And you can rewrite this term here on the right as the sum of the divergence in V of some integral in time of some quantity here, which depends on, so F, the electric field. Which depends on so f the electric field and the characteristics of the magnetized free transport, minus in divergence in x of a similar quantity. And so after integration in V, you recover a similar representation formula that you have in the unmagnetized case, where you can write your macroscopic charge density as the sum of something depending on the initial data plus a divergence in x of, so in an. Divergence in x, so in an integral in time of this sigma here, which I will call a flux, which again depends on f, your distribution. H of t depends on electric field and your characteristics, and so the characteristics of this left-hand side here. And so now that you have this representation formula, you can go back to your objective: is bounding this norm of the electric field. This norm of the electric field. So, the first term corresponding to the initial data you can easily bound. And using Caltech-1 Symmetron, you have this bound on the other contribution which we worked for. And so you can bound it this way, the integral of time of this sigma that I highlighted. And so, what's interesting here, the interesting thing that you find is that you have find is that you have uh this this uh it's a new estimate for for sigma so here uh you you you recover mk at the power one over k plus three so that's what you that's what you wanted you have a singularity in in a zero here one over s which is also present in the unmagnetized so it it's also present for blaster poisson and highlighted in the right here you have a term which really comes from the from the presence of the external being uh which presents Which presents singularities at multiples of the cyclotron period 2π over omega. So this creates difficulties and so it's interesting because you really find singularities that are linked into the physics. So what you get for free by in fact using exactly the same method as for Blas of Poisson is propagation of moments for all times smaller than 2 pi over omega. You just use the same method. So you obtain this estimate on the electric field. But so only, as I said, only up to a time, only on a fixed time interval smaller than the with final time smaller than the cyclotron period. And to show propagation of moments for all time, as I said in the introduction, you make a simple observation is that you're Observation is that your velocity moments that at this time is smaller than the cyclotron period are bounded by parameters of your system, conserved quantities, and your initial velocity moments, which just means, in fact, that at all these times, your solution verifies the same assumptions as the initial data, and you can reuse the same machinery and prove propagation of moments for all time. Prove propagation of moments for all time by induction. So that's how you get propagation of moments in the case of a constant B. So now I'm going to talk about non-constant B case, which is in fact more, as you can imagine, physically more interesting, because if you want a confined plasma, of course, it's better to have something that's a bit more exotic than constant. And so just going back to the concept. And so, just going back to the constant, just to show you why this has little chance of succeeding, is that here we really used to have an explicit formula for the characteristics of this magnetized free transport, which you only get if you have a constant D. And so we need a new approach, and so this. We need a new approach, and so this is provided by the paper of Palard that I mentioned earlier. So, here, so just going, so here I'm presenting the Blazov-Poisson, so without the BK, just to give the ideas. So, you consider this time the characteristics of the full Blazov-Poisson equation. And now you're interested in this quantity here, Q delta, which is going to quantify the variation. The variations of your velocity, the local variations of your velocity characteristics, just from this ODE. And what Palard noticed is that, in fact, you can bound the velocity moment of your weak solution by the initial velocity moment and this quantity Q, so it's Q of T T, so but yeah, here you're bounding by the full variable. Here you're bounding by the full variation of the velocity characteristic, but so you have this sort of this sort of estimate. And so, if you can show a bound on this quantity, you show impact propagation of velocity moments. And so, that's what exactly what Palar showed. If you assume that, and so showed, and also he managed to improve slightly the result by Lons and Partam. So, because if you remember, so the theorem by Jons and Partem here, you had to take. But I'm here you add to to take k greater than three here you can you can go up to up to up to two almost two which which is what was expected from I mean there was no reason why you couldn't consider a case between two and three and so if you consider that you have an initial velocity moment of order k which is finite you can show a uniform bound on q of t and when Q of T T and which is going to be bounded by a constant depending on the same quantities as before. And so to do this, he, as I said, used a lot the ideas by Pafelmoda, which was also presented by Megan yesterday. And so here you have more or less Q of T delta, which Q of t delta, which is which is so an integral in time of an integral in phase space of this quantity. And so the idea to estimate Q of T delta is to separate the phase space into three parts. A good part where your velocities are bounded, a bad part where not only are your velocities not bounded, but this quantity here is small, so this contribution is very singular. this this contribution is very singular on the on the bad part and an ugly part which which is just what's what's left in the in the face space uh and in fact so you the the the the the the general method is to is to estimate uh the contributions of the good and bad part in a in a straightforward coarse manner and really the the the the the the the work is on is on the the effort is put on the on estimating the contribution of the Estimating the contribution of the ugly part. And as Megan mentioned yesterday, the idea is to first integrate in time to really get a fine estimate. And so, in the Razor of Poisson, you recover an estimate of this type, where here you see you have this moment of order 2 plus epsilon, which is linked to the fact that you have a propagation of moments for all k greater than 2. Should be a question I asked myself. A question I asked myself. I don't know if the kinetic people here have who was the first person to call these sex good, good, bad, and ugly. Was it Shepherd? I think it was Glassi, right? Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't sure. So yeah, so now the question is, can we apply the same approach for the magnetized Blazor Poisson system? So first question is, yeah, do you have a similar Yeah, do you have a similar relation between your velocity moment of order k and this quantity q? And in fact, you do, because you can just write again a Grand Val inequality on your velocity characteristic. So it motivates using this approach. But in fact, so it unfortunately doesn't work in the case of B. So here. Of B. So here I'm taking a B that's that's bounded in time and Leipzig in space. And so unfortunately, this approach doesn't work in the case of B that depends on position. And here, so it's but so yeah, if you assume that you have an external B that only depends on time, you can show a similar estimate. similar estimate to what Palar showed up to a time TB which is a which is so is going to be bounded and depend on the the L infinity norm of B and so say we managed to get so I managed to get a similar estimate and so from this estimate in in the similar fashion as I as I showed before you can show propagation of moments for Can show propagation of moments for all time by induction. So, again, it's interesting that using this different approach, you use a similar method to generalize to all time. And so, yeah, so the approach is similar, so it's the same, you separate your face space into separate your face space into these into these three parts and uh and so here you so the the the the the good part changes a bit because here uh the the the increment of your velocity characteristic is characterized no longer by a q of t delta but q of t delta times this uh this exponential delta delta v um and uh so um just to to to finish To finish, this, so, so, yeah, as I said before, you put all your efforts in estimating the contribution of the ugly set. And to do this, so the first idea is that you show that if your ugly set is non-empty, then both your characteristics and the difference between so your characteristics of a general particle and your, so there's a V star here, which corresponds to the characteristics. Corresponds to the characteristics of a test particle are bounded from above and below. And this is due to the fact that, so if you're on the ugly set, so which means that you're not on the good set, so you're bigger than this, so your velocities are bigger than this peak here, which is a very big constant times the quantity that quantifies the variation of your velocity character. variation of the velocity characteristic on this interval t minus delta t. So it's reasonable that on this interval you don't move that much. So that's one and this is actually what fails when you consider a B that that depends on position because you don't recover this estimate here between the difference of the velocity characteristics. Characteristics. And so using the second relation that you verify when you're on the ugly set, so the opposite of this relation, you can show this estimate on the contribution of the ugly set, where again, so you recover this. So V at the power two plus epsilon here, which is again linked to having propagation of moments for all orders greater than. For all orders greater than two. And so, so, yes, so this is how it works for the case of a magnetic field that only depends on time. And so, I'm just going to, yes, so here I'm just describing how you can't, it's basically that you can't write a Grandval, a satisfactory Grandval inequality on D minus V star, so you don't recover the same. You don't recover the same estimate on this velocity characteristics when you consider B. That also depends on position. So, yeah, with this, I'm going to finish with the list of references. And thank you for your attention. Thank you, Elisa, for a great talk. And in this case, Paul, um, any questions? So yes, so when you put the situation together, what is the growth for the moment that you get the time? The growth, you don't get any growth. You actually show that your moment is bounded, uh, is bounded uniformly by a constant for all time. So that's you have exactly uh it possibly doesn't depend on capital C. Oh yeah, oh yeah, it depends on capital C, but in fact, so you you you have you have this, you have a similar growth as in the unmagnetized. A similar growth as in the unmagnetized case. You have this. So here it's to take into account the case where T is smaller than one and T greater than one. So basically you have this growth in time. And for your MK, what's the decay the growth that you get in time? It's the same. Because you bound your MK with this. Oh, yeah, I'm mistaken. So it's this power at the this So, seven over five at the power of k. Actually, I have a related question. So, let's say, even in the unmagnetized case, because you said the moments depend on capital T, right? But does it really have to be, like, are there examples as capital T goes to infinity, the moments really grow to infinity in some polynomial way? Or? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Oh, I'm not sure. I have to think about it. Yeah, it's a good question, but I. The upper bound is like that, right? But I wonder whether it can really grow to infinity in something. Yeah, I see what you mean. I don't know, yeah. Yeah. Yes. So if you go back to the inequality that you showed before, the yeah, so this is for Vela Pozzo. The constant potential. The constant depends on mk. So, if mk grows, I mean, how can you get the same power then? I mean, presumably, your constant is getting worse and worse as mk grows. Not sure. Yeah, that's mk of the initial data. Yeah, but if you iterate the argument, in the next step of the iteration, your mk will be bigger by a certain amount. That presumably means your constant also. means your constant also deteriorates with the growth of the F initial? No, I don't remember exactly what power you get over this MK, but your constant stays. It doesn't decay yet. If the constant grows, then the rate of growth for the MK cannot be seven and a half, right? In time. In in tires, uh in in in tiers. Yeah, so uh so in fact you can you can generalize uh so yeah, so basically two existing results uh by Nupper and Eo to the case of a general bit that depends on both both time and It depends on both time and composition, yeah. So yeah, this also does the space depending. Yeah, also the space dependent DA, which is which is a bit weird because, yeah. Yeah. And so you get this sort of result. So this is a result I got for when I consider the MEO uniqueness criteria. And so yeah, you show that if all your velocity So yeah, you show that if all your velocity moments, initial velocity moments, are bounded like this, then you have uniqueness. Okay, if there are no more questions, then let's take answer and recommend at 9 a.m.
