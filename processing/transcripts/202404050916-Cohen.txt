Organizers, thanks for great talks, great conversations. I really enjoyed this week. I want to tell you about work that is joined with Adam Lawrence at Basser College. We have a couple papers in a row with some more on the horizon, together with some subset of his undergraduate students, Abby, Stephen, Isabella, Andrew, and Ella. And Stephen is hopefully going to grad school in fall, so that's exciting. Here's sort of Here's sort of a weird question that's been plaguing me for a while, and I'm thinking about all the different talks we saw. Margaret gave like a list of all the different random models. We saw random hyperbolic models. We saw random physical models. We saw random models for biology reasons. Or we saw tons of experimental data, people producing, I mean, Jason's like 4,000 crossing knots or whatever. We saw these huge things. So keep in mind, whatever thing that you're Whatever thing that you're caring about. In particular, what litmus test could we imagine? What kind of baseline of point of comparison could we make so that you could go to other people and say, well, my data, my random model is good at predicting these things, whether you're going to the biologist or going to physicists or something like this. And I still don't have. I still don't have good intuition. I mean, across all the different things, I don't really have good intuition for what those kinds of things might be. But the things that I'm working on now may be in the direction of trying to provide some kind of data like that in that direction. So I'm going to be looking at given crossing number C. I'm going to look at every single two-bridge knot of that crossing number C. Crossing number C. We can think about these things in two different ways. You can think about just that list, and we'll take an average over something on that list. But, or since this is the right community for it, maybe you're thinking of it like a bag labeled C, and we have all the knots of those crossings inside that bag, and we're choosing one at random. So, if you want, my co-author tends to think of it in terms of average, but maybe I think of expectation. Average, but maybe I think of expectation. And over this set, we can compute the cipher genus. And this average cipher genus approaches c over 4 plus 1 twelfth. And the average absolute, okay, the average signature is quite trivial. The average signature is zero because the unknot and its mirror have negative signatures to each other. But if you take the absolute value of the signature and then take the average, And then take the average, we get, as the cross C number grows to infinity, we're getting this square root of 2c over pi. So that'll be part one of the talk. That paper we just found out, revisions, so we're going to be working on that. You'll be able to find the updated version on the archive eventually. This paper with Adam, oh, I thought it would be done by now, but really, really close. Signature is one half of the paper, and we're working on some other stuff maybe on. And we're working on some other stuff. Maybe I'll mention the first time I'm here. Part two is secret. I'll tell you halfway through. All right, so now let me backtrack and let's go over some basics. Bridge number, we were talking about bridge number, so maybe I won't, someone gave the definition, I've forgotten how. So I won't go over that, but two bridge knots have this really nice form where all of the crossings, we have a plaque closure over here, all of these crossings, maybe I should do this, all of these crossings. Maybe I should do this. All of these crossings in the first twist region, the second twist region, and then they alternate, and you get two choices based on the parity of the number of twist regions. Because two bridge knots are alternating knots, I'm going to choose a model specifically that's only giving me alternating diagrams. And I'm going to have these be sigma ones and these be sigma two inverses. And I've written it like this and this, and I think going way back to when I started this with the probability. To when I started this with the probability grad student, I think I made the wrong decision, so forgive me for continuing to use the opposite convention. Many people, I think, so far have already talked about Cipher Genus, but Cipher Genus, we're obtaining a number of circles through Ciphert's algorithm. And here's an example that I borrowed from some other work. This is not me. Not me. So if S is the number of ciphered circles for a particular diagram, I'm going to cheat and avoid all of the complicated three-manifold stuff that you would need to think about and use this result by Marsugi and Crowwell that says I can just look at an alternating diagram and count the number of ciphered circles, and that's going to tell me the cipher genus of it. I love sharing this slide from Nathan's. From Nathan's awesome website where he indexes all of his talks that he's given, or many of his talks that he's given. So if you scroll down the long list, I think maybe 2017 or something like that, he's got a slide deck on an incredible data set, which of course now our computing power is a lot better. But he has, I think, like one knot of every crossing number, and then has run all these different knot invariants through there. So, you know. Through there, so you know, go check it out to see if your favorite non-invariant is on one of the slides. In this particular case, I think for computational reasons, he computed a lower bound in blue and an upper bound, and correct me if I can correct, an upper bound in red, and when they coincide, it's black. But if this data set is representative, again, that question that I asked at the very beginning, if we would believe this data set, it looks like Cypher G. It looks like cipher genus across every knot, not just two bridge knots, looks like it's growing linearly with respect to crossing number. And then that result that I showed you on the second slide said C over 4 for the average cipher genus. And look, here's C over 4, C over 4, C over 4. So maybe, maybe two bridge knot genera look like genera of all knots? These prime or are these just everything? These prime or are these just everything? Prime. Prime. Generally, and maybe I have some ideas how one might try to go about proving such a thing for like alternating knots. I'm thinking about things. Adam and I are proposing some models, but how one would prove something like this in general, no idea at all. But maybe lessons that we've learned for two bridge knots, maybe we can figure. Learned for two-bridge knots. Maybe we can figure out how to extend some of those things. Although, today, because I'm talking about two-bridge knots, I need that they're alternating to use that result by Murray-CD and Krawa. Another kind of motivation comes from probabilistic topology, and I know this is the right audience for it, so I want to bring up these models. Brooks, Makover, Gombord have this model we heard from Anna about gluing tetrahedra together. So let's go one dimension down. We have a bunch of triangles and let's glue up those edges. I guess we have an even number of triangles. And let's glue up those edges in some kind of random way. And we get a surface. They compute the genus of the expected genus. Like if you construct one of these at random, what would you expect the genus to be? Here's some earlier papers on this subject. Tal Noak and Nati Liniyalt, who is really not. Noak and Ati Linial, two Israeli mathematicians, have this construction where you take a chord diagram and we take two endpoints around the chord diagram, and then you randomly pair up those edges and you get chords that cross the circle. Now let's thicken this thing up so we obtain a surface with boundary. And they ask, are they able to say what the expected genus of one of these randomly constructed coordinate diagrams? Just because the numbers for both of these results are a little weird, I didn't. Are a little weird. I didn't bother scaring you with that, but you can look up these results. So, maybe in that flavor, maybe this average cipher genus result that I told you about, maybe we can think of it as some kind of random model to match some of these types of results. I want to walk through where this is coming from. There's this main ingredient that I'm going to talk about, which I think is probably the most useful part of the whole project. And it's so useful that we used it to do paper to. So useful that we used it to do paper two and paper three. So here is leading up to that. I'm wearing a shirt from the MAA, which is a parametrization of a not using cosines. Pierre von Saint-Koslev and Daniel Pecker, two Parisian mathematicians, Daniel Pecker, passed away recently. They use this parametrization that looks like cosines. It's Chebyshev polynomials. And they prove that all knots are Chebyshev, which is really nice. And then what you can do is Really nice. And then what you can do is you can snap this to a grid, and you see that these crossings fit really, really nice on grid points. The grid is like the eighth Chebyshev polynomial and the B-Chebyshev polynomial. Now I'm losing depth. What I did with Sundaram Krishnan, a probability PhD student under Robert Adler at the Tefnion, and then together with Chaim, who came in on the second project, is we turned this into a model for random tube rates. This is into a model for random two-bridge knots. And studying this in two papers gave enough of the ingredients away that now all the work that we're talking about now doesn't involve randomness. So hopefully my dream is that all of your random models produce that kind of intuition. I think Clay said this, like do the experimental results and build theorems from those. So I hope that we can get stuff like that. I'm going to avoid a lot of the hard work of these details to Of these details for clarity to just show you the easy things. So we produce what's the probability of a knot with a given crossing number. We have formulas for these things. And then we say what's the probability of a knot, sorry, given like a length, like n, what's the probability of a knot appearing in that model? And then what's the probability of a knot with a specific crossing number appearing in that model? I will just. I will just mention it that maybe there's a central limit theorem going on, but we were unable to prove such a thing. So, those of you who are good at central limit theorems, maybe there's something there. So, there are so many crossings that you say, what is the probability you need for any one of these two to the n or for each one? Yeah, let me explain. So let's like fix an n here, and then I'm gonna write one, two, three, four. I'm going to write one, two, three, four, five, six. And now I'm going to flip six coins: heads being one, tails being another. And then I say, okay, over that probability space 2 to the n or something like that, what's the probability that the unknot appears? What's the probability? Or what's the probability that a 10 crossing knot, two bridge knot, will appear? And then in this model, the only thing you see is unknot or two bridge knots. Sorry, the talk wasn't supposed to be about the random. I didn't mean to. Wasn't supposed to be about the random. I didn't mean to leave out details. Along the way, I was trying to use this model to get Jones polynomials of three bridge knots, which I think is the only paper. But along the way, I knew Jones polynomials of two bridge knots, and there are 12 papers on the subject. So, not incredibly new, but what was really nice about this was that when I needed to compute Rive, I found the orientations of all of these ahead of time. Of all of these ahead of time. And you see that this one is oriented to the right, up, up, to the right, down, down, to the right, up, up, to the right. And it just repeats over and over again. So I use this information on the Chebyshev diagram to tell me where all the orientations are, and then I move them into alternating diagrams. This is not going to be alternating when we flip coins, but I have a trick to turn it into alternating diagrams. So together. So, together, this random work allowed us, instead of having tons and tons and tons of unknots, we know what the reduced form of an unknot is, and now we know what the reduced form of all the two bridge knots. And as a result, we're able to construct, I think through the subsequent papers, I construct a set TC. It's all two-bridge knots of crossing C, counted twice, except for words that are palindromic, like they look the same backwards. Like they look the same backwards, and those are only counted once. Eventually, let me, I know this is, whoops, I know this is like not quite comfortable. Eventually, I'll deal with figuring out the palindromic case. But let's focus with the set TC. I wrote a solo paper trying to just outline this direction, trying to get a lower bound for cipher genus over this set. The result was not very nice. It was sums of products of binomial coefficients. Of products of binomial coefficients. But given that talk spurred it, I forgot to mention, but it spurred Suzuki, whoops, sorry, Suzuki and Tron independently proved this result. A lot of the papers that I had read on Tube Ridge Knot came from Suzuki and Tron. And then independently, Diao Yuanin, together with his PhD students. With his PhD student who just graduated, Don Ray, they don't get this numeric result like this, but they get, again, sums of products of binomial coefficients, which experimentally matched up with this perfectly. So lots and lots of like secret hidden cometorics here, which allowed us to get this. So then I showed this awful thing to Adam, and we started talking about this idea of a recursion, which is the big idea. Recursion, which is the big idea that I'm trying to sell to everybody here. And we notice that if you take the size of this set Tc, it's equal to T of C minus 1 plus 2 T of C minus 2. And it feels like Fibonacci, but it's actually this Jacobs doll sequence of numbers. This was big because I could stare at the list for like C is equal to 5 and look at 4 and 3 and figure out the next. And three, and figure out the next ingredient that was the recursion. I'm going to choose C odd, and I'm going to end all of them with sigma ones, but there's a similar case when C is even. And then I look at the two crossings right before it. And of course, I have four cases, sigma 1, sigma 2 inverse, sigma 2 inverse, sigma 1, sigma 1, sigma 1, sigma 2 inverse, sigma 2 inverse. It's easy to see that if we just delete the two sigma 1, The two sigma one squared or sigma two inverse squared, nothing changes in the global position of the knot because we do a full twist. Like you just delete this twist and the global direction, like this, whatever is coming in here is still going to come out here. So those are maybe a little bit easy to see. These first two are super mysterious. I never would have come up with them if I wasn't just staring at tons and tons of. If I wasn't just staring at tons and tons of examples, together cases one and two partition the set of c minus one, because here you see this second to last is sigma two inverse and this one is sigma one. And this gives me one copy of t of c minus two and this gives me one copy of t of c minus two. So let me draw some pictures. Maybe you can believe it. Here's the easy case is we just remove these two crossings and then what we do is we And then what we do is we count the ciphered circles, and you can see that the number of ciphered circles is not going to change in case three. In case four, we delete these two crossings, and this piece looks like this piece, and this piece looks like that piece. And oh, look, we lose two circles. So I'm just keeping track of how much things have changed in our recursion. All right, those are the believable cases. Here are the weird cases. Case one, Weird cases. Case one, these three crossings I'm going to replace with these three crossings. Again, I would not have come up with this if just the data, the combinatorics, told me to do this. And if you see, like, up here, you go all the way down, and this is that long strand that goes down forever. Up here, you go, and that's the long strand that goes down forever. Here, you take, like, a loop-to-loop and come back. Low here, you go and come back. So these things match, and so the idea. These things match, and so the idea is whatever the knot before this, I just append to this, and it's not really changing any global structure. So I like this idea, and I'm going to try to sell this idea in all of your models if there's some kind of smaller piece that you can replace something with. Case two, I have to divide up into two cases based on whether the crossing before it is this one or this one. This one or this one, but forget that first crossing. I have this, this, and this, and I'm going to replace them with this and this. And again, I get one fewer crossing. So in case one, we lose a ciphered circle, and in case 2A, we lose one ciphered circle, and in case 2B, we gain one ciphered circle, I think, if I'm looking at that correctly. So we add together all of the things that you gain. Add together all of the things that you gain and lose, and we count all of these sets. And we get this recursion, which again is this Jacobs stall piece at the beginning, together with the counting, the differences, the like the ciphered circles we gain or lose by that process. That was TFC. I do this all for palindromes. Now I have two copies of every knot, and then I divide by two. Adam spent a bunch of time staring at OEIS, so thank you, OEIS, the online. OEIS, the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, and for this we obtained by closed formulas and contact. That's the end of part one. Any questions? Well, maybe you say, but I was curious, what does the distribution of genuses look like around the average? Part two. Oh, okay. So, of course, right, like the average was just easy to count, but then Easy to count, but then the next question is: okay, can we count the number of knots with a given cipher genus and a given cross number? And that's in the next paper, which we worked on with undergraduates. Leading up to that, when I wrote that solo paper, I again cited all this stuff from probabilistic combinatorics. I want to mention Sergey Smutov and Boris Patel have this thing where they take an N-guy. Take an n-gon or a 2-n-gon for some huge n, and again they're randomly identifying edges across this 2-n-gon, and they get this random surface this way. And they compute the genera of all of those surfaces, every surface that they construct randomly. And if you take n and send it out to infinity, the genera distribution approaches a normal distribution in their model. So they say, In their model. So they say, whoa, whoa, whoa, maybe this is an artifact of it being a single n-gon. And now they take many n-gons, like all of different sizes. So now you can glue to the same one, or you can glue this one to this one. Turns out that doesn't make a difference. They still get a normal distribution as the total number of edges goes out. Hayam has this paper with Michael Farber. If you take this model that they had here, where you have all these different copies. They had here where you have all these different copies, but you don't glue together all the edges, you only glue together some of the edges. Now we have a surface with boundary, you have one variable that's like the number of, and correct me if I'm wrong about this, but you have one variable that's like the number of glued edges, you have one variable that's the number of non-glued edges. They get a normal distribution in both of those variables. Sunrose Shresta studies these things called square tile surfaces. You decide to tile your bathroom. You decide to tile your bathroom floor from right in the middle of the floor, and then you run out of tiles. And then you take those boundary edges and you glue them together randomly, kind of like the stop signs, like the n-gons up here. Same thing, central limit theorem, local central limit theorem, Gaussian, when you get out to infinity. So I knew about all these results, and yet I was totally shocked when we managed to prove that the genera, the distribution of genera of two-bridge knots approaches. Of genera of two-bridge knots approaches a normal distribution as the number of crossings goes to infinity. This paper is very technical. There was lots of undergrads working on many, many equations, and I don't have a lot of intuition. I mean, the result is true, but I don't understand why it's true, although I've learned a lot from the talks today. So, here are some questions. I think I mentioned maybe one of them during the problem session. During the problem session, open problem session. But maybe this says something about genus. Like maybe because genus is additive, we have some nice things, right? So like maybe that's the one that makes me feel sort of the most comfortable. So maybe this result is telling us something about cipher genes. Maybe this result is telling us something about two-bridge knots. Maybe two-bridge knots are secretly some kind of combinatorial model like this, and so that's Model like this, and so that's why it should fit in with this program. Especially thinking of instead of two bridge knots with a given crossing number, thinking about that TC, which has that Jacobs doll stuff going around in it. The result that we had in part one matched Nathan's data for all knots. So do we think that maybe this would hold for all knots also? I don't even know what the experimental data. I don't even know what the experimental data would suggest for something like that. And then here's the wacky thing that I think I didn't explain very well when I was during the open problem session. But like, maybe the normal distribution is just hanging out at infinity for so many objects, so many invariants, lots of things that we care about? And if so, can we start developing tools to go out to infinity and then walk back into the finite? Walk back into the finite cases and have it start to tell us things. You know, figuring out how quickly things approach the normal distribution and how big we have to get for things to start looking order. So I don't know. More questions than answers. But in order to get this result, we go through the median and the mode, which are also roughly C over 4. And then we get this variance, which is roughly C over 16. And these numbers were mysterious. And these numbers were mysterious to me, but in a new project we're getting C over 32, so I'm starting to feel a lot better about C over powers of 2 showing up here. In order to get these results, we do a thing where we compute the total number of two bridge knots of a given crossing number and a given cipher genus. So, what we do is we compute something from T of C. Something from T of C, we compute something else from the palindromes. We add them together and we divide by two. But just, oh, yeah. Oh. You're finished. Yeah. But just to show you, the palindromic case is very similar. So you have like a one and a two. Here's a one and a two where there's like a one and a two and this is like one of one C over two and this is like two C over two. What's the generating function corresponding to? So we it should be pretty clean. So we. It should be pretty clean, I would have thought. Yes, we got from this some nice closed formula. And I just, I don't know, I like to hide lots of details, especially in big audiences. This paper is out, so it's on the archive. I can find it for you afterwards. Adam didn't really want to do a lot of generating. I kept saying, let's do the generating functions. But he just became a whiz with OEIS and managed to. OEIS and managed to, like, I don't know, like a tarot reader, just say what the formula would be. And I'm super impressed, and I still don't know how he worked some of the magic. But now we're really good, several papers in. So what do we do? We take this, we find the closed form, and that's how we get the computational things that lead us to the normal. Is that it? Okay. Any questions about this part? Any questions about this part? So, yeah, I mean, I don't know experimentally how far it is from the normal distribution, how far we have to get till things sort of look like that. So, maybe towards infinity, I know, but I don't know how far C has to go to get there. So, now I'm going to switch to signature, and we heard signature in Nathan's talk and in Marina's talk. And then Marina's talk, and they got normal distributions, or they were talking about normal distributions for like a different subset. And so I don't know, maybe that's lurking around in the background here, but I don't have results in that direction. Signature of a knot is signature of a symmetrized matrix that's associated with the knot. I think someone defined this, so I won't. But Trazik has this great formula. It doesn't look like this. It doesn't look like this in their paper, but Adam, together with my PhD advisor Oliver Dasbach, have a paper where they translate Trazik's language to the language of like, not theorists who play with Jones polynomials and stuff like that. So this is the A-smoothing, if you do Jones or Kabanov, where you sort of walk along the over strand and you turn left instead. So this is like not ciphered smoothing, but a different smoothing. But a different smoothing. And it turns out that Trazik's result says that you can obtain signature from the alternating diagram by counting the number of circles in the all-A smoothing, subtracting the number of positive crossings. Again, I need orientation here, and luckily I know where all the orientations of the crossings are, and minus one. So I'm cheating, I'm using alternating knots, I'm using combinatorial results, and then again, I'm just going to count. So this is going to follow pretty closely to what we're Follow pretty closely to what we were doing before. And then this result, like I said before, is that as we get towards infinity, we get 2c over pi underneath the square root. Oh, and we're taking the absolute value of the signature. We're not taking the signature itself. It turned out that the stuff on one side of the signature looked like the stuff on the other side and was offset by just a little bit. So there was a By just a little bit. So, there was a lot of really beautiful comatorics that has fallen out of this paper that I don't quite understand where it's coming from. And Nathan had some ideas about maybe why this thing might be a square root. So, this project, this third project, Stephen was working on. I mean, what an excelling student, whoever gets into grad school. Along the way, what we do is we compute the number. Way what we do is we compute the number of knots of C crossings together with signature sigma in our set T of C. We learned along the way that the palindromes are such a small set. And as long as each signature of each of the palindromes is not very high, we can sort of ignore that contribution. So we didn't know this earlier papers, but now it's starting to feel that way. And what we do is And what we do is a very similar thing, and we get a recursion. And this recursion feels exactly the same thing. Here's a C minus 1, and here's two copies of C minus 2. So we're getting the same kind of Jacob stall flavoring. Let me show you some pictures for this. So I did, sorry, this is the Chevy Chev notation, apologies for that. But here's the end of case one, and here's the replacement end of case one. The replacement end of case one. And if we do this all a smoothing, we lose one circle and we end up gaining one positive crossing that I've indicated in bold. So if we lose a circle, gain a crossing, nothing changes in case one. In case two, we end up, nothing changes with the number of circles, and we end up having to add, we end up with two new We end up with two new positive crossings, so it changes a little bit there. Here in case three, we end up losing two circles, and in case four, nothing changes. These four cases are the odd case, and the even cases are pretty similar. Any questions? Alright, so then we used this formula here and populated a table. And I just think this is beautiful, so I wanted to leave it on the screen for a little bit. It on the screen for a little bit. This is only the set T of C, so there should be a lot more combinatorics in here. Again, the number of crossings, the number of knots with C crossings and sigma signature. And I don't know, pick a row, like 131 makes me think of 121. 1541 makes me think of 1331. One makes me think of one three three one. So I'm feeling a lot of Pascal's triangle here. Clearly, there's this kind of offset, but the even rows are nice and centered, and the odd rows are a little off. In these two rows, like they should be the same, but they're off by one each time. So there's some weird things going on there. But here's the wacko result. Let's take seven and eight. Let's take seven and eight and add them together. One, five, ten, ten, five, one. There's a lot of generating function stuff going on in these numbers, which I mean, we had like recursive formula one, recursive formula two, recursive, we just don't know. And I had for a minute, I had. Don't know, and I had for a minute I had an undergrad who was going to do a lot of stuff, and then I lost him to applied math. So, um, is this uh two bridge knots? This is not just two bridge knots, but it's this weird set TFC. So it's counted, two bridge knots counted twice, except for the palindromes, which are counted once. In the genus paper, we have a table like this, but that's with the palindromes. And so I'm wondering if I go back, but I don't think it was as But I don't think it was as beautiful. This just seems so elegant. So, again, here's that result. Sorry, please. So, you build this as a symmetric. Is it synchronous for the career? Well, okay, so for even the great question. For even, it's not quite a palindrome, you have to reverse the word, but then it's the opposite. The word, but then it's the opposite, so you have to sort of like switch all the crossings. And so, for the even, exactly, it's this result about your images having negative signature to each other. But the odd is not quite that. And so, that sort of describes the offset. Thank you. So, here's this result where we add together the odd row together with the even row, and we do get this binomial coefficient, which we This binomial coefficient, which we've been keeping quiet for like almost a year, when Adam wanted to move forward, I said, I really want to figure out a nice combinatorial proof. And I spent three months, and I have cases after cases. I mean, look, this 2m minus 1 should be the number of crossings. I mean, roughly, it's like the inside number of crossings. I should be counting something with k, and I wrote out every single knot and was circling all the crossings that contributed and whatever. Crossings that contributed and whatever, and I and it's not there. So I'm very upset that the paper is again going to not be illustrative of some grand design, but will be a bunch of computational things. So finally I said, okay, okay, let's write up this result anyway. So I don't know, maybe someone will come along and figure out what this combinatorial thing should be. Just before I go, I wasn't involved. I wasn't involved in these projects, but Adam had two summer research students last summer who worked on braid index after Joanen gave an awesome talk at ICERM about algorithms to compute braid index. And so Adam followed a bunch of that intuition. Suzuki and Tron independently prove something about this. And they get these kind of results for braid indices of two bridge knots with a given crossing over C. With a given crossing over C. I gave this talk or a version of this talk in Buffalo, and Thomas Kindred was there, and I gave it in San Francisco, and Cornelia Van Kot was there. So if you know Thomas, Cornelia, and Patrick Shanahan, they care about unoriented, non-orientable genus. And we have already some results in that direction. We've toyed around with some other things, we have partial results. With some other things, we have partial results for various not invariants. So, if anyone wants to join in on any of those projects or talk to us about your favorite not invariant, I'm hoping to make this machinery available to be able to answer your questions as well. I think I'm a little early, but I'll end there. Thank you. Question is a question. Okay. On the list. The the list. I mean now with like your paper is on on positive three braids. So the big thing with this was all coming from the fact that these knots had like a but there's like the end of this. And you can't do this kind of things with like with braids that keep on going, but a different butt. A different button. Maybe there is a different kind of replacement that would work for three grades. But I've already talked to Adam. It's something that I think would be interesting. One of the things, one of the issues with it is that we're using all this stuff about alternating diagrams. And so we wouldn't have alternating diagrams, but maybe there's different machinery we could build for that. I'm not in that four. Yes. So maybe. We're definitely thinking about it. I don't, just because I haven't worked with the model enough, I don't know how many three braids give you the unknots and these kinds of things. I mean, I guess if you're using the canonical form and simplifying things. With the full twists several times and then stuff at the end. Yeah. Definitely on our list. Have you thought about to extend any of this to the class of alternating seamless nodes? Well, we were hoping to go right to alternating, but we're trying to find models that. Trying to find models that make this good, but I am fairly certain that these types of techniques will work. The question that I have for alternating matasinos is what your do you use the parameter of the total number of crossings? Do you use the parameter of the total number of chunks or whatever? I don't know the right organizational principle for that. The right organizational principle for that. So that's why we thought just jump to alternating and look at the number of crossings. But I would expect that if you could figure out similar replacements, that something like that would work. I mean, there's got to be some sort of tangle simplification there that follows the same kind of idea about recursion. I mean, Adam, when I first started this project, he was like, oh, is there a recursion? And I was like, no, there's no way any of this works. And then just staring at examples, the recursion jumped out. So maybe for all these. So, maybe for all these other Matasinos, maybe there's some actual nice recursive thing that gets you something smaller there. I haven't started that yet. Are there more questions? I thought let's think we'll shoot the next and final talk is at 10:30. 1045. Sorry. 10.30. Is it not going to huh? 10.45. I would just pick that. Oh, right. I would absolutely know I'll be able to do it. It's a 45 minute question. So once I missed it, I think you're. I just took that thing and I like handed it to you as a dollar as a student. He was like, oh, what are these numbers? Can I call it? I never saw them. So it's a whole annual. Yeah, slide joint six. But I don't want to have to talk quite fine.  Oh, I forgot to say that.
