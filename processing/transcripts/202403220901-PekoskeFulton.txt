For listening, and thank you to the organizers for the invitation. I would have loved to be in Banff this week, but I'm stuck in Boston. So I hope you all had a great week. I'm going to be talking to you a little bit about dynamics of DNA traffic oil knots with intrinsic access twist. And the overall motivation for all of this is, well, really, it came from. Well, really, it came from attending a few topology conferences. Can I figure out what, say, some stable configurations for DNA knots look like? Maybe some transitions in this like deterministic process or saddle configurations. And then I wanted to put that all together and get an idea of kind of the overall not. Not landscape of DNA trefoil knots. So we're going to look at some deterministic and stochastic dynamics, and that's the overall goal. Can I think of this as both looking at the dynamics of DNA knots, but also the overall energy landscape? Okay. I don't think I really have to convince this audience of Of why modeling DNA is important. So essentially, I'll just say most of this was again motivated by looking at knot energies in a knot energy landscape. And I decided to look at the trefoil knot in particular. Well, this was sort of easiest to work with, first of all, but also there's a study by Rybankalv and Vologats. Study by Rybenkov and Vologotsky that essentially says for a nicked strand of DNA, other than those sort of open circles with trivial topology, the most likely knot configuration out of this experiment is the trefoil knot. So we're going to be looking at the trefoil knot, and all of the dynamics here are driven by. Are driven by sort of an access twist, really to capture things like supercoiling strands of DNA. So let me tell you a little bit about DNA topology. So, if I have, say, two oriented curves, I can talk about the rise of a single curve. That would be, well, these are. Be, well, these are for my purposes really computed with, say, Gauss integrals, but intuitively, you can think of the ride as the number of signed crossings of a single curved. For two curves, the twist is really how many times one curve winds around another. So here's a twist of zero, one, half, and one. And then the linking number is half the sign crossings of Of those two curves. So in a planar projection, you can think of the red crossing the gray six 12 times. So that would be linking number of six. Or this is an example of rhythe of zero, right? I just sort of have an unknown here. And a twist of six. Okay. So the sum of the rhythm twist gives us a linking number. This is a result. Gives us the linking number. This is a result by Color Grenot and White. And the linking number is actually topologically invariant. So for you're going to see many, many, many experiments or the results of many experiments. And for each of these, I'm just thinking we have a fixed linking number that's not changing throughout each of the simulations. Okay, so my purpose is to model DNA dynamics. is to model DNA dynamics. Let me tell you a little bit about how I simplified my notion of DNA. So we, this is a ultimately this is a model from Lim, Kim, and Swagen. What they did was they took, say, a double helical strand of DNA and thought of this as an elastic rod. So this elastic rod, sorry, elastic rod is intrinsically. Sorry, elastic rod is intrinsically straight, homogeneous, and transversely isotropic. Okay, so what that means is it doesn't have a propensity to bend or twist in any particular direction. Okay, that would be opposed to, say, something like a sequence-dependent model accounting for maybe different bending moduli between base pairs. Okay, so the way this rod is formed is. The way this rod is formed is: I take a central axis, sort of splicing those base pairs. And then in its relaxed state, we get an elastic rod. Excuse me. We get an elastic rod sort of accounting for this double helical structure. Okay, now if I give this extra twist, that's sort of what we would see as that blue curve. So we have. So we have DNA as an elastic rod. We incorporate measured parameters, say bending, twist, stretch, and shear moduli. And then ultimately, this DNA is sitting in an ionic fluid. So we'll also have to account for the interactions between the rod and the fluid. The way this is done is, or one way this is done, is say through the generalized immersed boundary method. Okay, so the mechanics of the rod are accounted for through Costa Rat rod theory. Here's our, right, our elastic rod with that central axis. And I'm thinking of this as just a double-stranded DNA. And so what Cosmart rods. And so, what Kosrat rod theory does is it accounts for the balance of forces and moments. So, we have internal forces and moments, those are capital F and M, and then also external forces and moments, those are the lowercase F and M. And the way that those internal forces and moments are actually defined is if I put a frame at every point along the central axis, then Axis, then those bend, stress, stretch, twist, and shear moduli define those internal forces and moments. So these A1s and A2s are the bending moduli. A3 is, I guess this would be stretch. B1 and B2 are those shear force constants, and B3 is that twist modulus. Oh, excuse me. Oh, excuse me. B3 is the stretched moduli. Okay. So once we have a balance of forces and moments for the rods, then you can think of the rod sitting in a fluid. Okay, this follows an immersed boundary method, say from Peskin. And oh, actually, sorry, before. Oh, actually, sorry, before I get to that, I jumped one slide. We also take into account self-contact forces and electrostatic repulsion. Okay, so we have internal forces and moments, those capital F's and M's, balanced by external forces and moments, and then self-contact and electrostatic repulsion. The self-contact follows a Hooke's law, so the amount of repulsion is proportional to the amount of compression. Proportional to the amount of compression. And the total self-contact is just the sum of every point of self-contact. For electrostatic repulsion, this is a little bit more complicated. So we take the charges along the sugar phosphate backbone and move them to a central axis. And then at each charge, the charge, the force is proportional. Force is proportional to, say, one over the square distance between those charges. But there's also a screening term. Okay, so this is a Debi-Huckel screening term that says, this is a counter ion condensation theory saying roughly you should have some condensation around each of these charges from the surrounding fluid. Okay, so now that we have. Okay, so now that we have all of the forces sort of intrinsic to DNA, we can put this in a fluid. So they use incompressible Navier-Stokes to describe the fluid flow. Okay, so this would be Navier-Stokes plus an incompressibility condition. And then Fb is a body force. So that body force came from the forces due to balance of forces. To the balance of forces and moments, the self-contact, and then also that electrostatic repulsion. Okay, so roughly the way that the fluid-rod interaction is accounted for is at every point along the DNA, we sort of put this in a discretized grid structure of neighboring fluid. Of neighboring fluid. And these forces are balanced locally and convolved onto local fluid points. Then you have to propagate those forces through the rest of the fluid and in turn see how that fluid interaction affects, say, each point of the DNA again. Okay, so it's an iterative process. Process sort of a standard immersed boundary method. All right, so hopefully, I didn't go through that too quickly. I just wanted to give you an idea of what this deterministic process looks like. But so now I'm going to sort of talk about some of my deterministic results. With this immersed boundary method, I ran lots of simulations and I wanted to get an idea of. An idea of say stable equilibria, saddle configurations, overall energy profile for each of these simulations. Okay, so the way that I did that was I started with a 600 base pair trefoil configuration. I just took sort of a standard parametrization, and then I add some intrinsic access twist. Okay, so I change that linking number as an initial. That linking number as an initial condition. And from this starting configuration, here are just a few results of stable equilibrium structures. Okay, these are organized by, so if we have negative excess linking number and positive excess linking number, and then each of these, I'm giving you results for different ionic concentrations in that surrounding fluid. In that surrounding fluid. So, sort of consistent patterns appear. At 0.1 molar, you see a lot more supercoiling and the DNA comes closer to self-contact, okay, compared to 0.01 molar. This should make sense because what that means is higher salt concentration, you're sort of neutralizing more. Neutralizing more of that, more of the electrostatic repulsion. So DNA can come closer to self-contact. Okay. As opposed to lower ionic concentrations, we're seeing sort of wider ballooned configurations. And that's consistent with both positive and negative access linking number. Okay, so this This is nice. I have, say, a few equilibrium structures, but I wanted to go further. For the rest of the talk, I'm going to focus on this case with 0.1 molar and negative linking number. And I just found this to be sort of a richer environment to study the dynamics. Okay. So let me give you an idea of what one of these simulations look like. I'm going to talk about linking numbers. Going to talk about linking number negative nine with a concentration of 0.1 molar. Okay, so we start with a trefoil and there's a rapid equilibration of that twist density and then sort of a slower unbending phase. Okay. And now we're sort of pretty. And now we're sort of pretty close to that equilibrium structure. Let me give you that one more time. So that there's a rapid equilibration of twist density to several points of self-contact. We sort of pass through a saddle and go through a slower unbending phase. All right. So let's look at the a little bit of the dynamics throughout. The dynamics throughout. I'm not giving us the full energy profile. All that I'm showing you is the bending, twist, and electrostatic energy. That's because things like shear and stretch energies are nearly negligible in the full elastic energy profile. So we see that. We see that there's a rapid decrease in that twist energy, right? The dynamics are really driven by that excess twist. And then, okay, so that's sort of the, these are again the main contributors to the full energy profile. And then there's that increase in bend energy until we have that slower unbending phase before this equilibrates. I sort of cut it off a little bit short, but that really does level off. Short, but that really does level off. And overall, as we get more and more supercoiling, that electrostatic energy sort of gradually increases throughout the process. Okay. So where I want to go from here, let me go back one slide just to show you. I want to take each of these stable equilibrium structures. So 0.1 molar with 0.1 molar with a negative excess linking number. And I want to find, my goal now is to sort of think of this as exploring an energy landscape. So I want to find more equilibrium structures. So I took each of these and then I perturbed them again. And when you do that, I ended up with an entire family of knotted. Of not at equilibria. Okay, so my notation here means I started with something, say, like with a linking number of negative six, and then I perturb it to have, say, a final linking number of negative four. So the linking number, the true excess linking number is on the left here. Okay. So for each of these rows, we're getting. These rows were getting entire families of equilibrium structures, which I thought this was fantastic, right? The more knots, the better, essentially. So I sort of classified these by their symmetries. Anything in black has D3 symmetry, anything in green has C2, and then anything not boxed is asymmetric. And then I also gave the total energy in KT. Total energy in KTs. Okay, so let's say I'm going to sort of skip the trivial case with linking numbers negative one and two. When we get to a linking number of negative three, it looks like we're getting three families. So this example, D3 symmetry here, and then one with one plactoneme and two loops. Say negative four, we have three families. Again, two loops and one plank. Two loops and one plectoneme, a central loop and two plectonemes, and then like a pretzel family. And these just get more complicated as you increase that, or rather decrease that linking number. Okay. So this essentially gives me a really rich environment to explore in energy landscape. Throughout these simulations, Landscape. Throughout these simulations, I just grabbed, say, a couple of saddle configurations. And there are many, many, many because I like started here and then perturbed. So here are just some consistent patterns that I noticed. But I thought this was really nice. So what I want to do now is we're going to switch gears and instead of talking about these. Talking about these deterministic dynamics, we're going to switch to thinking of this as a stochastic process. In order to do that, I don't want to work with, say, eight different representations of this negative three linking number knot. Instead, I sort of classified these according to their two. To sort of equivalence classes. So, what I did was I mod out by like rigid isometries, and then I find a distance threshold that just sort of visually made things that appear similar to, say, be in the same equivalence class. So, I would say for negative three, linking number negative three, we end up with two equivalence classes. Linking number negative four, we have three here. Number negative four, we have three here, and then I think the most complicated is down at negative eight, negative nine. We have something like maybe seven or eight different equivalence classes. Okay, and the representative that I'm choosing for that equivalence class has the lowest energy value because it's closest to the true equilibrium structure. Okay, so now I don't have right. So now I don't have quite as many NOT configurations. I just have those equivalence class representatives. And what I want to do now is think of sort of a stochastic process where we're going to take a random knot, sorry, a random walk throughout this knot space and sort of see how this changes the overall behavior. Okay, so for a fixed Okay, so for a fixed linking number, let's take a random walk and see which configurations start to appear. I also did this with many, many simulations. This was done now with the stochastic generalized immersed boundary method. And for our purposes, it's nearly identical. So the rod dynamics are all the same. Same. The fluid flow is now given by Stokes flow, not Navier-Stokes. But the main difference is instead of having just a body force, right, for the balancing the forces, internal, external forces and moments, electrostatics and self-contact force, there's that body force plus the thermal forcing. Okay, so that's accounting for the thermal fluctuations in the fluid. Um, the thermal fluctuations in the fluid. Um, so I wanted to get things like transition probabilities, mean holding times, transition rates, and so on. Ultimately, my goal is to find a stationary distribution. And I want to compare this to, say, a Gibbs distribution. The Gibbs distribution is just accounting for, say, the difference in the depth of those energies. The difference in the depth of those energy wells in that deterministic process. Okay, so let's look at a simulation. We're going to look at this overall has a linking number of negative eight. We start near negative six and then sort of pass through the negative three. I think we're down at the negative. Negative three, I think we're down at the negative 10 state with, say, a centro loop and two plectonemes. And then we'll eventually see sort of an asymmetric version of this where this loop, central loop tends to migrate. Okay. This looks pretty different from the first simulation we saw, right? Because we have thermal fluctuations. I want to talk through sort of that classification process. The same way that I found or that I categorized as equivalence classes, this is how I classified the stochastic version compared to each equivalence class. So I sort of ran this automatic classification and I'm going to talk you through. This is just sort of the way that I did it. I'm going to talk you through the states that we passed through. So this is for fixed linking number of negative eight. These are the states that Negative eight. These are the states that these came from. These came from the negative eight, negative six. Briefly jumped up to like a negative three state with say, so we went from pretzel configuration to two loops and one long pluctineme. And then a central loop and two pluctinemes is from the negative 10 state. And then to an asymmetric version of this, we sort of end at negative 7 and coming from negative 7. So that asymmetric version of two loops. That an asymmetric version of two loops and one platinum. Okay, so I thought this was actually quite nice that this classification worked so well for me. And so where I went from here is I want to find a stationary distribution. So let me give you an idea. If we start with, we're going to start with the simplest version of this markup process. Say fix the linking number to negative three. Fix the linking number to negative three. I need to sample the space so that I ensure we see every representative in that equivalence class. So I ran, say, two experiments in this case. And from those, I can get the average time spent near each state. Let me see if I can show you what we're talking about. Let me see if I can show you what we're talking about. So we're hopping between this negative three, negative three state and negative three, negative nine state. Okay, so D3 symmetry and one loop, two pectonemes. So the average time spent, that mean holding time, helps me find the stationary distribution. So here's kind of the punchline. That stationary distribution is in blue, and I'm comparing to the Gibbs distribution in orange. Again, that Gibbs distribution is. Again, that Gibbs distribution is only accounting for the sort of differences in the depth of energy wells. Okay, so if we just talk about the deterministic process, you would expect to spend roughly 65% of the time in the case with two loops and one pectinine, and about 35% of the time in the D3 symmetry state. D3 symmetry state. When you add thermal fluctuations, what we're actually seeing is that negative 3, negative 9 state is much more likely and occurring with, say, maybe roughly 95, occurring maybe about 95% of the time. Okay. So this is really changing the overall dynamics. So I did this for each of those fixed linking numbers. Each of those fixed linking numbers. Okay, so here I'm showing you the Gibbs distribution in blue, sorry, in orange compared to stationary distribution in blue. And I ended up with overall trends across all linking numbers. So the most likely states that you see, as long as this appears as one of those equivalence classes, is the NOT family with two loops and one platinine. Loops and one pectinine. Okay, kind of universally for the higher probability states, the Gibbs distribution is an overestimation. Okay, the not family with the central loop and two pluctinemes, rather, it doesn't matter if it's the symmetric or asymmetric version. This is kind of the next most likely case. So I think that would be, sorry, my Zoom bar is in the way. I think that would be like the state here. This state here, oh, it's all coming from these seven states. Okay, so anything where we see from a seven is kind of next most likely. And then the, sorry, the lower energy states, anything that's like highly compact, those pretzel configurations, they're actually appearing more frequently with those thermal. More frequently with those thermal fluctuations. Okay. So overall, overall, the deterministic process gave me, say, stable equilibria, right? These are kind of what those knot configurations look like at the depths of those wells. We got a few samples of saddle equilibrium structures, right, or the boundaries between these. And then And then compared, say, the deterministic process to, say, stationary distributions when we account for thermal fluctuations. Okay, so I want to thank you all for listening. I do have to say this was work done with my PhD advisor, David Zweigen, and it would not have been possible without him or his support. So thank you all for listening, and I'm happy to take questions. And I'm happy to take questions.
