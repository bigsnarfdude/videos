Today I'm going to talk about DHR regamin que red algebra based on a work I wrote a year ago and also some ongoing works with Taro. So I'll give an introduction on and also some historical aspects of how we have been developing the concept of deformed W algebras. Then I'll move on to the gauge theory. I'll move on to the gauge theoretic derivation of these quiver-w algebras. And then at the end, I'll give a summary and conclusion. So our main interest is the BPS-CFD correspondence. So on one side, we have correlation functions of BPS observables in superstar gauge series. And on the other side, we have correlation functions of like shafts or quantum algebras based on this negro software and also AGD correspondence. And usually when we like And usually, when we like to study this BPCFT correspondence, we first, one way to study from the algebraic specs is to define some kind of vertex operators and then show that the composition of them gives this gauge theory side. But today I would like to talk the opposite side. So instead, I would like to start from some gauge theory and then derive new deformed W algebra. Then also after learning this correspondence, I'm going to generalize the story and get a broader PBSGFT correspondence. So So the history of the formW algebras is quite long. So the traditional examples are QV rassole and QWN algebras. So yesterday Auto-san and Kondosen gave a brief introduction of these QV rash. And we also have deformed W algebras associated with the algebras done by Franklin Restigin. But we also have modern examples of these deformed WLG. Have modern examples of these different algebras, which one example is the quiver divided by algebras. So it's a gauge-theoretic interpretation of this Frenkeler stigma, or you can understand it also as an operative version of Nekrasov's QQ characters. Another modern example is the Q corner VOA. So originally introduced from JRT perspective by the Rap Chaki in the rational level, then also we have a derivation using quantum fluoridal algebras. Using quantum Fourier algebras based on Barson, Feigen-Mertzon. And also, defining the generalities of this Q corner VOA, you can also study the quadratic relations of them, which gives a pure algebraic definition of this Q corner VOA. First done by Kojimai, and also I did work related to this. And this is somehow super algebra, super equivalent generalizations of the uniform WN algebra. And you can also generalize this curiform VOA to. generalize this q corner v o a to the algebra which is done by this working jimo hindrkowski and you can also um further um glue this type of algebras which gives the concept of webs of deformed widup by pachaka and rapture so this was also introduced yesterday by condosan with me and for constructing the deformed w algress the webs of this deformed w algress is quite difficult but um Quite difficult, but the first example was done by Hardasan, so studying the Fagian semi-halt of W algebras. And a new example was introduced yesterday, the sign-Condosan, the N equal to superconformal algebra. So even these examples, even as you can see from these examples, we have many deformed algebra deformed WWE brands. And what we want to do is to extend this more and more. So how to derive this new type of deformed WWE jurisdiction? Derive this new type of deformed W algebra. So, usually, basically, you have two ways to find this kind of deformed W algebra and write down the generators of this algebra. So, the first way is to start from a large algebra, the quantum toilet algebra. So, you start from, say, like GL1 and study the vertex operator representations of it, and you can also study the tensor product representation of it, and they give the generators with the double jets. So, for GL1, you have like three fox faces. Have like three fox faces, so if you choose one color of them and take n tensor products of it, you'll get the QWN. Or if you want to get the Q corner VOA, you can just mix the color of it. Or if you want to consider general versions like including other type of VLGRS, you have to introduce some type of boundary fork modules and you need to add the new new modules here and others here will be the normal F the normal F1, F2, F3. Normal F1, F2, F3. So this gives a new type of derivation of this Q-deformed W algebra. Another way to derive the deformed W algebra is to start from the quiver W algebra. So you start from some kind of quiver, and there are parameters associated with that quiver. And so you associate three buttons to each of the nodes of the quivers, and you can define the screening currents and highest weights of them. And studying the commutativity. them and studying the commutativity with the screening currents, screening charges, you can get the W algebras. So there are two stories of these different W algebras, but in this talk I will focus on the second derivation. And the relation, this first quantum plural algebra derivation is not so clear for the moment, but yeah, so I'll focus on this second side. So let me just briefly explain. Just briefly explain a few examples of it. The simplest example is the A1 Q Verlev algebra, which is just a Q giraffe row. So this is given as the current of the Q giraffe is given like this. So Q12 is the product of Q1 times Q2, and this Y is called the highest weight, which is defined as this weight. And an interesting aspect of this QVR sorrow is that the second term can be written as a product of this highest weight with this A inverse operator defined. Inverse operator defined like this, and this is called the root current. And the definition of these three bosons are given like here. And if you look at the definitions of these mode relations, you can see that this part, if you take Q1 or Q2 to the one limit, it looks like the normal Carton matrix of the A1 quiver. So this definition of the root current already shows us that there's a Q-deform structure of this A1 quiver. So this is basic construction of Is basic construction of these types of queue-driven variables. And you can also see how to define the highest weight and screening current. And actually, if you study these relations with this, you can rewrite everything in this free buttons associated with the root current. And in this case, it's like this. So yn is a n over 1 plus q12, which is this part. So you're Which is this part. So you're taking the inverse of this part, while for the screening current, you're going to take one part of this 1 minus q1 or 1 minus q2 to define the screening current. And since looking at this part, it gives the A1 quiver, the Q deformation of the A1 quiver, you'd like to generalize the story, and you can do that, and generally, the quiver. That and generally, the queue-carta metric is given as this. So, this is the diagonal part, and you have arrows from node i to j, and you also have another arrows from the opposite direction. So, it's a symmetric quiver, and you will have parameters here defining the parameters of the the before W. So, one non trivial example of this um quiver W algebra is the fine quiver W. So, Connozan already gave an example yesterday. Already gave an example yesterday, and the Carta matric is defined like this. So, setting Î¼E to Q3 to inverse, you get this equation. And if you reform it, you can get 1 minus Q3 times 1 minus Q4 with this Calabria 4 condition. So, already looking at this, you can see that what happens. So, this part looks similar to this 1 minus Q3 and 1 minus Q4. And you can understand that. And you can understand that the one minus Q1 and 1 minus Q2 part is also associated with some kind of queer, the A's or hot quiver. So then you would like to ask how to generalize the queer W algebra to cases when you have two types of parton matrix. So 1 minus Q1 minus Q2 and 1 plus Q12. Then the answer is this is a double quiver W algebra. So you have two types of carton matches here. So this was done by McCarthy. So, this was done by my collaborator, Dimurassan. So, then you like to ask how to generalize this situation to the larger algebras. And it seems that the answer is that these side quivers can be quivers of tori collaborative focals. And they give a large class of new queer algebra. And I wrote how to define vertex operators in first paper and also I'm currently studying how to get all the currents of it. How to get all the currents with it. And also, see a recent paper of Hanko and Bao Shong Yamazaki because they also discuss the partition functions of the Calavia fourfolds. And the algebras I'm constructing now is related to theirs. But I'm not going to talk about the general discussion of this story about Calavia fourfolds, but only focusing on the C4, because already in the C4 we have many new generalizations. And the way to derive the new types of currents is to choose the highest weights. Is to choose the highest weight and I'm going to show examples how to derive it from the J0. Yes? No, no, no. They don't have the algebra. So Franco gave how to derive the crystal, how to draw 4D crystals, 4AB V's crystal. This one they gave the supersymmetric localization computations. Yes, yes, yes. No, so for the C3 case, it depends on how you impose the parameters. So if you impose like Carver 3 condition, you won't get anything new. But if you impose the Carver 4 condition and keeping one extra parameter Q4, you can get everything. So even in the generalization. So even in the generalization of this, if you start a proper highest weight and define a screening current, you can get all you can expand the generators and the generators will be expanded by the VPS crystals. No, I don't think so. So in that case all the generators here will be commuted. So wait. So here like if you place Q forward to zero it becomes um trivial and you won't get any new. You won't, you won't. No, so that's a part I also don't understand. So how to understand the relation becomes the relative algebra. So it seems that directly getting from this is it's not a good strategy. But later I'll briefly discuss But later I'll briefly discuss how to see the structure of counter to the LGL1. But I don't know the relation with coverage. Yes. Yes, it looks to me, yes. But I'm so at the end, what I would say is that if you expand the Would say is that if you expand the QQ characters, the monomial terms have a one-to-one correspondence with the basis of the quantitative GL1. And if you study like Calvary 3 times C, it has one-to-one correspondence with the basis of the Q-V younger. But we don't know what will happen if you generalize. So not included like Calvary Street times C, like general recovery false. I don't know what will happen. Okay. Any other questions? Okay. And so I. Then so I'll move on to the gauge theoretic picture. The gauge origin gauge theoretic picture is the gauge origami. And roughly speaking, a gauge origami is a generalized gauge theory introduced by Microsoft. So usually in gauge theory, you would like to consider V-brains. I'm only wrapping in one direction. But a generalized gauge theory is a gauge theory whose space-time contains several intersecting components. And each component, you have a gauge group. And at the intersecting A gauge group, and at the intersection of it, you have matter fields giving bifundamental representations of these two groups. So, roughly speaking, you have this kind of generalized Kubernetes theory. And the gauge origami system is understood as a low-energy limit of these multiple intersecting D-range. And if you consider like type 2 string theory on Z times R2, where and Z here generally can be RV4, but I'm focusing on the C4 case. On the C4 case, and here it depends on here. If you take R2, it becomes irrational. If you take R times S1, it becomes trigonometric. If you take 3, it becomes elliptic. But this is wrong, so I focus on R times S1. Then I'm also assuming that we have omega backgrounds where the parameters are associated with this. And focusing on the C4 case, we already have multiple types of subspaces. So, for example, we have C sub A and we have four possible C. Have four possible C spaces, and we also have six possible C2 and four possible C3, and only one possible C4. So, what I'm going to do now is to consider the brains wrapping in this kind of non-compacted subspace in C4 and compute the partition function and try to derive the deformed WR driver. So, for the well-known example, it's the spike instant tone introduced by Microsoft. Introduced by Microsoft. So, this system comes from intersecting D4 brains in Type 2 A string series. And so, we have 4 C here, and the D0 grains will appear only this 0 part here. And D4, when I write 1, 2 here, it means I'm spying the C2, the C1, and C2 here. And also, you have six possible cases. And if you focus only on one or multiple D4 rain stacks, then you just get the five. D4 rain stocks, then you just get the 5D and equal one star UN series. So an A0 hot queue or GA series. So this one already appeared in yesterday's talk for Commun SAR. Then you can also physically like to consider the non-perturbative corrections of these D range and that is instant bones. And spike instantons consist of three types. So normal instant tons, folded instantons, or cross instantons, or a general system. So if you focus like System. So if you focus like on only on parallel, one type of D4 of stacks of V4 brain and the D0 brain sticks to it, then this gives just the normal instant tones. And if you consider the case when they intersect with each other, then you get folded instant tones. And if they are transverse to each other, you get the cross installance. But generally, we call this spike instant. So to derive the partition function of this spike instantaneous setup, Spike instant setup, you like to study the low-energy theory of these D0 brains, which is written in the supersymmetry quantum quiver mechanics of this theory. And if you focus on one stack of D4 brains, you get this like quiver here. So Konda San already gave this quiver yesterday. So it's written in 8 Susie notation, but you can also write down in 4 Suzy notation or 2 Susie notation, and you'll get this kind of previous for 4. Grease for four SUSY, but of course, you also need to include super potentials, but I'm omitting all of those. And you also get for two SUSY notations, you have oriented arrows and non-oriented arrows, which correspond to fermi fields. So, given this type of fever, you can compute the partition function of the D4. Then, you can also add multiple D4 grains intersecting with each other, and the quiver diagram. And the quiver diagram will look like this. So you'll have six possible frame nodes, and you have a quiver like this. Yes, I think this one we need to turn around. Um, I don't know. I don't know what you are correct. I don't know what what corresponds to the deformed algebra. Then given that quiver, you can do the supersymmetric localization. And schematically, this partition function takes this form. So you have open strings contributions to the D0, D0, and also D0 to D4. And after evaluating the poles, they will be classified by Young diagrams as this. So for each stack of D4 grains, you will have a Young diagram control. Four brains, you will have a young diagram contributions, and the bifundal contribution connecting them will give this kind of partition function. So, you can also generalize a story-to-theter headering instant to case, and in this case, D6 brains appear, and the D6 brains will wrap the C3 subspace of the C4. So, you have four possibilities of this, and again, you can also write down the Cleaver diagram. The quiver diagram. So, if we've got some D6 wrapping only one in the 4 Susie notation, it's like this, and in the 2 SUSY notation, you have extra Fermi fields. And if you want to consider intersecting D6 range, you need to consider the 2 SUSY. So, the quiver will be like this. And this quiver will be at the end connected with the quiver of the gauge origami. I know quiver of the quiver that we are using. Algebra. Then, given that fever, you can do the supersymmetric localization, and then some partition function will come from this counter-integral formula. So, again, you have a D0, D0 open string contributions, and you also have six, I don't know four possible D0, D6 contributions. And classifying these poles, you will get plane partitions, which are three-dimensional generalizations of the Young diagrams. And it's written like this. And it's written like this. So basically, for each stack of D6 reins, you have multiple plane partitions, and connecting those D6 brains, you have interaction terms like this. So finally, you can also lift up everything to the MAPIS4 case, which is D eight brains. And actually, due to some stability condition physical conditions, you need to include this anti-D eight brain. But unfortunately, I don't really understand. But unfortunately, I don't really understand the algebraic aspects of this anti-D8 brain, but you need to include it for physical reasons. And this group theory will become some kind of UN slash N theory. Then the quiver corresponding to the setup will be written like this. And again, you can also write down the counterintegral as this. But in this case, the poles will be classified by solid partitions, which are four dimensions. Solid partitions, which are four-dimensional generalizations of the plane partitions. And for each stack of the E8 brains, you have an extra, you have a solid partition associated with it, and also a parameter K8, a K alpha, which here represents the distance between the D8 and V8 bar brains. So this will be all the setup I'm going to consider in this talk. So let me explain the Let me explain the main theorem I'm going to aim. So now, given a nice gauge theoretic counterintegral, you can derive the algebraic structure from this counterintegral formula. And the theorem is that for each d-brains, you can associate a vertex operator. And they have a correspondence with where the d-brains wrap. So, for example, I'm going to denote the d-zero brain vertex operator operator operator. denote the D0 brain vertex operator as this A current and I'm going to denote this D2 brain operator as SA and D4 will be X dars A and D6 will be WA and D8 will be denoted CC. So for each D brains we have multiple types so for even for the D2 brains you have four types and the D4 brains you have six types. Brains, you have six types of vertex operators, and D6, you have four types of vertex operators. Then, the definition of the vertex operators could become like this. So, for each vertex operators, you have zero modes and non-zero modes. But zero modes have for the moment have to be imposed by hand. But these non-zero modes have a nice relation. And if you focus on this root current, Focus on this root current, the commutation relation of this root current is defined like this, where P1234 is where PA is defined as 1 minus QA, and PAN here is defined by sending the real parameters to the power pan. And given a subspace of this C4, I'm multiplying this PA, which defines this PA. This PA, which defines this PS, and all the other vertex operators, the non-zero modes of these vertex operators, will have a nice relation with this root current as this. So given space-time you want to consider, you can write down the corresponding charge like this, and if you take the inverse cartoon matrix of it, this gives the definition of this. So I'm now giving the So, I'm now giving the answer of how to define the vertex operators, but we can actually explain how to derive these defining relations from the counter integral formulas. And I will talk that later. So, using this, so just first accept the definition of vertex operators, then at the end, all the free field the All the free field, the counter integrals of this gauge program system can be written by the compositions of these vertex operators. So in the theory for spike instantons, as I said in the quiver diagram, you have six multiple D4 brains and giving the framing nodes, and they correspond to this product of X operators. So X operators. So X here represents, so A dash A here represents the six possible C2 subsets of the C4, and you introduce a new extra parameter corresponding to Kiron Bunch moduli, a Kiron branch parameter. And for each parallel default range, you're introducing any numbers of default rings. And this A inverse corresponds to the contributions from instantons. And now you're considering the K instanton sector. Considering the K-in-Santon sector, so you'll get this time formula. You can do the same thing for the tetrahydron-something case, and in this case, you will have four possible D6 range, and that corresponds to this W operator, and you can get this formula. Also, for the D8-anti-D8 case, you need to introduce this extra k out of a parameter corresponding to the physical distance of this D8 and anti-D8 range. Of this D8 and anti-D8 range, and studying the composition of that also gives the magnetism formula. So, roughly speaking, you can consider some kind of a correlation function as this, where this gauge origami side, you have multiple. So, I'm writing here D4 veins, D4 veins corresponding to vertex operators, and this black dot will become this D0 itself. This D0 range corresponding to the instantal bar. So from now, I would like to explain how to extract the critical structure from the partition function. So up to here, any other questions? Yes, yes. This one? Yes, yes. The K in central section. Then at at the end you have to take the sum of the K, of course, but yeah. Okay, then I'll move on to the quiver structure. So actually the modes relation have a quiver-like understanding. And this is a generalization of Humor-Pesn's quiver-double algebra. So for example, if you focus on this C1234. Um, this C1234, I will call this a full Q Carton matrix. And you can decompose it into a half Q Carton matrix. So you have a positive and negative part, and this dual means you are changing all the equivariant parameters to the inverse. So it looks like some real structure in this half in this full Q-Carton matrix. And if you pick this half-Q-Carton matrix, actually, this half-a-geometric and physical. Actually, this has geometric and physical meanings, and it is directly corresponding to the quiva structure. So focusing on C12C4, the positive part, you can define this as this. So it's defined as 1 minus sum of QA and Q4 with QI, where I is 1, 2, 3. So looking at this equation, it looks like you're breaking the symmetry of the 1, 2, 3, 4, but that's 1, 2, 3, 4, but that's the case, what will happen in all this gauge of your system. You have to take the half of the quiver, and this half-carton matrix is identified with the quiver of the C4, which is also dual to the 2D and equal 8-made superamules obtained by the dimensional reduction of the 4D and equal 4 superamules. No, so you need Q1, Q2, QC, Q4 equals 21. see q4 equals to 1 and that that will occur so from this condition you need that another condition i'll explain later is that um if you consider like the superpotential or the epsilon conditions that will give this q1 q2 q4 go any other questions sorry It's only a number, yes, because it's only one node. But if you want to generalize to other cases, you need to include other matrix. It becomes a matrix. So, this full Q carta matrix means This full Q-Carta matrix means that, so we're only discussing the world-volume theory of the diesel brains. So, if you consider like general Calabio 4 and you're studying gauge ergonomic construction of it, so the D brains inside the Calabia will give the framing nodes. But at the end, if you just focus on the D0 brains, you don't need to discuss those framing nodes, and that is discussed by the 2D n equals 0 components. By the 2D n equals 0, 2 fever. That gives the queer relations this here. But if you want to introduce other brains in the collabio, you need to study how the brains wrap the non-compact cycle of this LV4 and how they introduce the frame nodes to the quiver and derive information of the flavor velocities and write down the counter-indega formulas and then everything will give this cartoonatrix. So you get the So you get the you get the definition of those vertex operators any other questions type what type A quiver you mean um you mean like container C2 and the AAN quiver gas here, you mean? No, A0 hot. A0 hot times A0 hot carton matrix. Yes, yes. So if you want to get the Kwiver W algebra associated with the Kuiberg series, so the original construction of Kiber Pestin, in that case, you have to take the collaborative C2 times C. Be able to like C2 times C2 over gamma, where gamma is associated with the quiver. So, if you take like a fine quiver of that, you'll get a fine quiver gauge series. If you take finite quivers, you get finite quiver gauge series. No, so here I'm focusing on like, so you can extend to that cases. So, basically, I'm focusing on I find type AA. I'm focusing on affine type, A type fever, all coming from the Tori colour belt. But given you can also generalize the story to such kind of cases. So you can consider like finite type fever by taking some place infinite or zero like that, decoupling the edge connecting those fever nodes, or you can also extend the discussion to DE types. But the problem is that if you study DE types, some cases you cannot evaluate the content. You cannot evaluate the quantity integral, so it's hard to get the full expansion of the QQKAT. But at least you have vertex operator relations with that. Any other questions? Okay, so then so this C positive part. C positive part is related with the quiver quantum mechanics of these laser brains. And if you study, for example, like a D1 brain probing the C4, this D1 brain has a nice interpretation in the 2DA series, and you have one vector superfield and four chiral superfields, and also three Fermi superfields. So this carton. So, this carton matrix is identified with as this. So, you have 1 minus x1 plus x2 plus x3 plus x4 with red lambda 1 plus lambda 2 plus lambda 3. And so, you have 1 minus chiral fields plus periodic fields. And we're identifying the superfields with the these Q deformation parameters. And they are the fugacities of these U13 charges of the rotational symmetries of C4. The rotational symmetries of C4. So, for general cases, you also have to write this down. So, if you have an index ij here, it means you are studying the chiral superfields connecting this to I and J, which appears here. And you'll also study the Fermi superfields connecting that I and J. So, in this way, you can define the deserving quiver for general Tori Carway 44 case, also. So this identification is not special from the supersymmetry localization viewpoint because even in the normal SUSY localization, the integrand is obtained by the product of vector, chiral, or Fermi-superfield contributions, and the flavor of gasity keys will also enter in them. So what this implies is that so and also this discussion can be generalized to cases when you have uh uh framing nodes like D2, D4, D6, D8 vertex operators. The 68 pretty software. So, what this implies is that you have some kind of operator generalizations of the within index, and that operator version of the within index is the generators of the Kubernetes algebra or QQ characters. So, in this talk, I won't distinguish QBW algebras or QQ characters, but yes, so they are understood. But yes, so they they are understood as the operative version of this reading index. So um we expect that this formalism can give you a way to generalize to other theories. So like if you want to consider SOSP theory, maybe you can define a corresponding vertex operators and extract everything. So roughly speaking, what I explained is that for a given within index, you have some kind of operating. Index, you have some kind of operator relation like this, and taking the sum of it, you get like this, and this is the QQ character. So, we expect that we can generalize the story for other types of queries, but for the moment, I don't know that. And another point is that if you want to explicitly derive Explicitly derive the expanded version of this operated version of the width index, you need to explicitly implement the zero modes. And for the moment, I don't have any nice way to give you these explicit zero modes, but rather they are all implemented by hand. So this is the general discussion of the QQ characters. So you can use the JQ recipe and get the QQ characters. Up to here, any other questions? Okay. Then so, um, as I said, we the filter realization of the width index implies that you have some kind of operators which are the generators of these formula with algebra and they are the qq characters. But we can instead do a traditional way of um deriving the the the q q characters by defining screening charges. By defining screening charges and studying the commutativity with them. So, if you start from a D to brain vertex operators, you can define this kind of screening charges as what we do in usual Deform W algebra. And based on these screening charges, you can construct the QQ characters by determining the highest weight. And if you focus on D4 and D6 case, these Case, these highest weight will determine the QQ characters. So, for example, if you want to derive a default QQ character, so the fine Q rew algebra, you have to pick one screening charge. And if you study, if you impose, so if you choose the highest width in the transverse direction of this screening charge, you can recursively determine the QQ character. And the D4 case will give this form. Case will give this form. And the appearing coefficients here will be the partition function of the affine quiver gauge theory. On the other hand, you can also generalize the sorry to the D6 case. So this part didn't appear in the previous literature. And if you choose this highest weight, you can study the conductivity again with this transverse screening charge. And at the end, you'll get a QQ character expanded by plane partitions. By plain partitions. So, in this way, you can get infinitely generated QQ characters. And this is also related to the affine structure of the queer. And now, given these screening charges and characters, you'd like to study the commutation relations of them, but studying them generally is difficult. But what we can say is that, so let TETB attach. So let T be a tetrahedron corresponding to C4 geometry, and you can associate each QQ characters associated to this vertex or edge or face. So here I'm denoting the vertex to be Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and the edge connecting this vertex would be like T1, 2 or the face connecting this 1, 2, 3 will be T1, 2, 3, which represents the D6 experience wrapping C3, it's 1, 2, 3. Then the end. 1, 2, 3, then the entire tetrahedron corresponds to the D8 case. And what we have found is that if the QQ characters associated to these elements are not connected with each other, which means they are transverse to each other, all of them commute. So if you choose Q4 to be one of the screening charges, then you'll get all this. This QQ characters inside the C3 subspace. So you have Q1, Q2, Q3, also T12, T13, T23, and also T123. So these are the relations of these QQ characters. So what I've explained is that for D4 and D6, you can get the QQ character, but it seems that for the D8 case, I don't know how to define this screen charge. So we don't have any nice definition of the screen charge. Don't have any nice definition of the screen charge. So, to obtain this, instead of studying the screen charge, we did a different process. So, it's like the fusion process of lower dimensional Q characters. So, if you're familiar with the representation theory of Pontorado, what you usually do is like study vector representations, take the infinite tensor products to get Fock representations, and study an infinite tensor product to get McMahon Horn representations. Then it seems that that's what you get also in this case. So, if you choose one of the D4. if you choose one of the d for qq character and take infinite products by shifting this q3 alpha minus one as this way so you're stacking the representations into the third directions and at the end you get this this extra character but even though you are taking this infinite products naively usually we're imposing the commutativity condition with the remaining screen charge otherwise you won't get the Otherwise, you won't get the correct answer. So, but for the DA case, since we don't have any corresponding string charge, we don't know how to derive it, and we can't reproduce the correct size if we just naively take the infinite product, infinite tensor product. But the monomial terms, you can get the monomial terms of these d8qq characters, except the sine factors. Then, the question is: how to define these sine extra sine factors. And so, this in our first paper, we didn't write it, but it seems that this is a story. So, first, you assume this kind of D8Q character where you have vertex operators giving the corresponding to the setup where you have solid partitions. And you have an extra coefficient here, which is the magnificent four partition functions up to extra sine factors. And you first assume that this is undetermined. This is undetermined. Then, if you impose the commutativity of these D8QQ characters, it seems automatically you can get the sine factor. So, this is a way to derive the complete D8QQ character that will produce the magnitude for partition function. Then, as a corollary, if you set this special value to Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, you can reduce the D8 QQ characters to D6QQ characters. QQ characters to D6QQ characters. So this means since the commutativity I explained here is general for every K1 and K2, then it means that all the D6 and D8QQ characters, the quadratic relations of this D6 and D8 all commit with each other. So it's something new and I think something strange happening. But from the gauge theoretical aspect, it's not so special because the composition of these QQ characters will give Composition of these QQ characters will give higher rank gauge group, so higher rank of gauge group. And for the D6 and D8 partition functions, it is known that the instantal partition function doesn't depend on the Coulomb branch parameter, so it doesn't depend on this x1 and x2. So here, this will give the u2, the rank two, I'm using four-parsitive function. Rank two, I'm using four participant function. Actually, you have a one-loop perturbative factor appearing from here, but you're cancelling with this. And then the fact that you have this closed formula implies that these two relations shouldn't depend on x1, x2. So of course they should commute with each other. And indeed, if you impose the condition of this commutativity, at the end it gives the sine factor. So everything seems to be consistent in this way. In this way. But unfortunately, it seems this is not true for lower-dimensional case. So if you study like V for the commutativity, the quadratic relations of these D4Q2 characters, you might get extra thermals. But for the moment, I don't know how to get a complete algebraic relations of these D4 and D2 case. And as I said briefly, so at the end, VPS CFD correspondence is. VPS CFT correspondence is just obtained by composition of these QQ characters. So, for the spike in Stanton case, you can associate QQ character for each D4 grains, and studying the composition of them gives the gauge origami system, gauge origami partition function of these spike instants. You can also do the story for tetrahedron instant case, and at the end, you'll get this. And using the D8QQ character I introduced a while ago, at the end, you get the complete. You get the complete multi-vision for partition function, including extra sign factors. Yes, yes, yes, after integration. So the QQ characters here are the expanded version of the operative value here. So this part. Any other questions up to here? So you mean how to derive this D8QQ character more systematically? No, no, no, I don't know. I don't know how to derive it. So you mean in this way, it's already trivial. So I'm explicitly writing down the counterintegral. Explicitly writing down the counter integral after the jq reciity, we get the extra signs and we give it expanded form. But from the algebraic viewpoint, you want to define everything without discussing like this. So in this way, I don't know how to derive. Yeah, so the reason why I don't understand this is because if you study the commutativity in studying the definition of the QQ characters, like studying recursion, so studying like the commutative screening charge and the The commutative screening charge and the transverse characters, at the process, you need to study the recursion relations of these contraction formulas. But in this case, I don't know how to get the recursion formula. So for the D6 lower than D6 case, everything seems to be like one parameter deformation for the quantum Florida algebra. So you have very nice whole structures and zero structures. But for this case, I don't know. Yeah, so a natural guess is like to study the D0 case. So you write down some AAA. You write down some operator, and so everything is transverse. So, for the D8 case, it looks like the transverse one is only a d0, but even you do that, you cannot get the answer. I don't know how to do it. So, for the moment, what I know is this derivation only. Yes. Yes, exactly. That's the part that I. Yes, exactly. That's the part I want to understand. So in the context of quantum Torrel algebra, so I don't know where that heat vector appears. So one possible answer would be how to define a screening charge because the screen charge should be somehow related to that vector. And defining that screen charge properly, maybe after you impose it, so the highest width will probably be the same, but the expansion might be different. I don't know. But for, yeah, yeah, I don't know. Yes, yes, yes. Any other questions? Okay. Then, since the since the title of this work Okay, so since the title of this workshop is to study the relation to quantum tool GL1, I'd also like to um roughly explain the relation with this GL1 case. But um for the moment um all of these are basically observations and so on the D2D4D6, each monomial terms of this D2D4D6 has a relations with the vertical representation of the toroidal GL1. So in this story you need to choose one direction and if you choose like And if you choose like this C4, and one way to see the relation, this GL1 is to choose C4, I don't know, S4, and then study the theory on this C4 case. And the QQ characters transverse to this C4 will become, we have these possibilities for this. So, for example, if you choose one. So, for example, if you choose one S4 and study the contractions of the screen you charge with it, and you take a Q4 to one limit, which is the negress of Shatashi limit, it becomes a vector Q character. You can also do the similar story for the D4 case, and at the end, it becomes the fork Q character. And you can also do the case for D6 brains wrapping the Q3 sub 1 to 3, and at the end, you get the Mach Mahong Q character. And in this Q character, And in this Q character limit, everything commutes. So, what this implies is that you have a nice beta gauge correspondence. So, for example, you consider like C4 and decompose, choose one direction here, and you have the transverse here. So, if you consider like the range including this part here, and you take the negroes of statistic limit, what you will get will be the beta-anzaz equations. On the other hand, if you consider the transverse. On the other hand, if you consider the transverse directions of it, if you take the NS limit, everything should become Q character. So it implies commuting Hamiltonians. And the relation between this should be the R matrix of the quantum total 01. And I think for basic examples with for D4 case, they are known, but for D6, I don't know what we have. And you can also generalize a sorry to like Calabius 3 times C. And in this case, what will happen is you will get here the R matrix of the Cubian or the Tribunal. Of the Pivi-Angian or the trigonal version. So, this is the relations with Torre to GL1. Have to hear any question? Okay. Then let me briefly explain generalizations of these QQ characters. So, one generalizations. So, if you study the representation theory of Torrell GL1, you'd like to expand you like to expand the you like to also consider plane partitions where you have non-trivial boundary conditions. So for the plane partition case, you'll have leg boundary conditions and some surface boundary conditions like this. And if you are familiar with like DT counting, so this part I think won't give any new stuffs because it's just the shifts of the origin, but this part will give an attribute. So defining a proper highest weight corresponding to this vacuum configuration. Highest weight corresponding to this vacuum configuration, you can introduce a QQQ character with respect to this, where you have boundary young diagrams like this, and also 1D partitions here, determining this part here. You can generalize the story to D8Q characters, and in this case, you have three non-trivial boundary conditions. So, the first one is the leg boundary conditions, where you have non-trivial plane partitions at the legs, at the four legs of the solid. Legs of the solid partition, but since I cannot draw it on the paper, so I'm decomposing it into one direction here and three directions here. So you will get for each layer of this Q4, you'll get a non-trivial D6QQ character with leg boundary conditions and extra turns here. So for example, if you look at this one leg here, in this fourth direction, you have this plane partition, I know, Yang diagram, Yang diagram, Yang diagram stuck in one. Yangdang, Yangdang, stuck in one direction, this gives the plane partitions. And if you focus on this four, you have all the same orange boxes in these four directions. So you get an infinite sequence of boxes extending in the fourth direction. You can also generalize the story-to-surface boundary conditions, and you'll have, in this case, six types of boundary conditions, but the figures will look like this. And you also can study the hypersurface boundary conditions. You also can study the hypersurface boundary conditions where all the boxes will be expanding infinity in the three-dimensional way. Then it becomes like this. So what I wanted to point out is that it seems that these QQ characters, if you take the wave of it, corresponds to the vertex term used to compute the invariant symmetry calculation portal portals. And since in the context of these countings, you can also glue the vertex terms in a proper way. So this leads to Proper way. So, this leads to the concept of waves of QQ characters. And at the end, the glued QQ characters will give the invariance of this toric coloristry and for. So, the reason I included this is because yesterday, our design counselor gave a brief explanation of these waves of reform W algebras for project corrupt chart, but the gluings here would be a little bit different. So, roughly speaking, if you write down a view wave diagram of View we have a diagram of the torics with four folds. You can write the brain waves like this. And if you consider like a D6 brain wrapping one part where you keep this like C, so consider like this three times C, then you can for each vertex you For each vertex, you can associate some kind of QGIS character like this, and also here. Then you can glue them in a way. So this gives a, and after taking the web of this, you get the DT invariance of these gluings. So if you study for the color before case, it becomes the necklace of Piatsulinga. The negroes of Piazza Lungas 4G network, like that. And also to comment: you have a screening current for this vertex. You have also another screening current for this vertex. And you can also introduce a higher dimension screening current that connects these two. So this is a different way to glue the these QQ characters. These QQ characters. So, I for the moment I don't know the relation with the WebSock WLGB, but this gluing procedure has a more nice way to understand. Okay, so let me just summarize. So, BBC52 correspondence gives a way to derive new types of deformed W algebras and an interesting setup is this gauge algorithm system. And I focus on the C4 case and show that the counter-integral formulas have nice free field realizations. And again, I also. And again, I also showed give a different way to derive these QQ characters and also explain the VBS shift decorum. Also, these QQ characters have relation to control algebras, and we also have further generalizations to like Tori Kalva. Okay, that's all. Thanks for listening.
