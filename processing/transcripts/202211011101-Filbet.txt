So, our next speaker will be Dr. Francis Philbert from the University of Toulouse. So, he is going to talk about discrete hypercoercive estimates for the Velassov Fokker-Planck equation. Thank you very much. The floor is yours. Thank you very much. And thank you for the invitation and to allowing me to present this work. Me to present this work. So, this is a joint collaboration with Alan Blaustein, who is a PhD student in Toulouse. And I would like to just say that this work has been initiated during the recent semester on frontiers in Kinity Theory in Cambridge. Thank you to the organizer for inviting me. So, here today, I would like to briefly present some results. Present some results we had on the cylindic model. The one we want to study is the Vlasov-Poisson system. So it has been described previously by Matthias. And here we will consider Fokker-Planck equation, a Fokker-Planck operator to model collisions between two different species. So our aim is to study the long-time behavior and some different Time behavior and some different asymptotic limit, and to provide the numerical schemes for that, which are able to reproduce this kind of phenomena. So our approach is based on a Hermit decomposition of the distribution function. And you will see that we will reformulate our initial Vlasov-Poisson-Fouca-Planck system in a different way, where a hyperbolic system with Hyperbolic system with source terms will appear. And then we will here I will give some basic properties on this operator, on an abstract operator, which will allow us to investigate in the same time the long-term behavior of the solution when t goes to infinity, propagation of regularity of the solution, and also to perform different asymptotic. To perform different asymptotic limits, where epsilon here is a physical parameter, and in particular, we will study the diffusive limit. Finally, if I have time, I will briefly present some numerical results. Okay, so let me start with the model we consider. Actually, I think almost everybody knows this system, but here I just would like to set the equations clear. To set the equations clearly and the notations. So we consider here the Vlazov equation, where the solution is given by a distribution function f epsilon, where epsilon is these parameters which appear in the equation. So you see there is an epsilon in front of the time derivative and also in front of the collisional operator, the Foucault Planck operator that you recognize here. That you recognize here, we have this parameter epsilon divided by tau epsilon. And more or less, tau epsilon is connected to the collision frequency. So here, so we suppose that, for instance, the distribution function represents the density of electrons, which interact through an electric field, which is generated by the particles themselves. And this electric field And this electric field comes from a potential phi. And phi is the solution to this Poisson equation, where you see rho epsilon is directly computed as the integral of f epsilon with respect to v, and rho i here is a given density, for instance, for ions. And we will suppose that it only depends on space and not on time. Okay, so here in this in this work, Here in this work, we would like to study simultaneously the limit t goes to infinity and epsilon goes to zero. So let me briefly describe the different phenomena. If we are interested in the limit t goes to infinity, then the distribution function will converge to a stationary state, which is given by the product of a Maxwellian distribution function, which corresponds to a Gaussian distribution function. Which corresponds to a Gaussian distribution times a density denoted by rho infinity only depending on x. On the other hand, if we now look the time evolution equation, but send the parameter epsilon previously given to zero, in that case the solution will converge again to a new distribution function given here in blue, which is And here in blue, which is again the product of a Gaussian distribution function now times a density rho, which now depends on time and position. And for instance, if we consider the diffusive limit, the density rho is given by this drift diffusion equation here. But it's important to emphasize that now if we consider rho, the As the solution of this repulsive Kerasical model, if we investigate again the limit for this equation t goes to infinity, we recover the same stationary state. So here, the goal of this work is twofold. First, we would like to provide some quantitative result in the limit epsilon goes to zero and t go to t goes to infinity. t goes to infinity. And start from this study, we want to design some numerical scheme for which we are able to prove similar properties. So here in this short talk, I will just present the basic ideas at a continuous level and in order to reformulate the equations and show you the basic properties we have allowing to prove these quantitative estimates. Quantitative estimates, and then, in order to design a numerical scheme, we have to adapt these properties at the discrete level. So, first, if we are so to simplify the presentation here, I will consider only one-dimensional system, but it's just to simplify the notation. All our work can be adapted easily to a high-dimensional problem. So, I denote this. I denote the Blazov equation like this. And here I will suppose that the electric field is given, is prescribed, and is coming from a potential capital Phi, which is smooth enough. We suppose that phi belongs to W to infinity. T0 times exponential minus phi here, where C0 is a press chi is given by the conservation of mass. And the Maxwellian distribution function is given by this Gaussian distribution function here. It corresponds to the steady state of the Fokker-Planck operator. Okay, so this is the long-time behavior. And now, if we suppose that 2 epsilon Suppose that to epsilon is given as the product of a constant to zero times epsilon squared in the previous equation, then we can perform a limit, epsilon goes to zero, and we get a non-trivial equation. If we consider to epsilon proportional to epsilon, it corresponds to the asymptotic limit t goes to infinity. So, here the interesting scaling is this one, the diffusive one. And in that case, for instance, if we perform In that case, for instance, if we perform a change of variable, x becomes x plus to zero epsilon v, then we define pi of t x as the integral of f of r of t x minus two zero epsilon v times v. Okay, we compute the time evolution of where f is solution to the equation one or the Vlasov equation, then pi is solution to Then, pi is the solution to this equation. And you see that this formulation is interesting because it gives us almost, it allows us to identify the asymptotic limits. Here you recognize a diffusive part, which corresponds to the diffusive part in the limit. And now, if we suppose that when epsilon goes to zero, this quantity converges to Euro, then we find the asymptotic equation. the the the asymptotic equation here which which is the the the equation on rho to zero given here this is the drift diffusion equation so that is in in in this limit epsilon goes to zero we we can prove that f converges to rho times m where rho to zero sorry is solution to this drift diffusion equation and the important point here is not only to prove convergence but to have error estimate with But to have an error estimate with respect to epsilon. So to do that, we will reformulate our problem using a Hermit decomposition of the distribution function. So to do that, we prescribe a weight function, omega of v, which is the invert of a Gaussian distribution function. And from this weight, we construct a weighted L2 space given by this space here, such that Space here, such that so we consider g a measurable function such that this integral here is finite. For this weighted L2 space, we can construct the natural inner product and the corresponding weighted L2 norm. Okay, and now we choose the following basis function, psi n, which are called the Hermit function. called the Hermite functions. Hermit functions are given by the product, again, of this Gaussian distribution function times the polynomial hn, which is called the Hermite polynomials. And the interesting property of these Hermit functions is that they form an orthonormal basis of this weighted L2 space. To construct the Hermit polynomial, we adapt a polynomial, we adopt a recursive relation. We denote by h minus one equal to zero. H0 is a constant polynomial, one, and then we construct the following, the other polynomial h n using this recursive correlation. Okay, so now from this approach, we have an orthonormal basis. Orthonormal basis of the weighted L2 space. And the idea is to expand the distribution function, solution to the Volazov-Foker-Planck equation in this basis, and so that now the equation on F is replaced by a system of equations on the Hermit coefficients denoted by CK, where this Hermite coefficient now only depends on T and X. On t and x. So we have replaced an equation for f depending on time x and v by a system of equation on Hermit coefficient depending only on time and x. And more or less, the k variable can be viewed as a discretization of the velocity space. Unfortunately, if we work with this Hermit coefficient, C k, Hermit coefficient C k, the natural space now for the space variable is a weighted L2 space with the weight rho infinity minus one, where rho infinity denotes the steady state of the Vlasov-Foker-Planck equation. So this is not very adapted for the space discretization since we want to perform some integration by part, for instance. By part, for instance. So, the idea is to work with a flat metric, and to do that, we just divide the Hermit coefficient ck by the square root of rho infinity. Like this, our new unknown will be the Hermit coefficient dk, for which we will get an equation which is more symmetric than the equations verified by the coefficient CK. Indeed, the equation. Indeed, the equation on decay is given by this system of equations now, where we have the time evolution of decay given by this operator here. I will come back to it later. And here, this source term corresponds to the discretization of the Fokker-Planck equation, because here, Hermit functions correspond to eigenfunctions of the Fokker-Planck operator. So we now have a double. Operator. So we now have a diagonal operator for the Fokker-Planck equation. And here this operator, square root of k times A dk minus one, and this operator A star dk plus one describes the transport part. So the two operators, capital A and capital A star, are given by these two operators. So here, the first part you recognize the free transport operator, dx of u, the type. Operator dx of u, the time, the space derivative, whereas this part corresponds to a source term corresponding to the discretization of the E grad V F part, which now becomes a source terms since we have eliminated the velocity variable. So now, instead of studying the Vlazov-Foker-Planck equation, we study this system of equations. So we can verify. So, we can verify easily that this new system is symmetric, so the system is hyperbolic, and so we have replaced the kinetic equation by a hyperbolic system with a source term. Now, let me briefly give some properties on the operator A, which will allow us to study the long-term behavior of the solution and the asymptotic limit. The asemptive limit. So the first point is that we have used in our previous notation two an operator A and A star. And actually, we observe that A star corresponds to the dual operator in the classical L2 space of the operator A. That is, the two operator A star and A satisfy this equality here. So this will be. So this will be useful, for instance, to perform some integration by part, and it is a property we want to preserve at a discrete level. The second property is related to the well-balanced property and the steady state. Indeed, if we denote by d infinity zero, the first, so this corresponds to the first Hermit coefficient, the zero that we have here. zero that we have here, we call it the square root of rho infinity, and it corresponds to the steady state of our hyperbolic system with source term. And so what we ask is that this quantity, square root of rho infinity, is in the kernel of A. And again, when we will design a numerical scheme, Design numerical scheme, we want to preserve this property in order to have a well-balanced algorithm. Then, in order to study the long-term behavior and the asymptotic limit, we also need two other properties about the operator A and A star. The first one is that at the continuous level, if we sum A plus A star, we observe that this is exactly equal to the multiplicative operator by the derivative. Operator by the derivative of the potential phi. This is quite difficult to preserve this property at the discrete level, but the one we want to preserve is this estimate here, in the sense that if we apply A plus A star to any function u in L2, we want that this quantity in L2 norm is bounded by a constant depending on the W1 infinity norm of the W1 infinity norm of the potential phi times the L2 norm of U. Then the last property we are interested in is about the commutators. So starting from A and A star, we define the following commutator like this, given by A times A star minus A star A. In the continuous case, In the continuous case, we can verify that this is exactly equal to the second derivative of phi. Again, this property is quite difficult to preserve at the discrete level, but what we will require at the discrete level is to prescribe that if we apply the commutator to any function u and estimate this quantity in L2, this has to be bounded by a constant depending on the. Depending on the W2 infinity norm of phi and times the L2 norm of u. Okay, so now if we have these four properties on the operator A, we can prove the following result. So the first one is concerned the propagation of regularity and the long-term behavior. So first, let me define a kind of a kind of equivalent H1 norm for the unknown D, which corresponds to the sequence DK. So we define the L2 norm of B D, where B is a differential operator given by BK equal to A when k equals to zero and A star when K is non-nule. In that case, when we ask the In that case, when we L2 norm of B D is given by this quantity, and it is this quantity that we want to propagate in order to prove propagation of regularity in the space variable. So, we have the following result. The first one is about the convergence to the steady state. So, we define d infinity as a sequence such that the first term Such that the first term corresponds to the square root of rho infinity, whereas all the other coefficients are equal to zero. Okay, so it corresponds to the steady state of our system of equation. And we prove that the difference between d and d infinity in L2 norm is bounded by a constant depending on the initial data times the exponential of times the exponential of minus two epsilon over epsilon square times kappa t. So it means that we have exponential decay to equilibrium when t goes to infinity and we are able to prove that when to epsilon is proportional to epsilon square, this decay rate does not depend on epsilon. The second property is about the propagation of regularity. In that case, again, we compute the time evolution of B D of L2, which is more or less a H1 norm of D. And this quantity is bounded again by a constant depending on the initial value of B D of at time zero times exponential of minus two epsilon over epsilon squared times. two epsilon over epsilon squared times k kappa t so it this show us that uh the solution the the we have propagation of the of this h1 norm uniformly with respect to time okay the second property okay so so some uh some some comments about the the proof sorry so the main idea here is to use the relative entropy estimate Relative entropy estimate, but unfortunately, this is classically known. We do not have any dissipation on the coefficient d0, that is on the density rho. So we have to modify the relative entropy in order to get the correct dissipation. And to do that, we adapt the hypocoercivity method. For instance, the argument developed by Jean-Dolbeau, Christian Charles. By Jean-Dolbeau, Christian Schmeisser, and Cléma Mouaud. And we adapt this to our Hermit decomposition. And actually, the functional framework is exactly the same. So it's not difficult to adapt this strategy in this case. And so you see, the main argument is to work with the new entropy relative entropy, H0, which corresponds to the classical L2 entropy plus a reminder term. Here I will not. Term here, I will not give too many details, which allow us to get the correct dissipation on the coefficient d0. And by estimating this new relative entropy, we can prove the result. The second one concerns the diffusive limit epsilon goes to zero. So now we will consider for this result that to epsilon is equal to to zero epsilon square. is equal to zero epsilon square and in that case we expect that the solution converges to a drift diffusion system. Again for to study this system we evaluate the relative entropy corresponding to the weighted L2 norm F minus rho m and in our framework it corresponds to this quantity here, E1. Then under some assumption on the initial Some assumption on the initial data, we have the two different results. The first one is that this relative entropy converges to zero when t goes to infinity, and we are able also to have an error estimate with respect to epsilon. So, here you see, if you look on the right-hand side, there are different behavior. The first one corresponds to the initial layer. Corresponds to the initial layer, which goes to zero very fast. Then, after a while, when this quantity becomes small, we have a reminder term which is of amplitude epsilon square. But this quantity also converges to zero when t becomes large. And of course, it depends on the constant depending on the initial data. So, here we have a decomposition on the So here we have a decomposition on the error, which is quite precise, where we see the initial layer and then the error with respect to epsilon, and finally a long-term behavior, relaxation which relaxes to zero. This is for the relative entropy, but we can also evaluate the convergence of the solution, the first Hermite coefficient, to the solution. To the solution of the drift diffusion equation denoted here by d0. And again, we get exactly the same behavior with an initial layer plus an error now of amplitude epsilon, but this error converges to zero when t becomes large. Okay, but here the result is weaker since it is for a in the norm h minus one. In the norm h minus one. And again, to prove this result, we modify the relative entropy. If I have time, yes. So yeah. Yes, okay. Yeah, I think we have two minutes left. If there are some quick things, yeah. So I just want to, okay, just to want to illustrate this result on some numerical result when we discretize the operator. When we discretize the operator capital A, and then we prove exactly the same phenomena, where we see that the disentropy is decaying with respect to time. And when epsilon goes to zero, the disentropy decays faster, but it starts to saturate when epsilon becomes smaller and smaller. And this decay rate here, the last one, when epsilon is smaller. Here, the last one when epsilon is small, corresponds to the decay rate of the drift diffusion equation. So, we okay. And finally, we also observe this quantity, which is interesting since we observe a very classical oscillatory behavior of this relative entropy here, and again with a decli rate which is sensitive to the values of epsilon. Epsilon. So, to conclude, here we have a proposed Hermit decomposition of the Blasov-Foker-Planck equation. And this approach allows us to construct and to prove that the solution has the correct asymptotic behavior. And to do that, we have adapted some hypercoercive estimates at the discrete level. And the current work is to adapt this. Current work is to adapt this when we consider the coupling of the blaster with the Poisson equation. Actually, it's not difficult to adapt the scheme using, for instance, a splitting strategy, but it's much more difficult to adapt the hypocoercive estimate for the non-linear analysis. Okay, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for the nice talk. Do we have any questions from Do we have any questions from the audience? Okay, we have a question from the audience. Hello, Frances Alina here. It's a very nice talk. I was wondering about this assumption that tau of epsilon is epsilon squared. Is it the only case in general you can consider, or you can consider different regimes as? Different regimes as well? So, here in our analysis, we can consider different regimes, but actually, the most interesting case here is the one with epsilon squared, because we get a time evolution equation. If we take 2 epsilon equal to epsilon, it corresponds to the convergence to the steady state. So the equation is trivial. Right, right. Oh, I see, I see. Right, right. Oh, I see, I see. And this tau epsilon is not essential here at all, right? No. No. Okay, I got it. Okay, okay, great. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you again for the very nice talk. So I think in light of time, we should probably move on to the next speaker. And thank you. Okay, so our
