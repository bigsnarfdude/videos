I don't hear that much sound anymore from the room, but that might just be. Can you hear me now? Yes. There's a little window that popped up over your screen, so we're just trying to get rid of it. Okay. Thank you. Okay, great. So, our next speaker is Flora Brogarden, who's a postdoc at Columbia University and CCA. They're a junior fellow in the Simon Society of Fellows, and they're going to talk about gravitational wave paleontology. Yeah, no, thank you so much. And I hope everyone can hear and see me. Sorry. See me. Sorry, I'm not there in person. I had to like last minute change my travel plans due to some personal circumstances. But nonetheless, I'm very excited to kind of share with you maybe like some challenges that we're having in the field that I call gravitational wave paleontology. And so this is the name comes from that, like we're kind of saying that, like, massive stars for me are the dinosaurs of our universe, but we're trying to use fossils, namely. Fossils, namely black hole collisions, which are the remnants and the fossils of mesostars, to learn about how mesostars once formed, lived, and died. Very similar to how paleontologists use fossils to study dinosaurs. So I just wanted to introduce you to the field and then hopefully discuss some opportunities or problems and brainstorm on ideas. Okay, so to begin, what I'm talking about are these massive stars. What I'm talking about are these massive stars that, compared to our sun, shown here in yellow, are typically about 10 to 100 or 200 times the mass of our own sun. And these stars are extremely rare in populations. So they live fast and die young with lifetimes that are a thousand times shorter than the life of our own sun. And also extremely rare. So the initial mass function tells us that only one out of a thousand stars is typically born as a massive star. And so And so, together, this means that they're extremely rare in populations. And so, it really requires super expensive telescope surveys to study massive stars in our own Milky Way. And it basically becomes almost infeasible or impossible to study individual massive stars in other galaxies and other environments, further away than our own Milky Way. And so, as a result, very little is known about these. Old, very little is known about these massive stars to date. But one thing that we do know is that they play an incredible role in shaping our universe through all these different processes. So for instance, they trace and trigger star formation. They provide a lot of feedback. They make these crazy trends, such as X-ray binaries. They often outshine galaxies, especially early in the universe. And they might be responsible for some of the main sources of real. Some of the main sources of reionization. They form black holes and neutrostars, and for instance, they produce all the oxygen and many other heavy elements that we breathe today. And so these stars are super important, and we really want to understand them better and know them better to learn about our own universe. Now, something that we do know since a few years is that these massive stars almost always live in pairs in binaries, and these stars. And these stars, when they live in pairs, they actually interact during their lifetimes and they can exchange mass, for instance. And eventually, when these massive stars die, they go supernova, and they might both explode. And if they can stay together throughout all these phases, and after supernovae, they might form a pair of black holes. Now, I don't have the visualization budget of interstellar, so I'm gonna just visualize them with. I'm going to just visualize them with like two marbles here. And these two black holes, if we can form them, they will spiral in slowly and slowly due to the loss of gravitation waves and eventually collide and making a slightly more massive black hole shown here. Now, this is interesting because as of twenty fifteen, we can now see these collisions of black holes through gravitational waves. So with LIGO, Virgo and Kagra, we're observing gravitational waves. We're observing graph de Genoese, and in the beginning, we had like a few events, then 10, and now we have about 100 events. And right now, of four, the fourth observing run is going, and we're expecting like to double this again to 200 or 300 events in a year or so. And so, this kind of gave us this new idea of that maybe we can use those black hole collisions and those observations of their masses, their rates, et cetera, to then study how these massive stars once upon a time. Massive stars once upon a time formed, lived, and died in our universe. And so, this is what I call gravitational wave paleontology. To use the massive star fossils to study the massive stars themselves. Now, this is extremely interesting, especially for astronomers, because of a very special property. And for that, we kind of have to take a look at this picture of the universe where on the left, you have the Big Bang and then the first stars forming, and all the way to the right, you have like the present-day. Way to the right, you have like the present-day wretched zero universe where Leico, Virgo, and Kagra are and are observing. Now, the special thing about these black hole collisions is that actually these stars might form throughout the universe and produce like a pair of black holes within a few million years, which is super short in astrophysical lifetimes. But then it can take easily many giga years before the black holes eventually collide. And so, this is an animation where you see. And so, this is an animation where you see different stars being formed at different redshifts and colliding at different redshifts. Of course, they still reside in their galaxy, and this galaxy basically evolves over time. But what this means is that the black hole collisions, even the one that we see today, that are relatively local and nearby us and colliding nearby us, these black hole collisions might actually have formed from pairs of stars that were formed much early in our universe, from this mixture. Universe from this like mixture of redshift, possibly as early as the first star formation. And so, in practice, what this means is that it's actually really difficult to immediately go backwards from like when we see a pair of colliding black holes to immediately go backwards and say, okay, these are the pairs of massive stars that formed them, because they're kind of coming from this mixture of stars, possibly. And so instead, what we have to do is we have to like forward model. Have to like forward model populations of stars. So instead, we take populations of stars, like hypothetical stars, that we forward model with our favorite model, and then we look at the properties of gravitational wave sources they leave behind. So you can kind of compare it how maybe in paleontology, if you want to study whether a dinosaur had feathers, it's not so easy to just look at the fossil and detect feathers. But you can model like what a dinosaur with and without feathers would look like. Fossil feathers like would look like in fossils and compare that to observations. So, this is very, very similar. And so, in practice, these simulations, like you can visualize them like something like this, where you put in like hypothetical pairs of stars, say with different masses as initial conditions. And then your simulation, these are called population synthesis simulations, will tell you whether that particular pair of initial conditions indeed formed a successful source, so a gravitational wave source. Source, so a gravitational wave source, which consists of like two black holes colliding. And so, in practice, it looks something like this: where we have a simulation box that takes into account all these phases, such as stellar evolution, but also binary interactions, such as mass transfer, supernova explosions, and then, based on a set of initial conditions, can decide whether this binary forms a gravitational wave source. Okay, so this sounds Okay, so this sounds great. We have a way to forward model these pairs of massive stars. So you would think, great, we're there. And actually, by doing it this way, often these, like a single calculation of a single pair of massive stars, like takes less than a second. So you could say like, problem solved. But if there's one thing I hope to share with you is that there's actually a big problem in doing this forward modeling of population of stars. That's like basically limiting. That's like basically limiting our entire field right now in doing gravitational wave paleontology. And this is what I call the gravitational wave paleontology uncertainty challenge. And that is that in this step of evolving stars, there are so many uncertainties and barriers that we have to overcome that it basically becomes infeasible to explore all uncertainties and truly map out our simulations in order to successfully. In order to successfully map back binary black hole collisions to pairs of massive stars. And so I wanted to share quickly what these are. So the first step or barrier is that we're not entirely certain about how these pairs of black holes form. So they could form from pairs of massive stars that start out pretty wide, like in the fields. So an example is this formation channel that we kind of briefly discussed where we just We kind of briefly discussed where we just have two stars rotating around each other, going through many different phases and interactions that eventually brings them close together and can form a gravitational wave source. But there's also all these other formation channels, like maybe they actually form, for instance, dense stellar environments, such as globular clusters or young open star clusters, where they can interact dynamically with many, many other stars and black holes. And maybe that is the process that brings them together. That brings them together. And so, in practice, people like me have to rerun our entire simulations, but for all these different formation channels, like including all these different formation channels, which makes it much more expensive. The second barrier is that actually the initial conditions of stars in the universe are very uncertain. So, where, when, and how do these massive stars form as a function of redshift or the age of our universe? Redshift or the age of our universe. So think of things of like how many stars are in binaries to begin with, what are their initial masses or initial separation distribution, and also, for instance, what is their initial metallicity, so the amount of metals in the star. And this turned out to be very important because, for instance, the metallicities that stars start out with can drastically alter like what kind of black hole the star leaves behind, as shown here by the total mass of the binary black hole system as a function of metallicity. system as a function of metallicity. And so in practice we shouldn't just like explore and initial conditions of different stars of just the masses, but all these different axes of different initial properties that these stars can have, dramatically kind of exploding the parameter space to begin with. And so we have to run simulations, but like varying stars and drawing stars basically from all these initial conditions. Now the third Now, the third hurdle, and maybe one of the biggest ones, is that these gravitational wave sources are an extremely rare outcome of stars, meso stars, both in real life and in these simulations. So typically, you'd have to try a million pairs of massive stars with different masses or separations, and typically only find that only one of those million stars that you try will actually form successfully graphedition wave stars. Graftish wave stars. So, most pairs of stars that you'll try will disrupt during their life and break up. And so, this is why you get a lot of extra noise. The fourth barrier is that actually this stellar evolution is super uncertain. So we saw, for instance, one of these faces, but in practice, we have a lot of free brown-dressed prescriptions to describe the stellar evolution in these faces that are asserted. That are uncertain, and so we kind of have like dials or knobs that we vary with different parameters, and then we rerun our simulations, like changing that and completely rerunning the entire simulation. And the last barrier is that this stellar evolution is really uncertain. So maybe this is one of those parameterized prescriptions with three knobs that we use to describe this phase of mass transfer. But in practice, it should really. Mass transfer, but in practice, it should really be this like hydrodynamical simulation that much more resolves all the detail that's going on in this phase. And so, what we really want to go towards is like not only rerunning it for all these different things, but also having enough computational time left that we can actually implement more detailed prescriptions. And so, this is often why gravitational-wave paleontology right now feels more like maybe this than successfully like overcoming. Than successfully overcoming all these barriers. And so this is really vital because right now, every single person that's trying to do this forward modeling is running into all these barriers and has to limit their own set of simulations, which is like limiting us from how much we can learn about massive stars from gravitational events. So I wanted to share with you a few things that we've tried, statistic techniques that we tried to basically make these simulations cheaper or like speed them up or Cheaper or like speed them up or be smarter about doing this. And so the first one is to attack that they are rare. So one of the things that I did is like developing this algorithm that I called Strope Baffle that's based on adaptive importance sampling. And it basically works very similar to using the game or playing the game Battleships, where in principle, when you're trying to play the game Battleships and you're trying to find like these ships in this two by two In this two by two grid of locations, you could play this game like completely random and just randomly try the next square and see if it performs a hit. But most people have probably used this like explore and refine technique where like once you find a hit, you actually try to explore and refine around it, which will actually much more efficiently and faster find the location of these shifts. So you can actually do something very similar for these gravitational wave simulations. These gravitational wave simulations, where by default everyone samples random the initial conditions of like these pairs of massive stars. But by having this like adaptive, important sampling technique, you can actually say, okay, maybe once you find a lot of hits, you can kind of search around it and zoom in. Of course, it's a bit more difficult because actually we're now dealing with this much higher dimensional space. We're dealing with these like islands that we're trying to find are now the stars or the stellar properties. Or the stellar properties that produce a successful graph dictionary source, but they're much more, you know, we're not sure how many there are to begin with. They're much more like discontinuous and more scattered. So it becomes very, very challenging to do this. But we did this. And one of the things that we found and we're working on now is that once you go to higher dimension, actually these standard important sampling techniques run into a lot of issues, where actually as you go to higher dimension, you become Of as you go to higher dimension, you become less efficient in basically sampling this higher dimensional space. So, one of the things that we've been working on is using this kind of like generational adaptive importing sampling to basically like update our sampling distributions on the go. But I would love to hear more like ideas or suggestions to overcome this. Other things that people are trying is instead to use active learning to basically say, okay, if we want to reduce the number of simulations that we have to do. Reduce the number of simulations that we have to do. Maybe we can kind of learn like these parameter spaces, what the outcome is, and in a smarter way, like here on the right, decide where we should put our next simulation. But you can already see here that we're dealing with all these kind of like small, funny islands that are in the space that are actually really difficult to resolve. Like if you don't know beforehand how many of them there will be. And these islands could be really, really interesting and important parts of our simulation. People have tried. People have tried to use Monte Carlo marker chain techniques, so MCMC, and improve this to maybe more directly optimize some of these hyperparameter spaces. But again, this is challenging because none of our models might be right. So it's really difficult to kind of find the maximum likelihood and say, okay, now we have the right value for some of these parameters when maybe none of our models truly give the right. Give like the right solution. And then recently, people are also looking into, including Derek Bingham, who's here, like been looking into, can we maybe use like certain equification or other techniques to like emulate some of our simulation outcomes? But maybe to summarize, this sounds depressing because it is a big challenge and we haven't completely figured out yet how to fix it, but it's a promising field. And this is, for instance, to give you an overview. Field and this is, for instance, to give you an overview of the gravitational wave number of gravitational wave events in the coming years. And it's rapidly increasing, right? So, this is very similar to the FRBs that were shown, where now we have about 100 events, but in the next decades, we're going to go to like millions of events per year of gravitational sources. And most excitingly, we'll not just see things up to redshift one, which is the current detection limit. Detection limit, but these next generation detectors will actually see these black hole collisions collide in the entire universe, so up to and beyond redshift 20 or 30. And so something that a lot of people don't realize is that these detectors will actually see every single black hole that's colliding in the universe like each year. So there's like no selection bias or like instrumentation bias. We'll just literally see like every event, which is just a huge data set. Which is just a huge data set. And so, personally, I'm really hoping that maybe with some of these extra dimensions, like maybe we can start looking at rates as a function of redshift, we'll be able to maybe distinguish some of these formation channels in addition to maybe using additional observations such as other gravitational wave observatories as well as electromagnetic counterparts. That will hopefully bring us to this next picture where we're going from this left, you know, failing to understand these uncertainties. You know, failing to understand these uncertainties to this future picture where we can understand and better constrain these uncertainties and basically reduce the cost of our simulations to then better do this forward modeling and understand gravitational wave sources so that we can hopefully learn about massive stars and their process in our universe. So that's it. And I would love to hear if anyone has any ideas for how. Ideas for how to overcome some of these challenges in this field. Thank you so much, Laura. Got questions? Yeah, thanks. How are you doing? I have no idea where the camera is, but I hope you're doing well. Well so it's
