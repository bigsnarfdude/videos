 So the last speaker of this section is Professor Deem Fieldman, and his talk today is on the video principle for the fish-subman falls. That's welcome. Okay, thank you for the introduction and thanks a lot for the organizers for the conference and for. For the conference and for inviting me, giving me the opportunity to speak here. Okay, so that's the plan. It's going to be about the well principle in Finster geometry. It's joint work with Thomas Vannerer. So some of you might have heard me speak about something like that in Vienna a couple of years ago. Since then, we understood the situation a bit better. In particular, we know that something know that some things happen generically but we have explicit counterexamples uh nevertheless so uh i will try to uh stress those uh new developments okay so uh let's uh let's start with the background and the motivation so uh steiner's formula what is steiner's formula you take a convex body in a ring a compact convex set compact convex set and then you look at the volume of its epsilon extension this formula appeared a few times this conference so i'll be very quick this is a polynomial on epsilon and you look at the coefficients they're certain functions of k when you normalize them correctly namely you put here this volume of the euclidean volume of dimension k what's left is called the kth which is called the kth intrinsic volume of k or the n minus kth gerames integral and uh well that's the uh the starting point of the story so some examples include the constant one that's zero the mean width that's one the surface area that's uh mu n minus one and the volume now uh the word intrinsic here has uh two The word intrinsic here has two different meanings. The first is that if you have a convex body which lies in a subspace inside the larger Euclidean space, then it doesn't matter if you consider it in the smaller one or the larger one. The normalization we chose guarantees that we will be getting the same case intrinsic volume. And the existence of such normalization is not somehow. not completely clear a priori that's uh that's uh something now the second meaning uh for the second meaning we will need to recall uh the uh tube uh formula of fermanweil here is what it says if you have a submanifold m inside some larger euclidean space and you look at small epsilons And you again consider the epsilon tube around m well it turns out that for epsilon small enough it's again going to be a polynomial and in epsilon just precisely a polynomial it's also easy to understand how small epsilon should be it's until you start intersecting yourself when you go perpendicularly to the manifold so Perpendicularly to the manifold. So that's the reach of the manifold. And so it's natural to call those coefficients again the intrinsic volumes of M. And so Weiler writes in his paper that up to this point, up to showing that this is a polynomial, that's easy, any student could do that, was remarkable. What's remarkable is that those coefficients they only depend on the induced Riemannian metric on M. So to prove that, he invented invariant theory, basically. Yes. Is epsilon to be positive or epsilon to be small enough could be negative? I think one is the original form is for all epsilon, right? So then I don't know what would the meaning of the left side be. know what would the meaning of the left side be for negative epsilon yeah because i think he proves that the tube is not just one of the direction so that when yes sure so i i'm talking here about uh close of manifolds but uh then the mu k is zero when k is out sure in wide case so different um well uh yes so if Yes, so if it's different if you consider the convex body or its surface. So, sure. Once you consider the surface, half of the coefficients would vanish. Okay. So in classical language, that would be like saying that those coefficients only depend on the first fundamental form. fundamental form and not on the second fundamental form. So now I want to take a different point of view, point of view of evaluation theory. So for this I will need to define or remind you what valuations are. So we consider a manifold x and we will write p of x for the subset of all differentiable compact polyhedra. compact polyhedra inside the manifold. So what is differentiable compact polyhedron? Compact, you know. That means that up to some diffeomorphism, it's the same as some part of a polyhedron, convex polyhedron in a linear space. Okay, and so one can use the same or similar formulas as before. As before, to extend intrinsic volumes to just all differentiable polyhedra on RN. And here comes an important definition, which is due to Alaska and Fo. So a small valuation on a manifold, which we will write as mu an element of V infinity, is V infinity is a map from those differentiable polyhedra to R or more generally complex numbers or some other ring, but we will use R, which can be represented as a sum of two integrals. One is just a measure, the integral of some measure over A. The second integral is the more interesting summons. You are integral. Summoned, you are integrating some differential form over the normal cycle of the set. So if you have such a representation with some sigma and omega, you say that mu is evaluation. I should say what is the normal cycle. So here is a picture. The normal cycle is just the union of all normal cones. So all the tips of the arrows that are pictured. That are pictured here. And that's a nice object. So it always has dimension n minus one. It's a Lipschitz submanifold. So you can integrate things over it. It's a nice object. And for some examples, we have the intrinsic volumes on our end that we saw before. They are smooth volunteers. Another, which is essentially a result. which is essentially a result of Chern, is the Euler characteristic is a smooth relation as a function on subsets of a manifold X. Okay, and there are various functorial properties of relations. Alaska studied them quite extensively, but we will only need one, that of restriction. Of restriction. Namely, if you have one manifold inside the other, then you can restrict. You can consider polyhedral here as a polyhedron here, and just as you would restrict functions. Very, very straightforward. Of course, one has to prove this gives you a valuation, but it does. And with evaluations in mind, one can Evaluations in mind, one can reformulate Weil's theorem from this point of view. So assume that you have a sub-manifold of Rn immersed or embedded as you'd like, and you look at the intrinsic volumes here and you restrict them here as valuations, as functions on certain subsets. So you get some smooth valuation here, and essentially, again, while Essentially, again, Weil's theorem tells you that those valuations are intrinsic invariants of the Riemannian structure that is induced on them. The simplest examples would be mu zero, which is just Euler characteristic, and the top degree one, which is the volume of a given subset. Okay, so now I want to reformulate, to say it again, using some category theory language without saying all the words, just naively. We can think of the situation as follows. We have an assignment, MUK, which takes a Romanian which takes a Riemannian manifold and assigns to it some valuation on it, which somehow depends on the metric. And in such a way that whenever you have an isometric embedding, then the restriction of whatever you have here, here is the assignment on the smaller manifold. So such a situation came to be known as Uh, came to be known as the Weil principle, so it first appeared in Romanian geometry, but recently it has been observed in various settings. So in pseudo-Romanian manifolds, you have a very analogous situation, except the valuations are a bit singular. But anyway, in quantum geometry, or more generally in dual Heisenberg manifolds. In dual Heisenberg manifolds, you also have such a collection of evaluations. And most recently, not yet even published, in Keller manifolds, a family of such intrinsic volumes. Hermitian intrinsic volumes has been constructed by Bernik Solanus and Vannerer. So we So we would like to know if something like this can be done in a Finsler setting. So one should say that in those cases, at least this one, this one, definitely Romanian, somehow algebra plays a big role, particularly the invariant theory that I mentioned before, which allowed Weil to prove his theorem. And in field-flow geometry, you don't have so much algebra. You don't have so much algebra to work with. You don't have the Riemannian curvature tensor. Of course, there are various objects, but many more. And so the question is whether something like this can be done. Okay, so let's start slowly. First, we want to look at norm spaces, of course. Uh, normal spaces, of course, just as we looked at Euclidean space in the beginning. So we start with the norm space Rn and we want to understand what are the intrinsic volumes there. So first we need to decide what is the notion of volume that we're going to work with, and that's going to be the Holmes-Thompson. the Holmsthompson uh Holmsthsen volume uh now in tensor geometry there's several definitions of volume i am going a bit later to give one argument in favor of this choice but right now let's just accept it so what is this definition of volume if you have some finsler submanifolds inside your norm space and you want to Space, and you want to compute its volume, what you do, you look at all the unit balls, unit tangent balls of this Finster manifold. You take the polar one, take the volume of that. That's your density with respect to some fixed density on the manifold. So this product here is the thing that's... Product here is the thing that's invariant. Once you fix some density on attention space, you can compute the volume of the polar body, and this product would not depend on the choice that you made. Maybe a better way to see it is to declare the Holstampsin volume as the symplectic volume of the cotangent ball bundle of the given Finster manifold. Of the given Finster manifold. This object is canonic, so a very natural definition. Okay, we have a notion of volume, and here comes some promising theorem, which in the positive definite case is due to Schneider and Weacker. And in the smooth. By the way, I didn't say, but we will assume that all our norms are smooth and strictly convex. Norms are smooth and strictly convex to avoid some pathologies. So, Alvarez Paiba and Fernandez and later Bernick gave, well, proved the following, that in a given normed space, Rn with the norm F, there are unique valuations, okay, which Okay, which extends the notion of volume such that if you take an n-dimensional sub-manifold, then plugging this manifold in will just evaluate its volume. So that's actually a theorem of Klein that if such flowations exist, they must be unique. And so the main point of the theorem is that they exist. So one not very good motivation to work with. Good motivation to work with Holmsterms and volume is that that's the only definition of volume through which such relations have been constructed are known to exist. It's not clear for any definition of volume or any other for that matter if they can be extended as volunteers. Later I will give a better motivation, but we have those intrinsic volumes and moreover it immediately follows that if you have one normal Folllows that if you have one norm space inside another, then the restriction of the intrinsic volumes here to the smaller one are going to be the intrinsic volumes of the smaller one. So we can think of it as a linear while principle. And we can now move on to us. We can now move on to asking about the general whale principle. So a couple of remarks. So I want to give some definition of those intrinsic volumes. So the quickest way to do it is by utilizing the Alaska-Fourier transform. I'm not going to say what it is, but it's somehow closely related to taking orthogonal complements. So, what you do, you look at the mixed volume with the polar of the unit ball. That's some valuation, and you apply inverse Alaska Fourier transform to it. So, the main thing to take from it is that those are not the coefficients of the Steiner polynomial as you might expect. So, that's So that's a different object, except for Euclidean structures, then it is the same, but in general, it's something a bit different. Okay, so now we're ready to tackle the while principles. That question was asked by Jofo. If you embed a Finster manifold isometrically into a neural space, are they induced Phase are the induced evaluations, intrinsic invariance of the finstler structure on M. Okay, so that's the question. I should note that in fact it is there is a Nash theorem for Finster manifolds. In fact, it's so much easier than Nash's theorem. Nash's theorem, you have flexibility in choosing your norm. So, this is due to Brago and Ivanov, that locally you can embed isometrically any fits or manifold into a neural space. So, if such thing were true, then we immediately could conclude there is some natural family of intrinsic volumes of install manifolds. But alas, that's not. But alas, that's not to be. So together with Thomas Vonnerer, we showed that the answer is no. But in fact, there is a weaker property that holds in some cases. So now I am going to describe it in some detail. And for this, we will need a definition. So maybe at this point, I should stop and ask if anyone has questions. Questions or remarks? Okay. So here is a definition. Suppose that you have a submanifold of a linear space. We will say that it has the weak while property, abbreviated like this. If whenever you take an open subset on this manifold and some two norms. Manifold and some two norms F1 and F2 on your normal space in such a way that their restrictions induce the same finster structure on you, then the corresponding intrinsic volumes of those norms restrict to give the same valuation on you. And that should hold for every k. So how is it different from having the usual? From having the usual well principle. Well, we don't allow M to change. The only thing we allow to vary is the norm on the larger subspace. So that's some special case that's only interesting if you have norms. If you were working with Euclidean structures, then there is not a lot of room left. From left. But here that it's conceivable, there's many different norms that induce the same installer structure. While the Holmsthmpson volumes, they depend in some complicated fashion on the norms. So that's the weak well property. And here is what we can show. So suppose that you have an immersed Have an immersed submanifold. Then there is a trichotomy. Somehow the situation depends on the code dimension. If the code dimension is small, namely the code dimension is either one or two, then there is a weak while property. It holds unconditionally. If the code dimension is at least Is at least half the dimension. Feither the dimension or the dimension, at least half the dimension, but well, does not is not if the dimension is not greater than n minus three, then generically this property holds, but there are counterexamples. And if the co-dimension is large, if the dimension is small, less than half. The small, less than half the total dimension, then generically the weak wheel property will fail. Okay, so that's the situation. And maybe I'll start by showing you what are the counterexamples which correspond to number two. So the counterexample I like most is that of the Most is that of the S gray embedding. So, in two words, what is that? You have this projective spaces in R3, so two-dimensional projective spaces, and that taking the tensor product induces a map to an eight-dimensional projective space, right? So, if you have two vectors, you can think of it as a rank one. Run one linear operator, taking the inner product with one and mapping to the other. And if you write it in coordinates, then this is just this is a parametrization of this four-dimensional manifold in R8. And this is going to fail the Loquel property. Let me indicate why. Property, let me indicate why. This will be also important. This will also appear in the proof, obviously. So here is the reason for why it fails. You look at the second fundamental form. This is a bilinear form on the tangent space with values in the normal space. And it so happens that while the image of the while the image of the whole thing at the point is the full normal space if you fix one vector and you look at it as a the image as a linear map from the second vector to the normal space then the image is going to be just three-dimensional it's going to be strictly smaller and this difference is Is the reason why the weak well principle fails? I will explain it, try to explain it a bit better, why that's the case when we discuss the proof of it. So another family of counterexamples can be constructed by considering a surface, a generic surface in R5, and then just And then just taking the product with R. So once again, you have half the dimension. But so generically, while Wigwell principle should hold, but due to the way it's constructed, this degeneration again happens. The full second fundamental form is onto, but when you fix But when you fix one argument, it's not. Okay, so now in the remaining time, I want to mostly sketch some steps in the proof. So the first main ingredient, so very very Very important reduction, which is uh which we use uh uses the Alaska product. So that's some very important structure that Alaska defined on smooth voluntations. And I am not going to define it precisely, let me just say that it corresponds to intersections of intersection of convex sets, but it gives the smooth The smooth evaluations on the manifold, the structure of a commutative ring. And moreover, whenever you have an embedding, then the pullback, namely the restriction to a sub-manifold, is a homomorphism of the structure. So a product is mapped to a product. And the Holmstompson intrinsic volumes have the are multiplicative. So Are multiplicative. So if you take the Alaska product of the first intrinsic volume, you consider it to take its powers, you get all the other intrinsic volumes. So that means that immediately tells you that it's enough to analyze only the first intrinsic volume. Because if that restricts to something which is intrinsic, then also all the powers will restrict to something which is intrinsic. To something, which is intrinsic, and you know, if not, then not. And that's also the reason why Holmes-Thompson definition is chosen. So, in fact, if you want to find a family of intrinsic volumes, which is multiplicative, which is a property that you want if you want to do integral geometry, then you must choose Holmes-Thompson. choose Holmes-Thompson. There is no options because the first intrinsic volume is the same for any definition of volume. Okay, so we agreed that it's enough to consider mu1. That was the first important reduction. And now we can actually do computations with mu1. Mu one. So there is a scary formula here. I will get to it in a moment. But let me just say that we represent our evaluations using some n form on the sphere bundle. That's a representation which is due to Bernigan-Brocker. Essentially, this form is the differential of the omega we had before, the one that you integrate over the boundary. I apologize that I can't make pictures. That's because my first... because my first plan of using the iPad failed. And so I'm reduced to using the mouse. Well, actually, I can do this. So we had integrating over the normal cycle form omega. That's the omega here. Right. So once you have this representation for For the intrinsic volume in the large space, you start restricting it to a manifold. And it's not hard. So, let me first read out loud this integral here, this form, differential form that we need to describe. It's given by this big scary integral. First, the inner integral goes over this unit sphere of the normal. Of the normal space, the outer one goes from zero to pi over two. There is something called a metric function. Here you have the determinant of a matrix, which consists of the normal vector coming from here, and the second fundamental form, a minor with some indices at the point. And here we have something finally that depends on the norm and the inverse cosine transfer of the norm at a certain point. Of the norm at a certain point. So let me make a picture explaining why this integral appears. If you have a convex some subset, you want to restrict. So we're talking about the conormal cycle in the plane. It should be related to the conormal cycle in the larger space. So that's why we need to be integrating over all the vectors that project to a given vector. So that's those. So that's those vectors together with the I guess there's some internet problem for him. So first? Yeah. Is there a question? No, it's not a movie. I thought that you get an internet from what's my internet was. What's my internet was disconnected? We didn't hear your voice. We didn't it was frozen for a little bit. Yeah. Okay, so when did you lose me? Like two minutes ago or one minute ago. Very short ago. So did we finish point one? Did we get here? It's fine for me. Yes, we did get there. Yes, yes. Okay. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, and did they read out loud the integral? Yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay, there's not much. So, okay, so we have this family of integrals. And to understand whether or not the restriction of the volation is intrinsic, we need to understand whether or not those integrals are determined by the restriction of the norm on the ambient space. On the ambient space to all the tangent spaces of the submanifold. Well, in a neighborhood of the point. Okay. How do I make this go away? Probably should erase it. Clear. No, I need to clear all drawings. Okay. So in fact, it turns out that those integrals can Turns out that those integrals can be computed more or less explicitly. So, for instance, the zeros coefficient is just the inverse Causi transform of the restricted norm. So, you immediately see that this coefficient is intrinsic. It depends only on the restriction of the norm. Okay, then you go to the next family of coefficients corresponding to j equal to one, and they are given by the inverse hemispherical transformation. The inverse hemispherical transform, which is some other integral transform of this function, which is the derivative of the norm in the direction of the first fundamental second fundamental form with certain indices. So that's some normal direction to the manifold at the given point. Okay, so here we start. Okay, so here we start talking about derivatives. They are not a priori given. We know the values of the function, not of its normal derivatives. But one can notice that in some cases you can recover those derivatives from the restrictions if your manifold is curved enough. So if your manifold is curved enough, then you can look near a point and look at the values of the norm there. Of the norm there, and by taking the derivative, you will get the derivative in a normal direction. So, I can say it more precisely. If we have a normal vector, which is in the image of the second fundamental form, well, that means that it's given by h of u and some w. And then you extend Some curve which has w as its velocity vector, extend u by parallel transport along this curve, and then the derivative of the norm on this extension, sorry, it should have been u of t, is exactly going to be the normal derivative. So what happened? What happened is the following. If the image of the second fundamental form The image of the second fundamental form as a quadratic form coincides with the image of it as a linear map with one coordinate fixed in enough points in a dense subset. Then you can pull this off. You can use this trick to recover all the derivatives and then you will get the first coefficient. So there's something funny going on, right? If your manifold is flat, then Is flat, then you have the linear while principle. If there is enough curvature, then you can do the strip. It's the in-between cases where it's not so clear what's happening. Okay, so I don't have much time, so I'm going to just say some keywords. Something similar happens for all the other coefficients. You need to find derivatives of various orders along the different normal directions. And if you're Directions. And if your manifold is generic enough, then you would be able to do that. Now, for codimensions one and two, it's a bit more delicate because there we don't claim something about generic, but rather in all cases. And there, so okay, I really don't have time to do. To do this, then I'll just explain that when you talk about a hypersurface for dimension one, then you essentially find that either your second fundamental form is zero or this happens generically. And so all coefficients are recoverable. When the co-dimension is two, then that's the really delicate case. And there essentially have three options. Either your manifold Options. Either your manifold locally lies in the hyperplane, or we have this coincidence of images, which we can finish as the proof. Or finally, it could happen that as a bilinear form, it has rank one. And that means that if you remember, the formula for all those coefficients contains some determinants. And once j is greater than at least two, they will vanish. At least two they will vanish because this determinant there will vanish, and the first couple of coefficients we just discussed, they are very explicit and can be determined in this case as well. So it's some amalgamation of various constraints and low co-dimension that allows for this result to happen. Okay, then maybe let me conclude with Then maybe let me conclude with a couple of open questions. So while we showed that in general the whale principle fails, but it still leaves the possibility that it holds in co-dimension one and two. In co-dimension two, it seems very unlikely, but we don't have a proof. In co-dimension one, it could hold for the trivial reason that, for instance, in Romanian geometry, generically, from generically from dimension for hypersurface in dimensions four and higher the first fundamental form determines the second fundamental form so for hypersurface for generic hypersurfaces the while principle is in a sense uh trivial uh so maybe something like this happens also in a few stories setting and uh well uh Well, so that's one open question. The other, maybe more interesting, is to find some subclasses of Finster structures for which you do have well principle. So of course we have the Banach spaces. Another interesting family, maybe a bit less known, is that of Hilbert metrics, where you also can do something. You also can do something similar. So, is there some more general framework? Okay, so my time is up. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. Any questions or comments? If no, let's thanks the speaker again. Thanks, Tima. Thanks, Tima. Thank you. Yeah, and this is today's talk. And anything from Deepin? Oh, no. I wanted to have something to notice. No. No? Okay. Yeah. Actually, Chinese time may see you tomorrow.
