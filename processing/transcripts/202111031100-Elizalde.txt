Thanks, Jessica, and thank you to the organizers for the invitation. So what I'll be talking about today is joint work with my grad student, Ben Adenbaum. So unfortunately, he couldn't be here right now because he's teaching. So if there are questions, he cannot be here helping me to answer questions, but if there are questions that I cannot answer, you can always ask him. Cannot answer, you can always ask him later. Um, so this is sort of a new idea to apply row motion to pattern avoiding permutations, which is something I've been interested in for a while. So the first slide I have is probably not that necessary because I guess everybody knows what row motion is by this point. But anyway, it took me a while to draw this picture, so I may as well. So, I may as well show you the pictures I drew. So, here's a posit. We have an anti-chain in this posit, and then you can do the following operations. So, you can consider the order ideal generated by the anti-chain. Then you can take the complement of that order ideal. So, that's usually called an order filter. And then you can take the minimal element of this order filter. Elements of this order filter. And that gives you another anti-chain. So the operation that goes from this anti-chain to this other anti-chain is called row motion and anti-chains. Now you can keep doing this. So you could create an ideal again, take the complement, take the mill and male elements, and so on. So here, the operation that goes down from an anti-chain to the next one, that's called row motion and anti-chains. The operation that goes from an order ideal to the next one is called row motion. To the next one is called row motion on ideals. So it's pretty much the same, but sometimes it's sometimes one considers it on anti-chain, sometimes on ideals. So, okay, and this post-eth I drew here, this works for any post-set, but the post-eth I drew here is a very special post-eth that I'll be interested in today. So it's the positive root poset of type A. And one way to think about it is that every element in this posit In this poset corresponds to an interval ij, where i and j are integers between 1 and minus 1. And then these intervals are ordered by inclusion. So at the bottom, you would have elements, intervals of the form i, i. Then the second rank, you'd have elements i, i plus 1. And then at the very top, you'd have 1, n or n minus 1, depending on. Or n minus one, depending on how you're indexing it. Okay, so that's the type A root posit. And one reason I like this posit particularly is because the order ideals of this posit, you can think of them as big paths. So you can just separate the ideal from everything else. And if you draw this up and down steps in the right way, this is a bijection between order ideals of A and B. Of a n minus one. So I'll be calling it a n minus one throughout the talk, this post-it. And dn is what I'm going to be calling the set of dick paths of semi-length n. So that means that they have two n steps. Okay, so if you think of them as dick paths, then what I said before about the row motion on order ideals, you could just think of row motion on dick paths. On dig paths. So, this picture here: if you draw the dick path on each one of these order ideals, then row motion is this operation that takes each dick path to the next one. So I don't think I'm going to be needing this operation defined on dick paths, but again, I had already drawn these pictures earlier this week. So, I thought I was very proud of them. Okay, so the second part of the talk is three-to-one avoiding permutation. 321 avoiding permutations. So, the second part of the title, sorry, three to one avoiding permutations. So, probably most of you know what they are, but let me just define them. So, permutation is called three-to-one avoiding if there's if it doesn't contain a sub-sequence, a decreasing subsequence of length three. So, a three-to-one would be three entries that go from left to right, and they are decreasing. Pi i bigger than pi j bigger than pi k. I'm going to use this notation. I'm going to use this notation: s n of 3 to 1 is the set of 3 to 1 over impermutations of length n. And then I will draw them in this way. So I will draw these diagrams where I have crosses in position i comma pi of i. So what that means, so the way I draw the coordinates is as in the Cartesian plane. So 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, this cross here will be the 2, this will be the 4, this will be. Here would be the two, this would be the four, this would be the one, three, five, eight, nine, six, seven. So there are different ways of drawing this depending if you think of it as a matrix or not. But I'm not going to think of it as a matrix, but rather the elements go from left to right, and then the heights are the values. Okay, so then saying that it's three to one avoiding would mean that there are no three crosses, so that the one on the left is the highest, the one in the Is the highest, the one in the middle is the middle height, and the one on the right is the lowest. So this permutation is three-to-one avoiding, as you can see right away from the picture. Okay, so I need a couple more definitions. So I'm going to say a point in this, a cross in this permutation is an exceedance if pi of i is bigger than i. So these are all the crosses strictly above the diagonal. I'm going to say that a cross is a fixed point. A cross is a fixed point if it's on the diagonal by a vi equals i. And then there is this name that has been used. I don't know if I particularly like it, but I didn't make it up. A deficiency is the opposite of an exceedance. So it's a value that's pi of i is less than i. Okay, so I'm saying, okay, so three to one-off implementations will be connected to, will be related to the anti-chains. Will be related to the anti-chains I was talking about before. So, the way this works is that you can characterize the three-to-one avoiding permutation by looking at the positions and the values of the exceedances. So, if I gave you these four crosses, these orange crosses, then there's a unique three-to-one evident permutation whose exceedencies are given by these positions and these values. Its values. So that's not hard to see. And that means that you can, there's a bijection between three to one available permutations and anti-chains of that type A positive root posit. This is how you do it. So you take these exceedances, you draw the poset here, sort of tilt it 45 degrees. And then when you put it in the right way, this cross. In the right way, these crosses give you points, elements of the poset, and they form an anti-chain because the exceedancies are increasing for a three-to-one avoiding permutation. Okay, so this is a pretty simple bijection. I'm going to call it EXC, and it goes from three-to-one avoiding permutations to anti-change of the type A positive root posit. Okay, so So now, with this correspondence between exceedancies and anti-chains, so what I guess between permutate, three-two-avoiding permutations and anti-chains of the type A root both set, we can define a row motion operation on three-to-one avoiding permutations. So basically, all you do is you take the three-to-one avoiding permutation, you look at the exceedancies, you put them in an anti-chain like this, then you Anti-chain like this, then you apply row motion in the usual way. So you take the order ideal, the complement, and then the minimal elements that gives you another anti-chain. And now this anti-chain here on the right gives you the exceedancies of a unique three-to-one avoiding permutation, which happens to be this one. So then the operation that goes from this permutation to this permutation, we call that row motion at the level of three to one of the permutations. Of three to one avoiding permutations. Okay, so you can keep doing it. Now, of course, the things like looking at the orbits is not going to be interesting because those will be the same as the orbits of the anti-chains in this POSED, which are well known. So everything is known in terms of orbits. However, the advantage of looking at it in terms of permutations, one advantage is that we could consider statistics and permutations that don't. Permutations that don't have a natural description in terms of anti-chains, and then we can look at things like: are they homo messic when you look at the permutation statistics? So I'm going to do some of that, but first, let me show you an interesting thing that happens here. So, if instead of the anti-chains, sorry, instead of the exceedencies, we were to look at the deficiencies, and I see there's some discussion in the And I see there's some discussion in the chat about what this should be called. I guess anti-exceedance or co-excellence. But anyway, I've already written the slides, so I'm going to call them deficiencies today. So the deficiencies also form an anti-chain. And I guess the formal way to define it, you could say you're taking, you first take the inverse of the permutation, which is equivalent to reflecting the diagram along the diagonal, and then you apply the map EX. And then you apply the map EXC to that that will give you an anti-chain. If you do that, for example, here, this will be the deficiencies. If you flip this and then create an anti-chain, this will be your anti-chain. Turns out that when you apply row motion at the level of the permutation, that's the same as applying inverse row motion at the level of the anti-chain that comes from the deficiencies. So while the exceedencies So, while the exceedencies are doing row motion forward, the deficiencies are doing row motion backward at the same time. And this is equivalent to a result of Panushev, even though he didn't, of course, he wasn't looking at 3 to 10 overgrading permutations, but it's really the same thing. But anyway, it's a fun fact that you can do it with the exceedances, or you can do inverse row motion with the deficiencies. And it's the same thing. The same thing, okay. So, um, now if we can actually uh define row motion directly without looking at the exceedencies, and that can be done using some existing bijections between three to one avoiding permutations and dig paths. So here I'm drawing four bijections. Um, so I'm not defining them formally, but I guess the picture, I guess this is a definition by picture. Um, so this first one on the top left. First, one on the top left, what you do is you consider a dick path where the peaks, I guess, would be at the weak exceedances. So, a weak exceedance is an exceedance or a fixed point. So, I consider this fixed point is also a weak exceedance. So, then if the peaks are there, that gives you a dig path, and this is a bijection. You could also consider a dig path whose valleys are at the exceedances. And then you could do this backwards. And then you could do this backwards by looking at the weak deficiencies or the deficiencies. Now, these maps they've all appeared before. So I think the one in top right, I think this is the Billy Jokosh-Stanley map. The one in the top left was used by Christian Grand Thaler in 2001, maybe without this pictorial description, but it was essentially the same map. And then I also have a paper from when I was a grad student where I was. When I was a grad student, where I was looking at these four maps and combining them to try to prove equidistribution results on the path. So, why am I telling you about these maps? Well, because you can just define row motion in this way too. So, the operation I told you, row motion and three-to-one avoiding permutations, is the same as applying this map. So, this notation is supposed to mean that the exceed, you have the corners, this type of corners at the end. The corners, this type of corners at the exceedances. And this tells you you have this type of corners at the exceedances. So this map is, you apply this E, and then you apply the inverse of the other map. And let me show you in the picture. So suppose I have this three to one avoiding permutation here. Let's look at the red path. So this red path is what I call E. I don't know how to call this symbol. I guess upper left corner. upper left corner. So you apply this map to the path, to the permutation, you get the path. And now we're going to put the crosses instead of putting them in the upper left corners, I'm going to put them in the lower right corners. And I'm going to put dots instead of crosses so you can see the difference. Now, you could do this just for the exceedances and then reconstruct the three-to-wine avoiding permutation, or equivalently, you could do Or equivalently, you could do the blue path here at the bottom and then again do the same trick. So turn the upper left corners to the lower right corners and put dots. And if you put these dots here, they form a three-to-one avoiding permutation again. And that's the row motion of the original permutation. So here, the one on the right, all I did is I put crosses where I had dots before. Okay, so this. Okay, so this big path sort of helps you compute row motion. And in fact, I don't need to go through anti-change or anything. I could just have defined row motion this way or equivalently this way from the beginning. So here, if I do the same, I play the same game here with these crosses. So now I would do the paths that leave the crosses in the upper left corners. Left corners and then put dots in the lower right corners that would give me a three-to-one rowing permutation again, which would be row motion of that. And so I could do that again and so on. Okay. Now, something I learned at the conference a year ago, the same conference, the dynamical algebraic combinatorics conference a year ago, is that the map that goes from the red path to the blue path here is the Lalan-Crevera involution. Crevera involution. So I learned this at, I think, Mike Joseph gave a talk, and I never knew that this had this name, but I know now. So that's the Lalan Carvera involution. And I'm going to mention this involution again later on. But let me first tell you a little bit about these results about homo Medsy I was talking about. So, okay, so probably we. Uh, okay, so probably we are all familiar with these definitions too, but um, it's uh it's the first time I'm using the word homomassy in a talk, and I guess the same for row motions, so I might as well define them. So we say a statistic is homomassic if the average of the statistic on each orbit, um, of a well, I guess this could be any bijection, but in my case, this would be row motion, um, if the average is constant on each orbit. Constant on each orbit. And it's called C messic if that average is C. Okay, so the first statistic I'll be looking at on permutations is the number of fixed points. I call this FP. So there's this result that we proved that the statistic number of fixed points is one MESIC under the action of row motion on three to one avoiding permutations. So this is not very hard to prove. So, this is not very hard to prove, but anyway, I think it's a fun result. And here's an example of what I mean by this being one MESIC. So here's an orbit of row motion on three-to-one avoiding permutations. These red and blue paths are just sort of to help you compute row motion more easily. And in each permutation of the orbit, I can look at the number of fixed points, which are crosses on the diagonal. Are crosses on the diagonal. So this one has one fixed point, this one has two, this one has one, and so on. And if I average these eight numbers, one, two, one, zero, one, two, one, zero, the average is one. So this will happen for every orbit and for every n also. Yeah, in fact, I mean, this implies that the expected number of fixed points of a random three-to-one avoiding permutation is one, which is well. Permutation is one, which is well known, but I guess it's still. I always think about it as a fun property of three-to-one avoiding permutations. Okay, so yeah, and one comment is that this statistic is very natural on permutations, right? The number of fixed points is a natural statistic on permutations, but it's not, and it doesn't come from a natural statistic on the corresponding anti-chain. Like if I looked at this corresponding If I looked at this corresponding anti-chain, these orange elements here, I guess I could reconstruct the permutation and know that there was one fixed point, but there's no obvious way to look at this anti-chain and compute something and say, okay, there's one fixed point in that anti-chain. But it's natural at the level of permutations. Okay, so some other statistics. So these, unlike fixed points, these other statistics. Unlike fixed points, this other statistic is one that comes from anti-chains. And this was studied by Sam Hopkins and Mike Joseph. So they defined this statistic on, so remember, the intervals here correspond to elements of the posit. And these are indicator functions that are one or zero, depending on whether the element is in my anti-chain or not. So this statistic. So, this statistic, you can translate it to the permutations, and it corresponds. So, if instead of the anti-chain, you look at the permutation that whose exceedances form that anti-chain, then this statistic corresponds to the number of crosses in this shaded region where the square in the corner is counted twice. So, for example, Twice. So, for example, in this case, the value of the statistic would be two, because even though there's only one cross in this shape, it's in the corner, so it counts twice. So Hawkins and Joseph prove that these statistics are one MASIC on anti-chains. So, of course, it follows immediately that the corresponding statistics on the permutations are one MASIC. But the reason I'm talking about this. But the reason I'm talking about these statistics is because now we can consider some other statistics that are similar to these HIs, but those are not natural statistics on anti-chains anymore. And those will still have this homomessy property. Okay, so instead of this HI, let me look at what we call Li. So Li is the number of crosses in this region. So this is a region that goes all the way to So, this is a region that goes all the way to the corner. So, the HI region was going like this, like this, but here, this is an L that goes all the way to the corner. So, if I define L sub i of pi to be the number of crosses in this region, and the parameter i is because I could look at the ith. So, this is the ith row from the bottom and the ith column from the left, but i could be. Column from the left, but I could be anything. In this case, it's three. So the statistic here is the number of crosses in this shaded region. For this example, it's two. It's easy to see. It will always be zero, one, or two. It cannot be anything other than that. But we can prove that this statistic is also one MESIC under the action of row motion on three-to-one avoiding permutations. Okay. Okay, so now we have the fixed points, which I guess would be crosses on the diagonal. We have the HIs, we have the LIs, and all of those have exhibit homomassy. Here's an example of an orbit of row motion, and then for each one, I've looked at how many crosses are in this green region. And if I average all those numbers, I will get one. I will get one. That's what the theorem is saying. Okay, so the fact that the number of fixed points is homomatic, you can also deduce it from the fact that the Hi's and the Li's are one messic, because you could write the fixed points as summing all the L i's for all possible values of i, and then subtracting all the hi's for all possible values. HI's for all possible values. And because each one of these is one MESIC, this would be n minus n minus one, and it would tell you that the fixed points are one MESIC. So this is sort of a different, another proof. Okay, so I guess there are other things in the chat that we haven't been following. There's a combination of jokes and actual questions. Is there a relationship to the berries? Okay, I don't know if it's. Okay, I don't know if it's. I don't know where this associum came here, or maybe it's part of a joke. I don't know. Anyway, you can ask Nathan at the end if it's important. So, okay, so there's another statistic that we looked at. So, this is the sign of a permutation. Okay, so okay, so Tom has a question. Did any other Did you find any other homometic statistics that are linear combinations of those L's and H's? So, no, so that's a good question. So, we actually looked at other similar shapes. So, this, you know, this L shape seems sort of a little arbitrary. So, we thought maybe there are some other regions in this array that if you count the number of crosses in those regions, it will be homomystic. We didn't do it systematically. So, it's possible. Systematically, so it's possible there are some others, but we, I don't know, we did some obvious, we looked at some obvious things that didn't work. So for the, one statistic we looked at is the sign statistic, which can be defined as minus one to the number of inversions. And then, so the sign statistic has this nice behavior with rho. Behavior with row motion on three-to-one avoiding permutations. So, when n is odd, it stays fixed. When you apply row motion, the sign is fixed. And when n is even, it changes sign. So, for example, here's an example when n is odd. So, there's an orbit here of size 10, and for each permutation in the orbit, I've computed the number. bit I've computed the number of inversions uh so I guess I haven't defined them but inversions an inversion in in this picture would be a cross that's above and to the left of another cross so there are three inversions in this picture so for each um for each of these uh permutations I compute the number of inversions and you can see that it it's odd so it stays odd so the parity doesn't change through the orbit parity doesn't change through the orbit. If it's odd, then it's going to be odd for all elements in the orbit. This is what this theorem is saying. On the other hand, so here n was five, but if n was even, then the parity of the number of inversions would be alternating. So it's here's even, odd, even, odd, and so on. So that's what the theorem is saying. Now, for the case of even n, of course, it follows. Even n, of course, it follows from this alternation that the sign statistic is zero mesic because the average on the orbit would be zero. By the way, the number of inversions is not homomesic. So I just put the number of inversions here because it was easier to see from the permutation. But if you take the parity, then the sign will be zero messic, but the number of inversions itself is not. Inversions itself is not. Okay, so yeah, so in particular, so the fact that this is a zero MASIC, of course, it implies that the average over all permutations in all three to one avoiding permutations will be zero. So this means that the number of even and not permutations avoiding three to one is the same as long as n is even. Now, this is a classical Even. Now, this is a classical result of Simeon and Schmidt. So, this could be considered one of the first paper that systematically looked at pattern-evoid permutations. And it already looked at this fact that the number of odd permutations that avoid three-to-one is the same as the number of even permutations that avoid three-to-one. Now, there's a bijective proof of this that was given by Reife Garcia. That was given by Reiffegarste. And now Romotion gives another bijective proof of this because row motion switches the sign. And in fact, if you take, if you wanted to have not just a bijection, but the sign reversing involution, we could do this. So we could take the inverse of the permutation and then apply row motion. That would change the sign and be an involution. And be an involution. So it gives this nice involution between even and odd permutations that avoid three to one. So I see Jim is asking about whether sine times the number of inversions would be zero messic. I don't remember if we looked at that. I don't think so. So yeah, that'd be a nice statistic to try. Okay. So, yeah. Yeah, so I want to say a little bit about this. So I talked about the Laland-Crevera evolution for DICPAS. So it has also been defined at the level of anti-chains by Panushev. And so I think when Panushev defined it, he didn't realize this was equivalent to an involution for DICPATH. And then Sam Hopkins and Mike Joseph realized that this was. Realize that this was really the same evolution. If you want to define it for anti-change, this is how you could define it. So you can take a path. So in this picture, the Laland-Creva involution for paths takes the red path to the blue path. For anti-change, it would be the involution that takes these orange dots above the red path to the green crosses below the blue path. Below the blue path. So this is this involution between, well, from anti-change to anti-change of this POSET. Now, I'm mentioning this because there's a result that Sam and Mike proved recently. They were looking at anti-chains that are fixed by this LK involution and anti-chains composed with row motion and anti-chains. And they show that the number of And they show that the number of antichains that are fixed is this central binomial coefficient. So, turns out there is a very easy proof of this if you use three-to-one avoiding permutations. Because essentially, saying that an anti-chain is fixed by this map is saying that the corresponding three-to-one avoiding permutation is fixed by this map, which just takes the inverse. And three-to-one avoiding permutations that are fixed by taking the inverse. Mutations that are fixed by taking the inverse, those are three-to-one avoiding involutions. And it's well known, this is also in this paper by Simeon and Schmidt, that the number of three-to-one avoiding involutions is the central binomial coefficient. So this is just to show that 3-to-1 above permutations can help prove some facts about, you know, that if you just look at the anti-chains, then you have to work harder. But if you look at the permutations, it becomes easier sometimes. Since it becomes easier sometimes. Okay, so the last thing I want to talk about, so I want to relate, I want to do the promotion and romotion connection here too. So I want to define promotion for standard Yang Tableau. So in particular, I'll be looking at this 2xN standard Yang Tableau. And the promotion operation, The promotion operation, you may argue what I'm going to define is the inverse of promotion. I guess it depends on which paper you look at. This is promotion or the inverse of promotion. But basically, I have a, so if I have a standard Yamato blow of shape 2n, so the numbers from 1 through 2n, so that they are increasing in rows and columns, I can delete the largest number, and then I have a hole here. Now I fill this hole with the largest of With the largest of these two neighbors, nine and eight. So I slide the nine so it takes this space. So now nine goes here, but I'm going to have another hole. And now I'm going to fill the hole with whichever is bigger between the element above it and to the left of it. So in general, I will want to slide the number so that this hole that is at the bottom right eventually will be at the top left. But I always have to slide the number that. Always have to slide the number that preserves the property that rows and columns are increasing. So, if I do that, I'll have to slide the seven down. Now, the hole will be up here. I slide the four to the right, then I slide the two to the right, and then I slide the one to the right. And now I've succeeded in moving this hole from the bottom right to the top left. And now I place a new number that's smaller than all the others. So I'm going to put a zero here. And then if I add one to And then, if I add one to each number here, I'll get a standard Yankee blow again. So, this operation that starts from this standard Yankee Blow and finishes in this other standard Yankee Blow, I'm going to call that promotion. And as I said, sometimes this would be considered to be the inverse of promotion. Okay, so this operation of promotion is related to an operation on dick paths that I'm going to call it rotation. I'm going to call it rotation because it's the same as rotation of the non-crossing matching that corresponds to this dick path. But I'm going to, I'm interested in defining it in terms of dig paths. And this is the way you would define for dick paths. So you take a dick path, you look at the last point on the x-axis. Well, okay, last point that's not the end point of the path. And then after this point, the path will go up. The path will go up, then there will be some big path here that I call y, and then it goes down. So, this rotation operation, what it does is it removes this upstep and down step from here, and it puts them at the beginning and at the end of this path that I call X. So, this rotation operation is a little bit more natural when you think of it as the, in terms of a non-crossing matching. Crossing matching. So here's the picture: how all these three things are related. So on the left, I have a 2x n standard Yan Tableau. Here I have a DIC path, and here I have a non-crossing matching on two endpoints. So the bijection from the standard Yan Tableau to the DIC path, all you do is you read the numbers. So you look at each, whether one is in the top row or the bottom row. One is in the top row or the bottom row, and then you take an up step or a down step accordingly. Then you look at whether two is in the top row or bottom row, and you take an up or down step. So in general, the ith step will be up if the number is in the top row. It will be down if it's in the bottom row. And that gives you a dig path. Now you can go from dig paths to non-trusting matchings by looking at each upstep is matched with a unique down step by basically. Unique down step by basically the upstep looks to the right and sees a down step. Or if you think of parentheses, these are matching parentheses. So that means that the first, since the first upstep is matched, the first step is matched with the sixth step, that means that you'll have one and six will be matched in the non-pressing matching. So, okay, so these bijections here turns out that when you apply, so I think there's a result, I think this is due to white. I think this is due to white. If you take promotion in the standard young tableau, that's the same as taking what I call rotation in the dig path or the actual rotation in the non-crossing matching, as you can see from this picture. So, okay, so these three operations are essentially the same. Now, there is this very, this important bijection of Armstrong. Important bijection of Armstrong, Stump, and Thomas. That for the special case of type A that I'm talking about today, it's a bijection between anti-chains of the type A reposit to non-crossing matchings, or equivalently to dig paths, with the property that it turns row motion into rotation. So it's an equivariant bijection between anti-change under row motion. Between anti-chains under row motion and non-crossing matchings under rotation. So here's an example. So I'm not telling you how the bijection goes, but I'm just telling you you have an anti-chain here. Somehow you get a DIC path or equivalently a non-crossing matching. And then this equivariant property tells you that if you were to apply row motion to the anti-chain, that would correspond to applying rotation to the non-crossing matching. Rotation to the non-crossing matching or to the dig path. Okay, so the reason I'm talking about this Armstrong-Stum-Thomas bijection is because I'm going to tell you a way to describe it that's easier than the original description. Now, of course, the original description, it has a big advantage, which is that it's defined uniformly for all root systems. And what I'm going to tell you next only applies to type A. To type A. But still, the description that comes out for type A, it's not so simple. And what I'm going to show you next is that if you use three-to-one available permutations, this bijection is essentially the same as RSK. So let me show you that. So you start with an anti-chain, and I want to construct a dig path or a non-crossing matching. So all you need to do is So, all you need to do is you turn this into a three-to-one avoiding permutation the way we know. So, this would be the exceedances of a three-to-one avoiding permutation. Okay. Now, for this three-to-one avoiding permutation, I'm going to apply RSK. So I don't have time to define it here, but so RSK is a bijection between permutations and pairs of standard young tableau of the same shape. Of the same shape. And in this case, because the permutation is three-to-one avoiding, the resulting standard Yankabla will have two rows. So here I end up with a pair of standard Yank Tableau with at most two rows. Now I can interpret each one of these standard Yank Tableau as a DIC path prefix. So it's not going to be a full DIC path because I'm not going to go down to the same. Going to go down to the same height where I started in general, but I can still take steps according to whether the numbers are on the top or the bottom row. So I can do one, two are on the top row, three is in the bottom row, four is on the top row, and five is in the bottom row. So this will be the path corresponding to this tableau. I can do the same for the other tableau, and I get this path. And now I'm going to take this right prefix, flip it. Um, flip it along a vertical line and attach it to the right of this prefix, and I'm going to get the dicta. So I claim that this construction, this is the same as the Armstrong-Strum-Thomas bijection in Taipei. So, and I guess for, yeah, the path, so it looks a little bit nicer with the path, but you can think of the non-crossing matching if you look, if you like the non-crossing matchings more. More. Okay, so the theorem is that, yeah, so the Amstrungstein-Thomas bijection in type A is the same as going through the permutation, doing RSK, and then gluing the path. Okay, so I guess that's all I had. I'm just going to show you one more example of the same thing. So here's a three-to-one over impermutation. Here's my way of computing the AST bijection. And now, if I were to do row motion. And now, if I were to do row motion on the permutation, that would and I do the same AST bijection that would correspond to rotation of the path or the matching. Okay, that's all I had. So thank you. I guess I have a lot of things in the chat to read, but I'll do it soon. Thanks. All right, let's thank Sergi. All right, Jean, would you like to ask your question? You're muted. No, Jean isn't. Jean is muted. Can you unmute, please? Sorry, there was some difficulty. So it's so important. So, in particular, it sounds like you have a way, just on the level of tableau, it sounds like you have a way of taking any pair of young tableaux with at most two rows of the same shape, stitching them together and getting a two by n standard young tableau, where n is the sum of the boxes of the yeah, yeah. So, that so I mean, this part, this part, last part. This part, last part is not very hard. I could have also taken the tableau on the right, rotated 180 degrees, and replace each number with whatever, n minus the number or something, and then put it underneath. And that would become a two-bay entable. But to me, the striking thing here, or what we were surprised about, is that doing RSK to the permutation essentially has. Essentially, is the same as I'm strung Stum Thomas for Daibei. Other questions? So, I had some questions. So, first of all, okay, so this is a great thing when you're doing 3-2-1 avoiders. Is there 3-2-1 avoiders, is there some way to get like pick your favorite other one of the other trivial wolf equivalents class 1-3-2 into the act? Yeah, so this is, I guess it's on Ben's list of things to look at. But so, so yeah, because when you do, there's natural bijections between one-three to avoiding permutations and dig paths. So, you could apply row motion to dig paths and see what. Motion to dig paths and see what happens for the permutation, if there are any home messages there. So we haven't really looked at that. Of course, for the three to one avoiding permutation, there's this added advantage that what's happening to the exceedances is sort of the inverse of what's happening to the deficiencies. So you would lose that. But I guess there's no reason why you can, you could still define raw motion for one, three, two, of any permutations. One three two of implementations and look at homo message. Yeah, we haven't done. I mean, this is all very recent, so um, there's lots of possible directions on the to-do-do list. Yes, and another thing that's on his to-do list, I guess I'll mention, I didn't have my slide of like open things, but one question I was wondering is whether, so of course the AST bijection works in other settings, like maybe the next one to look. Like, maybe the next one to look at would be type B and whether there's some way to generalize this RSK business in that setting. Or I guess also the promotion row motion paper by Nathan and Jessica and Nathan also gives lots of generalizations of this phenomenon, right, for our RC posits. So, is there any other case where we could do something like this? And I don't know whether. And I don't know what the permutation would be in general, but maybe there's some way to generalize this property to other settings. About what you just said, Sergi, you could reverse engineer RSK from this because you have these two bijections, you just switch them on the side where you know everything. The side where you know everything, yeah, that's true. But I guess it's not always clear how to get what the permutation would be, though. Like in here, from the anti-chain, there's a very natural way to go to a three-to-one avoiding permutation. But for anti-chains of other posits, yeah, it's not so clear what even the permutation could be. All right, great. Well, let's thank Sergi again for a very nice talk. Okay, and now we have the group picture. And then after that, we're going to have the poster session. So LaDan, are you ready to take a screenshot for a group photo? Okay, so yeah, so I would encourage everybody to turn on your camera. Turn on your camera.
