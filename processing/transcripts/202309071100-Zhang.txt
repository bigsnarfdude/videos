My topic today is about blocks conjecture for K-way surfaces. Let me introduce the block conjecture. We let X be a smooth projective variety or complex number field, and CH star is a childhood. Then Block and Billingson predicts that there should be a decreasing filtration of the childhoods, satisfying certain nature. Satisfying certain natural axioms. And one of the consequences of the blossom Bradingson filtration is the Bloss conjecture. That the conjecture says that the graded piece of on zero cycle is controlled by the holomorphic I forms. Okay, one x When X is a case with surface, the conjecture just seems that if a correspondence acts as zero on the homomorphic two forms, then it acts on zero on the homological, on the degree zero part of CH0. In this talk, we focus on the automobile caseway surfaces and have a categorized caseway and kind of the existence of Law Billington field. The existence of blob-bengal filtration is widely open. So the conjecture is not so concrete. But on hypercatal varieties, there is some prediction on the filtration of hypercatal variety. So this conjecture may be more concrete that let me introduce. Let me introduce the Boe-Bazong filtration. The Bov√© conjecture that the Bloch-Weningson filtration or hypercalorite should split. That is, the filtration is induced by graduation on the chore groups. And there is opposite increasing filtration. We call the filtration and Buevatan filtration. For zero cycles, Vazan has constructed a candidate for the zero cycles. And the SP of the Brevazan filtration on zero cycles is generated by points with which arobate on a rational equivalent with dimension larger or equal than n minus i. We give an example. If x is a k3 surface, then the degree zero piece of the fuebozon filtration is generated by the fuebo-ton class. The class is represented by any point on Rachel curve, and the degree one piece is the entire group of char zeros. Okay, so we get a track ball conjecture on hypercatal varieties. Conjecture on hypercale varieties. That is, if X is a hypercalor variety of sorry. That is, if X is a hypercarbarized of dimension 2n, and we consider the group of sympathetic Bayartian automobiles or anti-synthetic Bayartian automorphisms. That is the action on the holomorphic two form is identity or minus identity. That will show that its action on the gridded piece of the Buy-Bazong filtration on the Chaw zero is identity or minus identity, respectively. That's because Blocker's original conjecture is about the action on the Blocker-Bennington filtration and the Blue. The block of Bennington filtration and the Boy Badon filtration is opposite to this filtration, so we get the corresponding conjecture. I have a remark that if zero on the homogeneous on the home two form is equivalent to phi restricted to the transitional lattice data. Don't like to see that IP as is a standard effect. Okay. There have been some results about the conjecture on K-3 surface and simulator automorphisms. Was on show that if phi is the involution and the simulatic, then it's It satisfies the block conjecture. And Hubbard proves the other cases for a finite order simulating automorphism. More recently, Du and Liu preserve that show that if the automorphism preserves a library fibrillation, then the block conjecture holds for phi. Their methods are all different. And our result is, in fact, a generalization of Hooverish results. I use derived categories. And I will explain later. And a higher dimensional prove that if X is a final variety of If X is a final variety of lines of cubic funds and the automorphism comes from the cubic four fold, then it also satisfies the Buevaton filtration conjecture. Okay, so what will happen if we consider anti-symmetric actions? It's divided into two parts. If the evolution, anti-semitic evolution, then the Cushian variety is either rational or index. In fact, if for any finite order phi, the cushion variety is rational or units. And uh we in the case we have the CH0 of y is one dimensional and hence and hence x plus phi x is a constant cycle in CH0X. We is a constant cycle on CH0X. If we want to show that If we want to show that it's phi x minus identity on such zero x home, then we just need to show that this constant right equals the Buy Vadon class. So we choose a point on the rational curves on x, and we find that phi preserves the Grey-Wadon class. So the anti-symmetric evolution x at minus Involution x minus zero on the set variable x home. In general case, when phi is a finite order of morphism, we should have a phi square is a symbolic automorphism. And the phi square satisfies the assumption of what are an uber. So physique square in fact In fact, satisfies the law of conjecture. And when C is a finite order, then it can be the product of anti-simulative evolution. We may decompose if phi 2n equals zero or equals one, then phi in fact. And phi in fact equals phi n and and phi n minus plus one which under the two automorphism is an evolution anti-simulative evolution or simulative automorphism of finite order. So we get a result for finite order anti-simulative automorphism. We give a higher More methods. We give a higher dimensional example which we will use before. That is, let X give a smooth coding surface. Then a line in a general line in P3 meets X as four points. So it defines the biological evolution on the Haber scheme. The morphism sends two points on X to another two points. To another two points of value to the since lines in X are parametrized by graph minus and the graph minus 20 is the graph minus 120 one dimension. So the four points, the sum of the four points is constant in set zero x. So we have to sum. So we can show that if the four points can show that if the four points can uh if you if a special choice of the four points equals the equals the bway class then it's action on set zero form is minus identity and uh and for other pieces of uh the boulevard filtration on x2 i just mentioned that the the first uh two pieces The first two pieces of the B-wave filtration determines the rational equivalence class of a point on the moduli space. So the action on set zero home determines the action on set zero x2. And we show that the whole conjecture holds for the block for behavior convolution. Now we can introduce our main results. Our results concern about the hypercar variety of K3N type. Here can be one, and then Y is a K3 surface. Then we show that this is a joint work with Zhu Yuan and Xing. Then the block conjecture holds for symbolic or anti-symbolic. For symbolitic or anti-symbolitic birds or automorphisms, if one of the following conditions holds one condition is that if y is a modulate space of stable objects on some K3A surface and the group and the rank of the lattice of the K3A surface is bigger than two. Although all K3 surface is a Jacobian fabric. Another condition is that if phi is symbolic and it preserves a biological Lagrangian vibration of one. In fact, our method deals only on the modular space, on K3 surface, on twisted K3 surface. And the second condition, if the second condition holds, then why it must be Why it must be a moduli space or twisted object on Twitter surface. And the two results imply that Blaze conjecture holds if V is symbolic or finite order. The V can be choosed to be 0, 0, 1, and Y is. one and y is isomorphic to x that is the first result applies for a k-s3 surface also okay i uh the preserved by lagrange fibris means that if the lagrange fibration is induced by a device l that say upper star L, that phase upper star L equals L at point to L. That is, it may not preserve the fibers. I will talk about the idea of the proof. The rough idea is we can decompose any automorphism of X into simple actions, but we know that automorphism of a K-3 surface Surface may be small, such as the following example. It's an example in obese people, but they do not handle the broad conjecture. We assume the neural severe X satisfies certain relation, then the automorphism group of X is that'somorphic to Z and generated by an anti-symmetric automorphism phi. That phi is indecremusible in Is indecommucible in automotive X because the automotive group is Z and Phi is a generator. But if we lift Phi to an automotive on cable schema two points, it has a natural lift. Then phi can be written as a product of three Buel involutions mentioned above. The decomposition appears in the O-Way source. Conversation occurs in the O-brace of the computation. Then we know that every brain evolution X has minus identity on CH0X whole. So after conversation, we have integral CH is also minus 1. So the rough idea is we can decommerce. We can decompose feed into diagonal automorphisms on hybrid scheme or modular shifts. Our result is essentially a generalization of example, but we do not use the larger group, we do not use a Bracken automorphism of a negative. Of a modular space of stable shifts, but we use derived equivalence. We let phi be auto equivalence or anti-auto equivalence. The point is we must include the action of anti-auto equivalence when not only to consider auto equivalence, but Equipments, but for example, the derived do functor is an anti-auto equipment because the home EF equals home due e duale not equal to home due duf. And the fact is that the fully mockery kernel of phi induces action on the Mokai La artist. And Hubert proves that the Fourier Mokai transform preserves the group. From preserve the gray bazan ring. So the action also the frame of action also induces action on self-development home. We say phi is anti-simulative if its action on the translatus is identity or minus identity. And then we denote by also. Denote by also dbx is a subgroup of simplitic automorphism and anti-symphony automorphism. There is a correspondence between the example we mentioned above and the derived equivalence we considered. That is the automobism of a derived category. If it actually Category, if it action fix the vector on the Mercalli lattice, then we take moduli space. And we show that after some modification, the derived equivalence preserves some stability conditions. So it induces a partial automorphism on the mobile space of X. And in contrast, if we have a partial A partial automorphism of a modular space. Then the action leads to two actions on the Mach Mammon categories, and we get auto-equivalence on the derived category. The difficulty is the difficulty is we need the automobile to fix the stability condition. I think this is relevant to Is relevant to Julia's talk yesterday, but the methods are different. However, the decomposition into auto equivalence is relatively hard. So we need a key obstruction of poultry. Hence the results show that if x is a particular q3 surface, then two auto equivalents. Auto equivalence and the phi and the percent is the two auto equivalents. If their action coincide on the homology, cohomology, then their action coincide on trop. So it's a starting point of our results. The result has a quick colory that if the action on the mocha lattice is a reflection, you have minus two reflection. And we also prove that the result holds for modular space of twisted objects, not only for direct category of case results. The Hooverish method, I talk about Hooverish. That talk about Uber's proof, in fact, proves that phi composed with Possi minus one, Possi minus one is X as identity on the Mocha artis. And any auto equivalence X as identity on the Mercallatis can be deformed everywhere. So, on a generic fiber, the framework high kernel is a shift, and the auto equivalence sends a sky privilege shift to a shift. So the automorphism acts on mercilatis, if the action on the machines identity, after some modification, it induces the automorphism of the K3 surface. Automorphism of the K3 surface itself and the action on H2 of the K3 surface is identity. So it shows that, and eventually it shows that the action on the troll zero group is also identical. And the foolish results guarantee us to consider the problem to the action on mock lattice. On mocha lattice. We know that the auto-equivalence automorphism group of the derived category is large. And we do not expect to truly decompose automorphism in the automorphism of derived categories, but we can decompose the action on the multi-laters. Another key result is we need to describe Thoughts is: We need to describe the action on the motile artisans. This is so-called direct relation of Hubbard, McGree, and Valerie. This shows that any halt isometry between the multi-lattis, which preserving the orientation, can be lifted to a direct equivalence. And for anti-equivalence, we just And for NT equivalent, we just compose it with the derived due function and we get the similar results. That is, if projectometry which reverses the orientation, then it can be easy to anti-auto equivalent. And for the symbolic auto equivalence, we have another version of the derivatives. Another version of the derived radius theorem. Since the action of the derived equivalence on the transnon lattice is identity, then any action on the extended neuron severe group preserves the discriminant group. And all the results are nicer ensure that if an action preserves the discriminant group, Preserve the discriminant group, then it of the subgroup in a unimodular lattice, then the action can be lifted to the whole unimodular lattice. So we get a target for simulating automorphism that there is a suggestion between automorphic simulated automorphism group of simulated auto equipment group of direct category. Equipment group are direct category to the author groups consist of elements which preserving which preserves orientation and discriminant group of the extended neuro CV matters. Before I talk about how to which is the action of the This shows that which is the action of a derived equivalence on the mocha lattice, and we and the Hubble result show that we only need to decompose in the mocha lattice. And we still need some basis to satisfy the brawl's conjecture. That is, we define the simplest auto equivalence is arising from Auto equivalence is arising from cardon-de-donative decomposition. We define that if anti-autoequivalence or anti-autoequence is called reflexive, if its action on the michaelatis is a reflection around the vector of square two or minus two. Or is the action The oil reaction sends V to minus V and the excess identity on V per model V to some isotropic vector. If the action of Calatus is minus two, then it is a theorem of coverage. And if the action of calattis is two, We see that the phi must be a simple must be an anti-auto equivalence because we can check that the action reserving the orientation reserves the orientation. And the idea of proof is just to take a modular space of the local vector V, and we say that it's an induced identity of. That is an induced identity on the act two of the modular space. And we call action on the minimum civil artists is the reflexive in motion. And our second theorem consists of two parts. That is, if X is a case of a surface and the Queswee surface and feed simulating auto equivalents or anti-simulating auto equivalents. Then if he is reflexive, that is satisfy the definition of all here. The action on the McKellar artist is a reflection or satisfy the second condition. Then the action on Then the action on the CH0 degree zero part of the group of zero cycle is identity or minus identity. And the second result is the first result is about the simplest auto equivalence indeed satisfies the blocks conjecture. And the second result shows that we can't decompose the any auto equivalence into the reflexive ones. The reflexive ones. The second result is when the rank of neuroscientific lattice is bigger than two, larger than two, all the X is a Jacobian vibration. Then there is reflexive auto equivalent such that the original auto equivalent is a composition of reflexive ones. Let me remind you that publish results guarantee that we only need this conversation, a decomposition in the Mercall artist. So this made this question more valuable. I will sketch my proof. Proof of part A that is C is a reflexive. C is a reflexive evolution that says X as an density on the group of zero cycles. Let's recall the definition of reflexive anti-derived equivalents. We noticed that the definition of all the definition of two types. The definition of two types have a common property that is fix the vector or send a vector to minus of this vector. That is the action send v to minus v and we consider the modular space of with mocha vector v if inflection on mocha lattice is a reflection. Artist is a reflection of vector of square two. And then, as mentioned about, as mentioned before, the phi must be an anti-auto equivalence. And we show that there exists another auto equivalent such that the action on the pilot is the same. And another auto-equivalent Another auto equivalent fix is a Berlin modulus, a Berlin stability condition. And hence, the equivalence induce isomorphism between the modular space. We recall that our definition of reflexive in Our definition of reflexive emotions. In the subgroup of Michelattis, in the vapor of Michelattis, the reflect the action is identity. So in fact, the isomorphism between the modular space is identity. That means the derived equivalence. The derived equivalents have enough fixed shifts. What remains to show is that such fixed objects indeed generate the whole group of their cycles. And this is a result of the biological motif of have a Have a modular space in that morphic to the biohemoti or cable scheme, and we can check that any we can check that the shifts in a modular space, the chain class of shifts in a modular space indeed generated the group of zero cycle or X. And the probable part B is a hard part. Football part B is a hot pot. We should in fact the image of the derived equivalence to the orthogonal group of extended neural survey group equals the group generated by reflexive involutions if the latter group is a congruent subgroup. In fact, it may show that the problem has no periodic obstructions. And the assumption of the rank and the neurotic lattice ensures the congruence are good problem. So we prove our theorem. Oh, let's check the time. Okay, I will stop here. Thank you very much for listening.
