For putting such a wonderful event together and giving me the opportunity to speak here. So, mostly I'm going to talk about the simple periodical graph operators, so discrete periodic trading operators, which is discrete version. Daniel talked this morning, he was talking about the continuous version. So, I'm going to focus on the discrete version. So, first, we have the discrete Laplacian. So, the Laplacian is defined on the lattice. On the lattice they did, so very standard lattice. So the Laplacian U at the site m equals all the you know m prime such as m prime minus n equals what the norm is given by the sum of the corresponding component. So roughly speaking, for one-dimensional case, when the lattice is Z, so lab rational n on this side equals this 4, equals this two labels, the sum of two labels. So on lattice Z2, Unlattice Z2, so you have this lattice. So Laplace, but aside this side, you possess four neighbors. So this grid applaution. So now we need to have this periodical potential. So the periodical potential we saw or potential V, actually most of the results in this talk works for the complex value of the potential for simplicity adjustment. Talk about the real value of the potential. So we say this potential is a gamma period. If we v n plus 2. Periodic. If Vn plus little gamma equals Vn, so where the little gamma is chosen from the capital gamma lemoning, gamma is Q n Z, O plus O Q Z, and Q Q D Z. So roughly speaking, the potential A is gamma periodic, means that on just a vector, the potential has a period Qj. For the question, should you subtract something? Because otherwise, the repression of a constant is non-zero. Oh yeah, so you can subtract something, but by shifting so it will not change this vector of this problem. Just a constant. Constant, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. He's not trying to think of a limit or anything. So then this topic is about the next topic, about a discrete periodic shading operator. We have a discrete Laplace delta and the potential periodic potential A. So go ahead. So the Q's are just period. What? Q is the period. The first direction, the potential has a period Q1, second direction has a Q2, the last direction has a period 2d. So there's a potential. Actually, isn't the constant a function of n? Then you subtract like minus 1/4 u of n? Yeah, yeah. If there was a real... Yeah. You could shift the spectrum with a constant. So you just shift the spectrum by four. Depends on D. Oh, yeah. Sorry, sorry. Yeah, yeah, sorry. And that's the mess of the natural battle. No, if you're really doing numerical analysis, h go to zero, yeah, you need to have that. So then that's our subject, that's the operator. So now let's give an example. When the dimension is d equals one, then just the two represents m plus one, n minus one, then v is a periodic. Then V is a periodic, is a potential, but since it's a periodic, the period is Q1, then the potential appears periodically. So if you write down this problem in the infinite dimensional matrix, it's a tri-diagonal matrix problem. Here is from the Um plus one, this guy is from Um minus one, here it's two guys, and the diagonal entry is a potential. So V1, V2, V21, and then it appears periodically. Since it's a periodic trading operator. Shading operator. So you can say this operator can be easily. You can, any if you choose any Q1 by Q1 box, this configuration contains all the information of this whole matrix because the potential appears periodically. So naturally, there is a standard flow case transform. I just wanted to give you the 1D case. If you choose a Q1 by Q1 configuration, then you get a finite dimensional matrix, which is definitely different from the original. matrix which is definitely different from the original matrix but instead you put e to pi k e to pi negative k here then you get a family of operator so actually the original infinite dimensional matrix is unitary equivalent to this new matrix but have this direct direct sum of k between 0 and 1 this is done by floating theory but now I want to talk about the any dimension this is the first one dimensional case I also just wanted to give you an example the cues are Oh, it the c the q's are integers or they're integer, integer, yeah. Okay. Yeah, q is integer, yeah, like a five, ten, yeah. Okay. Yeah. So one is the integer. So I get a matrix. Yeah, okay. So now I wanted to rewrite this matrix in a way which we study this equation as a one-dimensional case, and we studied, we have this flow called block boundary condition. Namely, the n, the eigenfunction satisfies such kind of a property. Such kind of a property, if you change this side by Q1, then you have a factor by factor U2 by K here. The K is called the quasi-momentum in physics. So by writing out this original operator, infinite dimensional matrix, this is an infinite dimensional matrix problem. But now we have this boundary condition. Then I can write down this operator on this configuration from 0 to Q1 minus 1, Q1 side. Then we obtain this. Q1 side, then we'll potentially this original matrix here. So, luckily, this way it can be extended to any arbitrary dimension. So, let me now introduce the fundamental domain. So, this fundamental domain is each component is between 0 to 2j minus 1. So, you can see that the potential on the fundamental domain can recover the whole potential, right? This is the fundamental domain. Now, the cardinality of the fundamental domain is the product of. The fundamental domain is the product of the period. So now, if we study the eigen equation, with this floccat blocked boundary condition in arbitrary, in higher than arbitrary dimension, so let me on just the addition. If you change this eigenfunction by side qm, you have only changed by our factor u2 pi i kj. So with this eigen equation under this boundary condition, we can realize this operator 3. 3 with this functory condition in our finite dimensional matrix space. Then we obtain, we already done this matrix operator on this fundamental domain, we can translate a problem 3 and 4 to be a eigenvalue problem for a Q by Q matrix. So what do we do here? I can give you a picture to explain it. So now we have a, for example, we have a So for example, now we have the fundamental domain in the two. One direction you have a peer read Q1. Another direction you have a peer read Q2. Then I can just choose the fundamental domain. Now I can write down this operator, this equation 3 with this functory condition on this fundamental domain. So what do we do here? If you choose a point here, Point here. If I choose a point here, now plushing U is a four label. I'm still in the fundamental domain and the potential V is a multiplication operator. So you hit this place. So after this action, this action, you are still in this fundamental domain. But however, if you hit this, I choose this boundary, not plushing is the four labels. Unfortunately, this guy gets out of this. Unfortunately, this guy gets out of this fundamental domain, but we have the floor block boundary condition. This guy translated to this guy. If you have a factor e2 pi i k1. Which means that finally you can realize this eigen equation. After putting those boundary conditions, you can realize the whole operator just under its fundamental domain. Actually, it's a dynamic matrix problem. But now this matrix depends on the potential way and it depends on the class. And it depends on the positive momentum k to the boundary condition. Actually, it depends on k in explicit way. It depends on u2 pi k1 on this direction. It depends on e2 pi i leg cube k1 from this direction. That's guy. E2 pi k2, let's go negative e2 pi i k2. So such kind of, but it depends on potential weight and the quasi moment in k. So since it is a pure variable shifting operator, by standard flow, k that is. By standard flow kit theorem, the original infinite-dimensional matrix is unitarily equivalent to this family of this matrix. And then now you get a direct assignment, direct design, k is in the tolls. And then you get this matrix, then actually they are unitary equivalent. So basically, original matrix is infinite-dimensional, but now I choose a fundamental domain and put some boundary conditions that are equivalent. Condition that equivalent. So, and then this matrix depends on the potential of the boundary condition D. So, now you can say that all then we can get the characteristic polynomial function of this matrix. So, many special properties, many problems related to periodic shading operator relies on the study of this characteristic function because they are unitary equivalent and the matrix eigenvalues. And the matrix eigenvalues is a determinant. So they are related. So, where is the argued geometry from, you know, in my title of my talk? Because we can now change the variable. So, if I change the variable in the following way, I let Ej, Zj equals U2 pi kj. Did you remember? Originally, this boundary condition depends on U2 pi i k k 1, U to pi i negative U2 pi i k 1. So now if I change the variable, then there's a matrix. Change the variable, then this matrix depends on the variable. So now, in the following, if I use variable k, I use a regular notation. If I use the variable Z, I use a curved notation. So now I get a characteristic function is a determinant if I use the variable Z variable. So if I can say now, this is an algebraic geometry problem because the determinant the matrix depends on Z and Z. on Z and Z here, then and Z2, Z2, then this matrix depends on Z1, Z2. The determinant finally is not on the polynomial of Z variable, but the polynomial in Z variable. So in order to study the original problem, it releases on how to apply actual geometry techniques to study this polynomial. So actually this problem also related to the adjacent They adjacent, you know, comparator. We can look at this graph in the comparator way. So maybe just use one-dimensional case to describe how to use comparatoric way to study this problem. So now we have a Q1 side, one to Q1. So if every guy is connected to their label by a read, one, Wait one director because this is from the Laplace. And then you have this self-loop. Self-loop is a potential. You put a VN, because it is a self-connected to yourself. It's self-loop is VN, the potential. And this end point is connected to the starting point by E2π I K1. And this end point connected to the last point by the boundary condition E2 negative K1. Negative T1. So basically, you can this property is also our adjacency matrices of our dynamic graphs. So this is the graph. Similarly, you can get a graph for this case. Every guy is connected to their four neighbors, and this guy connected to this guy by such weight, and this guy connected to this guy by some weight. So really, this is also a problem of adjacent symmetricist of compression. No, this is why we can use the compressorities to study this. Can use the computer physics to study this problem. So, what we are going to do in this talk, so you can say the algebraic properties are finally, you know, it turns out that it plays a crucial role in the study of the periodical training operators, because I mean, this guy is a determinant of this original problem. And also, for example, the flat band, you know, we have heard a lot of flat bands. Let's talk, you know, this giant means that this lower polynomial has a factor lambda minus e. a factor lambda minus E. If a factor lambda minus E, which means that this original shading operator has a flat band, lambda equals E. So in this talk, I'm going to talk about the opposite of a flat band. I wanted to say the formula value is irreducible related to the embedded eigenvalue problems. So this is one of the topic I'm going to discuss after this slide. So what's a fermi variety that formula varieties are your fixed or any Fermi variety is that you fix our energy level lambda. You study the zero set of this low-land polynomial, then we call Fermi variability at the level, energy level lambda. So this is the Fermi variability. So now I'm going to talk about the first step. Why do we care about this? For example, the irreducibility of the Fermi varieties, I will display to you later. And why this irreducibility of the Fermi variables related to the embedded eigenvalue. Related to the embedded eigenvalues, and what's the embedded eigenvalues. So now we studied the perturbated shooting operator. We have this great Laplacian plus the periodical potential, but now I have a small perturbation. We wanted to say under this perturbation, what will happen? Basically, we wanted to say that under super small perturbation, the properties are similar to the original periodical shading operators. So, a traditional approach is to study this problem is to Problem is the two, you know, is these the two references here by Cado and Abelman, which are very old paper. I think this is for the Cado's paper is 1959. So it's a very classic approach to study the disc. Those approaches are from the continuous shooting operator, which usually cannot be applied to discrete settings, even when there's a potential, periodic potential is zero. So I'm going to introduce a new approach, which originally from the continuous case. Which originally from the continuous case by Coochie Man and Van Berger in 2000. So let me explain to you what's embedded eigenvalues. So originally periodic trading operator, you have a band. You have a spectrum in the band, you know. So now, by under small perturbation, V, can you create an eigenvalue in this band? So this is called an embedded eigenvalues to the band. So definitely when the potential is V0, little V0, there is no eigenvalues. But I wanted to show. There is no eigenvalue. But I wanted to show, our goal is to show under small perturbation, if the potential weight decreases super fast, we cannot create eigenvalues on the band. So the approach is that the new approach involves the algebraic and analytic properties of the firmware vertices. Basically, we want to show the first step is to show the firmware validities is irreducible. Secondly, we need to use something from PD's related continuations and also PD is related continuations and also related to some use some complex analysis. So your V will have compact support or the little V will have compact support will you expect no embedded eigenvalues but your V will have to have compact support or can you expect some kind of decay? Yeah, if we decay so you can exponentially no embedded eigenvalues. So absolutely. Yeah, basically originally is the compatible support then. Yeah, really good question. So you can say here it's compatible. Yeah, really good question. So you can say, hey, it comes by some code. Right, if you want to use unique continuation as well, that's the key. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Also, you deconstruction, yes, also from that part. So now, basically, I wanted to give you a simple special case of our result. We showed that, for example, this is easily the problem. Now we have discrete Laplacian. For discrete Laplacian, you only have one band, which is 2D to 2D. So now we want to show that if the potential detovate decays super exponentially, gamma is bigger than 1, you cannot. Gamma is bigger than one, you cannot create any valid eigenvalue because the intersection of the eigenvalues and the band is empty. So, you know, simple is the case. And originally, this result is only known for compactly supported potential little approach for potentially decay. And our result for not just for this free lab lashing, our result works for if you have a periodical potential, many, many bands. Now, under small potential. Now, under small perturbation, if the perturbation decays should break exponentially, you cannot create eigenvalue. But I only wanted to give you the example about one band first. I wanted to show you the proof first. Good. So now I wanted to give you the proof of this one-band case. So one band case is the proof. So now we have this, we will prove it by contradiction. Suppose the number is in this interval and it has. Lambda is in this interval and it's an eigenvalue. Eigenvalue means that you have an L2 function. So lemonade, Laplacian u plus the potential v equals lambda u has an L2 solution. So by Fourier transform, the Laplacian U becomes the Causalian multiplication operator, Causion function. And the potential A, I d I denote the Causai X is the Fourier transform of these two guys. These two guys. And U is a Fourier transform of the U itself. So I abuse the notation a little bit. So U is a discrete L2 function, but if we do Fourier transform, I still use U. So under Fourier transform, I get such kind of equation. So now I can say, this is the proof. So since U is in L2, U is in L2, which means U must be bounded. U is bounded, and but little bit decays the superior exponential. But a little bit decays the super exponentially. So, by some basic incompetent analysis, our function, the Fourier coefficient that decays should predict exponentially, is equivalent to that. This Fourier transform is an entire function with this vanishing order. So the gamma is a decaying rate of the Fourier coefficient. And then the eigenfunction, after the Fourier transform is an entire function with this order. This order means that our fun Or function this entire function, the order means this guy, this guy is called an order, the growth of this is called the order of this entire function in complex analysis. You can see, this is what we learned in Kapros, right? If the Fourier coefficient is decaying faster, after the fully transformed function has a better regularity. So this is the same thing. If we decay super exponentially, then this eigenfunction is entire function and with this rate. function and with this rate. So now I can rewrite this equation in the following way. I have the u and the pi this denominator. Now I claim that if u is an L2 function, then ux must be an entire function with the same order. Then we get a contradiction. Because ux is an entire function with the same order, which means the fully equivalent of ux, which is u. Ux, which is u n, decays super exponentially, which is impossible because this is by we get a continuum result, any eigenfunction cannot decay the super exponentially in TVs. Then we get a contradiction. But the difficulty is that how to prove, you originally only know u is in L2. How can you prove ux is an entire function? So this is a technique. So I'm going to give you the describe the proof. The blue goes in the following way. I give you the plane. This is black machine. I hope I give you some graphs. That's the case. First, I denote this guy, this three domains, is the zeros of the denominator. The zeros of denominator. Let's see the graph. First, we know that Ux is L2 on the torus. U is L2 on the torus. What does this mean? Two on the tolerous, what does this mean? Which matter the zeros of Possi and the zeros of the denominator must be cancelled out on the real line. Because if you cannot cancel the zeros on the real line, you have a singularity, you cannot be in L2. So first you must cancel the zeros on the real line. But then I wanted to show that these two functions must have the same zeros. You know, the denominator must cancel. Denominator must cancel the zeros of the numerators on the whole complex plane. Our function is not, you know, it cancels zeros on the real line, but how to push it to cancel zeros on the whole complex plane? This is the picture. This is the zeros for this denominator. For this case, we can cancel. This is the approach. If you cancel this real none, by complete analysis, you cancel the whole domain. If in this case, If in this case, you cancel this, this is the zeros of the denominator. But given that you have zeros on the real line, then you cannot cancel anything. So you cannot cancel the whole domain. But this case is not enough. You only have one point in the second here. You only cancel this whole one point. You cannot cancel the whole complex domain. So, which is impossible? In only this case, we can push from cancellation on the real line to cancellation on the whole complex plane. So, wanted to make sure that you. Wanted to make sure this is the case, the zero set of the denominator is this case. So, in order to make sure in this case, we need two assumptions. One assumption is that the denominator only has one, the zero set of the denominator only has one component. Lemon name is irreducible. Because if you have two components, you cancel this guy. That means you can cancel this guy. This guy. Because you only cancel the real line, you gotta mean you cancel this guy, but you cannot cancel this guy if I have two components. So, first, the condition that I only have one component. Secondly, we need that the intersection of the real line has a maximum dimension like a here. If you only have intersection is one point, you cancel this one point, you cannot cancel the whole domain. Only I'm on only this case, first one component. Secondly, I intersected R N, R D with the market segment dimension. R D with a market statement dimension. I cancel this line, cancel the whole domain, but it only have one domain. Then I cancel everything. So, but for this case, it's quite easy to verify because H node is a cosine function. I can verify it. But this approach is quite powerful. We can actually give you a conclusion. We need a unique contribution results, we need the irreducibility of the firmware variety, we need the dimension into. The dimension intersection has dimension d minus one. But actually, some weaker consumptions already enough for us. I don't want to mention them here. And this approach works for continuous and discrete settings. Now, I'm going to talk about this, how to prove the irreducibility for periodic trading operator. So, the first irreducible continuation is standardized in PDEs. So, we know the result. And the real formula reality has dimension V minus 1. This has dimension V minus one. This is the author's per standard result in the text book. Only difficulty is to show that the Fermi varieties is irreducible, only have one component. So this is why we care about the irreducibility of a firmware varieties. So now, basically, this is the main result, one of the main results in this talk. So, as I mentioned, here it's very easy to verify because H naught is from the free shooting operator. But now, Shading operator. But now we have the general picture which have many, many bands, which operator is called a periodic shading operator. So we are able to prove that irreducibility. The first irreducibility result is that if you look at this loan of the polynomial as a variable as they say, you know, you fix the lambda. You look at this loan of the polynomial as a variable. This is a lot of polynomial as a variable as a function of Z, as a logand polynomial of Z variable. We show that this log of the polynomial is irreducible. So that means you cannot factorize this polynomial. So arbitrarily chosen number. So we can also show that when dimension is d equals to 2, the Lawrence polynomial as a function of Z is irreducible, except for one point. Point. The one point is given by the average of the potential. So these two results implies that, oh, here, I wanted to say that this here is sharp because when lambda equals average, this actually this longer polynomial may have two irreducible components, which means that this is sharp. And this two theory implies that if I look at this longer polynomial as a function of both Z variable and another. function of both Z variable and a lambda variable, then is reducible. So based on this irreducible result and what I mentioned, so let me probably put it here first. Then we can show the following stronger result. We have a discrete periodic shading operator. We have a perturbation. Now you have a spectrum band. Now we show that if the perturbation is exponential decaying, then there is no Then there is no embedded eigenvalues. Namely, every lambda in this spectrum band cannot be eigenvalued. So this is our result. So maybe go to the fluid result. So basically our contribution is to prove those two, prove the irreducibility results here. And then those irreducibility results answers two conjectures in our area. First conjecture is that the block of variety. Blocker variability is a zero. Block of variability is a zero set. If you use two variables, k and lambda. The conjecture says that block of variety is irreducible. Our theorem 4 answers this question because you use two variables. Another conjecture is about the Fermi variability. Fermi variability, this conjecture says that the Fermi varieties are irreducible. You can separate for finitely many lambda. So wa this series two or three also answer this question. Two or three also answer this question because I only show that the only exception is the one point. But the context that we may have finitely many exceptions. So this is a problem. And already, here is some stories about this conjecture mentioned in many articles since the 1990s. So the previous study they reduced results. The irreducibility results is known when d equals 2. The broken value is irreducible in this paper. And when d equals 2, you know, there's three people proved that the family value is irreducible. You accept it for finitely many names. We show that you accept it for one number. So it's stronger. And the dimension is three. It also shows that the vermin variety is irreducible for every. The vermin variety is irreducible for every lambda. And as their approach is, they use the compatification, which is a more artifact geometry approach to do it. So we use kind of analysis approach to finish the proof. We still have 10 minutes. So here is some recent developments. So we can study more general graphs, not just the ZD, the graphs. We can do more now group. So now I wanted to talk about. So now I wanted to talk about another topic, which is about which is related to the inverse problem of the periodic filling operator. So we have two natural isospelatority problems here. The first isospellatority problem is called a fluke isospector, which is from the periodic shading operator. Fluke isospectral means that this Magnus spectral means that there's two operators with k V and y are the potential. K is a passive momentum. So if those two operators have the same spectrum for every lambda, for every k, we call this potential V and Y are floated at spectrum. However, we can use polynomials to characterize this floccade at spectral. So V and Y are floated at spectral. And y are floated as a spectral is equivalent to the characteristic polynomial as seen for every k and lambda. And this blockable validity as a zero set of these two polynomials. So lemoni potential V and Y are fluored at a spectrum is equivalent to both zero variety broken varieties are the same. Using in this language. So, I think three years ago, I introduced a new type of isospectuality problem, which I call it Fermi isospectron. So, Fermi isospectron means that you have one number node such that the characteristic polynomial are the same. You can hear that the characteristic polynomial are the same, which means that the same for every k and lambda. There, for me, is a special quality, which means that you need to have one net energy level. You only have one net energy level, their characteristic polynomial are the same. So, lemoni, Fermi isospectality means that the Fermi varieties are the same at one level lambda naught. Floccan isospectality means that the broken varieties are the same. So, this condition is much weaker, right? Because firmly is just that you choose one level, hypersurface, hyperplane. If there are a thing, we call firmly isospectoral. I waspect quality. But look at looking at the spectral quality means that you need the whole plane, the whole polynomial are the same. So if you use the eigenvalue, you use the spectrum to describe the format of spectral quality, which is the following. Floated at a spectrum means that the eigenvalues are the same. Fermi address spectral quality actually means the product of the eigenvalues are the same. So which means that the firm address package quality is weaker? From ethospectural is weaker because of located isospectority means each eigenvalue are the same. Fermi, which matters the product are the same. So now we can able to prove this result, which is which the dimension is bigger than two. We show that if we have two potentials, which y and v are firmly isospectral, and the y is separable. is separable why is the D1, D2, DR separable? Then the potential V must have the same is also separable in the same way. So what's the separable mean? So for your potential V on this three, I call it a two one separable, which means this potential V can be written in the following way. In the following way, can be separated as a two-dimensional case and a one-dimensional case. Can be written as a potential of V1 N2 plus V2N3. So we call 2, 1 separable. So namely, formable, if they are forming, I was back at 4. One guy is separable, another guy must separable in the same way. So furthermore, if two potentials are separable, If two potentials are separable and they have the same, if they are firmly at spectral, then I can show that each lower dimension decompositions are floated as a spectral. So the last statement properly is the easiest set of one. I have a potential V and the zero potential are firmly ato spectral, which means that I have a potential way, another shooting operator. Another pot another shooting operator without potential, but as they all firmly variability are the same, at one level, then the potential weight must be zero. So basically the inverse type of problem. So this is actually this problem is my original motivation to study this inverse problem because it's pretty simple, right? From me where I'm saying, at one level, can this potential zero? Can you tell me this potential is also zero? And unfortunately, this approach, I project, This approach approach I intro here only works dimension bigger than two. It's still quite open if this, like this is a simple example. In dimension two, if I have a potential way and a zero potential, the Fermi variety are the same. Can you show that this potential must be zero on dimension two? Because my result only works for dimension bigger than two. So for dimension three, the problem is you know is easy, but two is the most difficult. Is easy, but is the most difficult one actually. And we did something very for example, we choose Q1 dimension is two, Q3 is three. So for this type of problem, so finally is a matrix is a sixth by six matrix. So we actually have six variables because the potential has six variables. And uh finally, if I affirm as a spirituality, we get a five equations. But I wanted to show there's a five equations that has non-trivial solutions or not. Non-trivial solutions or not. So, actually, we did like a lot of calculations of trying to find these solutions by numerics. So, even this problem, you know, it's still challenging because the remaining case when d equals 2 is quite difficult. I mean, and also in the last minute, I wanted to mention that, you know, actually the argument both for this proof, we also use the argument property of this log of this load of the polynomial I just introduced. This Laura and the polynomial I just introduced a lot. So, actually, the attribute properties of this block and the fermi variables play crucial roles in the study of shading operators in the spectrum theory. For example, I just mentioned that we can use it to study embedded eigenvalues, we can use it to study the properties of the spectrum binding functions, we can also use it to study the inverse problems, like this paper, the study design. They studied that the integrated density of states. So, can you use the integrated density of states to recover the potential or not? You know the integrated density of states, and then what can you say about the potential? It's inverse preference. And also, it's related to the quantum of obesity, velocity, for this block of reality and the fermi variables. I think I checked for this one.
