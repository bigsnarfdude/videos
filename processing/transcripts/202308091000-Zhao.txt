Yeah, thank you. So, first, I want to thank the organizer for giving me a chance to give a talk in this last meeting. I'm sorry that I cannot join you inside outside. Anyway, very sorry. So, today I will talk about some recent results with Yuan JLio, Yuan Jele, Swan Chen Liu, and Chinghua Sha. Shang Chen Yio and Ching Hua Shao on the Halbert expansion for some non-relastic kalaika equations. The talk of outline of topic is divided into the following sections. So now first I want to talk about the problem. So we know that to describe the dynamics of fluids, there are different scannings. So in the microscopic scannings, is the Scannings is the Levites equation and Euler equation. And in the mesoscopic scannings, is the kalactic equations such as the Boltzmann equation and the Landau equations. And the interesting problem is to study the relations between the equations from the solutions of equations from different scanning. So this is the, in fact, Hilbert, Hilbert proposed that. Hilbert proposed his famous Hilbert expansion in the close number. And the problem is how to justify, regularly justify such expansion. And our main purpose is to show that for the Landau equations and the Lang cut of Boltzmann equations, yes, it's okay. So, for example, So, for example, in this part, we focus on the Langdau type equations. So, two models are considered in this talk. So, the first one is the Landau equations, and the second one is the philosophy of Maxwell Langdau. So, we call the VML in the rest of my talk. So, here Ipshung is the cruise number and Fhipshung is the density, number of density function. Density number of density functions at time t position x with velocity v and here e and b is the electromagnetic field satisfy the maxwell equations and here the collision the the collision operate is the land out collision operate is the land out collision operator here just forgot about the i just want to mention that the this three three This 3 times 3 is a non-negative matrix with its elements, take this form. Pay attention to that. There was a parameter here, gamma. When gamma equal to minus 3, this corresponds to the Columbia indication in the plasma physics. What we want to show in this talk is that we consider the Cauchy problem to the above two types of equations. So the Nandau equation and the VMA equation. Equation and the VMA equations, which prescribe the initial data. For example, for the Landau equation, we only gave the initial density distribution functions. And for the, but also for Maxwell-Landau equations, in addition to the initial distribution, density distribution function, we also give the initial data for the electromagnetic field. So, this is the model. The model. Now we will show how to help the expansion for the Langdau equation. The helper expansion is to expand the solutions in this form. Here capital Fn, this is independent of a close number. And here, Fr, if shown, this is the remainder. So if we submitted the solution, the form of the solution into the Landau equations, we got this. Landau equations. We get this one, and then comparing the coefficient of the power of the cruising number, we can deduce that to the minus one power. We have this is C F zero F zero equal to this is this means that from Boltzmann's theorem, this means nothing but that F zero is a is a local. Is a local Maxwellian and then for the coefficient of epsilon zero, we have this equation for f0 and f1. From here, we can see that once f0 is determined, then we can determine from the epsilon zero the lung free part of f1. Once we define the lung free part of f1, and then from the equation for each. That comes the equation for each one. Episode one, n equal to one, then if you want, then we can deduce that from this equation with n equal to one, we can determine the fluid part of f1 and then continuous such a process. Then we can determine f0, f1, and to f2k minus one. And then if you submitted this one into the This one into the Landau equation, then we can show that the error terms for such equations. So, this is the Helper expansion. So, as I said before, F0 is nothing but a local maximum. This is here, the fluid density, velocity, and the temperature, absorbed temperature. So, this one composable Euler equations. And then, what we want to show is that we want to. What we want to show is that we want to deduce the bundles for the coefficient Fn and then to show that the remainder does have resolutions in some time interval and then to deduce some time independent, in some sense, even independent estimates on the solutions. So this is what we want to do. So to do so, we want to introduce two types of Introduce two types of perturbations. So, the first one is the perturbation around the low convex variant. So, this one, this is the low convex variant. We use this, we take the perturbation as a small f issue. And then we can show that the perturbation satisfies this kind of equations. And then, as usual, this is the localized the neural. The linearized collision operator with respect to the local maximum, and then this is a non-linear collision operator, non-double type collision operate. So, this is another type of perturbation is that we introduce the following global vaccine. So, the TC, this is the important is that this constant TC. We will show how to. We will show how to choose this TC later. So if we perturb the error term around this local global maximum, then we have the achievement. This type of estimate, satisfy this type of equations. So this is nothing, but what I want to say that this type, in this type, this when minimalized the remainder. this will linearize the remainder equation of the new of the remainder equation for the remainder or with respect to the local vector m and another one is perturbated with the global vector mu and then consequently they will have a linearized collision operator language non-linear collision operator and this and this one is the difference between the uh the the linearization between the local Between the local Masswin and the global Masswin. And so the story is to show that we can show that the solutions, for example, for 14 has a solution in some time interface. So this is for the Lambda equation. So we want to show in this talk that the Helper's extension help provide you that the corresponding time. On the same timing it fails when the corresponding Euler equation has a smooth solutions. And then for the velocity Maxwell-Langdo equations, so it is not well understanded that for the Euler Maxwell equations that have a global solution, so we want to show that the corresponding half bodies expansion hold us globally. Holders globally. So, in this case, we expand the solution of the density distribution function and the electromagnetic field correspondingly. And then the same way as those for the Herbert expansion for the Landau equations, we can show that F0, capital F0 is nothing but the local Maxwellian. So, this found Euler Maxwell equations. And then the F zero and the F 0 and the E 0 E 0 B 0 will be denoted as E B. So E B satisfies the corresponding Euler equation, the Maxwell equations. And then similarly, we can determine the coefficient in the same way, in the same way as for the Landau equations. So now we can show that the remainder satisfied the Satisfy the corresponding vertical version of Maxwell equations, vertical max equations. And then, as before, we want to show that such as for any given t in fact, we show that when t greater than zero less than equal to the power to some minus power, we can show that then we can indeed construct solutions of the Solutions of the VMS system, such a VM system in the time interval, whose length is equivalent to the power. And to deduce center, in some sense, even independent bundles for the solutions. What I mean is that you want to, in this case, we can justify the helper expansion. So as usual, as before, so we can two types of normalization. Two types of normalization perturbation can be constructed. The first one is with respect to the local maximum, which is who which is determined by the unique group solutions of the Euler Maxwell equations. So this is the F equation, this is the perturbation. And another type of is the H epsilon. I just is a perturbation around the global max rate. Global max winning. So the story is now reduced to deduce center episode independent in some sense for both Fish and Episcopal. So now I start with our main results. To do so, we want to list some dissipation estimates for the Langdale type equations. So let's put this corresponding to the Colombo potential. I mean, gamma equals to Potential. I mean, gamma equals to minus three in this talk. So, this is the dissipation rate, and then we can also need to introduce some time velocity dependent weighted functions. I will mention the role, the role to introduce such a type of estimates. In fact, this will perform. In fact, this one performed energy stimulates, it can reduce additional dissipation dissipation mechanism, which is modified by our former results joined with and then as before the then the last phase of the Nino-Razzle equation is five-dimensional and then this is with respect to the This is with respect to the local Maxuania. And this is this last phase is linearization with respect to the global Maxuania. And then both of them are five-dimensional. So we can construct a scalar basis for this last basis and then we can define the projector and then we can decompose the solution into two parts, the free part and non-free part. Two parts: the fluid part and non-fluid part. Now, is uh such argument now is well understood. Understand, and now that now we talk about the solution for the fluid equations, for the limited equation. For the compressible oil type equations, if we deduce the Landau equation from the compressible Euler equations from the Landau equation, we can show that the pressure function is, but I want to see that. I want to say the state equation is for ideal polytropical gas. And also, by some normalization, we take the R, the gas constant equal to 2 of 3. And this case, the absorbed temperature and the internal energy is equal. So, this is for the compressible Euler equations. And for the Euler maximum. Euler Maxwell equations. If we use the higher body expansion to equations, then we can show that the solution of the oil equation is not isotropical. But we can construct... So what I want to say is that we first construct the global solutions to the following isentropic oil. Euler Maxwell equations. And then, based on such solutions, if we define the temperature and internal energy to be the density to the power 2 of 3, then we can construct special solutions to the long-isentropical Euler-Maxwell equation derived from the VMA system derived by the Hilbert expansion. And now I want to talk. And now I want to talk about the solution to these two types of equations, smooth solutions. So, first one is the local smooth solutions for the compressible Euler equations. So, this is well we use that now. This is well known. What I want to mention is that if we choose, we need to ask in our results, we need to ask that the oscillation of the solution to the fluid equation is sufficiently small. Is sufficiently small. This is less or equal to some constant times to epsilon zero. But epsilon zero is independent of the cruise number. This is small, but has nothing to do with the cruise number. So, and another one is for the compressible Euler equations. I mean, for the isentropical case. So, this is the results by Elesco and Pasuta in 2014. They showed that. They showed that for such a Euler maximum equation isentropic case, if the initial data is substantially regular and small, then it does have a global solutions. And the solutions decrease. Yes, the regularity is very high, for example, something like 10 to the power 4, but plus 1. But for the lower world derivatives, for example, for some n1 substance. For some n1 substance, but great density, then we can show that the decay is quite good. The normal derivative decays very fast. The P0 is greater one. So decay very fast. So from this one, from these types of results, but for this result, the solution is small in some sense. So in this case, if we take the each one is small, so we can take the such as the As the constant Tc. So this capital T is the solution of the absorption temperature of the solution of the conversion Euler equation. And here T capital T is the absolute temperature of the solution of the conversal Euler equation. Our results means that if we take the initial data in the sufficient way in some sense, we can choose the T C such a Tc such a constant T C such a disholder. So under the T C is the global max winning I mentioned before. So now our main results can be stated as the follows. So this means that the interactions, or so this is the, for example, we ask this is the energy functional and this is the energy functional and this is a functional and then this is a entropy dispersion rate function. What I want to see is we want to use the interplay before the solution f epsilon two types of energy norm. So we want to interpolate between the such this is a estimated visible to f this is estimated to if you so this is a power we can indeed show that if the initial data can be can be state is find as this And T C is constant. I mentioned before. If this is the initial data for the fluid part of the coefficient, and the energy function, the energy, the energy function is bounded at time t equal to zero. And then we can show that there is a constant epsilon greater than zero such that for the lung. That for the Langlau equation. So, this is T. So, this, I mean that we have this, we can show that the Landau equation does have a solutions. And such expansion holders in the same time in the field when the conversion oil equation has a solutions. And also, we can show that these are kind of a bundle. From these bundles, we can show this that such a means that. So, such a this means that the solutions as the mean this t0 is the uh is the time in the t e te is the time uh is the time uh time interval on which the compressor oil equation has a group solution because the smooth solutions we can show that as the group number tends to zero this dot tends to the solution convergent to the local maximum determined by the solution of the compressor oil. Solution of the compressor oil equation. So, this is the Helver expansion for the Langdau equation. For the VMS system, so we have also defined the corresponding energy functional and then the energy, the entropy dissipation rate functional. And our result is that if the initial distribution functions and initial electromagnetic field can be expanded in this way, and then if the rho t u l u low t u low u t e b is the smooth solution of the Euler Maxwell equation and then T C is defined as before if the this one is used to determine the coefficient of the of the fluid part of the coefficient and then we ask the initially the energy function is bounded then we can show that in such a time interval when t greater than zero less or equal than equal to the power zero less or equal to each to the power one third and then we can show that the the VM system does have the solutions and and satisfy this kind of estimates from these estimates we can show that the expansion holders work so this is our main results so now since time is needed I just skip the quickly to show the formal results so of the formal results so of for the for the fluid uh for the fluid uh limit of uh for the for the kalatic equations the first one is time and support to show time and support they are equivalent for the result for such a result for the boltman equation there are many results for the for example the global maximum or some element wave fields for the land equation that some results by language and his group and then for the compressible Euler equations the latter one is to Equation: another one is to shoot when the cruise number is small, the solution converges. So, for example, for the combustible Euler limit for the Boltzmann equation, so in the analytical formula, and also for the smooth solutions. So, I will talk back to this one later. So, and also for the inferromoh, Riemann solutions for 1D converse oil in the summary results. And the incomposer for the income. And the income for the income limit, there are some also summarized just for the income versus left full limit and the conversion left social approximation of the bottom, there are also many results. But now, for the what we want to show is to the required duration of the Halbert expansion for the Boltzmann equation. So, in fact, there are some results. There are some results. Results, there are some results for the let me see. There are some results for the record suggestion of the health efficiency for both material efficiency. So, for example, for the caution problem for the initial boundary failure problem, the main problem in this argument used in all these methods ask that the problem that the main difficulty is that if you want to choose a firefile, the helpless expansion. firefile the homeless expansion holders record mathematical records we need to we have to in encounter the following following term this the quad quad cubic term of the of the velocity v to the power three so here from max winning there the you take derivatives from the which observed temperature then you have a v square so from here have a v square so from here another v so how to the main problem is how to control this one how to control this term so the the the for the for the bottom equation with cutoff potential cutoff potential then there are some results by cave and yanko they use the all of these estimates i need to use the uh need to use the uh the lines uh for the cutoff case For the cutoff case, we can decompose the linearizer Bosmac operator into the collision operator into two parts. This decomposition is very important in the analysis. Also, the so-called L2L infrared approach are developed for such argument. Anyway, I want to say that for the Boltzmann equation with long cutoff potential, with cutoff potential, so there are some argument by Professor Carvalish and Yango and Group. So, but for the Langdown type equation, or for the Lang cut of both line, the problem is how to the problem is uncanny. The main purpose of all this talk is to consider the case for the Langdao type equation or the Lang cut of Bolsonaro equation. Are the line cut of Boltzmann equation? So, our main argument is the following. So, the first argument is that one. So, we use the interplay between two F epsilon and H epsilon. So, for example, what I want to say is that F epsilon can be transport bounded by H epsilon, then we have a lot of exponential decay. So, this means that you want if for such terms, so for the if you want to deduce the S1 F equation, so we have we need to bound the such a term. We need to bound the such a term to contribute the phi to the power cubed. This to this term, so this one can bound our idea. Is this one? So we have this one. This is the fluid part, this is the long fluid part. Fluid part of low problem can cancel. This is the explanation decay. So this is the low problem. So this part can be used as a ground equality. For the long fluid part, we decompose into the lower velocity part and the higher velocity part. velocity part and the higher velocity part. For the higher velocity part, then we can use this one, no problem. We can use the dissipation of the minimized Langdau collision operator. For this part, we use the dis estimate. We use H epsilon to bind in F epsilon, and then we use the smallness of the H epsilon. We can give a disbound. So at the close number ten to zero, this is the sufficient. number 10 to zero this is sufficient what what i mean is that we use two types of energy type estimates we want to bound the f epsilon by to transform reduce the estimator the the the the the back term on f epsilon into h epsilon but here we have a less coefficient this is sufficient small so this is the double one but for the uh for the anyway uh this is the first idea This is the first idea. So now let's scope them. Now, for the case, if we would derive an estimate on H epsilon, if we derive the, so what I mean is the formula I say that if you want to, for the bad term, for F episode, you can transfer this into X event. But for exhibition, you cannot how to for exhibition. For exhibition, for example. For attributions, for example, we will use this type of, when construct the group solutions to some complex kalactic equations, we will introduce such a type of weight. From weight, such a weight, we can deduce a light, a light, how to say, a light actual dissipation time. So, what I want to say is that we can we use this actual time extra time this nice term to control those terms appeared in exhibition so in through this way we can uh count and then we also will use the last decay of the solution of the eulo-maxwell equation then we can use the uh the the the estimate so so this is uh the main idea of our size so now uh uh just one minute uh one more minute sorry for the for the delay so The for the delay. So, for example, for the Boltzmann, for the long cut of Velasovo Maxwell Boltzmann equation, the problem is that we cannot, the problem is that if we deduce the weighted estimates, such as types of weighted estimates, to the Boltzmann equation, to the line cut of Boltzmann equation, our formal calculation with Lenjundan and Song Chen Yu shows that we can only have the only has the here the weight here just one one for the velocity so so the but anyway we we can use some uh anyway such a problem can can be uh overcomed for the land cut of boltzman so in summary i want to say that for the non-double type equation and the land cut of boltsman equation so we can indeed do indeed Indeed, show that the help of the expansions than CD holders provided that the resulting fluid equations has a global, has a smooth solution, and the oscillation of the solution is sufficiently small. But I want to point out that the oscillation of the small of the oscillation of the fluid equations Clude equations have nothing to do with the mean free path, the closed number. So I think I stop here. Thank you for your attention.
