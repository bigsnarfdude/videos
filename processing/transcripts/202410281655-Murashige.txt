Thank you very much for the introduction and help. And first of all, I'd like to thank all the organizers of this workshop for giving me this opportunity. Thank you very much. Today I'd like to talk about a gravity current. This is a gentle work with Dr. Kamasa. Gravity current is a flow of one fluid within another caused by the density difference between the fluid. By the density difference between the two flues. This is an example of experiments conducted by this group in 2005. Here, each photograph shows a side of view of 2 meter long and 0.2 meter deep. Water tank of 2 meter long and 0.2 meter deep. And the top photo shows the initial state at t equal to 0. And here two flues of different. And here two fluids of different densities are separated by this partition. And the density ratio is 0.993, and the left fluid is slightly heavier than the right one. And these two fluids are bounded above and below by the horizontal rigid walls. And at t equals zero, this partition was vertically removed. Then, and the interface between these two flues changes with time like this. With time like this. And after these transient states have disappeared, we can observe at least two types of gravity currents. Namely, one is left-going gravity current rhythms, and another one is right-going gravity current rhythms. And we can find disclosure flows in many natural and industrial circumstances. And on the other hand, Dr. Benjamin. On the other hand, Dr. Benjamin theoretically considered this flow of gravity current in this paper in 1968. And particularly, he derived an approximate solution of this flow. And using his approximate solution, we can calculate the shape of this interface and compare with this experimental result like this. This dashed line is Benjamin's approximate solution. means approximate solution. So you can see this solution agrees with this experimental result very well. And in order to get this solution, Benjamin adopted the steady-state approach. Namely, he assumed this interface moves with constant speed in permanent form. This work follows this approach. And the aim of this work is to estimate accuracy of Benjamin's approximate solution. Benjamin's approximate solution and improved solution using local flow analysis near some critical point of this flow. And also from this local flow analysis, we found singularities at the critical point play a key role in this flow. Then I'm trying to examine generation of singularities, namely how these singularities are generated from another point. From another point of view, using the initial value problem. I talk about this in this order. Let me begin with the formulation of this problem following Benjamin's theory. Benjamin focused on this type of gravity current and formulated this problem on these assumptions and ideas. First, he assumed this interface. Assumed this interface moves to the left with constant speed in permanent form and fluid two-dimensional in this vertical cross-section. Then, this fluid motion is steady in this frame of reference moving with this interface. And also, he assumed the motion of this upper area is negligible, or namely, at rest in this frame, moving frame. Then, this problem becomes one. Then this problem becomes one year problem for the lower fruit. And also, he assumed near this point, corner flow is created. This assumption is based on these experiments. Around here, a corner flow is created. And at this point, a flow separates from the top wall. So we call this point the separation point S. And furthermore, And furthermore, in order to analytically obtain an approximate solution, we introduce conformal mapping of the fluid domain into another complex plane like this. We call this complex plane lambda plane. In this plane, the interface S to B is mapped onto this upper half of the circumference of the new circle. Here, this chi denotes the interface. Yeah, this chi denotes the argument in this complex frame that it ranges from 0 to pi. And chi chord 0 corresponds to point B. Point B is the downstream end. And chi chord pi corresponds to S, S is a separation point S. And also the top A to S and the bottom A2 to B two, these two rigid walls are mapped onto minus one to one on the real axis. Then Axis. Then the distributed domain is mapped onto the inside of this semicircle. We formulate this problem in this complex plane. Then it's convenient to introduce the logarithmic code of variable or omega as a flow variable. This variable is defined by this, namely the logarithm of the complex velocity W, and its real part tau is the localism of the absolute value of root velocity. The absolute value of fluid velocity Q. And the imaginary part theta denotes the flow direction. And this complex variable omega is analytic in the flow domain and satisfies these boundary conditions. First, this is the rigid door condition on the top door and the bottom. And the second condition is the upstream end condition. The third condition is the downstream end condition. Downstream endo condition. These two end conditions are derived from these conservation laws. And next, this is the pressure condition on the interface. In this problem setting, the upper area is assumed to be at rest. So the static pressure acts on this interface like this. And using Bernoulli's equation, this equation can be. This equation can be rewritten for omega in this form. Here, tau is a real part of omega, and theta is the immersion part of omega. And chi is the argument in this complex plane, and this represents the location on the interface. This is interface condition. And the last condition is a corner flow condition and near this point, separation point. And the flow of row cut flow analysis near this point. Flow analysis near this point, and we can find the angle of this corner is 2/3 pi, namely 120 degrees. This result is similar to this case, the local flow near the crest of highest surface wave, and this is a well-known result. And in this case, this corner flow or solution for omega is given by this. And these are boundary conditions of this flow in this complex spa. Flow in this complex frame. However, it's difficult to get a solution fully satisfying all of these boundary conditions. Then, Benjamin tried to get an approximate solution. His idea is to neglect this interface condition and derive an approximate solution satisfying all the other conditions except this interface condition. Interface condition. This is his idea, and he obtained this solution. He introduced a new variable, capital q tilde, defined by this. Using the rational function of this variable, he approximated the solution. And here, the corner-flow singularity is included through this exponent. And using this solution, we can calculate the shape of the interface. Uh the shape of the interface like this. However, this solution doesn't satisfy uh the interface condition. Its solution satisfies all the other conditions, but only this condition is not satisfied not satisfied. Then we may evaluate the error of this approximate solution using this interface condition like this. Here, this capital G denotes the left-hand side of this interface condition. This condition. And substituting the approximate solutions of tau and theta into this left-hand side, we can get this capital G tilde. And if this capital G tilde is small enough, we may expect that the error of this solution is also small. So we may regard this capital G tilde as the error index. And this figure shows this error index of the vendor in the program. Or this area index of the bending approximate solution. Here, this axis of abyssis denotes the location on the interface. The left end corresponds to the separation point S, and the right end corresponds to the downstream end B. So, this figure shows variation of the error of Benjamin's approximate solution along the interface from S to B. And this dashed line corresponds to zero. So, from this figure, we can see. So, from this figure, we can see the error rapidly increasing at both ends, here and here. Then, I examined local fluoro solutions near these two points, S and B, in this complex plane using this complex plane. In this complex plane, the separation point S is mapped onto lambda equal to minus 1, and the density remained. 1 and the downstream end of B is mapped onto gamma equal 1. Then, local solutions of omega can be written in these forms. Namely, near the separation point S, a solution approaches a corner flow, or given by this. And near the downstream end B, a solution approaches this uniform flow. Pengen is approximate solution satisfies these leading order conditions. And also, we can examine. And also, we can examine the remaining terms, high-order terms. Then we find the next order terms are given by G's. Particularly, these exponents, mu1 and mu1, these two are given by these. So, both of these are not integer. It means these two terms are singular. And we can incorporate these secondary singularities into Benjamin's approximate solution. Solution like this raw equation. This row equation is the newly obtained solution. Japan equation is the Benjamin's approximate solution. These are in the same form, but here new variables, capital P and capital Q, are introduced. And particularly, the secondary singularities are included through these exponents, mua and mua. Here, let me emphasize the difference between these two approximations. Between these two approximate solutions. Benjamin's approximate solution satisfies only the leading order conditions of these Roper flow solutions. On the other hand, a newly obtained solution satisfies these Roper flow solutions up to the second order time. This is a difference. Then I compare the error index of these two approximate solutions. And this is a result. This is the result. Here, the red line is the error of benzamine solution, and blue line is the error of the newly obtained solution. So, we can see the error is reduced, particularly near both end. And also, we can further improve these solutions by adding higher-order terms like this. And in this case, we have to numerically determine these unknown coefficients. And here, let me skip. And here, let me skip details here, but we can reduce the error using these high-order corrections like this. This green line and blue line, this line shows the error of the high-order approximate solution with eight tons. And here, let me emphasize. Let me emphasize that the exponents of secondary singularity is mu1 and μ1. These two are included in high-order terms like this. So, from this, we found the secondary singularities near the separation point S and downstream and B are essential for gravity currents. This is the main result we've obtained from these raw perforal analysis. And also these raw curflow analysis motivated me to Analysis motivated me to start to work on generation of singularities, namely how these singularities are generated, and particularly at this point, the separation point. I've not obtained any new results yet, but let me explain briefly what I'm doing. First, in order to catch singularities, I'm trying to repo consider this problem using an initial value problem. using initial value problem of this flow which is called which called is called partial depth slope exchange flow or like this. This flow is close to this experiment which I showed first. Only the difference is initial state. In this flow, this partition doesn't reach the top wall. So the height of this partition is smaller than the total water depth. Smaller than the total water depth. And initially, the left side of this partition is filled with heavy fluid up to this height. And right fluid is on this heavy fluid. And after this partition is removed, this interface changes like this. This is called the partial rock exchange flow and has been studied in some previous works. Some previous works. For example, this figure shows some computed results of the Navier-Stokes equations for this flow by this group in 2017. Here, each figure shows the snapshot of the side view at a certain time for different values of the density ratio, like this. Here, small h to raise h. Small h is the height of this partition. The rajh is Of this partition, the large edge is the total water depth. And this ratio is changed from 0.4, 0.5, 0.08 to 0.9. And with increase of this depth ratio, this flow approaches the gravity current in this work. And particularly, I'm interested in variation of rubber flow near here. And we may expect that this limiting process may give us some hints to understand generation of similarities at the Generation of similarities at the separateial point of gravity currents. And also, this problem has been studied using non-dispersive model in shallow water theory. These equations, the two-layer shallow water equations for local depth theta and the layer mean horizontal velocity u. And in this case, top and the bottom are bounded by horizontal rigid walls. So this equation. So this equation can be reduced like this for eta2 and u2 of the lower fluid. And here small a and small b, these are coefficient functions given by this. And these two equations can be written in this matrix form and using eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of this matrix A, which are given by Which are given by this. It is eigenvalue and left eigenvector. And using this, this model can be written in this form of characteristic equation. And this is suitable for this problem because initially the fluid motion is at rest. So this is similar to the well-known damp break problem. And in this case, one of Riemann invariants. One of the Riemann invariants is constant everywhere, so the solution is simplified. Such a solution is called the simple wave solution, and we can easily obtain the solutions. Let me show you some completed results of the time evolution of the interface for this case. The density ratio is 0.23 and the x ratio is 0.24. This is initial state, and this black line is uh the interface between two rules. Between two rules. And after this partition is removed, this interface changes like this at t called 0.5, 1.0, 1.5. And this is the time evolution of the interface for this case. The depth ratio is 0.4. And increasing this depth ratio, this time evolution changes like this. This is 4.4. This is 4.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.99. So, from this, we can see with the increase of this depth ratio, the shape of the interface changes from Shinguru-valued to multi-valued. These are the results for this case. The ratio is fixed to 0.3. Increasing this value of KHT ratio, we can get this result. We can get this result. This results for this case, the HT ratio is 0.6. And further increasing, we can get these results. These are for 0.9. So from this, we can see for the whole range of the density ratio, we can find this phenomena. Namely, the shape of the interface changes from single-valued to multi-value. Single value to multi-value. This phenomena was first pointed out by Rottman Simpson in 1983 and has been studied in some previous works. And this may be related to the generation of singularities, but it is a the result for non-dispersive model. So now I'm trying to examine some dispersive effects on this phenomena and investigate. and investigate generation of singularities from this limiting process with increase of this depth ratio. And this is one of future works. This is a summary of my talk. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much. Any questions? Can you compute the critical depth ratio? Critical depth ratio. Critical depth ratio of what? Yeah. 0.500. Yeah. Yes. And we can calculate, we can obtain this value analytically from the characteristic equations. And like this. The edge ratio is given by this, and it depends on the ratio of RGs. The first part, yeah. Yeah, it's right on the steady part. Singularity Meaning of this? How do you get it? First, we assume that the next order term can be written in this form and substituting the boundary condition. The boundary conditions and matching the problem of leading order the next order, matching of each order terms. The local flow analysis is that. How does that then globally make it all work across the board? Error is reducing to zero across the interface by fixing the fact that the map is. It's almost zero. Yeah, yeah, this one, yeah. Yeah, this is the result of using this. And I tried to minimize the error. Actually, the square, square error. You have to normalize the error. It's a Error. It's a it's uh the coefficient is uh optimized to this error. The error is a electron is defined by this. So actually with with those exponents, the mu1 and the mu1
