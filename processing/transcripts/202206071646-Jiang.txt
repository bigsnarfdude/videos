Thank you, Max Hans. So, first of all, it's a quite great pleasure and honor to have the opportunity to give a talk here. Thank you for Marco to say that the first talk me to yeah, I don't need to go over to I don't need to go over many things. So, before we get into that busyness of integrating the bio debris, I would like first to promote, so Marco mentioned there's a biharmation interpretation of GPS structure. And I would like to give a number. It's purely Poisson. So I would like to promote that description to this Poisson community. So, and actually, this is known like 20 years ago, like two pages: Yakov Rich and Zapdin. Refer the GKMN for is equivalent to the problem data. So again you have a metric and you have two complex rock gi plus minus. But this time we don't form the two forms. So first of all let's assume g i plus minus are again I will assume they are compatible by green i plus minus compatible I plus minus alpa. Then we can cook up to five vectors. And this is, as you may just recognize, is the formula for the two real Poisson structures Marco just mentioned in person. By the way, my notation may be a little different on Arcode. Arcode is just Pi 1 and it's Pi 2. So DK manifold is equivalent to this data such that if you cook up these two pi vectors, they are Poisson. And if you look at the sculpting bracket, these two Poisson structures. Two potential structures. Unfortunately, user is not zero. So it's controlled by these three, by the three form of a Germany level. Here H is a sum of close real three form of M. Somehow this is a Somehow, this is uh this two bioxean Poisson and this uh equation somehow encodes the interval of a GPA metric. QV Poisson geometric interpretation. And moreover, if you look at these two Poisson structures, they are transverse to each other, the Poriation are transverse to each other, and indeed. And indeed, if you look at this Potten's workers, Dira's workers, and you look at the graph, right? They form out in triple modes. So we have two minor triples. Um now what I like to do next is to yeah, Mark mentioned that so this is some kind of they have holomorphic incarnation. They're just like the holomorphic neural structure A plus minus and B plus minus, right? And I would like to make that more explicit. So there's a preposition. Uh proposition. We know this exists over GPI manifold, right? By the way, I do this, I chose, so there are some clonical streets you can use to street the honomorphic. To split the holomorphic round algebraies, I will just write the holomorphic algebra. Marko discussed in the last lecture E plus minus in this way. So these are E plus minus and H plus minus they are the two one part of the the colour three form of the G terminal. Respect pass of minus. We have this malin triple, holomorphic malin triples. And how are they related to each other? So there's an answer to this question. Actually, they are related by data equivalent. So we can. So there's a standard construction if you have a holomorphic DRAS structure, then you can form a match pair. So first of all, you will use this A plus as a complex Diral structure, then you take a match pair with Tc of 1 plus. Again, this is a Diral structure. It's called the match pair of A plus with Tc1 plus. So somehow it encodes the holomorphic structures of that holomorphic Diral structure. Or moment you also and that's called this A plus C. Okay, then similarly you have B plus several much pairs. Little C here to indicate some kind of complexity of okay, so the relationship So the relationship between these two homo mining people is that there exist real two points such that A plus and A plus C and A minus C occasion and for B side So we should be careful here. For the B side, I don't choose B minus. What I would choose is B minus conjugate. So actually conjugate B minus. And that's the relationship. And before the categorize the GPS structure, so if you give me such an object, a pair of horns. A pair of holomorphic marine triples, and they satisfy these two gauge equations. Then they determine the degenerate GK structure. Actually, that's a generalization of one of Marco's results in his paper, brains on phosphone varieties. He discussed how to, yeah, there's a similar feature. So in synthetic pains, a special case of. A special case of this result is in the simpler type case manifold of simpler type case is equivalent to a pair of holomorphic Poisson structures together with a closed two form such that this equation goes. Right? Hope you remember this because at the end that's the most important equation in my comment. Actually, this journalized in that symbol equations. So what happened here is a But what's going on here is, you see, in this picture you don't see FO1, L2, right? You don't see the compressed neural structure directly. You also don't see the H. I mean, of course H plus minus are determined by H, but what's the other way around? So if you give me such a longitude, how do I determine a G5 structure? How do I determine a GV structure? And I would like to sketch the Laplacian structure because it will be relevant. So the point is to observe that once you have these two equations, what's the inevitability condition? That three forms they status file is equations. By the way, because it has conjugate, so here's H minus conjugate. And really you see that the real part, because B1B to okay, forgot what B1B to have real two point. Not necessarily closed, just two point. In this equation you already see that real part of H plus minus are the same and thus that H will increase together by double binding. And how about the imagery part? You yeah, if you subtract for example the second equation by the first equation you get So that means the imaginary part is exact. So basically, that's the reason why these money triples are holomorphic interpretation. If you would like to stimulate, If you would like to think of them as some kind of imaginary part or holomorphic, real part of a holomorphic derived structure, first of all, there should be some trivial groundbreaking. Otherwise, you don't get this, right? Because this ground is trivial. This explains why the reason there's a possibility that this has a holomorphic incarnation. So the result is. So the result is that because this is exact, I can just trivialize the imaginary part and just get a real part of the Quran algebra. So what I mean is these two holomorphic Quran algebra, their real part can be identified and the imaginary part can be just cancelled out. This is a tree we want. So you can gauge your way by using these two forms. And this will be the original current algebra we use to define the GC structures. And then with L1, L2, then you just transfer, you just transfer these much pairs. Like for example For example, this will be L1. So it is not L1. So L1 is something else. It's like this. So this is a construction of L1, L2, the compressed era structures of the GC structures. They are the eigenbundled plus eigenbundles of G L1 or J2. Okay, I use 1 and 2, I don't use A L. Sorry. And this F plus minus, they are, okay, they are this. Okay. So there's F plus is the primitive of H H plus, as you can. So that's how this picture corresponds to a GK structure. And from these equations, you can readily see that, okay, let me erase this. You can really see that these holomorphic divine structures, A plus minus, B plus minus, the real parts are the same. You can identify them naturally. There's some kind of Okay, there's some kind of the current algebra in, I mean, this derival structure, they're leaving in some non-trivial coronavirus. So three forms that's non-trivial. But for the imaginary part, something quite cool happened. So for the imaginary part, this marketple is going to go down to the plus colour. To the first graph. But for the minus side, it's going to be equivalent to the second round. So that's what uh what's going on in zone. So this is gives us a holomorphic incarnation of interpretation for this uh Interpretation for these two real puzzle structures. So, any questions? I will keep this and I the important part will be this was integration. So the idea is to integrate this honomorphic route, honomorphic mining triples, A plus, B plus. As we know, they are just equivalent to d5 algebraics. And I would like to make some. I would like to make a little view of integration of puzzle of the biology project or monitoring process smooth or holomorphic. So already there are many mathematicians provide these techniques of integrating integration of the biogeography during structures. So the way I will describe is to use the integration of dual structures. I would like to think of this integration if by algebra is build this integration of dirge. Build this integration of Dirac operators. So let's first talk about integration of Dira So established by boosting Karenic, Weinstein, and Zoom. So this result says that if we have a If we have money triple, actually on my standard, of course I have money triple. So I'll just start with the money triple. Then we have this money triple either smooth or homomorphic. And A is a theoretical structure, and I try to integrate it. So this position A is integrable. So there is a source simplicity connected the input point of A. Point of A and this integration results test that there is a precinct structure multiplexive the simple means Be a forming guy is uh is uh frequent and it satisfies some kind of non-degenerating condition. And I would like to rephrase it in this way. So you can see the graph omega and use the anchor map on boot point of a runoff space. So A runoff state. So downstairs we have a payroll point with this uh diral structure. So the condition is that it's a strong forward dura. So the strong means that the kernel, so there's a cloning of choriomorphism. only call choreomorphism. Kernel of that choreomorphism into the size of omega to be there. But uh it simply just says if you take uh omega with turnover dt and turnover ds, you get zero. That's strong doesn't mean I'm strong and forward you also wasn't it. This duras stronger forward is cultural. Okay that's the integration of a dura structure. That's the integration of a dural structure. And then there's a result proved by Alexey, Boosting and Merinton. So they study this marine triple. And once you give me mining triple, and I integrate A, I have this picture. And I can try to pull it back. And I can try to pull it back, D-Rock pull it back. The second D-Raw struggle, that is not. The result is that this D-Rock pullback will be again D-Rock, a transverse to a graph of omega. So we get a marine triple downstairs. So there's a marine triple for each. Yeah, this group algebra, as you may expect, was uh discoveries. Okay and yes, once you have a mini triple, a really cool thing you can do is to own Dirac Sun, as Microsoft State. So So if you have two zero structures, they form min triple, there's a polynomial structure hidden inside. So this would be page to a possible structure that is formula. So there's a problem structure ID layer. And it is more difficult. Is multiplicative, it's not multiplicative, it's standard of affine Poisson structures, and that makes G into a Poisson rule. So this becomes Poisson rule. Okay, that's the what's the meaning of integrating a D by algebra. Integrate it first, then we pull it by B to get a problem solving. Okay. So then it comes to basically I I will I'm I'm going to do is present many techniques that already exist in Proton Geometry community and to apply to generalized scalar structures. So another ingredient we need is a deformation result. Deformation result of Poisson Bucolin. I think it's first study by paper by Liu Weinstein and Xi. So, in this paper, they study post-form homogeneous spaces. And I find that it's quite useful to adapt to our situation. So, we have let's say we have a Poisson rule for you. Integral is a default algebra, it's an A. Because B can be identified with A star, so I just with A star. Okay, this is a B by algebra. And so we want to understand how do we deform this Poisson structure. So basically we know that DGOA controls the deformation of pi G, right? Right? Ah is this joy? Downstair, we also have a DGOA. Because we have a D by algebra in the standard result that if you have a D by algebra in, then you get DGLA. And that DGOA controls the deformation of this. Controls the deformation of this star. So we have this PGOA. It controls the deformation of A star for P, if you would like to view it as a monitor. The meaning, the more precise meaning of this is that if you give me a two form, Phone in ways to opaque. And you look at the graph, this epsilon becomes a dual structure if and only if it satisfies a Mauric-Kadon equation. Right. Zero. Or integral Lagrangian, but only if this only cada equation states like. Okay, so now we have two DGOAs. We have Poisson rule board. Again, there's a I find this standard result in the paper. In the paper, it's also quite natural because I think as a, you know, if you have a Poisson group, you look at the cotangent of this good point, you get an LA group point. So there are two, so this is a good point. As soon target goes into A star. So I will do normal number. So I will denominate them by phi s phi ti c t. These are some kind of fungal map or a source and target map. And the definition is quite straightforward. So we just look at the left translation and right translation. So actually it's easier to define his dual map. So let me just do it this way. I will describe a dual map and you can figure out the original map. So there are two maps closing to TG, I do all the map. To DG, I do all the math. So, mostly, they are just, if you think of A as kernel of dt, and this is just respect to M, and this is just kernel of DT if you think of A as kernel of DS, you just get kernel of DS. It's just an enclosure. So then, like you can expect some kind of dev translation, right translation actually like that. And the result is that these are the biological emotions that I will keep these. These are the biological emotions. So study by algebra and moving zen cospon. goes from T star D T G to A star A okay and you have deep algebra in Morph and the key property is that use Use DGOMOFIN So the pullback induce DGO amorphisms this guy to this guy. So you see that. So, you see that if you give me a marvel cut down element downstairs for this DGOA, I can use it to deform this Poisson structure. So that's the idea. That's the idea of deformation of Poisson book boys. I mean, you deform it, okay. So let's see. You choose a normal pattern. I just erase, sorry. If C don't Uh if C long Mara Kadan Not A Then you pull back this Maro cut down element, you get again you get Maro Kartan element for the personal structure and they then okay they are commutative because uh you know because that's almost the description that Left and right address. Brought to zero. If you have the third guy, this is again moral cutdown element. Basically, so we have three model cut down elements, right? And then we try to define, then we define pi gene. For example, we can define it by this kind. Then this is never again the post-point, but there's still a post-some action. Right action. You can control this picture actually because you have this guy. So, for this guy, you attain thousand books. Again, there's a Poisson action for the middle map. So you see this picture is quite similar to what Marco mentioned before, right? So actually I will call these Poisson by modules because these two actions are Poisson actions. Pass on by just a couple of pools. And then let's just apply this technique to general scalar. So journalized calorie we have. What do we have? So we have this, right? So we have paper. So we have A plus, B plus, or A minus, V minus. And let's try start with A minus B minus. Integrates, again, deliverable, I assume it's difficult. Integrates to G minus S minus, G minus O X minus. It's a Poisson Go for it. Integrates S D. possible for integers is evaluated. Then the first two equations is the because this D by algebra is a multi triple this can be identified with the second one. It's like we don't need to deform the Poisson structure for the real. Form the Poisson structure for the real part. Oh, by the way, my convention is a little different from my code, save the imaginary parts I set to real. So for real cards, there is no deformation. For imaginary cards, there is deformation. So basically what's this deformation? I will just avoid the complexity of as you see this picture is actually for smooth deformation. If you want to use the this DGOA to study the holomorphic deformation, you need a drive complex for this DGOA. Anyway, so to avoid that complexity, I will describe a deformation. Describe a deformation that's in terms of real part and imagining part. So for the real part, I fix it. And for the imaginary part, I just fix it. I need to choose Marukata Manner and deploy it, right? So what I choose, um then I just look at this DGOA and it's back. And this guy. It corresponds to this puzzle. Imagine file. So we have this DGOA. It's basically equivalent to this DGOA. So I just use this DGOA. Integration are the same, the Google Approximate Google are the same. And then, if you look at this DGOA, there is a very nice choice of a model cutter network. Of a Marocata method. You just choose the tangent. Of course, this dira structure transfers to the first guy, so it can be characterized by a marker-down element. And if you, of course, you need to do some identification, like well, this is A, right? So. So which 2A was which 2A because pi 1 is you know it's as moving to T star this can be identified as T star. So basically the Morrow Kartan element is a two form for this guy. It's a two form and what's that two form? I hope I choose that sign I use plus or minus maybe I just use plus or minus This is the Hermitian form appearing in the by Hermitian description of GK structure. So this is this guy. So as you can see, his choice is not random. Somehow it just encodes the GK data, just metric. So the idea is that this corresponds to a small data element, right? Then you deform it. Just need to modify this picture a little bit. Just change pi g to this pi minus i because I don't change the real part, right? Basically, I mean, let's just let me just do it. This one, let's pi minus, okay. Discuss minus and this coup point tends to be the G plus side so basically this is a pi plus plus and this is the pi z okay and this is pi z Okay. So that's the feature we have. So you have a homomorphic Poisson bimon between the Poisson Opens of the holomorphic minus triplets, A plus B plus or B minus B minus. And moreover, this is very And moreover, this is very important. There's a bisection. Because you don't change basically you don't change the units. So there's bisection, the unit, S. And for this S C because you function in the real part, it's called isotropy. There is a co-isotropic. A coisotropic bisection for this Poisson structure, for this real part. But if you are an expert of Poisson Google, you will say that what I am saying is wrong. So it's not just core isotropic. It's actually clean, like rounding. But in Lagrangian bisection for a real part of penalty bisection S. Okay? And somehow this is indeed in the symbol type case, we know this because you have a Lagrangian bisection, right? It's Lagrangian respect to a real power. It's Lagrangian respect to a real part of the imaginary particle table, or one of them. And so basically, you get a pullback last structure, you get two forms, the two phone includes the major. But in this picture, actually, we have a quite similarly, we have a clean lack of long-term bicycle for a real part. But this is not yet complete, actually. It's actually a corollary of Actually, a corollary or property of something more deeper. So actually there exists a brain structure. There exists a complex brain supported over its S. So what I mean is the brain. There's derived D. Such that you look at these GC structures. Yeah, I also mentioned this, right? If you have polymorphic polynomial, you get GC structures. So in our case, we have this guy. Here should we choose the imaginary. So, such that J D is D. That's what I mean, a complex brain over S. Basically, you have a dura structure. D, supported over S. It's a supported neural structure. And it's stable. It's stabilized by J. It's a GC structure, so that's the meaning of countless frame. Once you have these, Once you have this, yeah it's quite uh this is quite uh I find it uh kind of amazing. So if you have this automatically it's uh you know it's a coisotropic, this is known, I mean S is choisotropic with respect to the real part. Oh, but I said notation right. So yeah, we have uh yes, but uh I mean yes, Scott is talking for you right it's it's R there, not I. Yeah. We need to use the same one, R upstairs and not I R downstairs. Right. Yeah, I need to use. Yeah, I need to use R instead of But uh you know I just learned this recently. If you have possible points and you have a coin swap by section, automatically it becomes a clean function. So basically a a Lagrangian bisection That somehow explains what's going on in this Lagrangian project. Do I still have time? No. Okay, uh so I'll just write up. Maybe I'll just uh explain why this Explain why this deformation actually generates the synthetic type phase. So I will erase this norm. So actually B field transformation is a special case of remote record anchor deformation. So, what I mean is a particular problem actually. If you give me a two form close two form And it is, let's say we have a Poisson structure pi. We say it's pi admissible if, you know, this guy is invertible. Okay, then you can do a B view transformation with Poisson structure. You get a new Poisson structure. Structure. Okay. And if you try to get the integration, let's say this integrates pi, then the integration of this new Poisson structure is okay. Okay. But uh it's a B view. Sorry, yes, thank you. But actually this is a B view channel. This is a Moroccan, this is a type of Moroccan information. Because of basically, it's just an observation that once you have such admissible tool forms, Missible two forms to get the moral cutter anyway. So basically, how do I do it, right? So you have this graph, a mine triple if I algebra it. And then inside this mine triple, there is a derived structure provided by V. But it's transverse to the route pi because of this condition. Then the model colour. There's a marvel cut down here. Okay, then okay, then you can deform, right? You can deform this Poisson integration omega, like pull back, right? Just like in this picture. And it turns out that you can check this as a condemner. Mega, for example we view it as cross-on boot point instead of simpler group points this moral cut and information. Let's say this is stone B. Basically this is the ingredient we need in a simple type case. I mean because in the simple type case is that Okay, this is a B view transformation by F or omega by F, right? And it's a B view transformation, but you can also use it as aurocardan deformation. I hope, yeah, maybe I should stop here. Thank you. I have a question. Maybe it's for your part quite well, but so you're getting always the same group here. What is changing is What is changing is the the complex structures and the substructure. Right. Now, what's the my question is, what's the relation with separations of the original journalized complex structure? Is there any relation? The original journalized complex structures, so to try to integrate in the sense that That uh micro integrated quickly mobilizing yeah as a relationship I'm not sure when because my code is not yeah but I think Yeah, the I mean the G the G plus is the G plus is somehow like G plus and G minus, these holomorphic Poisson group points, they're only available because of a GK structure, right? So you could say, well, okay, if you have the problem of integrating a GC structure, so then there's this general procedure which There's this general procedure which involves building out this rubloid out of little pieces or something. But if you happen, if that GC structure is part of the GK structure, then you can kind of, as a first step, you can produce this Poisson group like G, no, G minus or G plus, which would be partial integrations of the J A and J B. But they're not holomorphic symplectic. They're not holomorphic symplectic. You know, they're they're only kind of partially there on the way to getting the integration. I don't I don't know but there seems that there was because you have this jk structure there is this trick that you pass to the diagonal by taking the plus and eigenvalues and that's what makes these group points appear on both sides to be the same because you make this thing completely simple. Be the same because you make this thing completely symmetric. There is something on the way that kind of makes life much easier, right? Yeah. No, I mean, I think it's that the relation, to answer your question, is that if you integrate To answer your question, is that if you integrated JA to whatever this weak holomorphic symplectic thing is, that thing would map to this G was. I mean, holomorphic. It would be a holomorphic map to the G plus. But I don't besides that, I don't really know. I mean, once we get up to the point where we can produce the double blue break, then maybe it will become more clear, because at least then you have something symplectic. Maybe you could say just briefly what the market dollars are. What is the Mercator element explicitly in that case that you were talking about? In the symplectic case? Yeah, in the symplectic type case. You said that the B fluid gives rise to a Mercator element. Yes. Which is a two-form. This out here. You raise that pi form. So basically, we are looking at this d biology, right? Where pi 2, oh, sorry, for your convention, pi 1 is invertible, but for me convention, pi 2 is invertible. This guy is invertible means we take pipe. Okay. And then, as I say, we choose this TM, right? Of course, because this is invertible, this graph F plus two form. Right? Then you have a case of transformation. Transformation. This guy transformed. Just identify. I1 transformed by minus F and Tm. And inside here, you have a graph of minus F, right? Then, okay, and this guy is this. What I just described with some kind of proposition, like a big field transformation. For this new transformation is a step special time mark down equation. This deformation. So you apply to this situation. So this F is V queen formation. B is closed. And epsilon B is a two-form. Is a two form. That's yeah, if it's not two, it's different from B. Right. So it's uh an explicit formula for like the one yeah it's this bad this is the model cadmium and that's the element that you push to the group point to give a a more
