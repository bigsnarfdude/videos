Okay, so first of all, thank you thank you very much for the invitation to come here. Likewise, it's my first international travel to go to a conference or anything since the pandemic. So it's very, very nice to be here, especially two years late. Also, I guess I just wanted to say very briefly that the original Just wanted to say very briefly that originally, when this was planned, I was supposed to be giving sort of a series of three talks and then followed by a talk by Colin Bushman, who sadly died in the interim. And so I just thought I can just sort of imagine him sort of walking around outside with his pipe in his hand. And it's obviously it's very sad that he's not here with us. Finally, the last thing I would say is that, so I'm this series of. This series of talks is really aimed at non-experts. So I kind of look in the room and I think that probably I'm not going to say anything that you don't all know already, definitely not today. So I hope that you're not too bored. And hopefully that for some of the people who are joining online, there will be something that they learn. Yeah, I guess that's everything for me. That's yeah, that was everything for now. Okay, so also thank you very much for the help with technology. I should have said that as well, which hopefully is going to work. And hopefully by tomorrow, I'll have worked out how to get rid of the thumbnails in the corner. Anyway, so here's what we're going to do today. So I'm just going to talk a little bit about local fields quickly. Quickly, a bit about so piadic groups, so the sorts of groups that we're interested in. So, first, thinking about the algebraic structure and also the topological structure, so all the sort of the integral structure somehow, and then start talking about smooth representations at the end, and then we will carry on from there. Right, so here's what we're looking at. Here's what we're looking at. So local fields. So we're looking at F is some non-Archimedean local field. So what does this mean? This means something which is either finite over Qp or Laurent series in a single variable over a finite field. Over a finite field. So the ring of integers then is going to be OF. So that's, oops, sorry, that's Zp, the unique maximal ideal, which here would be PZP. And in the case of these fields here, this is the power series. Or the power series with zero constant term. The residue field is the quotient, so this is FP or FQ in these two cases. P is the characteristic, Q is going to be the cardinality of the residue field. And then we're going to take the absolute value symbol to mean the normalized absolute value. Normalized absolute value. Okay, so what I mean is that so this is the one whose image is q to the z, well, together with zero. And so in particular, so what that means is that so the absolute value of a uniformizer is q inverse. And so this var pi is going to be a uniformizer. Later on, I might so most of the time I won't put subscripts on to indicate the field. On to indicate the field, but later on, when there are extension fields, I will. Oh, I remember that. That's not how I scroll down. Right. Okay, so what do these fields look like? Well, so the additive group of the field, so this is a topological field, has a fundamental system of neighborhoods of zero consisting of the pro p subgroups, which are just given by the powers of the maximum ideal. Okay, and so this. ideal. Okay, and so this is a filtration in the sense that the this is interesting which way around to do it. I'm not sure where this is. The intersection of all of them is zero and the union is the whole thing. The multiplicative structure, so again, so I said this field is locally compact. So this is multiplicative structure is a locally compact group. Multiplicative structure is a locally compact group. It has a unique maximal compact subgroup, which is the units. And then inside this, it has nice filtration by open prop subgroups, which are the things which are congruent to one mod some power of p. Okay. And again, so filtration, so this means that the intersection of all of them is just one. Intersection of all of them is just one. It's a fundamental system of neighborhoods of the identity. Okay, I want to talk briefly also about characters of these groups. So I'm going to have C being an algebraically closed field of characteristic L, okay, which L is not going to be P. So I was going to say when I said this at this point, not like in the previous talk, but the previous talk is now happening tomorrow. So. So, but we do allow L equals zero, of course. So, I've written down two conditions there. Really, I mean, C, in quite a lot of what I say, C doesn't necessarily have to be a field even. I've just decided to do it like that so that then I don't have to start talking too often about, oh, but I have to add this condition there and then take this and so on. Occasionally, I'll comment on things which are true more generally. True more generally. But really, the two conditions that are important are that p is invertible and that it contains enough p power roots of unity. Okay, those are the two conditions which matter. And actually, even the enough p power roots of unity, you know, if f is a field of positive characteristic, it just needs pth roots of unity. It doesn't even need all p power roots of unity. Okay. And then the point is then what you can do is you can have a non-sony with the condition on the p power roots of unity, you can have a non-trivial Have a non-trivial additive character. Okay, so this non-trivial additive character here, I'm going to normalize it. I'm going to choose one of, I don't know, level one or conductor P or whatever. The point is that it's trivial on the maximal ideal and non-trivial on the units. Okay, this is just a way of fixing one for normalizing things later. And then what this gives us is this. What this gives us is this gives us here a bijection between the field and the continuous additive characters just by taking the translation of our fixed additive character psi. And similarly, if I don't want to look at all things, but just look at characters of subgroups, then I can get a Then I can get a bijection, well, an isomorphism between the cosets of P to the minus m and p to the minus n, and the additive characters of this quotient. Okay, so those are additive characters. We can also talk about multiplicative characters, so characters of the multiplicative group. Okay, so here, so again, this is going to. Here. So again, this is going to be looking at continuous characters of continuous characters from f cross to the multiplicative group, so some group homomorphism. So continuous for the trivial, for the discrete topology on the coefficient field C. So in particular, that means that the inverse image of the identity has got to be open. So that means it's a So that means it's actually going to be a smooth character. So we can talk about its depth, the depth of the character, the depth of the character, okay, which is the minimum n such that the kernel contains this group of This group of units congruent to one mod p to the n plus one. And another word: so we're going to say that this character is unramified if actually it's trivial on the maximal compact subgroup. So another way of saying that is that it's trivial on all compact subgroups. Okay, so that's unramified. And so we can match up the additive and the multiplicative structures. The multiplicative structures, at least if we look at cosets. So here we can match the cosets, the additive cosets to multiplicative cosets here by what is essentially a truncated exponential map. But actually, if you do an exponential map, really, then you have to worry about convergence and things. And so, but here you can just do it: x goes to one plus x. And so combining this with the isomorphism on the previous. this with the isomorphism on the previous on the previous uh slide uh we we can uh see what all the what all the characters of one of these unit groups look like remember that they're all um at least at least uh the ones which are trivial on on a subgroup which is not too much smaller okay so this is we we have this uh this condition here on m and n that they're not too different um and in that case we get And in that case, we get a nice isomorphism of character groups so that we can identify, essentially, we can identify the characters by something additive on this side. Okay. Right. Okay, so that's the field. I should also say, if people are putting questions in the chat, I can't see them, but I guess somebody, you'll tell me. You'll tell me if you'll tell me. You'll tell me. You'll tell me if you'll tell me if there are questions. Okay. Okay, so periodic groups. Right, so what are we going to have? We're going to take a group which is the group of F rational points of a connected, I think it'll usually be connected. So maybe I shouldn't have put it in brackets. Reductive group defined over F. Now, I'm not going to go through the theory of reductive groups. So, but rather just think about examples. Okay, so. About the examples, okay. So, um, the examples, I mean, the easiest example to have in mind is GLNF, and I'm kind of mostly show GLNF and then say what changes for other groups or what one has to do to make it more general, but also SLN or some classical groups, so the symplectic group or whatever your favorite group is, think of that one. So, here, for example, I've written down what the symplectic group SB2N is. Is okay, and so this group has so this is a this group has two structures. So it has an algebraic structure coming from the algebraic group G, and it also has a topological structure coming from the field F. Okay, so it's a topological group for the topology coming from F. And so those give us two different things that we can think about and we can think about playing against each other. So I can start off with the algebraic structure. Like I said, I'm going to start off with GLN. So GLN has, so GLN has, so inside it, it has this nice big abelian, this nice big abelian subgroup. Okay, so this is the subgroup here, T, which is the diagonal, just the diagonal elements. Okay, and so this is what's called a maximal F split torus. So torus means that it's isomorphic to a number of copies of GL1, so of the multiple. One, so of the multiplicative group. F split means that that isomorphism is defined over f and so it's maximal for that property and it's the standard one. Standard is just because it just means that we've chosen one. Okay, and this is the obvious one. So important facts about this. So the first thing is that all maximal S-flit tora are conjugate to T. Okay. A conjugate to t okay, so uh so so again, what I mean is that that you the the the so t is the points of a torus, and I mean that t is if you've got another f-split maximal torus, you to look at its points, then it's conjugate in in TLNF to uh to this one. So, somehow we can just think about this standard one. Um, the other thing that's worth saying is that that doesn't mean that there aren't other maximal tori, okay? So, for example, um So, for example, maybe the easiest one to see, and which is sort of at the opposite extreme, is to take some separable extension of degree n. So we can think of then E as an n-dimensional vector space. And so like that, we can think we get an isomorphism between G and the F. This means this means aut F, I mean automorphisms as an F vector space. As an F vector space, okay, so the F vector space automorphisms of E, okay. Of course, E cross embeds into that, and then so there is some maximal torus T prime, whose points is exactly the multiplicative, or exactly the multiplicative group of this field. Okay, okay, and so this should have said that it's conjugate to T because obviously it's obviously conjugate to T prime. So it's conjugate to T. So it's conjugate to T in the extension, TLNE, but it's not conjugate of a C over T L N F. And so this gives, as I say, this gives something somehow at the opposite extreme, and then there are things in between. Okay, so that's Tori. So this maximal S-blit Taurus sits inside the standard. The standard Borel subgroup, okay, so which is just the things which are upper triangular, and so again, this is this is all so a Borel subgroup is a maximal connected solvable subgroup, and in general, they're all conjugate to this one. Okay, so that's that's Borel subgroups, and then parabolic subgroups are. So, the standard parabolic subgroups are things which are block upper triangular, like this, for some block sizes, whose obvious use sum is n. And so there are different ways of saying actually what a parabolic subgroup is. So, here we could say a parabolic subgroup is a subgroup which contains a Borel. That works well for GLN. That works well for GLN. So, a Borel is something which is conjugate to the standard Borel, or is a maximal connected solvable. But in general, it's the same thing as saying that it's a closed algebraic subgroup such that the quotient is a projective variety. And actually, that's what one needs to do in general. If one wants to do it more. Okay, so then so we've now we've done the Then, so we've now we've done these first three here: the torus, the borel, and the and the and the parabolic. So, the parabolic has inside it's the maximal connected normal unipotent subgroup. So, unipotent means that all the elements are unipotent. So, and unipotent, an element being unipotent means all its eigenvalues are one. Okay, so this is the called the unipotent radical of p. Radical of P and then a Levy subgroup is a complement to N in P. So we have P as a, as I said, semi-direct product of M and N. And there is a nice one, which is the one which contains our fixed standard maximal S-plit torus, so the one containing T. Torus, so the one containing t, and that's the one which is block diagonal, so it's isomorphic to a product of GLN. So I guess the important thing somehow is that this Levy subgroup is somehow made up of groups which are smaller than the group that we started with. And so it allows us to have some inductive process, hopefully, to by understanding the smaller groups, we can eventually understand the bigger group. Okay, so. Okay, so what happens for other groups? Okay, well, so here, first of all, SLN and SP2N. SLN is kind of easy. You just intersect everything with GLN. Sorry, everything from GLN with SLN. And in fact, I mean, the same is true for SP2N as well. But everything is really pretty similar in both cases. So, I mean, one thing for I mean, the one thing for SLN is that the Levy subgroup ends up being a little bit nastier. Okay, it's not nice, it's not just a product of smaller SLNs, but still, it's something which is maybe not too difficult. In some ways, symplectic groups are nicer from that point of view. So for example, if you look at the maximal split standard maximal torus, okay, it is just the diagonal torus intersected, but that imposes some conditions on the entries. On the entries, as hopefully you can see. So they become inverses. And then what that means is when you look at a standard parabolic subgroup, you again get this sort of symmetry, the first block size and the last block size have to be the same. And you may or may not end up with a block in the middle here. So that block might be of size zero. And then And then when you look at the levy subgroup, you find that you get the end, just as we saw with the Taurus, the entry that you get in sort of two opposite blocks, as it were, are related to each other in some way. I mean, exactly what it is, it doesn't really matter, but you can derive one from the other, basically. And so the Levy subgroup turns out to be just a product of this symplectic group, which is this small symplectic group, which may or may not be. Which is this small symplectic group, which may or may not be there coming from the middle. I mean, this could be SB0, there's nothing there and a product of GLS. So, very briefly, one slide saying what happens in general. Okay, so for a general group, you can still look at a maximal F split torus, okay, but it may not, whereas in GLN, a maximal F split torus was also a maximal torus. Also, a maximal torus. Okay, so there is amongst the maximal tori, there is one which is F-split. In general, that might not be true. Okay, but if it is, then the group's called split. Then what takes the role of a Borel? Well, the thing that takes the role of Borel is a minimal parabolic subgroup. Okay, so parabolic, remember had this definition that one could give with a quote. Definition that one could give as a with the quotient being projective, so one can do that. And so the point is, this may not be the points of some, you can still define Borel subgroup at the algebraic group level. So if you like going to the algebraic closure at that level, but it may not, that Borel subgroup might not be defined over F. Okay. Okay, so this parabolic subgroup might not be the points of a Borel subgroup, but if it is. Subgroup. But if it is, then the group's called quasi-split. And if it's split, then it's quasi-split. Happily, the names were well named. Okay, so and then the rest is really the same. So what a parabolic subgroup is, the unipotent radical, so this maximal normal connected unipotent subgroup and so on. And a Levy subgroup being a complement is the same. Okay, so that's so that's the algebraic structure. So, um, so now let me talk about the topological integral structure. So let's say so it has a topology on it, which makes it into a locally compact and totally disconnected group. So in particular, what it has is it has lots of compact open subgroups. And these are the things which are going to be really useful. So for example, For example, if I take just GLN, GLNO, this is a maximal compact subgroup in G, and all maximal compact subgroups in GLN are conjugate to this one. It's also open. It has, so as we saw, so for the multiplicity, so for GL1, we saw that we had this filtration by units which are congruent to one mod some power of p. Well, we similarly have a filtration. By, where am I? By we can just take things again which are one mod sum power of p, but now as matrices. Okay, these are pro-P subgroups. They intersect. So this is a fundamental system of neighborhoods of the identity again. They're also rather nice that you have, so you have the commutator subgroup of. Subgroup of a pair is contained in one of the ones a little further down. If you look at the normalizer of this maximal compact subgroup, so all you add, in fact, is the center. And this is a maximal compact mod center subgroup. Okay, and the compact mod center subgroups are also going to play an important role. Right, so that's some subgroups. That's some some subgroups and with a filtration, but more generally we can do we can we can get some more okay so again so we had at the top here we have we have our maximal compact subgroup and with its filtration um so uh the the if we look at uh k mod k1 uh or if we look think of k this is gln o we can just reduce all the coefficients mod p okay and so we get gln k so we have a subjective We get G L N K, so we have a subjective map from G L N O to G L N K. Okay, and this is called the reductive quotient. And the kernel of this is just the group K1, so things which are one mod P. This is the prop radical, so this is the maximal normal propy subgroup. And the quotient is called the reductor quotient. You notice I've also called it K0 plus instead of K1. Okay, so this is to do with, well, So this is to do with, well, it's going to be convenient to call it K0 plus for reasons which will become apparent later. Okay, so what we can do now, though, is that we can inside GLN, inside our reductor quotient, so our reductor quotient here, this is an algebraic group over a finite field now. So we can do all the algebraic constructions that we were just talking about. In particular, we can. That we were just talking about, in particular, we can think about parabolic subgroups. Okay, so the standard parabolic subgroups, just things which are upper triangular in blocks, mod P. And then we can think about its inverse image. Okay, and so this here is this thing here. It's called a parahoric subgroup. So this will look like things which are upper triangular in blocks mod p. Okay, so the so sire in this in this ring, the units in this ring. This ring, the units in this ring. Okay, and also, so as well as having had the parabolic subgroup over here, we can then think about its unipotent radical. Okay, well, what's the inverse image of that? Okay, well, that's the pro p radical of our parabolic. Okay, in other words, the maximal normal pro-P subgroup. And so that is just things which are Which are block upper triangular, they're congruent to the identity mod P. Sorry, block upper triangular, yeah, block up upper triangular with identities on the diagonal blocks, mod P. So strictly block upper triangular mod P, if you like. So this just the pre-image of the standard, of these standard unit radicals. And one thing to notice is that if I look at this parahoric, I can. Parahoric, I can easily see a quotient by what the quotient by this pro p radical is, and it's just the it's just the diagonal blocks, okay, which was just the Levy subgroup of, or the standard Levy subgroup of this parabolic. So again, this is called the reductive quotient. So this gives us some things called, like I say, called parahoric subgroups. Maybe I said, so these are, these are the, I guess, the standard. Are the, I guess, the standard parahoric subgroups, and in general, anything conjugate to one of these is a parahoric subgroup. Okay, so in particular, we can do this for the Borel subgroup. And so for the Borel subgroup, the premium is called the Ohoris subgroup. So this is things which are just upper triangular mod P. One remark. One remark is that if I look at its normalizer, so the normalizer actually is a little bit bigger, it doesn't just contain the center. So it contains some other elements as well. So in particular, it contains, for example, this element and its powers. That's another maximal common. That's another maximal compact mod center subgroup. And in fact, all maximal compact mod center subgroups are conjugate to the normalizer of some one of these parahorics. And it's exactly the parahorics where the block sizes are all equal. And when the block sizes are all equal, one can find sort of the analog of this element, but in blocks. And that's the extra thing that you need to generate this normalizer. Okay, so the Orbory subgroup also, and indeed. The Auhori subgroup also, and indeed all parahorics, also have a filtration. Okay, and this is where this weird thing that I have labeled this with a zero plus is going to come in. So, what does the filtration look like? Well, so the first step in the filtration is just the pro p radical. Okay, and that's where, so what we've done, we've just changed these diagonal entries by a power of p from o to p. And then in the next step, well, we can take the next. And then in the next step, well, we can take the next diagonal and again just increase the power. And the diagonal sort of carries on down to include this bottom. So you think of this sort of cyclically, so this entry, we're changing this power here as well. And we can keep doing that. And eventually we get down to something where we've changed them all from where we started. Okay. And so this gives us a filtration, and then we can keep going. Just carry on. The labeling of this filtration. Labeling of this filtration. So we're going to call the first one just sort of zero step. And we're going to end up labeling these with real numbers. And somehow the so the first step, I guess in the end, what I want is that this last one should be the group that I get, which is labeled with the index one. So I want this group here to be I. Be I want this group here to be I1. Okay, and so that means I want to sort of balance it out in between. And so you that means you do it every one over n. So for example, this first one is I1 over n. Okay, what do I do? Well, I said that, and the next one is I2 over n. What do I do for all real numbers? Well, I just look for, I kind of think of this as some left continuous thing. Continuous thing function. So I zero is here. As soon as I go past zero, I'm already on this next one. So from anything greater than zero, but less than or equal to one over n, this is the filtration subgroup. And so that's why zero plus means just the next thing after zero. And similarly here, from one over n to two over n, as soon as I'm bigger than one over n, I'm at this next group and so on. Okay, so that's that's how the filtration. So that's how the filtration works. Okay, in general, we can do the same thing for parahorics. So parahorics also have a filtration. They have a filtration, again, indexed by real numbers. As soon as the real number is bigger than zero, this is a pro-P subgroup. So the intersection is one. The map, which goes from R to the... R to the filtration subgroup is left continuous. And we can talk about, we can put an index R plus to show we're at the next one. Has nice commutator relations. And the first quotient is exactly this Levy subgroup that we saw. So it's some connected reductive group of Kf. There are many filtrations. Okay, so I showed you one on the Awahori, but there are many on the Awahori. Many on the Wahori. For maximal compacts, there is only one. But elsewhere, there are many. How to index them? Lots of different ways you can think about this. You can think about this, I guess the best way is probably as coming from a point in the Bruhertiets building. Or if you want then to take some explicit model for the Brewer-Tietz building, you can think of it in terms of a lattice function. I'm not going to really talk about those, how you get them though. Okay, so other groups, what happens for other groups? Okay, so for SLN, again, you can just, essentially, you can just intersect with what happens for GLN, but now you have to worry about them not all being conjugate anymore. Okay, so you get, if you just intersect, you get SLNO, but you can also conjugate by some other elements, and then you get others which are going to be conjugate and then intersect. You get others which are going to be conjugate in GLN. Which are going to be conjugate in GLN, but not conjugate in SLN. Okay, so they will be n conjugacy classes. Again, for the parahorics, it's the same thing. The Iwahori, likewise, I mean, you don't need the Iwahoris are all conjugate. The filtrations, you just intersect the filtration. The reductive quotients, it's again, it's just. Reductive quotients. It's again, it's just the things whose product in terms is one. Symplectic groups are kind of interesting. So it turns out that there are you can you can conjugate them all to be of the following of this form here, where we have so again we have this sort of symmetry where we have a block of size i here and another block of size i here and everything else in the middle. And everything else in the middle. Okay. And what does the relative quotient look like? Well, so in the middle here, you see that you're going to get some symplectic group, but you also get another symplectic group kind of coming from the corners. So the point is that this thing, O P inverse P O, this is conjugate in G L to something which is just O O O O, right? Okay, but not in the symplectic group. And so you get a product of two symplectic groups. So, you get a product of two symplectic groups. I mean, one of them might be zero, one of them might be trivial. The Iwahori is just intersect. Filtrations, you can just get them by intersecting. In general, what does the reductive quotient of a parahaldo look like? Well, it looks like a bunch of GLNs and up to two symplectic groups. So, in the same way, this maximal case was just up to two symplectic groups, and then you get some GLNs in the middle, kind of like you get in a Levy subgroup. In a levy subgroup. Again, in general, okay, so very briefly. So, what's a parahoric subgroup? It's sort of the connected part of the maximal compact of the stabilizer of the point in the Brughartitz building, whatever that means. So there's this connected part. The issue is that if you take this stabilizer and you can define its reductive quotient, but it might not be a connected group, reductive group over the finite. Connected group, reductive group over the finite field. So you take its connected component and then you take its pre-image. There are filtrations, these Moir-Prasad filtrations, and these quotients are some connected reductive groups over the residue field. Okay, one last thing about groups that I want to say. I just wanted to talk briefly about Haar measure. Because our prime is invertible, Is invertible, the group does have a Haar measure with values in C. Okay, so C, remember, is not the complex, not necessarily the complex numbers. And the easiest thing to do is you choose some propiece open subgroup, whatever one you want, and you declare it to have measure one, and then you know the measure of everything else from that. One important thing is that you can then get, in general, you can get compact open subgroups which have measure zero. Okay. Okay, okay, so for example, in TL1, if you choose the one units to have measure one, then the units has measure q minus one. And if L divides q minus one, then that's zero. Okay, so this is if L divides q minus one. Okay, and so maybe just a word that I maybe should, well, so we're going to say l is benign. Say L is banal for G if these measures are all non-zero. Compact open. Okay, so and somehow in the banal setting is the sort of setting where we expect everything to work exactly like the complex numbers. That's cool. Okay, so another way of saying this is that, so for example, for GLN, banal means that L doesn't divide the order of the finite group GLN over the residue field. That's what it means. Okay, so now finally, let me talk about representations. Recognize him. He's the one I visited in Norwich, you know, the new Klaus. Norwich, I know in the UK last time. With long hair. Hello? Hello? There's a someone talking. Sorry. I want the microphone should be off.  Sorry, could someone turn on Sean's microphone, please, for the people on Zoom?  Okay. Can you hear me now? Hey, excellent. Hopefully, somebody will write yes in the chat as well. Okay, good. Okay, right. So, hopefully, this is the point. I'll start this slide again because hopefully, people heard everything before. I think so. Okay, so. Everything before, I think. So, okay, so let's talk about representations then. So, so g is going to be a group as above, or any closed subgroup. Okay, so I'm including closed subgroups of this. And C again is going to be some algebraic closed field of characteristic L, which is P. So a smooth representation is going to be some pair pi and V. I mean, sometimes I will just write pi and sometimes I will just write V, but where V is going to be some C vector space. V is going to be some C vector space, and pi is some homomorphism from G to the or that's interesting. That should have been a, oh, yeah, that's meant to be a C, not a G, homomorphism with the property that the stabilizer of every vector is open. So again, this is sort of saying it's continuous for the trivial topology on the vector space. Okay, so another way of saying this, so is if. another another way of saying this so is if we have some subgroup uh we can look at the invariant space and then we're just saying that that the that v is the union of its invariant spaces under open subgroups and since every open subgroup will contain a compact open subgroup you can just do it over compact open subgroups or equally if you prefer since compact in fact all you need is some fundamental system of neighborhoods of the identity there um and another word so uh a representation is called admissible if Called admissible if these spaces of invariance are finite dimensional for all for all compact. Okay, so then what I'm going to write rep C of G, this is going to be the category of smooth representations of G. So the morphisms are the G equivariant linear maps. It's an abelian category, so we've got a curve. Belian category, so we've got kernels and co-kernels and quotients and so on. Um, important is not just finite length representations, um, um, and it's not semi-simple in general. So we have extensions of representations. Um, I mean, it is semi-simple. So, if you look at compact, if you look at a compact group, uh, and for example, if L is zero, or in fact, if L is banal, then the representations are semi-simple. The representations are stemming. Okay, and we're going to write IRR for the set of equivalence classes of irreducible representations. So, irreducible meaning no proper invariant subspace, G-invariant subspace. Okay, so just two quick examples. So, first of all, the continuous captures that we were seeing before, so for GL1F, those are still. F those are those are smooth. Something else, so if you take some irreducible representation of GLNF, which happens to be finite dimensional, well, then it turns out that it's one dimensional. Okay, so basically because it's smooth, it contains one of these filters. It contains one of these filtration subgroups, but those have lots of unipotent elements in. So it contains all the conjugates, so it contains all the unipotent elements, so it contains SLN. And so then the kernel, so the kernel contains SLN, and so that means it'll factor through the determinant, and you're left with something one-dimensional. So a theorem which, I mean, if I mean, if I'm actually proving things, definitely wouldn't come here because this is much too early. But on the other hand, it makes sense to say it here is that actually. To say it here is that actually we have this definition of admissible, and actually, every irreducible representation is admissible. Okay, sort of non-very non-trivial theorem, okay, but a very important theorem nonetheless. Okay, and in fact, in general, I'm going to quite often put theorems sort of in the wrong place in terms of proving them because I'm not proving them. Okay, so let me do a junk. Um, limit to adjunctions and Harris-Chunder theory. So, if we have a closed subgroup, uh, then we have an obvious restriction map which takes us from representations of our big group to representations of the small group. Okay, and this has a right adjoint, okay, which is called smooth induction. Um, and so I mean, really, the point is so, which goes the other way. So, the point is that we have this adjunction, this adjunction picture. Junction picture at this adjunction. So that's really what's important about it. I mean, I've written at the bottom there a way of realizing this induction as a space of functions. It's not really going to be important for us. The only thing that's going to be important is that there is, it has this property of a junction. When the group's also open, it also has a lack. It also has a left adjoint, which is called compact induction. And again, so this is what it means. And again, you can write down what it means. So it's things, you can think of it as functions whose support is compact mod H in the full induction. But again, that's not going to be very, very important, what it actually looks like. important what it actually looks like is just going to be formally what it is. So here's a kind of a nice nice example. If I take the trivial representation in, so if I'm in GL1, I take the trivial representation of the maximal compact subgroup, which was O cross, and I compactly induce this up to F cross. Okay, so if I do take this model, we can see what it is. This quotient here, of course, is just quotient here of course is just z okay given by powers of the uniformizer and so all i get is i get is i get the i get uh the uh neuron polynomials in a single variable okay so the the the so x is corresponding to to what so to a uniformizer in here um and uh so this is uh this is an infinite length representation every unramified character so remember that means character trivial So, remember, that means character trivial on O cross appears as a quotient of this just by specializing x, but it has no irreducible sub-representations at all. So, this is kind of the sort of thing which shows how not semi-simple things are. Okay, oh yes, a remark at the end. So, if we in a minute, we're going to talk about inducing from a parabolic subgroup. Now, if you remember, one of the ways to define a parabolic subgroup was that G mod P was compact, okay? G mod p was compact. Okay, and because that's compact, that means the two sorts of induction coincide. Okay, so parabolic induction. So if I have a parabolic subgroup, then we have a parabolic induction functor. So what do I do? So I start off with a representation of With a representation of my Levy subgroup. The first thing is that, remember, the Levy was a complement for the unipotent radical, which in particular means that it's a quotient, it's isomorphic to a quotient of the parabolic. Okay, so if I have a representation of M, then I can compose it with this, with the map from P to its quotient. And so that's inflation. That's what this is. So it's composing with the map from P to M, which has kernel N. And I get a representation of P. And then I can use induction. And then I can use induction to induce up to g. Okay, so uh, and that's going to be what our parabolic induction functor is. Okay, uh, for people who know what this means, this is this is unnormalized parabolic induction, so I'm not going to normalize it. Um, I might mention something about that later. Okay, so because we saw that, um, so we saw that induction has an adjoint, so it's right adjoint to restriction. Um, so in inflation, it turns out is also right adjoint. It turns out it is also right adjoint to something. So we have a functor which goes the other way. It's called parabolic restriction or the Jacques functor. And is everything okay? Just the command. Ah, right. Okay. Okay. And so the inflation is right adjoint to the co-invariant functor. Functor. So again, maybe not so important what it is, but here it is. So what you do is you take the space, subspace generated by things of the form. So you act on V by something in N and subtract V. That gives you some vectors. You take the space generated by those, and that's B round brackets N, and then you take the quotient by that. So it's the point is it's the largest quotient on which N acts trivially. That's something we do. N acts trivially. That's something you do. And so that's that, sorry. So that's saying that parabolic induction is right adjoint to this Chacke functor. So a remarkable fact, which again shouldn't really come here, but is called second adjunction. Okay, which so in the case of the complex numbers is due to Bernstein and was proved. And was proved kind of earlier this year by Dathel Mosk and Krintuk using some using like Schulze using very difficult things. And so as I said as a comment, this works not only for C and algebraic closed field or Cauchy scale. It's much more general, in fact. So start my video. So is that actually this So it is that is actually this induction is left adjoint to. Okay, so here we have what's called the opposite parabolic subgroup. Okay, so this is there's a parabolic subgroup which intersects with our fixed parabolic subgroup exactly in this Levy component. So if we had something upper triangular, it would be the things which are love a triangle. Okay. And so it's left our joint to well almost the parabolic restriction with respect to the opposite parabolic. Opposite parabolic, but with a little twist. Okay, so you have to twist by this thing called the modulus character. The modulus character is defined down here. And so if you, so as I said, if I had normalized my parabolic induction, which you do by twisting by the square root of the modulus character, then the modulus character wouldn't appear here. But then you'd have to, then you have to know that you've got a square root of your modulus character, which if you want to do it over Z1 over P algebra, of course. To do it over Z1 over P out of Z, of course, there might not be a square root in there, so that's why you don't, unless you, unless you can. So that's why I didn't here. Okay, so how am I doing? Tridents. Maybe I have a little bit more because we have stopped a few times for technical things. Okay, so right, so now we have this way, parabolic induction, of getting from representations of a Levy subgroup, which somehow we said was sort of a product of smaller groups. Sort of a product of smaller groups to a representation of a big group. And so the first question might be: well, do we get everything like that? And well, the answer is, I guess maybe, of course, maybe to make it interesting is no. So somehow, so here's the first version. So we say that a representation is cuspidal if its parabolic restriction is always zero whenever I take a proper parabolic. Whenever I take a proper parabolic, so obviously g is a parabolic of itself. Parabolic restriction of g to this is just doing nothing, so obviously I don't mean that one. So if I always get zero, so by a junction, if I'd taken something irreducible, this is the same thing as saying that it's not a sub-representation of anything induced from a proper parabolic. Okay, so that's maybe an easier way to think about it. It's not a sub-representation of anything. Is not a sub-representation of anything parabolically induced. And so there's a very important theorem due to Harish Chandra, which essentially follows by some of what I haven't said is things like, so induction is transitive. And so parabolic induction is essentially transitive somehow. And essentially, it follows from this that for any irreducible representation, you can find it somewhere from something cuspidal for some smaller group. So you can find some Levy, some parabolic subgroup. Levy, some parabolic subgroup, and some irreducible cuspidal representation of the Levy. So the Levy, remember, is another group of the same sort as G. So it makes sense to talk about cuspidal representations. It itself has Levy subgroups and parabolic subgroups and so on. So such that pi is in this induced representation. And what's more is if I have another, if I have another such pair, m prime and rho prime, then actually it's conjugate. prime then actually it's conjugate okay and and we call the conjugacy class of these pairs of these these pairs the cuspidal support oops of pi um so uh because i'm doing this in possibly characteristic l i also need to talk about super cuspital uh which is different so um so for an irreducible representation cuspital we've just seen so it's something which Cuspital, we've just seen so it's something which is not a sub-representation of anything parabolically induced. For super cuspidal, this is similar, but I'm asking for it not to be a sub-quotient of anything parabolically induced. So if L is zero, so basically in the complex case, these are equivalent. Okay, and somehow, but this is kind of, I think this is kind of non-trivial. The point is that somehow, whenever you find something as a subquotient, you can change the parabolic subgroup that you're inducing from to Subgroup that you're inducing from to move around the subquotients in your induced representation to make it become a sub-representation. Okay, so some geometry going on there. But when L is not zero, you get situations where you can get subquotients, which whatever you do, they sort of stay in the middle. Okay, so you can get cuspidals which are not super cuspical. So there is also a theorem similar to the theorem because of transitivity. Of trans again, because of transitivity of induction, that you can always find a representation as a subquotient of something induced from something supercussible. But then there's the horrible thing is that there's not uniqueness in the same way in general. So you can have things which can appear from two non-conjugate induced from two non-conjugate levy things. So the smallest example happens in SP8 and it's And it's this is kind of weird. Okay, so I said there's not in general, there is uniqueness for GLN and for SLN, but not in general. Okay, so my. Right, okay, so I've got two sides left. Yeah, good. Okay, so I was just going to finish today by sort of preempting a little bit what's going to come next about. Come next about in the end, I'm supposed to talk about types as well. So say something a little bit about types. So if we take some compact open subgroup of G, we can look at the Hecker algebra that it defines. Okay, so one can think of this as sort of K bi-invariant functions from D to C with compact support. From D to C with compact support. Or you can see that as the endomorphisms of the compactly induced representation of one. So you see that those are the same thing just by using a junction, a junction and Machi, I guess. Okay, so on here, it's obvious what the product is. Okay, it's just composition. On the k-by-invariant functions, you Variant functions, you sort of translate what that is, and it turns out to be the kind of usual convolution product. Okay. And so then an important theorem is the following. So suppose you have some complex subgroup of measure whose measure isn't zero. Then there's a bijection between, if I look at the irreducible representations which have invariance under this compact subgroup, so whose invariance space. Subgroup, so whose invariant space is non-zero. And I look at, on the other hand, I look at the simple modules for this Hecker algebra up to equivalence. Then there's a bijection between these, which is just given by taking a representation to its space of invariance. Okay. And again, so the space of invariance by junction, this is this Hom space. And so that's how you can see the action of this endomorphism. Of this endomorphism algebra. So, this is a kind of a very important and useful theorem in order to start thinking about understanding representations by looking at their restrictions to compact open subgroups. And kind of the archetype for this is to look at the Wahori subgroup. So, this is just for GLN. I've just written it for GLN. So, which is essentially due to Borel. And I've written this for the complex number. So, you take GLN and you take the Wahori subgroup. Then, in fact, you get even much more than just this bijection. So, if I look at the map, which takes me to an invariance, this actually gives an equivalence of categories between Between, well, on the one hand, so this thing here that I called rep CI. Okay, so what does that mean? That's the things which are not where not only is this I invariant subspace non-zero, but actually the I invariant subspace generates the representation as a representation of G. Okay. And on the other hand, these modules, the category of write modules over this hacker algebra. So this is what was I going to say? There was something else I was going to say. I don't remember. Okay, I will just carry on then with what happened. So moreover, there's another way that it turns out that there's another way that you can describe this category on the left. Okay, so it turns out that this category is precisely can so how do I tell whether a representation is in here? Tell whether a representation is in here. Well, you look at its irreducible subquotients, okay, and all of them have to have cuspital support, or well, I'm in the complex, so it's the same as supercuspital support. So supercuspital support given by the torus, so the diagonal torus, and some unramified character. So unramified here, so means, so a character of the torus. So, a character of the torus, the torus is a product of F crosses. Okay, so an unramified character is a product of characters, and I just mean that they're all unramified, so they're all trivial on O cross. Okay, so which again is the same thing as saying that it's a character trivial on all the maximal, all the compact subgroups of T. Okay, so you can, so the point is that it turns out that you can see this category differently in terms of parabolic induction, basically. And the other thing that turns out to be true is that this category is an indecomposable sum end of the full category of representations. So we can split the category of representations as this piece and everything else somehow, or some complement, and this piece is actually indecomposable. So it doesn't split anymore. And kind of that's the beginning of the story of then type. This is a so the trivial of the representation of the Horri is somehow the first type that was described. Was that described? And yeah, I should stop there since I'm other questions for Sean? Does the theorem remain true when you replace the complex numbers with the C that you've been considering? No. I mean, this theorem here. Yeah, no. Yeah, that's yeah, no, it doesn't know no, so so um simple objects fine, but but but in general the the the the well do you want to well why don't I say the question I can just repeat the question I'll just repeat the question the question was is this is this theorem also true when uh C is not the complex numbers but some some other field of characteristic L? Field of characteristic L. And so in the banal case, so that then, yes, but in general, the answer is no. And somehow the thing is that this algebra is somehow too small. So it's not seeing everything that happened. You need something bigger. There is. So, I mean, another thing that's important here, which I haven't said today, but which I will only mention parsing. Um, which I will only mention passing tomorrow is that in the complex setting, this or in fact, always in fact, this hecker algebra is kind of nice. You can describe it by judges and relations, it's an alpha-hecker algebra. It's so over the complex numbers, so its modules are known and so on. So, it's well understood. Okay, so you can replace that by another algebra. So, there is an algebra which you can put in there, but describing that algebra is, I mean, you can describe it somehow. In some senses, I mean, you can describe it somehow. In some senses, you can describe it explicitly as just like here, this was the endomorphisms of some induced representation, right? So you can describe it in that same way. But if you wanted it with generators and relations, that's another question. And it's kind of complicated. Yeah. Any other questions? Anyone would like to make them in the chat? The chat. Well, if there are no more questions, we have a coffee break and we will maintain the Zoom open.
