Okay, our second speaker today is Kevin Schumann, who's been telling us about L2 homology of rival comes from space with other central. I was afraid to write my own title. It's too long. All right, thanks to the organizers. Great to be here. So it's all joint with Gregoria Abermedi Board of Oaken. So I'm going to start just like Damien. I'm going to start just like Damien with some motivation old conjecture. What's that? Not the output. No, this is, yeah, and they're not here, which is good. Well, she can go put in vowels. Yeah. Pre-partisan vowels. You can have them, yeah. Well not yet. Alright. Okay. So this conjecture is um you the hop Do the hop. Greek years old at this point. So with M, so this is an conjectural, even-dimensional closed a spherical manifold. Closed spherical manifold. He didn't say spherical, so that was kind of generalized. Then the Euler characteristic Characteristic of this manifold satisfies a certain, well, conjecturally, has relation to sine. So if you multiply by negative 1 at the end, this is always positive. So in other words, it might be 0, or it alternates going from negative in dimension 2, where it's true, then positive in dimension 4, negative in dimension 6, and so on. And so on. So, I don't know. We don't have anything to say about this conjecture, but we'll do kind of a generalization of it. And I won't go into the cases where it's known. It's known in a lot of cases, but it's open in dimension four. First non-trivial case. Okay, so Charney and Davis more recently thought about this conjecture where this manifold Where this manifold is additionally as a structure of a locally catzero cube complex, considered the case where M is locally kind of suitable to keep it. Okay, so what's nice is that in this setting, you have a kind of a nice formula for the Euler characteristic. Can you assume the cubulation is of the dimension? Do I assume the cubulation is a manifold homeomorphism to a locally cathodic repeat complex? Okay. Okay, so I guess I do any Q complex is this nice way to compute the Euler characteristic, which is you, it's a combinatorial version of Gauss-Bennet. So you look at your complex, look at all the vertices, and let me just keep you. And let me just rewrite something. So there's some function I'll define in a second, which depends on the link. And maybe I'll just assume it's a simplicial complex. Okay, so in this case, K of L, we're general versions, but we just said this is 1 minus vertices over 2. Vertices over 2, plus the edges over 4, and so on. Okay. I don't know. Should I be seeing this formula? Or should I say why it's true? I'll just do it quickly. You just, every time you, so you're computing all of the characteristic alternating sum of cells. If you put a one on a vertex, If you put a 1 on a vertex, you keep it there. If you put a 1 on an edge, you move it to its endpoints. You go, okay, is that okay? Do it one more. You see a 1 here. You put a quarter on each vertex. That gives you the same number, and that's what this is doing. Okay, so that's nice in that you have a nice formula, a local structure. Maybe I should say, yeah, well, okay, one second. So they made another conjecture, completely combinatorial conjecture, which is, well, basically what Haupt implies, or I guess what would Or, I guess, what implies hop is that if you have an L is now a flag triangulation as 2n minus 1. So, if I had a 2n manifold and it had the structure also of a locally cache zero cube complex, if I looked at a vertex, oh, let's look at the I would see that it's flagged, so that's coming from locally K0, and it would be a triangulation of a sphere one-dimensional mouse. And then the same formula should hold. So they just conjecture that this K of L also alternates sign in this way. And so this kind of, by this formula, implies option. This kind of by this formula implies of in this special case okay, just the formula. But it turns out in this case that it's equivalent. Okay, so you'd also go the other way. You'd also go the other way. So, this is because this direction is the Euler characteristic formula Gauss and A. This direction is what I'll call Davis' construction. It's in like, I don't know, first two pages of his book on Backs to the Grooves, which are good ones to read. Or the whole book's good. Being recorded is no good. So if L is a flag complex, it would be so particular for flag triangulation of a sphere, but if you're a flag complex, there exists a locally cat zero cube complex P L. PL, okay, and the link of every vertex is isomorphic to L. So in other words, you can just, if you, you've, you fit one flag complex and then you put that everywhere locally in your Q complex. So in particular, if you have a kind of a counterexample to the local picture, This kind of a counterexample to Carney Davis, you just put that flag triangulation everywhere, and then you get a counterexample to Hopkins. I'll do this. There's a, you know, kind of a, it's not a hard construction in this, in the right-angled case. So if I see, for example, this is L, you always fit it inside some large cube corresponding to the number of Corresponding to the number of vertices that you see in L. So it's in the 3 cube. And then you put in corresponding faces wherever you see edges and simplices so that the links match. So here you can put in these two parallel faces and you're done. And that's essentially the general procedure. And maybe, I don't know, maybe we just so this is also, I should say, So this is also, I should say, pi one is the commutator of the corresponding right angle Coxider group. Universal covers the Davis complex. Let's square this. These kind of fit. Too small. Any questions on this? Okay. So, okay, so let me output what we know about Terny Davis. I should have kept Horace's name up there. So Davis and Oakin kind of showed Charney Davis conjecture for plague triangulations of S3. So this is the first non-trivial case if you do it for First, non-trivial case, if you do it for, so this is, you know, where the corresponding PL or the Davis complex of four-dimensional manifolds. So, dimension two is easy, and you know, you're just looking at triangulation of circles. So, this is the first kind of case that you look at. I should say for sorry, I can for P L this is L? Or the piece of this is L. So to do this, they proved the stronger conjecture, which is the one that we're interested in for this talk. Stronger conjecture. So this is a conjecture of Singer. But the L-to-homology of closed a spherical manifolds, so let me write this down too. This is now a conjecture not just in even dimensions, but for all dimensions. So if Mn is, I enclose a spherical, then this invariant, this L. What's called L tomology, which I'll try to talk about in a second. So the L tomology of the universal cover, so now you're looking upstairs. So this is zero outside of the middle dimension. And it turns out that, well, these homology groups have corresponding dimensions, so you can find. Corresponding dimensions, so you can find an L2 Betty number, and then if you take the alternating sum of the L2 Betty numbers, they also compute the Euler characteristic of the space down the stairs. Are you assuming that the dimension is bent or? No, I'm not at any point. Yeah, so in odd dimensions, this is just saying it vanishes. But the conjecture is kind of harder in odd dimensions, I guess. Or more subtle. Yeah, so this implies Hobbes. And this implies Hobbes. Not obvious, but once you have the right notion of dimension and you look at alternating sum and you only have one term, that's how it yields. Okay, so this is what they did. So they proved, let me kind of say the extent of what was known. So they proved Singer for these kind of manifolds coming from writing La Coxida groups. Writing concoxative groups. And they also. In the four-dimensional case, right? For the four-dimensional case, yeah. And they also proved Singer for flag triangulation, or for barycentric subdivisions of triangulations of S5 and S7. And S7. And this is kind of the higher-dimensional cases that were known. We have dimension 4. And what's weird about this conjecture, or part of it, is that it's easier to prove it for even dimensions. So these are odds. The manifolds are even dimensional. And that's easier. So we don't know if we're flag triangulations of even very centric subdivisions of flag triangulations best for. Okay, so now I can say our theorem, and then I'll say what these are. These L2 homology groups. Here, I guess. Okay, so it holds for didn't know it. Okay, Singer holds for PL. For PL, so these this case, where L is, this is the main computation, so it's the barycentric subdivision of the boundary of an n simplex. Okay, so this is for all n, including odd dimensions. So over here we said they improved Singer for these S5 and S7. Do you mean for like the writing of Crox or your For like the writing of capture groups. Yeah, sorry. I always say this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. So for, oh no, for here, P sub L and L is this. Yeah, thanks. Okay, so this is kind of, in some, I mean, one of the simplest ways to get a flag triangulation of the sphere, you just start off. Simplest way to subdivide a or get a triangulation of a simple or a sphere boundary of a simplex would be like B D and then take its barycentric subdivision. So that's L, then you take the corresponding manifold Davis complex, those are the ones that you're interested in. Damien's pictures were like way too good. This is about as good as I can. Okay, and also, so once you have this, you get it also for varying subdivisions of odd-dimensional spheres. So, again, the even-dimensional case is easier. So, this is kind of the thing we know when the manifold is odd-dimensional, and for even dimensions, you get this. And for even dimensions, you get this. One holds for all men as well. Yeah, yeah, thanks. Yep. I guess this is for all men too. And you mean any triangulation that that's 2n minus 1n? And that's 2n minus 1, any kind of. Well, yeah, so you take any triangulation and then take its barycentric separation. Better if it's PL. I knew someone would ask that. Okay, so we said it this way. You can do all this with, instead of spheres, you look at generalized tomology spheres. And it goes through. I think. I'm not the person. Yeah, I mean, even for the equivalents of Hop and Charney Davis, I shouldn't have said spear. I've wanted an opioid. Okay. Oh, so yeah. What was I going to do? I was going to tell you what L2 homology is. Okay? And then tell you how to prove it. So give you an idea. So I thought I'd make a table. This is going to be L. Table, this is going to be L. This is Davis complex, and that's L tuomology. Okay? All right, first L is a point. I could have done the empty set, but a point. Davis complex is an integral, and the L2 homology is usual homology. I know what it is. Okay, two points per L, so now you're looking, and you're writing La Cox group as infinite dihedral. Your Davis complex of the universal cover of P L is just real line. Now I've Now, I have to tell you what L2 homology is. So, a quick definition: if you say it's the chains, which are L2. If you're looking at infinite chains, they're L2. And they have to be cycles, and they also have to be co-cycles. That's it. So, L2 chains, so it's some growth condition on what you have, and they have to satisfy cycles, and then you look at the view them as co-cycles, and they should also do that. They should also do that. And now you can see that for the real line, this is always zero. So, always zero. Because if you look at one cycles and you say they have to be cycles, they have to be constant, so they're not L2. Or if you look at, that's in dimension one, so there's nothing. If you look at dimension zero, you say everything's a cycle, the only co-cycles are constant, but those aren't L2 either. But those aren't L2 either. Is that okay? Everything counts just. All right, three points. I'll stop doing that at this point. I won't go to four points. Here you get your Davis complex, this infinite trivalent tree. By the same argument, you never get anything. By the same argument, you never get anything in dimension 0 if your space is infinite, I guess, connected. Because again, the 0 co-cycles are constant. But there are non-trivial one cycles that are L2. This is the picture that everyone draws. And I'm... Oh, why did I start a half? I don't know. I guess that works too. 4, 4, and so on. Okay, that's an L2 chain. Yeah, that's an L2 chain. It's a cycle, so that's something in there. Okay, cool. When do I end, by the way? I have no idea how long I have like 15 press. Oh, cool. Okay, let me do L is a pentagon. Okay, so now you're looking at Looking at the Davis complexes, hyperbolic plane are quite asymmetric. Get H2 tiled by squares, 5 at every vertex. And now you can see that the, you know, the, again, zero-width and second L2 homology is going to be trivial by the same arguments as for the real line. It turns out that you get. It turns out that you get a whole bunch of non-trivial L2 cycles in dimension one. There's kind of a lot of L2 homology in degree one. Oh, I should have written, sorry, so this is concentrated. The star is one, same here. One of the embarrassing things that I don't know how to do is, so kind of by looking at this dimension counting. Of by looking at this dimension count, you know, there's a whole bunch of harmonic L21 cycles in this space. I don't know how to write one of them down. So, if you ask me, like, what are the numbers? You know, you can put numbers on edges, they should be cycles, they should be co-cycles, they should be L2. You have no idea how to actually do it. If anyone knows. Okay, and then some more if you want kind of higher-dimensional things, you can take joins of L. Joins of L, so you get higher-dimensional simplicial complexes. This gives you the Davis complex of products, and then there's kind of the usual Kuhn formula. That's one trick that you can use. And the other trick is if you have a decomposition of your space, something like this. Something like this, where the allies are all full subcomplexes. And you get that this is a decomposition or is a union of orbits too small, too low. So if you decompose your flat complex in some way, if you look at the Davis complex, Some way. If you look at the Davis complex, you see a whole bunch of Davis complexes for each piece, and they're intersecting it, Davis complexes at their intersection. And the relevant, then what you get from that is MyRuthoris. And those are kind of basically all the tools I know to compute these things. Okay. Uh okay, so is that all right? I don't have many other good examples of L, so. Okay, so let me show you why barycentric subdivisions of triangulations are easier than general-clad triangulations. And then we'll talk about kind of what we have to do here. Okay, so let me start with. I'm going to actually, we can do it, so prove. So I'm going to actually, we can do it. So prove Singer for PL, and L is a barycentric subdivision of a triangulation of S3. So I can't draw this very well, but what you look at, so there's some simplicies glued together. Okay, I'll just draw the same picture. I can only draw one. Same picture. I can only draw one. This is, of course, filled in, so it's a very centric subposition of a three-simplex, and then there's also more simplices floating around here. Get a whole triangulation of S3. That's part of the picture. And now the point is that if you look at a barycentric subdivision and you start looking at vertices, you know essentially what the lengths of vertices look like. Of vertices look like. And it turns out a lot of them happen to be L2A sickle. So let me look at the very center of an edge. Can't really draw this. Okay, so here's, I'm looking at this vertex now, and its link in the barycentric subdivision. Its link decomposes. Its length decomposes as these two points, which I can draw, plus the part I can't draw, which is the length of this edge in the triangulation. So the link is the flag triangulation of S3, and it's the suspension of a circle. It's the very center of an edge, S link. Link as a function. And then we go to the things that we know, all the tools that I know. So a suspension is a join with two points. This is L2A cyclic. So Kuhnet's formula tells you that the link has, so the link is L2A cyclic. point so by the link L2AC you mean the yeah I always say this yeah sorry I'm just whenever I say a finite complex is L2A6 like I always mean this corresponding Davis complex okay yeah when I say it like that it seems like it's not very clear okay there is some relative tense piece of link Of length is equal, of v is the ultimate circle. That's right, kids complex. Okay? And also, since stars of vertices, again, that's a join with a point, so the Davis complex of a star is just a Davis complex of a link across an interval. So you can use this decomposition link. Link and star, and then you go to your migrator sequence. Everything here is zero in your migratoris, so these have isomorphic homology groups, L2 homology groups. You can cut it away and not change anymore. And also the same thing works for very center of a 2-simplex in this case. So also face. This is kind of a suspension in a different way. In a different way, so its link is the barycentric subdivision of a simplex one down, but then you get a suspension because this two simplex is contained in exactly two or two three simplices. So that link is also suspension, so that Davis complex is L2A cyclic as well. To acyclic as well. And also, the reasons that their suspensions are kind of independent. So if I remove the edges from this picture, it doesn't change the fact that the link is Zeltoacyclic, because these are the vertices that are making it acyclic. So hopefully that's slightly believable. So, the conclusion of this is you just remove all these vertices from your picture. So after removing, So you get the Davis complex, the original Davis complex has the same L2 homology as a two-dimensional Davis complex. The ones I remove the barycenters of edges, Once I remove the barycenters of edges and the barycenters of faces, I'm left just with the graph. So it's the vertices of my original complex and the barycenters of the three simplices. So I get, that's a graph, a flag graph. Ava's complex here, or a flag graph, is two-dimensional, so I for sure know that the L2 homology could dimensions three and four as zero. So you get vanishing above. So you get vanishing above the middle dimension because there's just no cells there. This has the same homology, and then you use duality to tell you. So this now vanishes above the middle dimension, and duality then tells you it vanishes below. I guess zero and one. That's always what you can do if you're trying to prove a singer. You always can show like one top-dimensional or kind of high-dimensional homology vanishes, and then you get low-dimensional. Is that okay? Okay. So now, let me tell you why, so now my picture is going to be more honest, why this doesn't work for flag triangulations of S2. Oh, that's true. Okay, so same picture. The why this breaks here is an element, I suppose, L is like its simplest fluctuation, one of the Simplest flag triangulation, or one of the simple ones. This is honestly L now. So we're just looking at flag triangulation of S2, corresponding Davis complexes. It's a three-manifold. You try to do the same thing. There are edges that you can remove. So you can again remove, or sorry, vertices that you can remove from the picture. Every very center of an edge is altogether. Is L2 acyclic by the same reason? It's a suspension. So you can remove those without changing L2 homology, and you're left with the Davis complex for L being one skeleton of a Q. And now you're stuck. So the conjecture says in this case, The conjecture says in this case, because this is odd-dimensional, the L2 homology should vanish in all degrees. This is a two-dimensional complex, so it might have L2 homology in the second degree, and you can't rule it out. And no more vertices are L2 acyclic. They're all three points, which has homology. The cube solo is stereotype. So you remove all of, yeah, so you remove this. Okay, let me try to draw the cube in there. In there. Can't draw all of it. I guess I can draw all of it, but is that okay? It's the subcomplex generated or spanned by the zero and two-dimensional races. Very centers of basis, original ones. Okay, so now what you can do in these degrees, I mean, we'll write this over. Let me write this. So you're not stuck because this is a three-manifold. You can either do, you use the fact some analytic stuff that this acts on H3 in a finite volume way. That's enough to guarantee vanishing. You also, or you can use the fiber in game, Kasha, Norina Wise, fiber it, and then that's enough to imply that the L2 model vanishes. But in high degrees, we don't know what to do. We don't know what to do. So, in some sense, we kind of found a proof of the one skeleton of a cube that actually generalizes to higher degrees. That's the main point. So, maybe I should mention, okay, so you can do, we do know the L-toomology of this complex. You either do fibering or use computation of this. Do both of those techniques work in the high relations, or just sorry, From the higher dimensions, or just starting from the higher dimension? Well, yeah, so I mean, this works in that you know for higher-dimensional hyperbolic space. Ah, yeah, sorry. Not for okay, so what's the new strategy? Again, okay, we only want to use these tools, hyperturs and so on. So you do something kind of strange. Let me, you start with a one skeleton cube. We're going to first input it. We're going to first input it or put it into. Oh gosh. Okay. What I'm trying to draw, I'll explain what I can draw. I'm going to add edges. So this embeds into a suspension of a hexagon. So the hexagon is here. So the hexagon is here, and these two opposite points are the suspension points. Oh, okay, so that's good. We know suspensions are also acyclic. What I'd like to do is remove the edges and then say, my repertoris, and I'm done. And what's good is that this is acyclic. This link of every edge is acyclic, elsewhere acyclic. Again. L20 cyclic. Again, corresponding ABIS complex is L20 cyclic. If I had my ruby torus, I could just remove those, get down to, you know, so I'm starting with something with zero, and I get down to something that has to be zero. Because at every stage, I remove something. That would say zero. Okay, so what we want is my R V torus plus removing edges, rather than Rather than vertices, you can think that's kind of our main trick. Instead of removing a vertex, you remove an edge. What's hard or what's weird about this, so what's strange, is that once you remove an edge, so if L is a flag complex, I can look at L minus E. So by L minus the edge, I'm just removing the open. Edge, I'm just removing the open star. This is a perfectly good flag complex, but no longer full. Maybe a better or an easier picture is just if I have a square and I remove an edge. So I get a perfectly good writing or you know, complex based off of these. But if I look at the inclusion map, But if I look at the inclusion map on a PL, or if you want to look at the corresponding right-hand gloco groups, it's no longer IO injective. I'm no longer full. So let me just, okay, pretend that I find right angle-Coxen group in that. So if I look at this kind of obvious map, it's not pi-1 injective. So it turns out what you end up So it turns out what you end up getting. I guess I should call this map the, just to expect to write it down here. I'm writing lopoxy groups. It's the obvious map for you to send generators to generators. Or not injective. So what you get is the status complex. So what you get is this database complex decomposes into pieces that are of the form, well, so you look at the star of the link, this is still good. And instead of getting the Davis complex of minus the edge, you get the Davis complex precisely motioned by. Precisely motioned by the kerdle of G. So you get some intermediate cover, which you now, by Meyer Vitaurus, we can say kind of what the L-typeology of this is, if you know the L etymology of the links and so on. Okay, last minute, I'll say what's kind of that so that one idea is to remove edges, but the main kind of new idea doesn't come from us. So Doesn't come from us. So there's a recent approach to L two-betty numbers. Oh, there. Yeah. One minute left, right? Okay, so I could have computed all of these numbers by taking some skew field and looking at the dimensional skew field, blah, blah, blah. One of its consequences, so I should, it's recent, but I mean, I mean, it was. But I mean, it was, I should say, like Linnell did it 30 years ago, but then Hiken and Kelek have kind of shown that it's useful in computations, other properties, much recently. So, okay. So this implies that the L to homology of an intermediate cover is upper bound, is an upper bound. I should say that. I should say betting numbers here if I want to say like what upper bound means, but there's an upper bound universal cover. So our Meyer v torus tells us something about this complex. We can assume it vanishes. And then the skew field machinery says that the data complex also vanishes. And then that's enough to kind of push the argument through. And you also need all this, you know, you need a nice fundamental group. Fundamental group. So you need, you know, writing the path scripts are special. Everything's kind of classified. Okay, thanks. Another questions? So, how much of this picture? I mean, this was sort of the picture for n equals two. Yeah. So how much of this picture is, I mean, like, if you play this. picture is I mean like if you play the same game and n equals four safe do you get another cube or whatever no so what yeah so the you actually the better way to think about these edge removals on L2 it's the same as subdividing the edge if you subdivide the edge which is something kind of commentorily more natural to do because it keeps you a sphere the whole time you subdivide the edge now your link is acyclic and full you can remove it without changing biology Can remove it without changing momology. So you want to probably think about it in higher dimensions in terms of subdivisions rather than edge removals. And then, I mean, both work. So again, you need induction. So this is kind of an edge, iterated edge subdivision. Of the suspension of one dimension lower. So if I want, I can do this one by suspending a hexagon, by starting with a hexagon, suspending, is that, yeah, and then subdividing these edges. And then subdividing these edges. You need to be a little careful about the order. So you subdivide here and then subdivide there. So and then you can, you know, the lengths of the edges look like copies of these in lower dimensions. So yeah, it's an inducting form. More questions? Thank you, Kevin again. Let's thank Ken again. Now there's coffee and we start again at ten two. Oh yeah.
