So today I'm going to talk about twisting of algebras using an automorphism then trying to connect that to two co-cycle twists of hop algebras. This is joint work with Hang Di Huang, Ben Wyn, Charlotte Orr, Ken Patrol, and Jin Di Wang and our work is on the archive. Alright, so Alright, so let's take a look at the big picture. If I have a greater algebra A and phi is a greater antomorphism of A, then I can twist by phi. So that's going to be, I'm going to call that A phi. I'll talk a little bit more how the twisting happened in a moment. So that's in the algebra setting. In the bioalgebra setting, I start with a bioalgebra satisfying certain conditions, which I'm going to call twisting conditions. Twisting conditions. I'll talk about that in a little bit. And a graded bi-algebra or morphism. And I can twist this by algebra, and I'll call that the Jane twist of B. Now what I'd like to do is on the other side, I have two cocycle twists of half-algebras, and so I want to find a way to connect these two notions. And the way we're going to do this is via a twisting pin. So my setup here. So, my setup here is going to be: K is going to be a base field. B will usually denote a bi-algebra with mu delta and epsilon standing for the usual operations. Currently, H is going to be a half-envelope of V using Takeuchi's construction. And then H is going to be, stand for half-algebra, with S being the antibod so. So what motivated us in this project was genderist. So we know that Artin Tate and Vandenberg in their second paper, Modules over Algebras of Global Dimension 3, talked about twisting by an automorphism. Okay, and also we know that James generalized this word to a twisting system. So let's look carefully at what do we mean by a right-jeng twist and the notation for it would be Aphi. So I start with a graded algebra and a graded allomorphism of A. I know that A and A phi are going to be isomorphic as vector spaces. Vector spaces. Now, this is what I mean by the twisting. I'm going to twist the multiple dictative structure. And so, if I take two homogeneous elements in A, I can twist it using the store sub phi. And this is what I get. R phi of S applied degree all times. And then in his paper on twisted algebras and graded categories, James also showed that. James also showed that the graded module categories of A and A phi are equivalent. So that's on the algebra side. So I want to move to the half algebra side. Now Dwinfeld came up with the notion of a twist and it's defined on H tensor H. And so in this And so, in this case, when you twist by H, the twinful twisted H is isomorphic to H as algebras. But as co-algebras, they are not. So, in the case of the twin field twist, we are deforming the co-algebra structure. And we know that if the module categories of two-half algebras are tensor-equivalent, then they are group-filled twists. They are groupful twists of each other. Okay? I figured out the button. So how does Tucocycle twist come into play? Dori and Dorian Takeuchi in their papers introduce a dual to drenchle twist. And they call them Tuchocycle twists. We're going to use sigma to denote two co-cycle twists and phi to be twist and phi to be the Reng twists. So in this case the co-algebra structure stays the same. So H and H sigma have the same co-algebra structure but we are deforming the algebra structure. So H and H sigma are not isomorphic as algebras. So then a two cocycle on H is a convolution invertible linear map sigma that's defined on H tensor H and it's going to satisfy this condition. And it's going to satisfy this condition. And we know that if H is finite-dimensional, then J is the drain filterist if and only if sigma defined on the tensor of the dual of H with the dual of H is the tuple sign. Okay, so this is the setting, and then we want to be able to say a few things about connecting these two settings. So what Let's unpack what is it we would like to do. First off, when is a gene twist of a half algebra a two cocycle twist? And I've got to say, even for me at the beginning, coming from the gene twist side, I just thought, how can you even talk about a gene twist of a bio algebra? Like, you know, that doesn't make sense to me. So, in particular, when is a gene twist of biological In particular, when is a Sheng twist of age, a Hof algebra? And then, once we've thought about this, when can the Sheng twist, how can it be realized, and when can it be realized as a jupacy twist? All right? So we're going to need some hypotheses on our bi algebra. We're going to require that it is Z graded and that the coproduct is going to send the B and P's to B n tends to B n. And as we can see here, And as we can see here, these are fairly benign conditions on our bioalgebra. Okay, so the polynomial ring on generators Xij with co-algebra structure defined as follows, and the degree of the Xij is V1. Is an example of a ring that satisfies our twisting condition. So our first result is if Our first result is: if you start with a bi-algebra that satisfies these twisting conditions we just talked about, and a bi-algebra automorphism of B, you can form B phi. That satisfies our twisting condition. And this, what is it? It's a gene twist of P, so we've twisted the algebra structure, but we've left unchanged the co-algebra structure. Okay? And if we were to Okay, and if we were to start with a half-algebra with antipode s, we have the same thing holding here, and then we have a formula for what the antipode would be in that case. And then we have this result, a little bit in the spirit of James' work, which is that the monoidal categories of GER age is going to be equivalent to that of GER HT. Page fee. So now what I want to do is I want to connect this to cosine topic. To do that, I'm going to need the notion of a twisting pair. So a twisting pair is going to be a pair of automorphisms of B, and it's going to satisfy the two conditions that you see here with respect to Phi 1. You see here with respect to phi1 and phi2. We want the reason why we want these conditions is we want phi1 and phi2 to be right and left by co-module max. And that allows it, gives us that. Another way of thinking of the twisting pair is if you think of the work of Brown and Zhang, I think it's on dualizing complexes and Hoffiel Homology. And hoffe homology, prohomology. They have a notion of left and right winding automorphisms. This is equivalent to that notion. So that's another way of thinking of the definition of a twisting pair. So with this twisting pair, we are able to connect a Zheng twist to a Tuchocycl twist. So what we do, we start with a bioalgebra. We do, we start with a bioalgebra that satisfies our twisting condition in a twisting pair of B. So we show that there is a unique twisting pair, which we're calling H of P1, H of Phi2, that extends phi1 comma phi2. Moreover, the two cocycle of HB sigma, this two cocycle twisted HB sigma, twisted by sigma, By Sigmund, is the right genterist of HB to the age Q1 composed V2. So here's kind of the connection between the gen twist and tuposycro twist. We were able to show that this holds, this result holds when we start with a Hoff algebra that satisfies our twisting condition. We have something similar going on. The right chain Similar going on, the right changed H, so the V1 composed with V2 is isomorphic to the tubercycloud to H sigma. And so as a consequence then, these two things have equivalent co-module parabolics. So far, I'm just kind of talking in an abstract way about this construction. I want to talk about some applications of our construction now. First, I'm going to talk about an application to manage universal pipeline. An application to manage universal quantum group of quadratic algebras. So let's talk a little bit about what I mean by manage universal quantum group. I start with a quadratic algebra, I write it in this way, and then I can form what we call the bullet product of A and B in this way. Where S23 here is just a flip of the two middle tensors. Of the two middle tensors in the full-fold tensor project. And so NL of A is going to be the universal bi algebra that the left coacts on A via this map rule. Now we also know that I can get this by taking a 3 bullet product with it. And then I can get the universal quantum group that left coax only, which we call the art L. Which we call the R L of A. And one way one can get that from the end one is by taking the half-engal. So we were able to show that every twisting pair of the universal quantum group associated to a quadratic algebra A is going to be of this form. And it is given by a graded algebra automorphism of A in an explicit way. A in an explicit way. So here is how my pair is going to look like for an L and an O. And we show as well that R L of A phi is a tuchocycle twist of R L of A with the tuchocycle sigma being defined in this way. And so as a consequence here, the co-representation theory of art elevated Of odd elevate only depends on the graded module category over it. So that's for the application in Manning's Universal Quantum Group. Now I want to talk about the one-parameter quantization coordinate ring of n-byng matrices. So I know James had mentioned that to consider what would happen in the case. To cons, you know, what would happen in the case that I considered the melty parameter one. I haven't gotten to that yet, thanks. So let's take a look at how we're going to apply our construction to this. I'm going to start with an endomorphism defined on V tensor B. And then I say that R is a solution to the quantum Jank-Baxter equation, or an R matrix, if it satisfies the equation that I have here. It's R1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3. With R1, 21323, etc., defined as follows. So if we start with V being the span of X1 through Xn, then R is going to be a matrix, an N squared by N squared matrix. And so this R is going to be defined in this way on the two, the tensor product. Okay? And so Okay, and so we apply the FOT construction to obtain a co-quasi-triangular algebra, which we're going to call AOR, theta. So when we do that as an algebra, we're going to get an algebra on n-square generators. The generator is going to be tij. Right, and then I need for these relations to hold with respect to my R ijl. As a co-algebra, I can define my co-product on generators Tij again in this way. And then I get the co-quasi-triangular structure via theta. And I've got to have theta satisfying this. So we were able to classify. So we were able to classify the twisting pairs of AR. And we showed that, so again here, supposing that Tij are the generators of AR, we showed that phi1 comma phi2 are determined by their values on the generators. And so in this way. Phi1 gives us this, phi2 gives us this, and then the alpha ijs. Is a matrix that's inverse to the matrix of the beta of the qj's. Now, what I want to do is I want to show you how this twisting pair, how does it look like when we're looking at the quantized coordinate ring of two by two matrices. When the mouse goes close to it, it disappears. Just click around it. When I click on that mirror, it's part of that window. Just sorry about that. Yeah, folks. About that. Yeah, folks. Unfortunately, how you're removing the presentation model and doing something that doesn't mean comment. Okay. Here we go. Thank you. So yeah, I'll let them know about that. Okay, sorry about loss. So here we're pretty familiar with OQM2, right? And so we have these relations, these defining relations on xij, and then the co-algebra structure here is given in this way. And then this go to two ij matrices satisfies our twisted conditions. So we're good to go. We can talk about the twisted pair. So, first off, remember from the FOT construction, I get this AR, right? And then I need to take, I need to get the Half algebra from this. So, what do I do? I'm going to localize using a central group like element. And so, the localization of OQM2 at that central group-like element is going to be OQ2. Central group like element is going to be OQGL2. Okay, and we were able to show that phi1 is given in this way and phi2 is given in that way. And moreover, depending on what Q is, if Q is 1, then any matrix of alpha ij, for any matrix of alpha ij, For any matrix of alphaj, phi1, phi2 forms a twisting pair. If the characteristic of our field is not 2 and q is negative 1, then we have a twisting pair if alpha ij is a generalized permutation matrix. And then if q is not plus or minus 1, then we have a twisting pair if and only if our matrix is diagonal. And then we show that the right jank. And then we show that the Raijang twist, as we did in the construction initially, but for example, this example as well, that the right jang twist of OQGL2 by phi1 composed with phi2 is isomorphic to two cocycle twist, of OQGL2 by two cocycle sigma. And this sigma is given explicitly in our paper. So I have, okay, I have quite a bit of time. So So I guess I'll take that time to talk a little bit about the work that we've done. So this work started during the peak of COVID in the summer of 2020. We started working together remotely. And then last year we found out that we were funded by AIM through the SQARES program, structure important. Structure important research ensembles, and we met in April to work on this in CNOSA. So Charlotte, after Chris's talk, is going to talk about some of the new results we have in the case of Tustine. And then Ken Vashar is giving a talk tomorrow on some of the work that we've done for the more recent work. Thank you. It's time for questions. Questions from Zoom? Jason, have you thought about this in the context of like the cop algebras or any other generalizations of copyright? No. So, right now, and without giving too much away, we've kind of talked about the twisting in a different setting. So, we were looking at this right now, but it's certainly a viable, it's something great to think of. And, you know, we calf altogether already came up earlier in earlier talks. Yeah, it would be something, definitely something to think of. Questions on Zoom? No?
