Much. So I'm going to be telling you about work that my students Xuenan Li is in red because she's really the heavy lifter here. But I will also be showing you some simulations and those were done with a lot of help from Boleiden and Katya Bertold. And my topic is metamaterials. I think that's not a familiar Materials. I think that's not a familiar subject to many people in this room. So I'm going to be telling you about a particular metamaterial, but I'm going to start with one that's a little easier. This one that's a little easier, I like to call it the checkerboard metamaterial. People in the business really call it the rotating squares metamaterial. I think it'll show up in Paul's talk, right? And but and the big picture here, just to make sure you've got the big picture, the big picture is, in general, I'm talking about mechanism-based metamaterials. So these are nonlinear mechanical systems where geometrical nonlinearity, something resembling buckling, is playing a crucial role in what we're doing. Okay, so this. Okay, so this checkerboard metamaterial, you make it by taking a polymer sheet and you punch out alternate squares in a checkerboard pattern. So the squares that are left are connected by very thin necks. And then you deform it. Now, I mean, you might deform it, allowing it to bend out of plane, but let's just visualize a system where it's between glass plates so that it's. Between glass plates so that it's forced to deform in plant. And if you pull on it, those little necks will be pulled and it doesn't do anything too interesting. But if you compress it, then, well, the necks are so thin, they bend very easily. And the squares, they're elastic, so they would like to stay pretty rigid. And it will typically form a sort of a pattern. Typically form a sort of a pattern where each you can see now why it's called rotating squares. Each square stays sort of rigid, but the holes that you left behind where you pinched them out, instead of squares, they become parallelograms. And as you compress, they get smaller and smaller until they're not there anymore. So in this example, you get a varying amount of compression ranging from a little bit to a lot. Little bit to a lot. Macroscopically, isotropic compression. And let's see, this image is taken from a paper by Michael Tchaikovsky and Sev Rocklin and a couple of others, where they did sort of both modeling and physical experiments and comparison of the two on this kind of metamaterial. And my point in this picture that here they were applying more or less point loads and seeing what happened. And seeing what happened. But my point is that if you go beyond homogeneous deformation, it looks like material. A little more. Let's see. If you're going to think of it as like a material, well, those homogeneous states, they're sort of like phases. Under deformation, you get, well, sort of a mixture of phases. But if you're accustomed to thinking about mixture. If you're accustomed to thinking about mixtures of solid phasors, phases, careful, this has a continuum of phases according to the amount of compression, not just a couple of phases. On the other hand, at constant compression, it actually has two symmetry-related phases because the square can shear to a parallelogram in two different ways. So at fixed buckling level, there's actually two symmetry. Actually, two symmetry-related patterns. And if they try to coexist next to one another, they're not too happy. There's a wall there which is necessarily stressed. Okay. And so let's see. My interest is, my interest is mainly. Is mainly in the sort of conceptual question of what do we mean when we say this is a material or metamaterial? What do we mean when we talk about macroscopic behavior? And I'm actually going to leave that. That's a teaser for Paul's talk. Metamaterials, this one and others like it will show up in your talk, right, Paul? Yeah. Right. Paul? Yeah, right. And I'm going to move to the system I'm really studying, which is a cousin of that one, but different in interesting ways. I call it the Kagome metamaterial or the Kagome lattice metamaterial, you might say. And okay, just sort of what's the basic geometry? Well, the lattice I'm talking about. The lattice I'm talking about is a tiling of the plane by hexagons and equilateral triangles. You could think of it as being, if you just concentrate on the edges and you make each of the edges of the equilateral triangles are just treated as springs and the corners are treated as nodes, then you can think of it as a male. Think of it as a mass spring network. And the springs, well, let's see, there are lines that are horizontal, and there are then two other families of lines that are at 60 degrees and 120 degrees to horizontal. And you see that these two viewpoints, well, they look a little different, but they're really almost the same. In the spring network, it's a mechanical system. It's a mechanical system because I'm taking, well, let's see, I'll call them Hookian strings, but they're still geometrically nonlinear. What the string wants is for the two nodes at its ends to be the same distance apart, but it doesn't care how much rotation. And the fact that the nodes rotate freely is, of course, what gives it that high degree of nonlinear freedom. Up here in the cutout model, Here in the cutout model, it's the thin necks between the triangles that bend. I'm going to ignore any resistance that they might have to bending. And the equivalence is because triangles are rigid. So if you're going to take a triangle whose edges are springs, its energy-free deformations are in fact rigid motions. Okay, so these are, and mechanically speaking, either way, you'd say, oh, well, you know, wait a minute. We've been thinking about geometrically nonlinear elastic composites for a long time. And this is just an extreme example where you punch holes, different geometry from my checkerboard, but same idea. And so it's a non-linearly elastic pore. A non-linearly elastic porous composite. Or if you did it in this lattice setting, you would say, Well, look, just thicken those springs to beams. And in some leading order approximation, don't let them bend. And you're back to a lattice, a sort of fully homogenization setting. Okay, so a similarity of this system to the checkerboard. Of this system to the checkerboard is that you have under macroscopically homogeneous strain, you can accommodate quite a high range of compressions from no compression to the compression that makes the triangles touch. And so that and that pattern, the picture I gave you, maintains the Maintains the period of the original reference cell. And so, in that respect, it's very similar. Okay, but here's the difference. This system is much more degenerate. It has lots more things it can do that don't introduce any elastic energy. Besides those one-periodic patterns, it could do two-by-one periodic. Patterns, it could do two by one periodic patterns. Double, I mean, so let's see. Here's two by two, by which I mean that the hexagons, it's easy to see the hexagons, the hexagons in the reference configuration have been turned into a family of hexagons. And when you trace through this one's the same as that one, the same as that one, it's got double the original period. There are, you want triple, I could give. You want triple? I could give you triple any number. You have more and more, actually, as you go to higher periodicity. And more than that, here's a version of one of these one-periodic patterns, which has two symmetry-related variants, just like the checkerboard, sort of. Oh, but they can meet and be perfectly happy along a wall. This picture is a little A little misleading. The truth is that the geometry, it is energy-free. The geometry decays to the far-field pattern like a geometric series. It isn't like the geometry is only reaching the far-field pattern in the same way that a geometric series converges, but it's energy-free. Bob, can I ask a question? Yes. Is it easy to say? Yes. Is it easy to say what periods m by n are not allowed as energy-free patterns? I think every period is allowed. Any m and n? I think so. Maybe you're going to get to this, but is it obvious why the oh, I'm sorry, was I interrupting the list? No. Okay. Why is it energy free to create a domain wall? To create a domain wall, no, it's not obvious. Okay, right, excellent. It's not obvious. Uh, sorry to interrupt. So, uh, are these boundaries free? All these boundaries? I didn't understand the question. So, I mean, the ultra boundaries. When the elegy is there. Right. So, so, in the patterns that I was showing you, these are just cutouts of a periodic pattern that would. Of a periodic pattern that would fill the plane. Oh, okay. But now, those questions are really exactly coming to the things that interest me, which is, oh, this is somehow very degenerate. And yet, I'm going to argue that it still can be thought of as a material. And I think, and for me as a sort of theorist, the question of in what sense is that true? Of, in what sense is that true, is at the heart of the matter. Okay, so much of my talk now is that's really the central question. And what I want, and just to try to visualize that question, what I really imagine is that you would take a big sample of this lattice and then cut out a macroscopic region, whether it's a circle or an ellipse. A circle or an ellipse or a square or any other shape, and try to think of that as a body that we might deform. Or maybe to think of it differently, take your shape and fix it, and then fill that shape with the lattice and consider the limit in which the lattice scale goes to zero. If we had a more conventional lattice, maybe a square lattice with the diagonals. A square lattice with the diagonals, too. Of course, that limit would be standard elasticity. With you'd have to calculate a little bit to know the Young's modulus and the Poisson's ratio, and maybe it would be anisotropic, depending on the details of your lattice. But and here we'd like to know, oh, can I do that kind of thing, even though it's still floppy? But let me, to whet your appetite, let me show you some simulations. The simulations were actually done with that cutout model in mind. I'll say a word about how they were done in a moment. But just to try to get a sense of the picture, so here, this simulation shown here, it was done by taking a square that's been filled with this Kagome structure and forcing the top edge to go down, forcing the bottom. Edge to go down, forcing the bottom edge to go up, leaving the two sides free. And this is what it did. And in fact, what you can see is that it chose to be sort of homogeneous and inhomogeneous in compression. It chose the sort of one periodic pattern modulated. And it chose a wall in between. In fact, it was seeing simulations like that that led us to ask: oh, do you think they're That led us to ask: oh, do you think there might be an energy-free wall between homogeneous one-periodic patterns? No energy. Well, in the simulation. Low energy. Low energy. Oh, it's stayed at low energy. So I will talk about the simulation in a moment. Okay. Here's another simulation, somewhat better resolved. Again, so this time it was a circle. So, this time it was a circle with the cut off a little bit at the top and the bottom. So, the top and the bottom were flattened. Again, in the simulation, the top was made to go down, the bottom was made to go up, and it did something really very similar to what we saw in the other simulation. This third picture is a little more complex. We took a rectangle, and this time we specified the deformation around the entire boundary. Around the entire boundary. We quite consciously chose it to be a bending deformation, which, well, we'll talk a little bit about this later, but from a theoretical viewpoint, that could be accommodated by an almost energy-free microstructure. And in the simulation, what you see, okay, the colors are not energy, the colors are. Are not energy. The colors are essentially rotations that were colored in order to help your eye pick out the patterns. And what you see is that it's locally pretty much one periodic, modulated, of course, a version of the one periodic pattern, but they're domains separated by sort of walls. Okay, let me come back to the question of how those simulations were done and what's in them. Done and what's in them. So this is where Bole Deng and Katya Bertoldi came along. They heard about what we were doing. Oh, we're already simulating rotating squares and you've got triangles and hexagons, but it's not such a big change. So their code, so this the simulations are based on the code that was obtained by modifying what they were already. By modifying what they were already doing. And in this code, the triangles are treated as rigid triangles. So they're characterized by the location of the center of mass and the orientation. Oh, but under deformation, the rigid triangles, if I showed you compression patterns that were perfect. But if you're doing something more complicated, the rigid triangles won't quite. The rigid triangles won't quite line up right. And so, in the simulation, the nodes, the edges of each triangle are attached to the neighboring triangle by, I think, rubber band with rest length zero. And so in the simulation, the energy penalizes the failure of the nodes to line up perfectly. Quick question. You may actually be going to address this, but can you tell? Going to address this, but can you take a continuum limit in this situation? Yes, that's that's where I'm at. Okay, can I have another question about the simulations? Well, I think I'm probably going to ask Ian's question. So in their simulations, you have the springs, the rubber band springs. Do you have the torsional springs? Okay, for all the simulations, sometimes introduce. For all the simulations, you sometimes introduce torsional springs, some resistance to bending, but unless I tell you otherwise, the torsional springs have been turned off. So, for the domain wall formations, are the torsional springs turned off? If you put in the torsional springs, it biases you towards certain patterns. Okay. That wasn't my question. The redundancy of patterns that I've shown is reduced by the torsional springs. So then I missed the points. And what springs are being used? What? What springs, what is being penned? So in this simulation, in this simulation, each triangle is rigid. Yes. So it doesn't make neighboring triangles to have their corners not quite on top of each other. And the energy measures the failure of the corners. The failure of the corners to line up. Oh, okay. So it's the length. Right. So it's really length square. Length square. Yeah. Okay. So it's like hookian in some sense. Right. Okay. Right. All my mechanics is hookian except for the fact that there's large rotations. Right. Ian, do you want to ask you a question? Yes. So this domain wall is emanating perpendicularly from the direction in which, I mean, it's along the direction of compression. It's along the direction of compression, but that direction is also somehow aligned with the bow ties in the lattice. Did you find domain walls or try compressing along directions which were not so well aligned? Very good question. And we didn't really explore that. I would, you know, I think what's showing up in the bending example is a little bit more like that. There too, you see that there are sort of preferred directions for the walls, but we haven't systematically explored this. I didn't say yet how the dynamics is done in a system like, so you one could have done just ordinary steepest descent, but that's not what was done in this calculator. So this loading is deformation controlled, not stress controlled. And it's applied very slowly. I mean, in other words, the deformation, the the deformation that the deformation the position of the when i tell you the top goes down what i mean is the centers of masses are forced to move and uh the dynamics is newton's law with damping um once in a while we introduce something to prevent interpenetration if we're going to be compressing the lock uh but so newton's law with damping it means that of course it's always With damping, it means that, of course, it's always bouncing around, but you're deforming the boundary condition slowly enough that the energy stays small. Okay, so Alan's question, that's where I'm headed. So now let's try to think theory. So the, and for the theory, we use not the same model as we compute with, but instead the model in which we have a We have a Hookian spring along the edge of each triangle. Okay, so that means that a fixed length scale of the lattice filling some macroscopic shape, I have the sort of the Kagome lattice truncated by the macroscopic shape. Within that shape, we have a whole bunch of nodes that I'll call Xi epsilon. And I'm entertaining a nonlinear deformation u epsilon. Well, it tells me for each node where it goes, not displacement. I'm doing nonlinear elasticity. So it's the deformed location of that node. And so the stretch length of the spring is the numerator. The reference length of the spring is the denominator. It prefers to be one. Well, because I'm not. Uh, because I'm non-dimensionalized. Uh, it prefers to be one, and I'm squaring that, so hooky and spring. Um, I'm there's no use to a spring constant, so I just don't bother with that. And uh, but of course, as epsilon goes to zero, I have more and more springs. So I have to renormalize. I want the average energy of the springs, and so if I have epsilon minus two. So, if I have epsilon minus two springs, I have to renormalize by epsilon squared to get something that is indeed the average energy of the springs. Okay, so let's see. I think I've told you everything here. And here, of course, only the springs, there's no penalty to rotation at the nodes. The springs that join at a node could be at any angle. Okay, so that's. Okay, so that's a perfectly respectable discrete sort of energy. And now it's a nonlinear mechanical system. So we expect that there could be many local minima. And if the system gets caught in local minima whose energy is high compared to the global minimum, then of course that I wouldn't expect. That I wouldn't expect, then I would expect to see hysteresis, but I would not expect to see a well-defined macroscopic energy. Oh, but in much the same way as we do when we study wrinkling or twinning in martensitic phase transformations or the arrangements of liquid crystals, we might hope that while energy, while nature finds or mechanics, finds or mechanics finds local minima, the local minima we will see will not differ very much from the absolute minimum. They will differ only by little defects that represent higher order corrections, but not leading order behavior. Atoms form crystals with defects. Same idea. You could, to leading order, you could think about the crystal. And the defects are a higher order effect. So So I'm going to, for the theory, I have to just posit, I'm going to assume, I'm going to build a theory on the idea that the deformations I'm interested in are those that achieve the minimum energy or up to corrections that are vanishing in the limit. And so there is a mathematical framework for this. It's the same framework that was used since the 80s to provide a foundation. To provide a foundation for thinking about nonlinear elastic composites. It goes by the name of gamma convergence. And really it says, oh, so then, I mean, I see in the pictures that although things are sort of buckling in a locally approximately periodic way, macroscopically, there's some average deformation that I can see upon which those local oscillations are superimposed. Oscillations are superimposed. And okay, for the people who do wrinkling, this is light tension field theory. And the question is, what's that macroscopic energy that you see when you look at the macroscopic picture? And now, okay, at first you would pause and you say, wait a minute, as you choose epsilon, you have a different. You choose epsilon, you have a different every epsilon is a different lattice. My deformations u epsilon are defined only at the points of the lattice. So, isn't that a problem? Well, not really, because you could triangulate the reference lattice and extend u epsilon by some standard piecewise linear way. And so there's no problem thinking about, even though my deformations are, in principle, defined only at nodes of the reference. Only at nodes of the reference lattice, I could think of them as piecewise linear functions on the entire plane. So there's no problem thinking about them. And then you think again and you say, oh, gradient U squared. Well, let's see. The compression patterns I'm going to see are sort of free. They have bounded gradients when I think of them as being extended that way. So, in fact, those extended So, in fact, those extended gradients, they all have their gradient squared is always controlled by the energy of the lattice up to up to the, well, up to the amount of this kind of thing that you can get by buckling, which doesn't have energy, any energy in the lattice. Okay, so if there is an effective energy, we expect that we even know, sort of mathematically speaking, what kind of functions it should be defined on. Okay, so I think the Okay, so I think the fine details of this, I'm not going to try to give you a proof, but I'm going to try to tell you what the implicit what that theory says and what its implications are. So the effective energy is a hyperelastic energy. It's just the integral of some sort of elastic energy function, which, like any other energy function, is defined in terms of strains. Benny. Just if you go to the previous slide. Just if you go to the previous slide, if you can go to the so just so uncensored. So basically, this is a large deformation but Hookian theory. Hookian, but large deformation. Microscopically, it's Hookian. Yes. The macroscopic theory will, of course, not be anything like Hookian. In this sense, it's like this is the like basically, like it's beyond going in some sense beyond Thopen van Kármán. If I try to search, there's no analogy to the small. I'm making no geometric. There's I'm making no geometrical approximation like Falkball von Kerman, but instead I'm it's as if I were doing tension field theory in a fully non-linear setting, right? Yes. And one thing that I'm having a little bit hard time to see is in what sense. So okay, so in view are the but the displacement is defined with respect to the original, what you would call the stress-free Kagomelattis, not to some isometric deformation of the Kagome lattice. Right. Right. So, so of course, depending on okay, if under compressive loading, we expect that it will stay pretty much very close to energy zero, if it can accommodate that. The theory permits anything. You know, if you were to stretch it, then of course, it wouldn't buckle. All the springs would stretch and you would have non-zero. And you would have non-zero energy. But you started your talk by talking about the huge degeneracy of isometric deformations. So my point is that how do I define you with respect to which of these configurations? Okay, where? Thank you for the question. I could have planted that question, but I didn't. Be patient. Okay, so. Okay, so the idea here is that we want a theory that will, I mean, so your eye knows what it means by the macroscopic deformation. In practice, mathematically speaking, U epsilon has these sort of locally approximately periodic oscillations, but we're not interested in that. We're interested in the deformation that you would see after some local averaging. You would see after some local averaging. And my claim is that it's a hyperelastic energy, but it's not what we know as Neo-Hookian or Mooney Rivlin. It's a rather different energy, which will be frame indifferent. It's defined entirely in terms of the strains. Oh, but it's already clear that compression will be. Compression will be energy-free. Okay? Isotropic compression. But I think, but Benny's question is: well, wait a minute. I mean, where does all that, where does this microscopic picture enter? How can I sort of calculate or estimate this microscopic energy? And the theory tells me that, well, one way, I mean, Well, one way, I mean, so your first idea would be: oh, we know about representative volume elements of composites, apply affine boundary conditions to some element. But there's a more convenient equivalent definition, which is to consider deformations, which are periodic oscillations superimposed upon an affine macroscopic. On an affine macroscopic deformation. So the deformation is f dot x plus phi of x, where phi is periodic. And then I have to allow for any period because I have no idea in advance what period will be chosen. But the macroscopic energy is the best energy you can achieve with periodic oscillations of some period superimposed upon. Proposed upon macroscopic affine deformation F. And this picture was just to remind you that, well, let's see, in this picture, of course, I've got a sort of a two by two periodic oscillation around some macroscopic compression. Okay, and well, sorry. Well, so I guess what I want first thing to say is that for less degenerate structures, this was done before from a technical viewpoint. Our observation was simply that the proofs that were out there also work in this degenerate setting. I've already warned you that if the system got stuck in local minima whose energy was quite different from the minimizer, then of course this theory is ignoring those. Those. And more than that, this is closer to Benny's question. This theory doesn't try to predict what you're going to see in the simulation, all that richness of patterns and walls. It says, well, forget that. What's the macroscopic perspective? It's as if you took a, I mean, we're familiar with this. If you take a polycrystalline solid and you view it as an effective elastic material, You view it as an effective elastic material, you can use linear elasticity, even though each grain is doing something different. So, this is a similar macroscopic viewpoint. Okay, and now still close to Benny's question. So what's the connection between all those energy-free patterns and my macroscopic theory? And the answer is: well, I claim that the effective energy vanishes at isotropic compressions and nowhere else. Compressions and nowhere else. Now, the fact that it vanishes at isotropic compressions is already clear. My energy-free patterns showed that. It actually has many ways to, it can do, you can accommodate those macroscopic isotropic compressions by energy-free patterns in many different ways. I use the term energy-free patterns because it's a meeting-on-pattern formation. Patterns because it's a meeting on pattern formation. Mechanics people would call them mechanisms. Okay, but the more interesting thing is, how do I know it can't do anything other than macroscopic isotropic compression in an energy-free way? Yes? How can it be energy positive? So, how can it vanish anywhere else, right? I mean, the energy is any epsilon by the By definition, any non-zero epsilon will give rise to energy, positive energy. Yeah, but the energy goes like epsilon squared. Epsilon, I mean the strain, right? I mean, so the energy. Right. So, so I showed you a lot of mechanisms. They're very complicated. And yet, somehow macroscopically, they don't just give you compression, they give you isotropic compression. Okay, isotropic compression. So here's the argument. I mean, I'm going to give you the essence of the argument, just the boil-down argument. If you have an energy-free pattern, and let's stick to the two by two case where I can draw pictures. If you have an energy pattern, it means that each of the straight lines that runs through the lattice consists of a family of springs. Consists of a family of springs that are all in line with each other. It's energy, an energy-free pattern would have to leave those springs in their reference length. The only thing that it could do is it could turn that straight line into a sort of a zigzag line. Okay? Each straight line has to be turned into a sort of a zigzag line. The macroscopic compression of the horizontal line. The horizontal line, well, you compare the end to end, you take four springs, because that's one period. You take the length of those four springs end to end, compare it to the end-to-end length of the zigzag line, that's the macroscopic compression in that direction. You do that for the red springs, and you get it's a different zigzag line. So you Zigzag line, so you get the macroscopic compression in that direction. How come they're always the same? Okay, and the end, okay, so here I've tried, I've assigned a little notation to that. E1 is the unit vector in the horizontal direction. E2 is the unit vector in the direction that the red arrows are going. And so the major. And so the macroscopic compression, that is to say, the macroscopic strain acting on, I don't say compression, the macroscopic strain acting on the horizontal unit vector is the end-to-end distance of the blue line, or if you wish, it's the average of those vectors that are blue. And the macroscopic strain acting on the unit vector. The unit vector in the 60-degree direction is the average of the red vectors. Okay, and then the key point is that if you look at, I mean, I actually only use two of the three directions running through the lattice, but every triangle has one blue side and one red side. And the blue sides and the red sides. And the blue sides and the red sides are related by 60 degree rotation. Okay, so the average of all the blues and the average of all the reds, they're also related by 60 degree rotations. And that's the heart that tells you, oh, okay. So because of that, the average red and the average blue. Red and the average blue, they have the same length and they're related by 60 degrees. Okay, and then you do a little linear algebra and you realize that the only matrices that could have that property F are isotropic compressions. Regardless of the loading mass. And here it's we're just trying to understand the energy. We're just trying to understand the energy. So it means that if you apply a loading that produced something else macroscopically, it would have energy, averaging. Okay, so this argument, of course, it was, I did it two by two, and I told you only about energy-free configurations. Okay, but you can do this k by k, and it's the same argument. And if the energy is small, then my conclusions are almost right. Almost right. So, this argument actually shows that the effective energy is controlled by the difference between the two principal strains. And let's see, in addition, of course, that was all about sort of compression, buckling, macroscopic compression. Much easier if you tried to stretch the lattice. A line of springs, when you stretch it, it can't buckle. When you stretch it, it can't buckle, it has to stretch. So, if you have any principal strain that's bigger than one, that costs energy. Okay, so the energy free state, macroscopically energy-free states, are the macroscopic deformations whose deformation gradient is a rotation times a factor less than one. A factor less than one. Of course, the compression can vary from point to point. We saw that in the pictures. The rotation can vary from point to point, too. But we've seen those deformations before. They're called conformal maps. There are lots of them because we can find them using complex variables. And so there's plenty of macroscopically energy-free deformations. And of course, they're And of course, they're using my buckling patterns, but in a modulated way. They're not exactly energy-free, it's just that their average energy is going to zero as epsilon goes to zero. Okay, simulations again, just, I mean, so here we had our code. This time we impose affine boundary condition, compressive boundary condition. Condition compressive boundary condition around the entire boundary, and it did something very simple. It could have done a much more complicated pattern, but we know there are many patterns. I think that the way we apply boundary conditions favors one periodic over the others. Yes. So, Bobby, if I understand correctly, Your claim is that, first of all, I can think of the generate class of the conformal maps, which are globally conformal, like sort of the contraction or I don't know how to phrase it, but basically just take the lattice and rigid body rotation of the whole body and then compression of perfectly uniform compression of everything. So all so this will be that's this picture. That's I mean, that's not going to be. Not conformal, yes, yes, right. But bending, bending comes from a very simple conformal map, yes. So, so, so, basically, your terror, okay, so all the conformal maps correspond to bending modes of your theory, and you can distinguish between them, right? I mean, so locally, they correspond to bending. There's plenty of conformal maps. My question is like this: Suppose I give you a given conformal map. Can you tell me what's its bending energy? Tell me what its bending energy is. This system has the, if I you give me a conformal map, yeah, from my way of thinking about it, the macroscopic energy is zero. Benny, he's ignored torsional springs. That's a key. That's a key point. Because, right, I mean, there is still rotation, right? I mean, the global rotation, even with the okay. So, so uh So let me here. So in this picture, I took a bending deformation. So there are three pictures here of bending deformation. Same macroscopic deformation. Top one is similar to what I showed you before, unbiased. The second one was done by putting in a little bit of bias, a little bit of torsional springs. So that biased the pattern towards. That biased the pattern towards sort of two by one periodicity. The bottom one was done by choosing an intelligent initial configuration in which I somehow took the one periodic pattern and modulated it. But you're right that if epsilon is fixed, then of course the triangle, neighboring triangles don't quite line up, and there is some. And there is some energy. But the energy per spring, the average energy, is going to zero with epsilon. Yeah, but this is exactly what we call bending in. Okay. So my question is, what would be the bending energy? Okay. And so the answer is: I don't know, but the guys at Georgia Tech, Zeb Rocklin and Michael Tchaikovsky, say. Michael Tchaikovsky says that if you do this kind of thing, but you do it very carefully, they believe the bending energy is as small as you like, that they can drive it to zero. Okay, that's that's we should win. Let's see, I'm very close to the end, right? So let's come back. So let's come back here. I mean, so when we did this simulation, it could have deformed. I mean, let's see, we pressed the top and the top down, the bottom up. It could have done the affine deformation. It didn't. Oh, we were leaving the edges free. There are a lot of conformal maps that qualify. And our dynamics, which had viscosity in it, our triangles were lazy. They didn't like to move. Triangles were lazy. They didn't like to move if they didn't have to. Our dynamics chose something that was non-affirming. I'm going to skip this and just wrap up. So, okay, so the lesson is: I think you got the idea. This lattice has lots of mechanisms, lots of energy-free. Mechanisms, lots of energy-free compression patterns. Still, if you take a viewpoint of energy, asymptotic energy minimization, something very similar or analogous to tension field theory when you do wrinkling. The macroscopic energy is well defined and it vanishes exactly at isotropic compressions. Isotropic compressions. And I spent my entire talk on basically one metamaterial. But if you're interested, if your idea is, well, isn't there a bigger universe than metamaterials? And can we talk about the universe a little bit? Wait for Paul. So I suggest, yeah, okay. One question. Suggest, yeah, okay. One question, and then we all go for coffee. We have to be back in 30 minutes. So, so, can I ask a question from the online audience? So, so this is actually a long question. So, Paul must also know this. So, for the quadrilateral Kirigami, we know that the energy-free deformation is. Deformation is an isotropic compression. It's quite surprising to me that. So, this energy-free deformation is also an isotropic compression, given it has this Kargomi system has a lot more degree of freedom. So, I'm just curious, but I don't know. What's the question, though, if I can just ask? So for the quadrilateral kirigami. Not all quadrilateral kirigami have isotropic compression. Yeah. The energy-free deformation is depends on the choice of quadrilaterals. Okay, so let me, I think I've got the question. Let me, so on the one hand, so so Franz, if we take the checkerboard that I started with, it also has an effective energy which it Effective energy, which is energy-free for isotropic compression. Its effective energy is pretty much the same as my Kaigome effective energy. What isn't there a mechanical difference in practice? And the answer is close to Benny's question that the corrections, the leading order energy, if you're doing a, when the effective energy is zero, what are you going to see? You're going to see the correction. And the analysis. And the analog of bending energy. And its leading order correction is very different from Kagome. Kagome is more degenerate in that respect. And then this will be clear in Paul's talk, but indeed, if you leave the checkerboard pattern and you start making your cutouts in other ways, you can get effective energies that vanish at other families of deformations. And even whose effective Whose effective Euler-Lagrange equations change time. Let's stop there and suggest we continue discussions over coffee. And I'll stick around here to follow up with you if you want. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's absolutely a coffee of the coffee. Of course, I'll be happy to talk to you just you're here. You can ask a question. If we talk, I think they're going to hear. For if we talk, I think they're going to hear us. Should we jump to one or something? Abrigue energy is not just when it's kind of D over D2U. Okay, so so first, yeah, you would expect that I'm so excited. Hey, Bob. So, let's quickly read. Is there anybody online? Yeah, I think there are people online. So, Alan just. So Alan just asked, well, breakout rule. In, you know, I mean, I think coming back to Benny's question, you know, doesn't it matter that the deformation gradient of your conformal map isn't constant? And wouldn't that introduce some strain gradient kind of correction? That's Benny's question. And in And let's concentrate on my bottom picture. And in principle, when you describe that bottom picture in a sort of naive way, what you say is exactly right, right? So, so, so. I'm sorry to interrupt, Bob. People who want to discuss this online are moving to breakout room one. I don't know if you guys want to also try to join that in the other. I think it would be easier just to do this. I think it would be easier just to do this because, yeah, like if they just come back, we won't, yeah, tell them to come back because we don't have the screens, bro. All right, yeah, I guess I would have the screen. You would have the screen. The whole point of breakout rooms was to be this kind of hybrid discussion. So you try to do this construction by hand, and you realize that if you freeze the gradient, you know what to do. But then if two triangles, you've frozen them a slightly different You've frozen them in slightly different places. And so they don't fit quite right. And that misfit is related to the gradient, the second gradient of the deformation. That's indeed a strain gradient kind of correction. And so if you do this sort of naively, what you say is right. Now, the group at Georgia Tech, they say, oh, but you know, now locally you have a sort of You have a sort of a deformed version of the Kagome lattice. It's locally sort of periodic. So why stop? You know, go in and solve a linear. Now any corrections you might do to this, of course, they're going to be small. So you're doing linear elasticity around the deformed configuration. But actually, Bob, isn't it just suggested from the three figures to get? I mean, I know that they're slightly different energies, but the. They're slightly different energies, but the fact that you see a lot of heterogeneity in some of the figures under the essentially the same boundary conditions suggests that the correction term in this problem is not dominated potentially by strain gradients. Right. Or I would put it differently. That the effective energy, of course, it sees only the leading order effects. And this system gets caught in local minisers. Minimizers. There is a slew of local minimizers. Their energies are all very similar. And they meet the hypothesis that their energies differ by an amount that's going to zero as epsilon goes to zero. And therefore, they are all described by the same macroscopic behavior. But the idea that if you're careful enough, you can drive the energy to zero. Can drive the energy to zero irrespective of strain gradients, is not inconsistent with the idea that there are lots of local minimizers whose energies will differ from one another, probably by amounts that are related to strain gradients. So can I ask this question that I wanted to ask? So, you know, this is a much richer system at the microscale than the one I study. Yeah. Yeah. Which makes it hard to compute the correct correction terms. Is there a plan of attack in terms of young measures trying to describe the minimizing sequences? Is that your goal? I mean, I know you wanted to compute the macro energy, but what's the next step in your problem? Because the idea of computing the correcter term in your problem seems very hard. Corrector term in your problem seems very hard. So, I think it's a great suggestion. I haven't actually thought of it myself, but I think it's a great suggestion. And somehow the existence of a multiplicity of mechanisms would suggest that the Young measures shouldn't have to be anything like unique. What did the Young dimension? The one-point statistics of the local patterns. Local patterns, all right. Depending on now, but I have another correction to suggest. I think you're a numerical part that you should get them to do the redo, take out the damping and essentially just let the thing oscillate and redo Fermi paste ultimate. Oh, now that's an idea. Yeah, because you're getting it's a Fermi paste one-dimensional, but non-linear couplings, non-linear stress strength. Whereas here, you're getting just Whereas here you're getting just geometric and and in general you know when you're doing pure Newtonian dynamics the uh it would be wonderful I mean now look it's a very it's a truly microscopic it's a truly infinite dimensional I mean already Fermi Pastel I mean there there are simulations of waves there are simulations of propagating waves already in metamaterial systems Dr. Bertoldi's real interest in Bole Ding Interest and Bolei Deng, they weren't mainly doing statics, they were really interested in the non-linear waves. Well, what you missed is a wave turbulence picture, yeah. And there will be it'll be very interesting. Actually, if you drive it and damp it then at maybe different scales, you actually could reproduce the finite flux solution of light solution. Yeah, I will, yeah. Yeah, that I mean, there's certainly could be it's probably, you know, I suppose people can make these things and actually do experiments. We should. The online guys can't hear you. Oh, but so Alan's question was: well, can't you do experiments? And that, in fact, we tried a little. In fact, we tried a little bole tried a little bit to do. Maybe this isn't done. Yeah, there is Bole. Bole tried a little bit to do experiments with rigid triangles attached at nodes that had a little flexibility. But friction was a huge problem there. You know, we could do, and now I have to say that the simulations, the fact that the simulations were done using a different Simulations were done using a different model from the theory. It was just a function of the code that was immediately available. You could do this with springs, of course, you could simulate. And statics, I think, I think make all kinds of materials with lovely properties. Right, right, that's right. And so, you know, Paul's going to be talking more about the range of materials that you can make. Range of materials that you can make as you start being more flexible about what you're going to cut out. And for this material, one of the problems here is that, you know, I showed pictures, but no really quantitative comparison of simulation and theory. And for that, I think you either need a family of problems that Family of problems that have a more unique answer, or you know, you need to figure out well where to look for that kind of test. And there's nothing to stop you having three-dimensional lattices either. Yes, so Alan's comment is, what about three-dimensional lattices? And indeed, there are, okay, so this, what's special about Kagome? About Kagome is that it's a so-called Maxwell lattice. That is to say, if you just assume periodicity of your deformations of any period you choose, and you consider the matrix that takes the degrees of freedom that define a periodic deformation and takes it to the strains in all the springs, the stretches, if you wish, in all the springs. That's a square lattice. So it's not invertible, but it's almost invertible. And that sort of reflects the fact that you're just at the very edge of degeneracy. It's, you know, when we do continuum elasticity, we would say, oh, not every symmetric matrix valued function is a string. Matrix valued function is a string. Or in a more elementary scalar sense, not every vector field is a gradient. Okay, but for this lattice in the discrete setting, it's almost true that every list of strains in the springs comes from a deformation. So it's much more degenerate than a sort of solid elasticity. Sort of solid elasticity. And there are three-dimensional structures that have that feature. It's a favorite feature in parts of the physics community because if you're thinking about granular materials, well, granular material flows until it stops. So the force chains that are holding it together should again be at the very edge of degeneracy. And so even though this system. And so, even though this system is highly ordered, because it's periodic, it's thought of as capturing what could happen when you're at the very edge of degeneracy. So many very exciting possibilities. And so, of course, there are three-dimensional versions of that. Ian, are you still there? Yep, I'm here. Okay. So, I see you're here. Okay. Right. I had a question actually, Bob, if you're still there. So the homogenization formula you showed says choose arbitrary K by K boxes. Okay, so two questions. One of them is: I guess you could have done the calculation using arbitrary periods flat out, m by n. Do you get the same answer? Uh yeah, okay. So I so so this right so uh so of course this I have an initial lattice, which by definition it's a lattice, it's periodic. And I think what you're asking is, well, if I thought of my original reference Kagome lattice with a different period. Uh, with a different period, would it change the answer? And no, you know, wouldn't change the answer because essentially, here I'm allowing periodic mechanisms on any scale. The different question, which might be in the back of your mind, is what's a little surprising here. I know that not all mechanisms are periodic, but I'm still. Periodic, but I'm still allowed to only pay attention to periodic mechanisms in this definition. That's not so surprising, though, because you're allowed to take the scale to infinity, so edge effects don't matter. That's right. That you can achieve affine boundary conditions by scaling any periodic structure and then putting in a little boundary layer. And so, this definition is equivalent. And so, this definition is equivalent to affine boundary conditions with an internal length scale that's allowed to go to zero. So, now my second question is: in the composites literature, for instance, or the older literature on nonlinear homogenization, has there been any effort to identify which period manifests in buckling experiments? Lots of attempts. Now, in that literature, okay, so for example, for example, there's a very recent paper by Pedro Ponte Castaneda, recent within the last couple of years. And he was, his story, you'll find that interesting. Can you see the whiteboard if I write near the screen? Give me a moment, and I should be able to. A moment, and I should be able to. Yes. Okay, so let's consider a nonlinear elastic composite that's just a very simple laminated physical structure. And then there's evidence. I don't know whether it's theorems or more hand waving, but there's common belief is that. Common belief is that it actually never initially buckles at a finite length scale. I mean, it doesn't buckle neither at the original period nor double nor triple. When you go through this calculation, you discover that that that the uh well that that that you should that the preferred construction is to is is to let phi keep well i let phi keep the original scale right so i guess the best way to say it is that this phi is again going to be uh uh uh maintain the periodicity the lambda Maintain the periodicity, the laminated periodicity of the original structure. Oh, but when you do that, you calculate an effective energy and that effective energy you get that way can't be right because it at large strains it can lose rank one convexity. So Pedro said, Oh, good, okay. So we do that calculation. Calculation. And then, because it loses rank one convexity, we should let the macroscopic strain oscillate in a way that its vanquin convexification should like. So, So, and so this is a picture in which you've, there are two length scales, and I didn't, you know, they're extreme. I have a homogenized structure meeting, the same homogenized structure with a different affine deformation in layers. And he was able to calculate sort of the effective energy you get this way and what happens when you. Way and what happens when you laminate it with itself, and by some happy accident, the result that you get after this construction is quasi-convex, so it must be the right answer. And in practice, of course, what that means is that it was very happy to use widely divergent length scales. Scales. I mean, this is, of course, but that's a proof of concept, right? That's not an explanation as to which. No, that's right. So, and this other question about, so why was it that the laminated structure didn't choose to buckle on some higher length scale, even though we know from examples that some structures will. I don't know how sound the theory is. How I don't know how sound the theory is. Okay. So I wanted to point something out to you, Ian. There? Still here. Okay. I think if you talk into your computer, maybe we can see each other. I don't know how many, who else? Uh I don't know how many who else is there. I don't know. Um, mostly just us, I think. Are we anybody else online? I think Fan is here, but I'm not sure if he's tuned in. Participants, yeah, somebody else is online. Uh, Fon is here, yes, I'm here and I can't get a list of participants, but I know I see you, so that's fine. Yes. That picture that Arshad showed, yeah, okay. In the in my work on. In my work on Austinite Martensite kind of stuff, okay, ux squared uy equals plus or minus one plus epsilon uyy. And but if you impose uy equals minus one on one side, uy equals plus one on the other side, then no no No proof, but a conjectured optimal microstructure would be one where you have a sort of a triangular state. And this is with mesiots, was it? And right. So the raw observation was made a long time ago without much analysis. And I've got a paper, should have been finished long ago. It's going to get wrapped up pretty soon with Alex Mead. Up pretty soon with Alex Misiatz and Chef von Mueller. And we actually prioritized and did finish some elastic, I mean, this is scalar, so it's very sort of idealized. We did some elastic problems that have a similar character and that relate to bending and thin films, and those are on archive. But and of course, And of course, here you only have two states. R Shad has any orientation. And the ones that you're going to see are special because they're chosen by the boundary conditions. But it feels very similar. It feels very, it in the same way that you can take the elastic problem of twinning and within some kind of a well-chosen onsets, reduce. Kind of a well-chosen onsats, reduce it to the scalar problem. Yeah, and I actually have a related question, which is now I really wish we could get together at a whiteboard so I could draw a picture, but you could imagine doing a clamped cylinder buckling experiment where you clamp the top and the bottom of the cylinder and then confine. And you could reason that in the middle there should be an origami. That in the middle, there should be an origami pattern, but to match the clamp boundary conditions, that pattern should refine. Shouldn't that be like your older work with Chefan? You can easily imagine that. Right. I mean, the idea there would be There would be that origami patterns. I mean, the idea there would be: origami patterns are efficient for, and it's hard to prove they're efficient for the same reason it's hard to prove that this is. So I have an onsatz, and I can tell, if we were together, I could tell you the scaling lot. Maybe we have, can we schedule a zoom? Maybe when we zoom Friday tomorrow. Okay. The two of us can stay online for other discussions when we're done. Online for other discussions when we're done with Eleni. So, but in going back to Arshad's talk, though, so that's why I had asked about the, I think you talked about the, you asked a question about this too. There is sort of like a flux closure domain. There's the thin tensional band at the top and the bottom. The origami construction exists in some middle portion. And then it seems like there's some tensional region at the top and the bottom that's thin. Yeah, that well, that's right. So, um, and and you know, is that another domain or is it sort of more like a boundary layer? I don't know. And where is the tension? Is the tension really spread throughout the origami pattern as well as in the boundary layer? Or well, oh, wait a minute. I mean, in the experiment, they've got a really They've got a ribbon, and they've attached something that's, I think they've attached something that lets them make a twist. I don't know quite how they set it up. They said it was clamped. It's clamped, I think, right? And so it's like, you know, they attach something that's fairly rigid along the along. fairly rigid along each edge. And then that's under constant tension and control twist. So then the tension is everywhere. But of course, let's see if you're going to twist these relative, let's see, the outer edge, if you just follow it, if it has to follow a sort of If it has to follow a sort of a helical curve, well, whereas the center can follow a straight line, then of course, locally in the ribbon, there's much more tension along the outer edge than along the straight line. And so then, correspondingly, in this sort of origami-like picture, locally, the structure is Structure is, so it's, I mean, in my scalar schematic, the average UI, the homogenized problem, homogenized problem, of course, sees uy can be anywhere, average, can be anywhere between plus or minus one. Homogenized problem, epsilon is going to zero, surface energy is gone. And in this picture, the whole point is that there's a unique That there is a unique homogenized solution for these boundary conditions, which has uy is linear in x. And so, of course, part of what you might hope is that.
