Anyway, I'll so the first speaker for today is Inyaki Garcia Chebarrio. It's a great pleasure to introduce him. He's a professor in Durham University and has worked in many topics in string theory, string phenomenology, and applications to. Applications to quantum field theory. And today he'll tell us about this latter topic. And his title is M-Teory, Symmetries, and Geometry. Please, Inya. Okay, thank you very much for the kind introduction. And thank you very much for the organizers for putting together such a nice workshop. It has been super interesting so far. So yes, indeed, I wanted to talk about how symmetries and M-theory. Symmetries and M-theory interact. And this is based on these papers here. So, a paper I wrote a couple of years ago with Ben Andigo, another one I wrote last year with Michele and my students, Fede and Sagar, and a paper that should appear soon with Federico, Fabio, Sagar, and Sakura. So, we heard last Monday that there are no global symmetries in string theory. My talk will be basically saying that. My talk will be basically saying that all the global symmetry of superconformative theories are in a string theory. There's, of course, no contradiction. I will try to elaborate on that later. But I thought it was an amusing contrast between the start and the end of the conference. So what are symmetries? The traditional definition is that in the classical theory, the symmetries are the group of transformations of fields in the Lagrangian that leave the action invariant and you typically impose something at infinity. And in the quantum And in the quantum theory, we additionally imposed that there are no anomalies. But when we talk about the symmetry, we want it to be non-anomalous with respect to the gauge. So complications have come into focus in the last few years. We have realized that this picture is perhaps a little bit simplistic or said in a different way. We can gain a lot if we go beyond this definition. First of all, regarding anomalies, sometimes we have anomaly constraints. We have anomaly constraints or new anomalies that only become visible if space-time has a more complicated topology. So, the traditional discussion is essentially assuming that the space is a sphere. If you go beyond the spheres, you can get extra information. Symmetries do not need to act on fields, so we can have higher-form symmetries which act on extended operators, and those are really useful for understanding quantum field theory. More recently, More recently, we have found examples of symmetries that do not form a group. Typically, symmetries are topological operators, you fuse them, and the thing that arises after fusion doesn't have to have an inverse. But perhaps more profoundly here, we might not even know or have Lagrangian for our theory, so it's not clear what your starting point is. So, I would like to describe a notion of symmetry, which can be Notion of symmetry which can be generalized, it's general enough that it encompasses all these different obstructions or generalizations that have become important recently. So, here's the question, what is a symmetry? If the old notion is not good, what is a good notion? We're not quite certain of what the final answer will be, but it seems to be some flavor of the following. It seems to be some flavor of the following: symmetries and anomalies of d-dimensional theories live in d plus one-dimensional topological field theories. So, every time you're talking about symmetries and anomalies, you really want to be thinking about topological field theories in one dimension higher. You're doing four-dimensional physics, you want to be thinking about five-dimensional topological field theories. And the slogan here is that symmetries are categorical. And I'm not going to go into categories in this talk, but the reason for this word is that when a mathematician For this word, is that when a mathematician hears topological field theory, they start thinking about category theory. That's the natural language in which topological field theories are formulated. These days, so whenever somebody says symmetries are categorical or categorical symmetries, what we have in mind here is that we are talking about some one higher dimensional topological field theory. And in this talk, what I will try to do is motivate this answer, explain why this is a natural thing when you start looking at sufficiently interesting. Looking at sufficiently interesting systems. And then I'm going to sketch how you can obtain these topology theories, these symmetry theories, if you like, in one dimension higher in M-theory. So how M-theory is rich enough to sort of give us the answer for these symmetry theories for many, many interesting field theories that we can construct using geometric engineering. So that's going to be my two goals. I encourage everybody to ask questions while I'm talking, and I cannot see the Questions while I'm talking, and I cannot see the chat, so please just interrupt me if that's okay. All right, so without further ado, let me try to motivate all these ideas. So, why I should be thinking of what dimension higher. And let me start perhaps in a way that might be surprising. I will start talking about anomalies, and just because the picture is clearer, even for standard symmetries, it's clear that you want to go one dimension higher. So, what are anomalies? So, what are anomalies? Well, what we learn in the textbooks is that anomalies arise whenever we have a symmetry of the classical Lagrangian that is not a symmetry of the full quantum theory. And this may or may not be a problem. If you're talking about gauge transformations, you don't want to have anomalies. If you have an anomaly in a gauge transformation, then what you're saying just doesn't make sense. The theory is inconsistent. If you have an anomaly on a global symmetry, that's a good thing. If you have a nutoft anomaly, You have an atoft anomaly, and really you're learning about the theory, it tells you information what's going on in the theory. That's not an inconsistency, it's actually really good to have atoft anomalies. So, the canonical example of a theory that has an anomaly is the theory of a biofermion in four dimensions with the biofermion charged under a U1 gauge symmetry. So, here's the Lagrangian. This looks fine classically, but as we all know, this is inconsistent quantum mechanically. If I try to gauge this U1, I run into trouble. I run into trouble. So, one way in which you can formulate this concisely is that you have an anomaly whenever you cannot define the phase of the partition function in a well-defined way as a function of the background fields. That is, you want to define in a gauge theory the background fields model gauge invariance. If you take the background field and do a gauge transformation, if you pick up a phase when you do that, then you say. You do that, then you say you have an anomaly on this transformation. I will explain in a second a bit more, a bit different way of looking at things, but this is one way in which you could have defined anomalies in general. So this was all revisited, and I'm saying the word recent. The paper by Dave Fried is now 27 years old, not so recent, it's probably older than some people in the audience. But this was sort of revitalized. But this was sort of revitalized recently by works by many people here highlighting a very nice paper by Whitton in 2015 which has sort of reinterpreted this anomaly story in a different way which seems to be more powerful and for some applications more useful. So many of these things came from condensed matter as many good ideas do but there are also interesting consequences for high energy physics. In particular they appear very naturally in M-theory. Appear very naturally in M-theory. Okay, so what are Diamfreed telling us to do in the case of anomalies? So I said before that you have an anomaly if you have trouble defining the phase of the partition function. So what they give us is a prescription for constructing the phase of the partition function directly. So say that you have your spacetime X D, some D-dimensional spacetime in which you want to put some D-dimensional quantum field theory, and say for simplicity that it is the... And say for simplicity that it is the boundary of some manifold y, which is one dimension higher, and you can extend all the structures that you have in x to y. So you can extend the spin connection, you can extend if you have spinners, you can extend some gauge bundles and so on. Anything that you have in x, you can extend it to y. Let's assume that that's the case. Then Di and Fried tell us that you can compute the phase of the partition function of the fermion in X. In X by computing the following quantity: the modulus of the partition function of the fermion in X. The modulus is always well defined, so we don't have any issues there. You can define it as you like. But the phase you construct by evaluating the following quantity in Y. You evaluate the heat invariant. So, what is the heat invariant? It's defined here. You give me some Dirac operators. So, this would be the Dirac operator of the fermion coupled to the spin connection. To the spin connection and any gauge connection that has extended to y. You solve for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. You have infinite of these, so some of them will be positive, some of them will be negative, and some of them will be zero modes. So you take the dimension of the kernel of the operator, the zero modes, and you add this sum plus one for any positive sine eigenvalue, minus one for any negative sine eigenvalue. Divide the pipe. Of course, there is an infinite sum of plus ones and minus ones. It's a little bit ill-defined, but you can. It's a little bit ill-defined, but you can regulate it, and there's no issue. So, part of the work in the Atiya-Patudian singer paper is showing that this thing is well-defined and you can regulate it. All right, so this seems like a rather strange way of defining the phase of the partition function, but what Day and Fritz showed is that this is a well-defined way of defining the phase of fermions on X. It reproduces what you would expect for any other prescription for computing phase. Prescription for computing phases on X. This might not seem like progress because this eta invariant for anybody who has tried to compute one are basically impossible to compute. We only know expressions for the eta invariant in a handful of examples. But it has very nice properties, at least formally. So if we change the orientation of the manifold, the phase of the partition function changes sign. So I tried to sketch this. So, I try to sketch this here. If you take your manifold and you change the orientation, I call this a bar for flipping all the structures depend on orientation, and then you get an extra minor sign. So that's good. I will explain in a second why this is important. And additionally, it's local, even if the definition that I gave is about the spectrum of the Dirac operator, which seems like a very global quantity, it's locally. It's local in the sense that it behaves nicely under gluing. So you have two manifolds which share a boundary, like here, they have the same boundary, and you join them together. If you want to evaluate the eta invariant of the joint manifold, you can construct it by summing the etiquette invariants, or here I'm taking the exponential formulation, multiplying the exponentiated eta invariance. So they have this very nice behavior under gluing. So the statement local then means that because you imagine that you're then means that because you imagine that you can consider you can construct manifolds by gluing simpler manifolds you can sort of construct data invariant by this patchwise construction doesn't make it any hard any easier to compute but it behaves nicely theoretically so all right so this is a a way of defining the phase how do we know if the phase changes when we do a gauge transformation well they and fruit proposed a slightly different way the slightly different definition of what an anomaly A slightly different definition of what an anomaly is. What they say is anomalies in this context will be cases in which the phase of the partition function depends on the choice of y. And implicitly, when I say choice of y, I also mean the choice of extensions of your gauge connection and so on. So remember that we are defining the phase by going one dimension higher, but really our theory lives on x. So we are making a choice in choosing the y. X is given to us, but y we choose. is given to us but y we choose um so if the choice of the phase depends on the choice sorry if the phase depends on the choice of y then we say that we have an anomaly there's a slightly different way of formulating this which makes it a bit easier to to deal with because the extensions that we are chosen always have the same boundary x by construction we are choosing y's that have boundary x we can change the orientation We can change the orientation of one of the extensions. This will be a prime here. So if you glue y and y prime with change of orientation along the common boundary, you now get a closed manifold in one dimension higher. Let me call that omega. Oh no, w. So we will have an anomaly whenever the eta invariant exponentiated evaluates to any. Exponentiated evaluates to anything different from one on any W or on some W. And here's the argument. So if we are trying to compute the eta invariant on W, well, W is constructed by gluing y and y prime with the change of orientation. And by the nice gluing properties I sketched before, that's the product of the eta invariant on y times. invariant on y times the eta invariant on y prime and i'm changing the orientation of y prime and that means i have to divide by the eta invariant on y prime okay so if the phases are different this quotient is different from one and therefore the partition function on the closed manifold w this time variant on w sorry is going to be different from one so this is a reformulation of the concept of anomaly what we are supposed to do is to look at this it time variant and see if we can find It invariant and see if we can find any manifold in which it evaluates to something different from one. Any questions? All right. So here we start seeing what I was claiming was the general behavior, the general way of looking at things. You have a theory with partition function exponential of the eight invariant. function exponential of the eta invariant one dimension higher this theory is topological i should say here i'm assuming absence of local anomalies um and in this case this is known as the anomaly theory for the fermion right so we have this this theory which whose partition function is the eta invariant on any closed manifold and what we want to know is whether this theory is trivial or not if the theory is trivial that means that there's no anomaly There's no anomaly, and if the theory is non-trivial on some manifold, we say that there is an anomaly. But remember, we're in one dimension higher. We have constructed an auxiliary topological physical theory in one dimension higher, which tells us about anomalies. Okay, so this is the first lesson I want you to remember in this talk, the first thing that we learned. When talking about anomalies, When talking about anomalies, we want to think about topological theories in one dimension higher. And this goes back to Diamond Fried 27 years. So this is well understood by now. Later on, I will give examples of anomaly theories, which are a bit more complicated in some sense. And this will be anomaly theories for one-form symmetries, not anomaly theories for local fields, local fermions, but more complicated objects, but still you can think of them in the same way. There will be theories in one dimension higher which are topological. Okay, so at this point, I have argued that anomalies live in one dimension higher, and the picture I was drawing is we have some boundary where, so it was this picture, we have some boundary where our physical theory lives, if you like, and we are extending it to some bulk, which is one dimensional higher. And if you hear these words, boundary, bulk, and so on, you start thinking how the ACFT. So you may wonder how these. So, you may wonder how these ideas appear in the context of ADA CFT. And they do appear, so I want to now explain what happens in ADA CFT. And I could explain the analogous story for anomalies, but I'm going to focus on the other half of the problem, the other half of the story, which is symmetries. So why symmetries in ADSCFT in the boundary have anything to do with the park? What do you see in the park that tells you there's a symmetry on the boundary? Pack that tells you there's a symmetry on the boundary. And there's a standard answer, which is that if you have a continuous symmetry on the boundary, you get a gauge field in the park. Here I'm going to ask about something a little bit more subtle. I'm going to ask if you have one-form symmetries on the boundary, how do they appear on the park? Because what I want to study later are one-form symmetries. So the easiest system to study in ADA CFT program. System to study in ADS CFT problem is the original one, ADS5 crosses five, dual to and equal to four superior miles. And already I can ask the question here, luckily, so it's not too easy to not too hard to see what's going on. So let me try to understand in holographic language something that was developed recently by Aharoni Seiber and Tachikawa. Okay, so let's just start with the n equal to four theory with algebra G. Sorry, let me start with n. Sorry, let me start with n equal to four theories, and we believe that these ones are classified by a choice of gauge group with algebra G and some discrete theta angles. So this is a way of saying that we believe that to give all the information about someone equal to four theory, you have to give me something like SUN, group SUN, and the value of the theta angle, and maybe the group is P S U N. There are different choices. But we believe these are all the theories that we have. So this class of theories was classified by Haroni Seiber and Tachikawa in the Rudy. By Haroni Seiber and Tachikawa in the Reading Between the Lines paper. The prototypical example is probably the theory with Su2 algebra, which comes in different global forms. You can choose for the SU2 theory the global form SU2. So it could be an equal to 4 with gauge group SU2, or it could be an equal to 4 with gauge group SO3. And this comes into variance plus or minus. And this was donated a bit earlier by... And this was donated a bit earlier by Atom Ronetsk. So, you might wonder what's the real difference between SU2 and SO3, both have the same Lie algebra, and therefore they have the same correlators and so on locally. But there are things that you can do to distinguish these theories. To me, the clearest is probably you try to evaluate the partition function on topologically complicated four-manifolds. So something like K3. You try to put the n equal to four theory on K3. And then equal to four theorem K3, the partition function for SG2 and SO3 looks very different. This was done by Buff and Wheaton in 1994, I think. Another thing you can do, which is closer to what the Harney Severn Tachikov did, you can study the properties and correlators of extended operators. All right, so there are different and equal to four theories. What you might ask then is, what is the holographic interpretation of the possible different Sg2 or Sgn? SG2 or SGN theories in general in four dimensions. And Witten already answered this in 98. And the key insight is that you think of the bug, it's going to be an internal part, it's going to be S5, and then something that looks like the boundary times a radial direction. So you want to think of this radial direction as a time direction and do quantization on the On the spatial slides, would be a copy of the boundary. So I will elaborate on this in a second. But the key insight is that we view the possible four-dimensional theories as states in the Hilbert space of a five-dimensional topological Bach theory that I will describe now, and we take the radial direction as time. And the different states in this theory are the different possible theories on the boundary. So the SU2 theory appears at one state, the SO3 theory appears as one state. Appears at one state, the so three theory appears as a different state, okay, in this quantization. Any questions? So let's let me try to repeat. Sorry, Indi, yes, I have a question. Sorry, what do you mean by possible variance? Maybe I got lost. Yeah, um, I give. Yeah, I give the example of SG2 here. So if you have an equal to four theory, it comes in different, there are different quantum theories that have the same algebra. The SG2 and the SO3 theories have the same algebra, so the local physics is the same. But if you try to evaluate, for example, the partition function on K3, you'll get different answers. So for me, variance, I just meant different global structures in that sentence. For SUN, this would mean the different SUN divided by some subgroups of the center of SUN. That's right, that's right. Yeah, exactly. So that's precisely. And maybe with some discrete tangles. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, can I also quickly just ask again? So if I would have these theories on the boundary of the ADS, so how would they be? How would they be different in the bug theory, or would they? Yeah, let me answer that. That was the next thing I was going to say. But the pencil line is going to be the bug is exactly the same. It's a choice of boundary conditions. But let me explain that. Okay. Thank you. Good questions. So the reduction of 2B on S5, so you take ADS5 plus S5, say, and you Crosses five, say, and you reduce the tip to be x minus five, and you have a lot of terms, but one of them looks like this: you have n divided by two pi i, the integral over your five manifold. I'm not quite saying ads five here, because I want to imagine that my bulk, so my boundary is something complicated, like k3, or maybe if that's too ambitious, maybe p1 plus p1 or something that has two cycles. So I can distinguish these global forms. But anyway, you can mentally replace x5 by. You can mentally replace x5 by this five. The important thing is that you get a coupling which is n times b2, which dc2. And if you look at the type 2y action, you will see that when you reduce, you get something like this. So let's look at this action. Well, this is an example of an action that will appear many times in this talk. I will refer to it as a customary, a BF action. By that, I mean there's a B wedge D of some gauge connection. D of some gauge connection, I'm going to call this kind of actions BF actions. So, this is an example of a BF action, and whenever you have one of these, the equations of motion tell you that B and C have to be flat. So, D of B2 is zero, because if you move the D to the other side and take the equation of motion of C2, this gives you this. And if you take the equation of motion for B2, it tells you that DC2 is zero. Okay, so these guys are flat. And more interestingly, perhaps for us, And more interestingly, perhaps for us, is that B2 and C2 are canonically conjugate. So the momentum for B2 is C2 and the momentum for C2 is B2. So you should think of B2 and C2 as sort of like positional momentum in quantum mechanics. In particular, you cannot set both to zero at the same time because the action is like this. You cannot quite quantize them in such a way that both. In such a way that both get a definite value. They don't commute. And the precise statement of non-commutation is written here. So you get the B's and the C's, and as quantum operators, there's some non-trivial commutation relation whenever they're coincident. So this was worked out in this paper. I emphasize this is a one over n effect, but it's important. It appears for any n. So, okay, and now I come to boundary conditions. So, when you do ADA CFT, you fix boundary conditions and then you compute, I know, partition function, the back or something with these boundary conditions, and this gives you correlators and so on. So, whenever you have, for any operators you have, you have to specify boundary conditions. But the fact that B and C don't commute sort of puts a twist on this because Because you cannot put both to zero. You cannot choose Dislay boundary conditions for both. You can just fix them to some specific value. So, what do we do? Okay, well, we do the best we can. So, the best we can is the following. First, let me imagine that on my boundary, which I'm going to call M4, or near my boundary, the bulk looks like R times M4. And I'm going to imagine that S are two cycles. S are two cycles on this boundary m4. So, one example you can have in mind is p1 cross p1, s2 times s2. So, s would be an s2, and then I have multiple s2s there. And I'm going to define these operators here, what I'm going to call the Ramon-Ramon flux operator and the Neville-Schwarz flux operator, basically by exponentiating these fluxes, these integrals. Now, Now, these Ramon, Ramon, and Nevis-Schwarz operators are built out of fields that don't commute. So it's no surprise that the flux operators themselves don't commute. So these are observables on the boundary that you can construct, but they don't commute. And they don't commute precisely because of this non-commutation relation. If you take these integrals, plug in this commutator, you will obtain this expression here. So the important thing is that if you have a So, the important thing is that if you have the flux operator in the Ramon-Ramon sector associated to some two cycle S, and the flux operator in the Neversoir sector associated to some other two cycle T, they will not commute if S and T intersect. Intersect mod T. So if they intersect mod N. If they intersect N times, for example, that's okay. They will still commute. But if they intersect once, and N is different from 1, then you have non-commuting operators. Commuting operators. And the non-commutation is a phase, just this exponential. Okay, so again, this may look a little bit sophisticated, but it's really the same Heisenberg structure that you find in quantum mechanics. You have position and momentum. You think of the exponentials of this and the way they don't commute. What you do is you pick up phases. That means that if I think of my operators, these Phi Raman-Ramon and Phi Nembers-Schwartz. Phi Raman Ramon and Phi Neverswartz. I have operators valued on this product of Comoly groups. So for each choice of Neverswartz and Ramon fluxes, I can define a flux operator. But they don't quite commute. It's not really an abelian group. What I get is an extension by a set n phase. And here's the set n phase. So I have a non-abelian group, which is built out simply of my flux operators and the phases that they get when they don't commute. This is known as the finite Heisenberg group, W. Heisenberg group W. Okay, so this is a very universal structure and there are theorems that tell you that there's a single representation of this Heisenberg group. It can be constructed starting from a maximalisotropic subspace. So this is the fancy way of saying a maximal set of commuting operators, a maximal commuting set of operators. So the idea here is the same as in quantum mechanics. If you want to specify a state and you have a set of non-commuting Specify a state, and you have a set of non-commuting operators. You pick a maximal set of commuting ones, specify the eigenvalue of your state under these operators, and that specifies the state. But you cannot specify eigenvalues under all operators if the operators don't commute. That would be too much to ask. So, we do the same thing here. So, I'm just formalizing what I said. You have the flux operators. You can define some sort of intersection that tells you how they don't commute. And you define this i to be maximizing. And you define this I to be maxima subgroup of this space where the flux operators live, such that the relevant flux operators commute. Okay, so once you have a specified state like this, remember that we are quantizing along the radial direction and our operators are measuring flux on the boundary. So what we are doing here, specifying a state, is really specifying the state at the boundary, how the boundary conditions for my band pulp fields are. Conditions for my bulk fields are. So specifying one of these i's gives me a canonical state, and this is the state I will associate to such a choice. But you have to make a choice. And the way you make this choice is not unique. In particular, it fixes the familiar notions, such as the gauge group. So there will be, in the case of SUN, a choice that gives you SUN, a choice that gives you P SUN, and some other choices that will give you the other variants that Variants that Tana Maria was mentioning before, for example, quotienting by this criteria group of SEDEN. But I think this way of looking at things is a bit more fundamental in the sense that I can apply the same thinking without any modifications, essentially, to the six-digit massive theory, which also have a holographic dual. I can do it in classes by some slight modification of the argument and so on. So I can think of this choice of global structure in a way that doesn't require any Lagrangian. Way that doesn't require any Lagrangian description. It requires, it doesn't require talking about gauge groups. And that's a good thing because many of the theories that we know these days, we don't know a Lagrangian for them. So we would like to have language to talk about them. All right, so here are some explicitly some examples. The thing you can convince yourself quickly is that all the cases that were found by a harness ver and Tachikawa can be reproduced from this point of view. And this was done shortly after we. And this was done shortly after by Tachiko himself. And the way you do this is basically: there's for any of these n equal to four theories, there's a canonical choice that you can construct in this way. So you define some i T2 and you tensor this by H2 of your four manifold. The details are not super important. The important thing is that there's a systematic way of doing the classification. And the way you obtain the states reproduces what you find. For example, this I2 you should think of. And this I2 is to think of as the maximal set of non-intersecting one cycles in the torus. Geometrically, that's what you get. The answer is reasonable because you can obtain an equal to fourth theory by compactifying the comma surface torus. So this torus is basically the compactification torus. And the statement is that the choices of global structure are choices of a maximal choice of non-intersecting one cycles in the torus. So which are the maximal sets of choices of non-intersecting? Sets of choices of non-intersecting point one cycles in the tours. Well, you can take the X cycles, say, or the A cycles, say, this gives you something that let me call SUN. You could take the B cycles, this gives you something which is S dual. So if this was SUN, this is going to be SUN mod ZN. Or you can do something funkier. So you can take n times the A cycle and plus N times the B cycle with arbitrary, you know. You know, coefficients A and B. And remember that I only need these things not to intersect mod N, right? In this case, if my gauge group is SUN square, these things don't intersect mod N square. The intersection of this with this is AB times N square. So that means that the intersection modulo n square is zero. So this is an acceptable set of one cycles that will give rise. One cycles that will give rise to commuting operators in this quantization diameter, and we call this theory the s un square mod set n theory, so a bit more exotic variant, but if you choose, for example, n equal to n equal to two, then this will be SU4 mod set two, that's SO6. So something that you know is there and you want to construct. And this way you can reproduce all the theories that were found by a Harness Aviant Potical. Fears that were found by a Harni-Cybernthaticala. So remind me where the notation is: the subscript zero refers to the theta angle. Oh, yeah, I apologize. Yeah, this is the fit angle that they discussed in a Harni-Sybernetical. I mean, some notation established. Yeah, it's not quite the fit angle. For any SUN theory or SUN modes, then there's an extra phase that you can put, which is set n-valued. And this is what this subscript does. So basically, zero is that you. Yeah. Is there a quick way to see the correspond to extract the this uh piece of data from the from I? Oh, yeah, are you asking how would I change zero to something else? Yeah, for example. Yeah, yeah. Um, so one way of reasoning is that or more broader question would be if there is an algorithm to go from one set to the other, yeah, yeah, essentially, yes. Um Yeah, yeah, essentially, yes. The problems are, in fact, isomorphic. So, if you remember the paper by Harney Cyber and Tachikawa, they have what they write is a lattice, which is Z N times Z. Let me try to sketch what they do in the end. They define a lattice, which is Z N times Z N, and then the final intersection product in this lattice. And then you're supposed to pick a maximum set of points. You're supposed to pick a maximum set of points in this lattice such that every point commutes with every other point, meaning that every point intersection with any other point is zero modulo setn. So you can quickly convince yourself that the lattice at the right is the H1 of T2 with coefficients in Zn. This is Zn plus Zn. So one cycles on the torus with coefficients Zn, it's one set of them from the A cycles, one set of them from the B cycles. And the intersection product that they write is And the intersection product at the right is precisely the intersection product on the teacher. So you literally can take their diagrams and reinterpret them in this language as choices of one cycles in teacher. Okay, thank you. But sorry, remind me why T2 is so special again. One reason to see why the T2 is in here, not in general, but in this particular equal to four theories, is because we can start with the two, zero theory. We can start with the two, zero theory, 6D 2,000 theory of type a n minus 1, put it on a t2, and you get n equal to 4 superior. So what's happening here is that you start with the 60 theory. You have to choose a global form for the 6D theory. And what we are doing here is choosing a global form by giving information only about what happens on the t-tube. This is a bit such a discussion. This is a bit sad discussion. I'm sure I can summarize very quickly. But I can do it after the talk, if you like. I'm happy to do that. But yeah, that's the reason. That's one way to understand it is because you can come from the six digitomasio theory, and the torus is the torus of compactification. Any other questions? Okay. Um, so that was um So that was, you know, so 2013. Since then we have rephrased this in terms of one from symmetries. So this was done in these nice papers, Capustin and Cyber and Gayett, Capustin, Cyber and Willet. So now we would say that the SGN theory has a ZN electric one-form symmetry, counting Wilson line operators in the fundamental. In case we choose the SGN mode set and theory, The SGUN Mozzadden theory, we can understand this going from SGUN to SGUN MOTSEDN as gauging the one-form symmetry in the SGN theory. And what comes out is that now you have a magnetic one-form symmetry which counts atop loops. So remember that higher-form symmetries, in particular, one-form symmetries are symmetries that count extended operators, instead of point-like operators. So one-form symmetry counts dimension one operators, so lines in this case. So what we will say now. So, what we will say now is that the choice of global symmetry in the boundary theory appears in the park from the fact that you have a BF coupling in the park. In particular, it's a topological subsector in the five-dimensional back theory, a BF coupling. And the choice of boundary conditions for this topological sector determines which actual theory, which actually one-form symmetries, you have on the boundary. So, this is our first hint that somehow symmetries, at least. That somehow symmetries, at least one-form symmetries, are encoded in the park. Now, I'm doing sort of the more complicated case here. As I said before, if it was an ordinary symmetry, we will know many of the things are in the park. You have a global symmetry in the boundary, you have a gauge symmetry on the park, and the choice of boundary conditions is the background for the thing. So, this is the same, but I'm just explaining how it extends naturally, sort of the same way. So, this picture generalizes this idea-CFT picture. For example, Harry and Tachikawa extended it to discrete CO form symmetries, n equal to 3S folds. Berman, Tachikawaw and Safri, they extend it to general symmetries of IBM. And Napruchiv, Ambiz, Gold, and Shafer-Nameki, they extend it to non-conformal cases. And I'm sure I'm forgetting people, but there's certainly things that you can do in this context. And it works, but it's not quite the end of the story because, first of all, not every theory I care about admits a tractable large and limit. Here's the first example I could think of. You have the A6 tug of massive theory in six dimensions. It's hard to imagine that there's a very tractable bulk that you could write. Even theories that do have a known bulk are subtle, and I don't really know how to extend Whiten's discussion to many of these. Extend Witten's discussion to many of these cases. For example, the case of an equal to four with algebra is ON has not been worked out, although Orien, I think, he knows how to do it, but hasn't been published yet. If you want to reproduce what Witten did, sort of line by line, it gets complicated because he was talking about B2 and C2. If you want to do SON, B2 and C2 are projected out, so the coupling is not in supergravity. Is not in supergravity, but you want to introduce it, you want to introduce into polygraphy theory that produces the thing. And it can be done, most likely, but it will require some version of differential real k theory. Not easy. And there are cases which I simply don't know the answer, even if I know the holographic too well. So in the previous case, I could say the words, which I think will work. In the case of n equal to 3s false, for example, I wouldn't even know where to start. Know where to start. In the case of SON, most likely the words if you want to replace with an argument are differential reality theory, I don't know what the right words are for n equal to 3s. We don't have the knowledge of string theory to tell me what the problem is. Yes, Dr. I'll come back to this question later. So, part of the reason I'm excited about what I'm telling you today is because it gives us hints about how to answer this problem. All right, so let me give you an example of a theory that Give you an example of a theory that quite obviously does not have a holer effect dual and yet it's quite simple to study. And this is simply seven-dimensional superior mills with catch algebra G gamma. You can obtain it by putting M-theory on C2 mod gamma. And it doesn't have a holerophic limit because it's not a CFT, it becomes free in the IR. Okay, when I say it doesn't have a holorophic limit, I just mean no nothing tractable, no super gravity. You can take the large limit by the node. You can take the larger limit by the node. So, the one for symmetry of g gamma is the center as it was for SUN. So, here I'm putting the table for the cases, for all the cases. So, if gamma is set n, then the algebra is SUN, the group in the simply connected form is SUN, it has center set N. Okay, so it seems like you need a very complicated chain to get to the same place, but if you do the non-abelian cases, it gets, of course. You do the non-abelian cases, it gets, of course, more interesting. So, if you do the binary dihedral groups, you get SO algebras. The simply connected coverage is spin, and the center is Z2 plus Z2 or Z4 dependent drag. You also have the binary tetrahedral, binary octahedral, and binary equosahedral. And in these cases, you can, well, you get the groups E6, E7, and E8, and the centers are set three, S2, and 1. Two and one. So E8 is a bit special, the center is trivial. And of course, I don't really need to choose, at least in field theory, there's no obvious reason why you need to choose the global form, which is SUN, say, in this case. In field theory, it seems sensible to talk out the seven-dimensional supergiant miss theory with gauge group SUN mods of them, in the sense I explained before. There's no obvious reason why you shouldn't. And in this case, you don't have anymore a one. This case, you don't have anymore a one-form symmetry, what you have is a magnetic four-four symmetry. So you no longer have atop lines, you have atop four surfaces, and just because you're in seven dimensions. But otherwise, it works very similar, like it works very similarly to the four-dimensional case. So, yeah, the similarity does not fully fix the global form of the gauge group, only the algebra. And then you can see two possibilities. Either there's a preferred global form of the gauge group, so mysteriously, there's some reason why M-theory prefers SGUN versus PSUN, maybe, or there's some extra data that we need to specify when constructing the string theory model. So in this paper with Ben and Diego, we argued that in the same way that happens in holography, it is the second case that. It is the second case that's realized. The string theory is agnostic, it doesn't carry if you want to construct SUN and PSUN. The choice of global form for the gauge group is encoded in the choice of boundary conditions at infinity for the supergravity fields. And all possible global forms can be obtained in this way. So there's no privileged choice, not only that, but anything you can construct in field theory, you can engineer in a string theory. And there was a paper, a related paper. Paper, related paper by Michele, Jonathan, and collaborators, and Tom and Daniel, who argued a few years earlier in some related examples how this also worked from a different point of view. And then there has been a lot of further work in many different contexts. You are seeing sort of always the same punchline that anything that you want to construct, you can construct by choosing boundary. You can construct by choosing boundary conditions on affinity appropriately. All right, so let me try to explain why this answer is true. So remember that in holography, we had a BF theory, so this NB2 wheel, that told us by a choice of boundary conditions, which global theory we had. And it was very important that the operators that were measuring the flux of B2 and the flux of C2 did not commute in the pack. The in the pack. This is the reason why we can choose SUN or PSUN, but we cannot do something that fixes both the P's and the C's. So we are after non-commutativity of fluxes in M-theory. Why would on earth the fluxes in M-theory don't commute? Luckily, this was solved by Friedmore and Silver. So let's put M-theory on some manifold, M11, which is of the form a 10-dimensional manifold times R. And we will try to understand the Hilbert space of M-theory. Space of M-theory on N10. And of course, this is an impossible question, but what we really want to understand is it's grading by flux. We want to understand how this Hilbert space is graded by units of flux, how much flux you can put. And of course, there's a lot of more information in the Hilbert space, local excitations and so on. But I'm not going to care about that information, only the gradient by flux. Okay, so here's the argument that they gave. Well, they didn't give the argument for M-theory for. didn't give the argument for M-theory for good reasons. They gave it for Maxwell theory and generalized Maxwell theories. So basically, here we are forgetting about the channel Simons couplings in M-theory. I'll come back to that later. But let me generalize sort of naively thinking only about Manxwell theory. So forgetting about Chen-Simons couplings. So M theory contains a three-form gauge field, C3, and the magnetic charge, the magnetic flux if you like, is measured by the topological class of C3. Measured by the topological class of C3. So you put C3 on your N10, and if you have sufficiently interesting topology on N10, you can have topology for C3. How do you measure the electric charge? So one way to measure the electric charge is we are going to do this in the Hamiltonian formalism. We're going to quantize the theory. So one way to measure the electric charge in the Hamiltonian formalism is as follows. You look at the canonical momentum for C3 and in the Hamiltonian formalism. And in the Hamiltonian formalism, that's the star of G4. That's the momentum conjugate to C3. And of course, this is what you integrate if you want to measure the electric charge in M theory, the amount of M2 for instance. So if we express states in this Riverton space in terms of the wave functions, and again, I'm forgetting a lot of information. I just cut out the topological class of the flux. So you have a wave function that depends on C3. Then this is the position. Then, this is the position coordinate. If you want to understand, if you give me a wave function phi of x and you want to know the momentum of this wave function, what you can do is shift x and see if you get a phase. If you get a phase, you are in eigenstate of momentum, and the phase will tell you how much momentum you have. So, this is what we are doing here. We have our coordinate, C3, in our Hilbert space, and we measure the electric charge by shifting C3 and seeing which phase we three and see which phase we get. So think of this phase here as e to the i px and then we have the regional wave function. So states that satisfy this will be eigenstates of momentum and you can read the electric charge by seeing what the phase is, what Q is in this expression. And for technical reasons I won't go into you want to do this for flat gammas, flat shifts. So, in the case that the shift that you're in for C3 changes the topological sector of C3, acting with the momentum operator will shift the position of the flux in the topological sector. So, trying to measure how much electric charge you have will change the magnetic charge. That is, electric and magnetic operators will not cognize. So, that will help. So, that will happen. We cannot simultaneously measure electric and magnetic charges if there are choices of gamma, which are simultaneously flat and topologically non-trivial. That is, when you add C3 plus gamma, you get something which is in a different commolecular than C3 itself. So, this happens precisely whenever the torsional part of H4 of N10 is different from zero. If H4 in comoly of N10 is different from zero, there are classes in H4 which are both. In H4, which are both flat and which have topologically untrivial. Okay, so this was the basic observation that they did. So Fesa, this will work more or less in the same way for any theory with a form, right? I mean, you could do this for M-theory, but they will be similar for. Will be similar for yeah, actually. What they did in the paper was actually not for M theory, they did for TEP2B and Maxwell. But I just generally, yeah, they even started with the electromagnetism. Yeah, so which brings me to the second question. But here, have you ignored the transmission term? Oh, yes, that's what I said before. Yeah, that SARM G4 is not the correct thing to integrate, right? You're completely correct. So, but you can take this into account and it changes nothing. It changes nothing. For the examples, I will mention in some cases it will not change anything. In some other examples, I suspect it will change something, but it's so subtle I don't understand very well. So I'm going to bring it up when it comes up, but I'm not going to solve it because I don't know how to solve it anymore. Okay, just take yours. No, no, it's definitely a good question. I didn't mean to further complicate. Yeah, yeah. So the answer to your question is it complicates matters so much further, I suspect, that I prefer not to discuss it right now. Prefer not to discuss it right now, and I don't understand fully. Thank you, yeah, that's a great question. Um, all right, so um, this is what they did. Um, we can just take this in terms of flux operators. So, for every class in the torsional part of H4, or if you like, you can dualize this to homology, it's a bit easier to think about, h6. And there's a unitary flux operator. I will think in homology, so to each six cycle, I can construct a flux operator associated to it. can construct a flux operator associated to it and similarly so sigma prime associated to torsional three cycles and these operators in general do not commute because of what you just said so the exact way in which they don't commute you want to compute the linking pairing of sigma sigma prime in the 10 dimensional manifold so remember sigma is a six dimensional cycle sigma prime is a three-dimensional cycle Sigma prime is a three-dimensional cycle. Six plus three is equal to nine, so these things don't intersect, but they link. So you can define a well-defined linking number and you define it as follows. So choose some n such that n times sigma is a boundary. So remember that sigma is torsional. So there will be some n such that n times it makes it trivial in homology. So choose an end like that. And then because it's a boundary, you can make it a boundary. Because it's a boundary, you can make it a boundary of something, and then you can define the linking number to be one over n times the normal intersection of d with sigma prime modulo one. Okay, that's what you want to do. All right, so one property of this pairing you can prove it's perfect, which implies that if these two groups are different from zero, then for each non-trivial element, there's some other sigma primes as the linked prime with each is different from zero. Link brain with it is different from zero. So, for any flux that I choose, there's always something that doesn't commute with it. And that means that these two guys don't commute. And what it means is that it's not possible to simultaneously diagonalize all of these flux operators. We are back to the same thing that happened in holography. You cannot set the asymptotic values of all these flag operations, you cannot set the asymptotic value of all this. Of you cannot set the sensitive value of all these flux operators simultaneously to zero. That is, you cannot simply take boundary conditions in which your fluxes all vanish in the presence of torsion. That may be a little bit surprising. We are used to always thinking, well, my fluxes at infinity are zero or some value I want. But when you have torsion, you cannot do this anymore. You need to turn on some flux at infinity. Say you're putting the C3s to zero at infinity, that means that now you have a sum over all the Sum over all the C6s at infinity. So the final structure is the same as we got in holography. We have a Hilbert space, a bunch of non-commuting operators acting on it, and you do the same thing. So if you want to specify a state, whenever you have a bunch of non-commuting operators, which is a maximally commuting set, and give eigenvalues for those, that specifies your state. But you cannot specify eigenvalues for everything. So the real choice is specifying the. So, the real choice is specifying the subset of committing operators. I call it i again and the details look a little bit different, but it is exactly the same as in holography. Okay, so in the interest of time, I have five minutes left. Let me be a little bit quick here. So, you could say the same thing. Okay, I just gave you the general analysis for NEM theory, modular subtlety that Alessandro pointed out. Let's do it for C2 mode. Let's do it for C2 mod gamma. And what you find is that, well, you have C2 mod gamma, you get some algebra G, so seven dimensional equal to one with algebra G. And I'm going to think of my cone, situation mod gamma, as really a comma, it is a cone of S over S3 mod gamma. So I'm going to take the radial direction of the cone as the time direction in which I'm quantizing. I want to specify boundary conditions at infinity. specify boundary conditions at infinity infinity is the is c2 mod gamma very far away from the origin very far away from the field theory so i'm going to take the radial direction to be my time direction which i quantize so i'm going to take m-theory instead on a manifold of this form r the radial direction times s3 mod gamma times m7 okay and now i want to understand something about the torsion of s3 mod gamma but clearly this manifold has torsion anyway Remote gamma, but clearly this manifold has torsion anyway. That's the main point. This effect that Friedman and Segal pointed out, that whenever you have torsion, quantization is non-trivial. In this case, it's clearly there, or it can be there, because STRMOD gamma has torsion, at least for most gammas. So how much torsion does it have? So we're interested in H1 of S3-mode gamma, and this happens to be the abelianization of gamma. That is, you take gamma and you divide by every element in gamma, which can be obtained by commutating. Gamma, which can be obtained by a commutator of elements in gamma, and gamma is simply pi one of extreme gamma, of course. So, if you do these ablionizations, if you compute them, this is an algebraic problem, you find that for set n, you get set n, for binary hedal, you get set two plus set two, and you get these things here that are familiar. It appeared before when I was describing the center of the simply connected gauge group with gauge with this algebra. So, you find exactly the same table, and this is an explanation for. There's an explanation for this, of course, which is now understood in terms of Friedmore and Sega. These gammas are the things that tell you how much torsion you have, and because of this torsion, things don't commute. And this non-commutativity is the same non-commutativity using the field theory. Okay, so a bunch of technical details. I'm not going to say much about it. Punchline, the classification. Punchline: the classification: the possible global forms of the d equal to seven theories on m7 are given by maximal commuting subspaces of h2 times h5 of m7 with coefficients in double integration of gamma and the commutators are as given above so we have a lot of very detailed information on the global forms of the gauge theories that live on the singularity it comes from this algebraic this geometric structure combined with a little bit of algebra bit of algebra and what you can do now at this point is reproduce the analysis of a harony cyber and tachikawa in seven dimensions basically isomorphic and you obtain exact agreement and what you find is precisely what we find here um and just to something alessandro asked before you still have the isomorphism i was talking about before these diagrams of dots of a harness iber and chicawa they are still the the same diagram that will explain non-commutative Diagram that will explain non-commutativity of operators in here with the same commutation relation and so on. So, again, everything is isomorphic between field theory and geometry. And I should say that in this nice paper of Michele and company, they do this in a fairly different way, closer to Harren-Sever and Tachikawa. They start thinking about extended operators going to infinity and so on. You can prove that the two approaches give the same result, but I'm going to focus on this approach, talking about fluxes, because it's. Of fluxes because it's it fits better with what I want to say later. Okay, and let me go back to the symmetry theory. So, hopefully, by now, I have convinced you that anomalies can be seen in one dimension higher, symmetries in a holography can be seen in one dimension higher, symmetries in a string theory can be seen in a bunch of dimensions higher. There's a bit of a mismatch here. What I did just now for C2 mod gamma gave me a condition on the fluxes at infinity. So, I want to understand the So, I want to understand the symmetries of the theory living at the origin of this cone in terms of what happens at infinity here, which is not quite in one dimension higher. So, I would like to reproduce this BF coupling that Witten found in holography that gave him all the information from this more complicated structure I get in M-theory. And we can do that. So, that's the theme of the paper with Sakura and the other collaborators, which is that we have We have really, I cheated it a bit when I did the quantization. I replaced this space, the cone, by something that asymptotically had the time direction times the spatial slice S3 mod gamma. I was really quantizing M-theory on this picture here and nothing here. And this gave the right result. So this is suggestive, because now if I think I'm making the S3 mod gamma small, and I'm talking on top of theory, so why not? Why not? Then I could imagine that the polygraphy theory I want, the BF theory, comes from reducing M-theory on S3 mod gamma. Okay. So we already know part of this story, the BF couplings. Well, they come from the fact that we have non-commuting flux operators. So let's see how these flux operators look. If you look a little bit into the details, my space is S3 mod gamma times. My space is S3 mode gamma times M7. My flux operators are a one cycle in stream of gamma and a two cycle, a five cycle in M7 in the spatial slice. But now in stream mode gamma, these operators will link and in M7 they will intersect. So if you track the details, you will see that the effective theory that you obtain in M7 once you make the S3 mode gamma, so you just look at these bits, this extended five operator and two. This bit, this extended five operator and two operators in M7 has commutation relations precisely as in the BF theory that we can wrote. Okay, so in this sector, in the BF sector, some of the details are almost trivial. All you need to do is you write these extended operators as a five cycle times a one cycle and a two cycle times a three cycle. And you do the usual reduction thing that you forget they have internal parts. And you look at them as five cycles and two cycles in M7. If you do this, you get. If you do this, you get the exact right commutation relations for the BF theory. And now you just look at this theory and you quantize at infinity and so on, but you have the right topological theory for the choice of global structure. Okay, and now quickly, and I play a couple of minutes, so I should finish soon. So, this is the paper that we are finishing now. You have more stuff, you have also anomalies. So, for example, this one from symmetries. They also interact with the instant on U1. And there's a mixed-toft anomaly which has this form. It doesn't really matter, but it's one of these anomaly theories that I wrote before. It's in eight dimensions. So my theory, the theory I want to understand is in seven dimensions. So the anomaly theory works, lives in eight dimensions. And you can ask yourself, can I obtain this coupling from taking M-theory on On STRMOD gamma, and the answer is that you can. So you take the Chen Semos couplings, C3G4 squared plus C3x8, on STRIMOD gamma, you do the integral, and you obtain this coupling here. And as you mentioned, there's a nice paper a few months ago by Medium and collaborators where through a slightly different approach, what I'm trying to do is here on the nose, what they did is slightly different, they obtained this coupling, the same. This coupling the same. But let me explain what we are doing, which is literally taking this coupling and integrating it on extremal gamma. So, what you want to do is to extract some discrete common invariant in d plus one dimensions, here d is equal to seven, by integrating this coupling on the link. And this is confusing for a number of reasons. First of all, this coupling is really continuously varying. It's not a discrete quantity. And in the cases of interest to us, we are talking about torsion. So, g4 is equal to zero and c3 is not. Is equal to zero and C3 is not globally defined. So, not only is this zero, but it's badly defined. But this can be solved. So, you use differential cohomology, or it has different names, Chigger-Simons or the Lean cohomology. And you work through the details, and you can reproduce the coupling. I'm not going to do that for lack of time. So, we did it in 7D, that computation is not too bad, but we also did it in 5D, where the computation is much more subtle, and there we obtained And there we obtained, well, the same analogous mixed anomaly. And interestingly, an anomaly in B2 itself, in the one-form symmetry itself, which is very subtle, it was worked out in field theory by Gukoff, Peancy. And so we can contrast with the results that they obtain in field theory with our geometric methods, and we find very nice agreement. But the nice thing about geometric methods is that they extend to non-Lagrangian gem theories, which is what we wanted from the beginning. All right, so let me conclude. All right, so let me conclude. So I think this is exciting. In recent years, developments in condensed matter, high energy physics, and mathematics, a bunch of physics and mathematics have sort of all converged into one idea and that we're starting to understand what symmetry means. And symmetry means that you have some sort of topographic theorem one dimension higher. And you should think of your theory really as a boundary state. And the string theory makes this beautiful idea geometric. And in some examples, And in some examples in 7D and in 5D, we could make this precise. I have no doubt that this is much more general, but nobody has worked out the details yet. And I emphasize that as we wanted, we did not need any Lagrangian information on the theory. Only the geometry is important here. We can ask and answer these questions about non-Lagrangian theories. So let me come back to what is this good for? We often hear that string theory has no global symmetries. Well, probably true, but if you start putting string theory in spaces with boundaries, 3-thee-renum spaces with boundaries, you get a lot of symmetry information built in in a very, very interesting way. So, these sort of very strange C-cube and C3, which X8 couplings in the transaction of M-theory are there, so that these anomaly theories, these symmetry theories work out perfectly and they match with the field theory anomalies and symmetries. So, you know, they're kind of there. And here I come back to what Elison was asking before. You can use these ideas to You can use these ideas to probe what the right formulation for these weird synonyms couplings are in M-theory. There are different proposals for what the right commodity theory is for M-theory. You could use field theory to understand these questions, compute the field theory anomaly, the anomalies and symmetries in field theory compared with geometric answer. So, this is a probe of string theory. But also, from the other perspective, you can understand strongly coupled field theories or non-Lagrangian theories by asking questions in geometry. Asking questions in geometry. And for this, we don't need Lagrangian. And even better, this hints very strongly as the generalized form of the Landau paradigm in the sense that we have demoted the CFTs that you're constructing, the similarities of M-theory in geometric engineering, to boundary states of topological field theories. And topological field theory is probably a bit easier to compute. So you start characterizing the CFTs as boundary states. It seems easier to classify them by asking what are the By asking what are the possible symmetries that they could have. So that's interesting. And with this, I finish. I'm just going to make an advertisement, but I'm not going to say anything about it. Right. Thank you. Do you want to physically clap? And let me also do it virtually. Thank you, Niñaki, for the. Inyaki, for the beautiful talk and questions from the audience. So let me let's see if there are no raised hands. Ah, good, Paul. Hello, hey, thanks for the great talk. I just have potentially a very stupid question. So when you write down the fluxes and you sort of say, okay, I'm forced to always get to choose a maximally commuting set, and you have sort of classified that which of these sets would there be for an n equals 260 theory. But could you, I mean, So then, but could you, I mean, just in general, is it actually, say for one, zero theories also, is it clear that such a set always must exist? Yeah, I'm not sure how to answer that in general. What I can answer is that for the constructions that we checked, the two, zero 60 theories and the subset of one, zero theories that you can engineer in F-theory, we could compute this and we got agreement. We could compute this and we got agreement with what was known of this theory. So, at least, okay, for those that are there, that always worked. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, but was it always clear? So, was there an independent field theory? Yeah, for example. For the 60 theories, for example. Yeah, yeah. So, for example, in the Tukuma zero theories. One thing you can do is you put them on a torus and then you get an equal to four, for example. And equal to four, we understand very well. Or you can just put it in a circle and do Jam Mils in 5D. It works the same way. And for those theories, you know that in these five or 4D theories, say for the AN theory, you get M plus one, the set M plus one, one form symmetry. Right? So what this tells you is that the 60 theory tells you is that the 6D theory should have a set n plus one two forms symmetry. You compactify in a circle and gives you the one form symmetry in 4D or 5D. So the answer in many cases was no from this kind of argument, from independent free theory arguments. Even more subtler quantities like how do these one-form symmetries commute, that's fairly involved and they can also be reproduced from the geometry, but we know from free theory. But we know from field theory. Oscar, then Watid, and so on. Yeah, thank you. Well, first of all, Inyaki, thanks for this very nice talk. Thank you. So I have just a very general question. At the beginning, well, you said that we can identify these anomalies, like studying these gauge theories in the boundary of a higher-dimensional manifold. What happened when? What happens when this boundary or the higher dimensional manifold is non-oriented? Is it the same procedure? Yeah, yeah. In fact, part of the original interest in these things, the recent interest was understanding these kind of questions. Anomalies in time reversal, for example, you can understand them as what happens to the theories you put in non-orientable manifolds. And the idea is that putting a background for time reversal is more or less like considering non-orientable manifolds. Less like considering a non-orientable manifold, and then yeah, you ask this question. So, you extend the non-orientable manifold to non-orientable bulk, you construct anomaly theory in the non-orientable bulk, you see if it's trivial or not. And so, yeah, it works exactly the same way. Okay, thank you. Wati? Yeah, hi, Anyaki. Thanks for the nice talk. So, I just had a basic question about the thing you said at the end about global symmetries. And I just wanted maybe to ask you to unpack. And I just wanted maybe to ask you to unpack what you were saying or thinking there. I mean, you know, as you say, we hear a lot that there are no global symmetries in theories with gravity. And there's this nice proof by Harlow and O'Guri that if we're in an anti-desitter space, that's true. And now you're saying putting the theory on spaces with boundaries. So there's sort of two different stories here, both of which involve a space with a boundary, right? In the sense that in analyzing the anomalies that you talked about here, you want to then go to a D plus one-dimensional theory where there's Dimensional theory where there's stuff happening. Whereas, if we're talking about a gravity theory in D dimensions and there's a holography, we look at a theory in D minus one dimensions. Um, so I'm not sure how much what you were saying here was was intended seriously or as kind of can you unpack what you meant here? Yeah, the first approximation, nothing I say is intended, but I can say um no, yeah, here I was just making a point which, um, okay, the serious point I was trying to make. The serious point I was trying to make was that if you ask a mathematician how they think of a topological field theory, they will start talking now about higher n infinity categories and all that. But what they have in mind is that they think of a field theory as an object that if you give me a closed manifold, it gives me something. You give me a manifold with boundaries, it gives me some more refined information, maybe filter space. You put a manifold with corners, then you start talking about maybe how the Then you start talking about maybe how these states in the Hilbert space interact and so on. So, for them, it's not enough to know what happens on a closed manifold. They really want to know what happens on boundaries, on corners, and more complicated. And the statement that there are no global symmetries in gravity or string theory, to me, has the flavor of saying that there are no global symmetries on closed manifolds. Now, we know, of course, that if you put a string theory on species with boundaries, you start getting super interesting things. You start getting super interesting things like already Horijava-Witten or the CFTs I'm talking about, or many other phenomena. They are there, and these things do have these three theories do have global symmetries. Sorry, when you say, just if I can interrupt for a second, when you say that there are global symmetries, you mean in the boundary theory, right? In the boundary theory, yes, yes, exactly. Right. So, for instance, when you have a holographic, I mean, that's, I think, essentially what Harlow and Aguri used in their analysis of global symmetries or engaged symmetries. Or engaged symmetries, that a global symmetry on the boundary becomes a gauge symmetry in the bulk, right? Yeah, I'm not disputing that at all. What I'm saying is that if you start looking at this boundary structure of a string theory, so what you're saying, you're saying is true, even outside the context of holography. If you have a theory, there's something going on on the boundary, which is part of the theory, like a theory in the bulk, which includes a boundary component. The theory on the boundary, even if they have gravity in the bulk, can Have gravity in the bulk can have a global symmetry, even if it's not related through a holography. That's maybe what you're saying. That's one way of saying it. And the thing I find amazing, the reason why I say this, which I acknowledge is a little bit provocative, is that string theory is tuned in such a way that all these funky couplings, C3 cube, sorry, C3, G4, G4, and C3X8, have the precise right coefficients for interacting with the geometry in such a way that the theory that gives you the symmetries of the The theory that gives you the symmetries of the boundary is exactly what it needs to be in field theory. And that's quite amazing. It's like it knows a lot about field theory in a very deep way. Interesting. Can I just ask one more question related to that? So would you say that that correspondence is equally valid whether the space in the bulk is in a negatively curved cosmological constant or not? So that the same sort of statement about bulk and boundary would be true even for a desider or flat. Desitter or flat interior? Yeah, I don't think it's any different. In fact, when I did the analysis here, I never told you what M7 was, right? Yeah. Okay, thanks, Nyaki. Interesting. I think it's known. Thank you. Thank you, Nyaki, for this very interesting talk. Actually, I have a question about your first part, about the first part of the anomalies. And if I understood correctly, what you said is that whenever you have an anomaly-free theory, an anomaly, yeah, an anomaly-free theory, its anomaly theory, well, this topological field theory that you construct it is non-trivial. But what happens in the other way around? No, suppose the turbo around. If you have a nominee free, the other way around. Yeah. If it's anomaly-free, the anomaly theory is trivial. Anomaly theory is trivial. Okay, that makes sense. So, but now I have another question. Can you, by using this anomaly theory, compute the amount of anomaly that you have in your theory? Yes. The presentation I gave here was a little bit geared towards global anomalies, things like Britain's SG2 anomaly. This framework is a bit more powerful there, but it works just as well for local anomalies. As well for local anomalies, which your question is perhaps a bit sharper. What happens there is that the Bach theory, the theory in Yd plus one, this eta invariant I was writing, it sort of becomes the Chern-Simons invariant. And then the way to think about what happens when you do small gauge transformations, say, would be you think of XT, another copy of XT with a slightly changed gauge bundle because of the gauge transformation. Bander because of the gauge transformation, and a little cylinder that connects them on which you want to evaluate the churn-Simons invariant. And this is the geometric realization of the usual descent formalism. In descent, you will see that the anomaly is something like the turn-simons, the transgression of terms. So, geometrically, it works like that. You put the anomaly theory here, the same one, the e-time variant, but in this case, where you have local anomaly, this is. Where you have local normality, this is essentially a churn Simons, and that's it. Then you get the variation of the phase is a churn Simons integrated on the park. How is it to compute that, actually? Like in a common example, the simplest example is it like the data function. The data function they have here, you told us is very difficult to compute. And now that you mentioned George Simon Senor, it can be easy, but it can also. It can be easy, but it can also be very complicated. Yeah, that's that's right. So, um, in the cases where you have local anomalies, um, by local I mean of continuous groups, you are better off doing the usual the same formalization. So, write the anomaly polynomial and as usual in textbooks. Um, when you have global anomalies, this becomes more powerful, um, like uh. Like, for example, you have discrete symmetries, which I was talking about the other day. You can use this formalism very nicely for understanding global symmetries. You extend the global symmetry to a bug, and then you start thinking how this anomaly theory evaluates with each invariant with the connection in the discrete group for the discrete symmetry. And in some cases, you can do calculation. So, I have a paper with Miguel. So, I have a paper with Miguel, I haven't stayed here, but we do a bunch of examples of discrete symmetries and so on. And you can compute the H invariant. The trick is that, or the useful way of thinking of this, is first you take care of the local anomaly using the descent as usual, nothing new there. If your local anomaly cancels, if it doesn't cancel, there's no point in talking about global anomalies. Local anomalies are more important. But if local anomalies cancel, then global anomalies, their computation. Global anomalies, their computation becomes a problem in bordism, which I haven't described. But there's a theory of borderism, and then you can compute this eta-invariant theory on some representative manifold. You don't have to compute it for every W. So here I told you that it has to vanish on every W. That's true, but the things that you have to check are greatly reduced by this Bordism argument. And very often, you can construct representatives of Bordism where you can compute the item variant. I have a paper with Mila where we do a bunch of examples. I'll take a look. Okay, thank you very much. Sorry, let me interject to just point out that there was already a dramatic realization of the dissent formalism in a paper by Alvarez, Gome and Ginsburg. Yes, yes, sorry, I shouldn't imply otherwise, you know. To my understanding, this is completely different, right? I mean, no relation whatsoever. There, they were considering the space of connections. I mean, this was what was enlarging the Maria. Yeah, thanks for the interesting talks. Yeah, I would like to know if you can relate your work or say something about the heterotic in seven dimensions related to this. I mean, if you could consider compactifications on K3, also modeled by some symmetries. Yes. Well, the answer is no, I can't say anything, but. The answer is no, I can't say anything, but it's a very interesting problem and I would like to think more about it. The reason why we did M-theory first, and there's a reason for that. And it's a technical reason is because you can see these couplings, C3 cubed and keep calling C3, C3, G4, G4 and C3X8. You can see them at the level of the action. You can write an action that includes those terms and then reduce that using that action, a classical reduction. In the heterotic or in type. In the heterotic or in type 2b or things like that, these are chiral theories. And when you do chiral reductions, the same effect appears, but because of loop effects of the fields that you're integrating out. So the discussion is a little bit more subtle. Like you could ask, you know, I'm reducing C3, G4, G4, C3, X8. I'm reducing that. But what happens to this coupling if I put it in a circle and then... If I put it in a circle and then it dualize, then I have type 2B, and that coupling is not there in type 2B. So, what I'm supposed to reduce. And the answer is that that coupling of the effective coupling 90, the same one, appears after doing the integration out of the chiral matter in type 2B on the circle. So, if I want to do this in the heterogeneity, I hope we can, but you'll have to deal with this complication. I haven't done it yet. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Since we have a few more minutes, I'll um use my privilege as our chair to ask another question on my own. So I feel you were a bit in a hurry at the end that you mentioned some what sounded like an interesting application to the right cohomology in M-theory. So, what do you mean? Something akin to understanding what the analog of K-theory is in M-theory? I mean precisely that, yes. I remember only one proposal. Perhaps I'm forgetting something. There was a proposal that H4 was somehow the correct thing to consider, but maybe by Diaconescomo and Witten, but perhaps I'm recalling wrong. Well, the most recent proposal is one by. The most recent proposal is one by Sati, Fiorentza, and Schreiber, I think, where they propose that the fluxes in M theory, the thing I'm looking to, I think I give you the anomaly, live in something which is called twisted comotopy, a J-twisted comotopy. It's a fairly, as I understand, it's a fairly horrible algebraic object. I'm not sure how to do computations there. But yeah, that would be precisely what I have in mind. What is the right algebraic object? What is the right algebraic object where fluxes in M-theory live? Or even type 2B, right? In type 2, the answer is not entirely clear in the sense that for weak coupling, you have K-theory, but K-theory is not test duality invariant. The formation is not test duality invariant. So it takes over Raman Ramon fields, but it doesn't incorporate so well the neural source sector. So that's a problem in practice if you want to understand. I was alluding to this when I was talking about. I was alluding to this when I was talking about then equal to 3S faults in holography. So if I wanted to do the with an argument, if I want to do it for SUN, well, I have an orientative fault. I know what orientifaults do, really. They project down the fluxes not to nothing, but to KO theory or KSP or some K theory version. Okay, so that at least the question is clear there. But if I have something like n equal to 3s fold, where the action on the S5 is The action on the S5 is involving the S-duality generator, then you really have to have something which is like K-theory but S-duality covariant. And we don't know that object. We don't know what that is. So, but I guess I was asking if you were announcing your results on this or if I'm saying that somebody's commanded. Okay, no, no. Yeah, and what I'm hoping to do in the short. In the short term, short to medium term, is that there's technically there's in all these papers we have been working on, there's always one thing that we assume that's very bothersome to me, but we do, which is that we assume that the manifold in which the fifth year lived does not have torsion. And what this really does, so remember the M-theory itself has torsion, but the manifold where the field theory lives does not need to have torsion. Let me go back to the picture. To the picture, okay. Um, so you have your quantization in this space: M7 is where the um the TFT lives, topology theory lives, and the part that has torsion is three mod gamma. And we're always assuming that M7 has no torsion, essentially. Um, but all these phenomena, all these subtle things, this twisted cohomotopy and so on, they are torsional effects intrinsically. Supergravity is fine, supergravity. It's okay. We know super gravity. Special gravity, it's okay. We know what happens to gravity. It's only when there's torsion that we don't know what's going on. So, what we really need to understand better is what do the field theories do on a space-time on spaces with torsion. And what I was proposing to look at the field theories in spaces with torsion, there's papers like this. And this gives you at least something to check against any proposal that you have, twisted comotopy or any generalized K-theory that you want to propose. You should agree with the field theory results through this change. With the field theory results through this chain of arguments. So it's a probe of what the right comology theory is. Put in field theory, Lagrangian field theories, on manifolds with torsion and see how it behaves, which anomalies do they have, and so on. I'm missing if you are comparing something with something else. Well, you know, two computers don't exist, but there are papers that they study field theory on spaces on Spaces on space times with torsion. And that doesn't exist. Okay, no, this is what I was. Okay. Yeah, exactly. And in this case, they can construct an anomaly polynomial and you have the structure of the anomaly theory, what I've been calling the anomaly theory, the symmetry theory, one dimension higher. Okay, so I guess in that case, you could compare. Yeah, exactly. In that case, you would like to take your favorite proposal for the generalized common theory that discrets fluxes in M-theory, type 2B, whatever, put it on the right compact. The right compactification manifold, in this case, it's this lens space, but could be something else, and you put it in that space, reduce as I was explaining during this differential cohomology. So basically, there's a version of differential cohomology for any comology theory that you give me. There's a differential K-theory, there's a differential comotopy, there's always a differential version. And you can apply our techniques for any, well, if they're powerful enough, to any differential commodity theory, and then this will give you. Theory, and then this will give you another normal theory, and these two things should match. So that's a way of probing your favorite common theory if you know the answer in field theory. And often you do. Like, you know, these results in field theory were worked out last year by Kukov-Peiensin, purely in field theory. And what we do is reproduce from geometry without using field theory. So you could do the same thing. Look at your February field theory, look at what happens with torsion, and try to reproduce that. And try to reproduce it. Okay. There is a question by Oscar. Thanks. John, just a very quick question. So we usually knew from the past that K theory was the correct tool to classify all these remote fluxes and the range and all that. And we have this non-B. And all that, and we have these non-BPS states coming from K-theory classification. And also, we know that in presence of fluxes, this K-theory has to change to a twisted version of K-theory. How this twisted version is related with this now generalized differential K-theory? Right. So there are two things. One is that if you give me your favorite generalized commodity theory, twist it or not. Commodia theory, twisted or not. Oh, I have to think for a twisted case. Let me not make the statement. Am I being recorded? Yes. Let me not make the statement about what happens for a twisted case. I'm not entirely sure. But for K-theory, your favorite K-theory version, you have a differential K-theory that exists, that's very well studied, at least in the unitary case. So that's one thing. The other thing I don't know is how all these versions of generalized community theory, like you said, twisted K theory in type 2, talks to the proposal by Sati and friends for the commodity theory in M-theory. What they propose looks very different to K-theory to me. Well, yeah, it looks different enough. Yeah, it looks different enough that I know how to compare them. It should be the same under reductions, but I don't know if anybody has done that check. Thank you. Thank you. But I emphasize this differential approach, it always exists, but sometimes it's hard to use. Like I can do it in the ordinary commodity case. I can do it in differential K-theory. Differential KO theory, for example, is already quite hard for me. For me. Thank you, Nij. Thank you. Wonderful. So it looks like we had a very nice discussion here. And organizers, I think now.
