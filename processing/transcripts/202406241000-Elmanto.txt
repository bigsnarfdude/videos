If you're bored or remind yourself. So, if m and n are equal in k0, so if the symbols m and n are the same, this is true if and only if m directs some r to the r. So, for some r, that's isomorphic to n directs some r to the r. In other words, m and n are equal in k0 if n if it's stably isomorphic. Isomorphic. So M is zero, for example, M is like the class of zero. I mean, the identity, the zero element, the neutral element in this thing is zero, if and only if M is stably trivial as a module. Okay, so here's R are the same. Yes. Okay, here's a definition of a small subgroup or a subgroup of K0 that I would like to. A subgroup of k0 that I would like to understand today via this method of motivic homology. So let x be for simplicity and affine finite type scheme over k but I don't want it to be smooth in particular. Okay, so let's say its dimension is n then we can Then we can look at f n k0 of x, which is the subgroup of k0 of x generated by the following. So you can look at kappa x, where x is a smooth closed point of x. So it's contained in the smooth locus, and it's a closed point. And it's a close point. Yes. Not yet. No. No, I have not. Exactly. So because it is a smooth logus, I can write kappa x. Well, it's like O X modulus of maximal ideal, right? But I can find a projected resolution of finite length of this kx, kappa x, and therefore this. Kappa x and therefore this is just the alternating sum. So kappa x is by definition the alternating sum minus one to the i of the classes of pi. My definition. So this is f n k0 of x is some kind of zero cycled group. And one can check that if x is smooth over k, then indeed f and k0 is the Fulton style group of zero cycles on X modular rational equivalences. Something that you can, but when you think about it, this is some kind of definition of zero cycles that people have thought about is. Thought about over the years. Any questions? Yeah. Yes. Ah, sorry. Resolution of a local ring. No, I'm is affine. So I'm thinking about this. Oh, no, no, not local ring. I guess, I guess this is this. I guess it's this. I do this. So X is spec, I guess. So X is spec, I guess X is spec A. X is spec A. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Because it is smooth locus. It's not smooth, yeah. The resolution will be a little bit more. The resolution will yeah, right, yeah, exactly. Yeah, could you please uh repeat the questions? It's it's I can't hear what the questions are online. Okay. Is both everywhere. Okay. All right. All right. So here's the theorem, which was like a conjecture of Murphy from the 80s. And many various people have worked on this, so Mark Levine. So Mark Levine, Krishna, Amalendu Krishna, and eventually, Krishna and yeah, Krishna and Srinivas, and Krishna again from the 80s to 2019, I would say, is that let R the finite type reduced. Reduced algebra over k equals to k bar, so over an algebraically closed field this time. Then, yeah. F and okay, and let okay, of dimension, sorry, of dimension n, which is greater than two, so you just want to dismiss curves. I dismiss curves, then Fn K0 bar is torogen-free. So the goal of this lecture is to kind of explain to you an alternate proof of this conjecture. And I want to use, I want to highlight the key point of this new proof is that. Like the key point of this new proof is that we have a homological interpretation of this object even outside of the singular setting. Yeah. Full power. Great. Let me just make sure I'm understanding. If you're not a real directly closed field, you could take like an open subscheme of a conic and you get something that has torsion, right? Yes, there's plenty of torsion also. And in the smooth case, do we already know something in the smooth case? What's interesting here? Is what's interesting here, everything, or just the fact that it doesn't have to be regular? Yeah, so we do know a lot of things in the smooth case. I think this conjecture was known in the smooth case by work of Levine and Murthy and so on. But in the singular case was what's interesting. Okay, so somehow you expect it to be almost never true when K is not updated with exactly. Yeah. Also, not true for curves because of pick, right? Thank you. Yeah, great. Okay. So, all right, so that's that's the So, uh, all right, so that's that's the deal uh that you sign up for, I guess. Yes, yes, yes, mesh at least two. Yeah, uh, so I really, yeah, so I want to explain a proof of this theorem using homological methods, but I want to motivate why you will want to contemplate this result at all. So, this has this was motivated by splitting problems for vector bundles. Which is inspired by the which was started by Serre by the following theorem that many people are familiar with. Okay, so let's say R is a Noetherian scheme, a Noetherian ring. So I'm going to mix ringing schemes. Ringing schemes, as any good algebraic geometer would. It's the RB note ring of dimension n and p finally generated projective module over R of rank less greater than or equal to n plus 1. Then p splits off Let's offer a trivial rank one summon, i.e., p is isomorphic to q direct sum r for some other finite generated projective module r. So, in other words, anytime you have a you're contemplating projective modules over an Ethereum ring of dimension n, the only interest. Of dimension n, the only interesting part happens when p is like rank n and below. So, Sarah gave a proof of this back in the 60s, I guess. Yeah, it's like a very old result. So, then it's a reasonable question to us. Are there really trivial or can we always split off modules, split off trivial summons of modules? Trivial summons of modules, which is, of course, a ridiculous question. The whole theory we just rolled onto algebra. Yeah, can we always like, what? Yes, the answer is no, of course. But well, let's attempt to understand what happens one dimension lower, in other words, when your ragn is equal to the dimension. So, um, yeah, so exams or remarks. If uh rank of key is equals to the dimension, then many examples of non-splitting of non-decomposable modules abound. So, here's my favorite example. So, if I have the sphere that looks like this, x squared plus y squared plus z squared minus 1, that's the equation for the sphere, then the fuzzy ball theorem. The module corresponding to the tangent space to the tangent bundle is non-split. Right, this is everyone's favorite example of a non-split module. Everyone's favorite example of a non-split module. You cannot like parallelize the fuzzy ball. So, but you might complain: okay, like I've been talking about algebraically closed fields or whatever, and this I just threw an R at you and exposed myself to the whole wild world of manifold topology. So, how about C? Well, turns out you can also produce examples. So, if I look at If I look at C adjoin X Y Z modulo X 4 plus Y 4 plus Z four minus one all these R right has many in the composable module the idea So, the idea, basically, due to which was recorded in a paper by Swan and Murthy, but relying ideas on Manfred, is that this R is open inside X, but this is smooth and projective. But the child group of zero cycles of X is large. Is large in the sense of Manfred. So Manfred initiated, he was one of the pioneers of the study of zero cycles along with characters like Reitman and so on. So you can find x such that pg of x, the geometric genus of x, in other words, like this h0 omega x is non-zero. Is non-zero. So as soon as you find one non-trivial two-form on x, charge zero of x is huge. This is a very classical theorem due to Mumford. And Swan and Moti exploited this fact and some ideas from K-theory actually to show that this gives you a lot, like basically a lower bound on how many indecomposable modules this thing has. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Thank you. So we're always talking about modules words. Yes. Oh, yes. So for the hairy ball, if you multiply the hairy ball, it's false now. Yeah, actually, yes. You can split off the hairy ball. Yeah, exactly. That's right. So basically, we are, I mean, we are checking whether the like some doctor and class or exactly, yeah. That's like just though. Yeah, that's like so. The way that you produce a lot of examples is to is via the theory of trend classes. You want to write down an obstruction, which is what I'm going to explain next, to splitting off the top rank. So if so the trend classes will live inside child zero, if it's huge, then like you are in good shape. So something like this is correct. So if I put n variables here, then you have to put like n plus two, then it's always like many, many indecomposables. Like many, many indecomposables. I mean, it's just a computation of geometric genus. So, this hugeness of charge zero vectors is kind of what was exploited. So, that's like the relationship between this is like kind of hinting at the fact that this FDK0, which is, I'm telling you, is some kind of fake zero cycles and it's real if you are actually smooth, has something to do with splitting of one rank, one, one, one trivial sum and of a module. Any questions? I want to talk about chin classes, as Andrea suggested. Yeah, so I want to systematize this, and this is like what Murphy wrote in his paper from the 80s. Yeah, so by the way, what I'm going to say in this first lecture, at least, is a lot of it is kind of lifted off an expository paper Murthy himself wrote in honor of Hyman Beth about the relationship. About the relationship between K-theory and this problem of splitting off modules of rank one. Highly recommend it. If you can't find it online, I'll send it to you. Okay, so I want to systematize this industry. So here's the definition. So again, P is rank N and n is the dimension of R. I guess for the definition, you don't really need that, but we just say that P is frank n. This is the sum of I equals to 1 to n of minus 1 to the i of wedges of the dual of p. And this is to be taken as a k0 class. And I do it that way. That's the definition of the churn class and just the nth churn class. You can construct lower ones, of course, but I just want to focus on this one because it's the one that's relevant for splitting off the rank points. All right, so let me write down some simple lemmas or some propositions about this object. Position. So let's say A, I guess, finite type, maybe reduce for safety over K equals to K bar. But many of these kind of works without these assumptions. Okay, then so one. So let's say S is an element inside P which. Which is equal or isomorphic to hum of p dual into A. Then if S of P dual, the image of S, the image of the section, which is inside A, is L C I of height n, then Then this Cn of P computes A mod i. So this A mod i would be a finite generative projective module over this dimension n time. It's a finite generative projective module over A, right, because the height is the same thing as the dimension. I can make sense of this in K0. And I'm telling you, I can write down Cn of P. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you. Sorry. Yeah, so two CN of P, in fact, lies inside Fn of K0, right? Yeah, it's not, it's in this special subgroup that I enjoy. Three, if P is decomposable, in other words, it splits as Q direct sum A, then Then the obstruction vanishes. CNOP is zero. So, this is telling you how to physically calculate CNOP, or like what CNOP really means, the relationship between CNOP and this MOTI. This is telling you that this lies in the subgroup I like, the relevant subgroup. And this is telling you that it's a good obstruction. Like if it's zero, then I die. Yeah. Yes. E finitely generated projective module. Thank you. Of rank N and is dimension N. Yes. Yes. Can you just comment for a second on this condition that S That SFP dual is LCI? Like, I'm just how does that occur in Nader, et cetera? So let me rephrase a question. What if it's GCI? What if it's actually a global complete detection? And you can show that actually CNLP is zero. Yeah. So exactly. So LCI generically, okay, so I'm going to claim that when your algebraic equals field, possibly even infinite field, you can always Possibly even infinite fields, you can always find a section where this is LCI. Just by some generic genericity argument. So generically, it does happen. And then when it's zero, it's like GCI. Yes. So that's. Can I ask you a question about the definition of CN of P? I can't see it on the board. I can't see it on the screen right now, but was the sum supposed to be from I equals zero up to N, or is it really from one to N? I'm just worried about the, it doesn't seem, I'm worried about the rank. Yes. Yes. Yes, that's a good question. Yes, thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. The way that you did this is that you write down the causal complex, which is I'm gonna what I'm gonna write on. So thank you, thank you for that. Yes, okay, thank you. Right, indeed. So uh proof right if uh a mod i A mod i is indeed LCI, then I wrote down, then I can write this A mod i as the following causal complex. Oh, sorry, this is a this is the quotient map, and then this is my s and then I can continue this until wedge n of p is the determinant and uh I dueled, of course, thank you. First, thank you. Yes, I remembered to dualize there, but not here. So, A mod i as a module is going to be quasi-isomorphic to this complex. So, this implies that the class of a mod i is really the sum, as somebody pointed out, is really zero because there's an a there minus one to the i of which i and Yes, which is the end of key. Great. Okay. So, uh, okay, so that's that's that's one. So, two is just. Uh, it's just so generically can find S such that this S p dual is L C I. So it's going to be basically a, A model I is going to be a product of field. And by definition, F and K0 is the thing that's built from field. So that's how you prove it. Oh no, this is dual. This is okay. CNOP. No, CNOP is defined as the thing we use in the dual. Yeah, like conventions. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. So three. So if P splits off something, you'll like some A, then by linear algebra, which I of P dual is. wedge i of p dual is equal to wedge i of q dual direct sum, wedge i minus one q dual, with how wedges interact with sums or exact sequences, then things cancel out sum of minus one to the i of wedge i of q dual plus wedge i minus one of q dual, and you just get zero. And you just get zero. All right, so that's that's so you see that CNLP, this lets you begin systematizing the problem of splitting of something because it tells you at least if it's non-zero, then you cannot split. So Murthy's theorem is about the Murthy's conjecture or this current theorem is about the converse of this result. So the conjecture that Murthy made, the full strength of the conjecture is the following. Of the conjecture is the following. Again, A finite type reduced over an algebraically closed field. And n is the dimension of A, which is the rank of P, where P is a projective, highly generated projective module over A. Yeah. Yeah, then the conjecture is that this is the full obstruction. CNOP is equals to zero if and only if P is isomorphic to Q direct sum of A R. So one motivation for this is topology. If you know something about Posnikov Taurus in topology, and you replace P with like, you know, vector bundles and you P with like you know vector bundles, and you replace A with the CW complex of like the same rank or manifold, then you do have the top chain classes are completed. So why not? He has no counter examples anyway. So in his paper where he conjectured this, he proved that you can do this if you eliminate some torsion phenomenon in F and K0. So this is the theorem. Assume that f n k0k has no No n minus one factorial torsion. You've involved it onto a specific torsion, and this torsion has to do with the Friedman-Roch theorem. Yeah, so let me also say that this K0 is really K0 of vector bundles. In other words, this the thing built out from finitely generated projected modules, aka vector bundles, and not G0, which is the thing built out from coherent sheaves. So it's not like the Riemann-Rock theorem that you might have seen with for singular scheme for C-switch. Seen with for singular scheme for seams which are not smooth. If you open a full ten, it's for g0, so it's a little bit different. Then conjecture is true. But it's not such an easy theorem, so I'm not going to say much about it, not going to say anything about it, in fact. But what Murty showed is that this is okay, this obstruction is complete as soon as you're able to dismiss. Complete as soon as you're able to dismiss n minus one factorial torsion. So, naively, I always think topological splitting should be easy, algebraic splitting should be hard. Yes. So is this something about being affine? Is this something about algebraicity is really just a torsion condition? Like, is there some way in which that intuition fits into what's happening here? Yes, that's a very good intuition. So you can imagine that there is a You can imagine that there is a that, you know, if you it's like right, so if you're topologically, if you're algebraically split, then you're topologically split, and you're trying to improve from going from topology to algebraic commentary. For smooth schemes, there's actually a way to make that kind of precise. And this is what unstable motivicometry theory does for you. But I'm not going to talk about that. It's only for smooth schemes anyway. Yeah. But that's like kind of a good intuition. Yeah. Okay. But any other questions? But any other questions? So now this conjecture is a theorem of course, this conjecture works. This is a theorem due to Levine, Krishna, Srinivas, and Krishna. But kind of the way that this theorem is proved is a bit difficult. Among other things, you have to do some kind of moving lemmas, some genericity arguments. But these generic arguments is performed with like this very this non-singular scheme. Sorry, this singular scheme. And then what makes it. And then, like, what makes it difficult? So, I think the break the current, the recent development in prismatic homology and derived DRAM homology and things like this have helped us prove this theorem in a more kind of like homological fashion and reduces it to some managing results in either et al. homology or in prismatic homology. So, I want to, for the next half an hour, and also the next talk is going to be an expository account of how both derived arm comalgent. Both the right DARM Commology and Prismatic Commology can work, and hopefully, it's like a user-friendly account that people who don't use it can use it. But all of this is in service of another cohomology theory called Motivic Cohemology, basically, which I'll tell you about, and also Tess and Arnov will tell you about any other questions? Uh oh, I guess yes. Remind me. So, you also mentioned another conjecture, the torsion freeness. So, then does this conjecture then imply this conjecture? Yes, yeah. So, we now know it's torsion free, so this conjecture is not proof. Yes, exactly. But in some sense, who cares about torsion-free? This is something I might care about, right? Yeah, okay. So, here's the strategy of proving Mercy, of proving projector. Okay. So if F and K0 of A is a cohomology theory, so I'm going to bear with you, this is just some symbols for now. If it's really written like this, where Where the n of A is the complex, and this is just co-module of a complex. Okay, so if it's like really calculated as co-module of some complex, then I can try to do the following maneuver, which seems kind of familiar, maybe. So, this is some kind of dreamy proof. Yeah, so remember, f and k0 is generators and relations in principle. Generators and relations in principle. So K0 is really generators and relations. Fn is like a subgroup, so it's also generous and relations. And the point of writing things like this is that it's very transparent where you can, it's very transparent that it houses obstructions because you can just write this down. If you write it as some other fancy homology theory, then like, what the hell? Like, how do I know that it's related to obstructions? So it's really nice that it came to you as a Jensen relations. Came to you as a genus and relations, but it's not nice because you don't have tools to access it, which is very difficult. So if it was something like this, then we can consider the box team sequence. So you have h to n of a at the end, and you want. N and you want to prove, let's say, that is m torgent free. In fact, maybe you want to prove that is m uniquely divisible. Then there are sandwiches that you can put this sandwich between two things. So it becomes h2n of a with z mod m coefficients, where you take the complex that computes this thing and you just model it by m in the domain. This thing, and you just model by m in the derived way, of course. And then there's a map here called the box theme that goes to h2n plus one of a zn just raises things by one. And same thing here, h2n minus one of a z mod m n boxed in h2n minus one of H2n minus 1 of A Z mod M. All right. So the dreamy strategy to try and prove multi, or even prove a stronger statement, which is turned out to be true, that it's also uniquely divisible, is that this map is surjective and this map is injective. Becomes a question like this. So, in that sense, you can systematize. In that sense, you can systematize this problem into something more cohomological. It's kind of a silly problem, silly strategy, but this is kind of the basic idea, right? You just want to say that if you want to prove M divis, M torsion free, you just have to prove that this map is zero, so that this map is injective, so that it's injective, which is to say that this is subjective. Ah, yes. Right. And, you know, if you're a And, you know, if you have a self-respecting cohomology theory, then you must have some vanishing bounds, the same way that singular cohomology or anything that it does, any cohomology theory you like does. And so this vanishing bound comes from some kind of geometry. But your task would be to prove this kind of vanishing bound. Maybe optimistically, like, let's say this is zero. Well, maybe this is zero or something like this. It's just like, yeah. Yes. Yes. No. But I'm going to tell you what it looks like. But I'm going to tell you what it looks like. So, in a range, it will be etal cohomology. And this is like what Vojvodsky proved for you. And then I'm going to borrow some vanishing results from a talcomology. So it kind of instructs to you how much to some extent this cohomology theory is really dictated by topology. So really, you're going to borrow something from topology. Okay, so is the strategy there, please? All right. And so I'm going. And so I'm going to tell you what motivated pomology is. Yes. Yes. Yes. You need to let's say you are uniquely m divisible. No. If you're uniquely m divisible, then you have no m torsion, right? Yes, I mean. Yeah, yeah. Yes, beautiful. Yeah, that's right. Okay, nice. By the way, I hope this conference is as informal as that. That's like kind of how good math is done, I would say. Okay, all right. So I'm going to tell you motivated homology in the smooth schemes, and I want you to take it as kind of a black box. And if you want to know more details, please ask me questions. Okay. Yeah. So here's the theorem that summarizes basically. Summarizes basically around 50 years worth of mathematics. 1984 was when Block proved his paper. So, how many years, 40 years of mathematics? Yeah. It was Block's birthday this year. He's now 80. The main three principal actors of this result, I would say, is Spencer Block, who came up with the first prototype definition, Mark Levine, who kind of refined some of Block's results, and Verbost. And I refined some of Blob's results and Verbotsky who gave like the definitive definition, modulosum conjectures, which Levian proof. So these are the three people who've done a lot of things for the subject. So let's say K is a field, non-negotiably algebraically close, then there exists complexes, there exists functors of ZJ modes that eats in a smooth case scheme. So we are still in the smooth case into. into dz, dz modules, okay. And j is greater than or equal to zero. Okay. Satisfying the following properties. So I'm going to like go in increasing order of scariness. So weight zero. So you can ask what happens when j is zero. It better be something simple. So zj mode of x is just the complex computing zero. Complex computing zero-ski comology of x is z coefficient. So it's very boring. It's irreducible, then you know, z be zero. Okay, so it gets more exciting when you sweep one. So z1 of modes of x is a complex computing Zoriski cohomology of x with gm coefficients at the shift of minus one. So in other words, h11 is just global unit. Words, H11 is just global units, and H21 would just picot group. And the bra group disappears because I put Zorisky there. Okay, but there will be some relationship to the raw group, which I want to explain later. Yeah, so somehow, right, like when Sid and I first started talking about this conference, possibly, like, so in some sense, motivic homology or K-theory is like some fancy version of the Picard group, some fancy version of GM. So in Motivi Komology, you just extend this in some other direction, but use. Some other direction, but you ignore the brower part, which is what happens when you put an etal here. But the brow thing is what happens when you put an etal there. So it's like it has the same common origin. And any iteration that you might have about a Picard group, it's reasonable to ask, like, does this still hold homotopic homology? That's a very reasonable question. And often that's a very fruitful line of investigation. Three this collection H I mod X Z J so by the way H I X Z J is just the ith homology of the Zj evaluated on X this this forms as I and J varies by a graded ring so ij plus ij and i prime j prime multiplies to i plus i j. i prime j prime multiplies to i plus i prime and j plus j prime the sidebar for the commutative theories the zj mot of x it's a graded e f the algebra all right so uh there's a part of this gradient ring which is uh nice if i take direct sum of i Of I of HI mode of O ZI. Okay, maybe let me just put a field here. Okay, so the grading is preserved if these two numbers are the same, H11, H22, and so on, is generated in degree one with relations in degree. With relations in degree two. So I will say this is the first non-trivial property of material mode. So if you know Milner K-theory, this identifies with the Milner K-ring. So yeah, so this result is due to usnest ranks length and also repo. And also reproved by Bert in his thesis. Yeah, so you don't need to know what Millennium K-theory is. The magical point of Millennium-K-theory is that it's the graded ring which generates a remains in degree one and relations are in degree two. And yeah, so a lot of ways that things project in multi-tick homology is because they're in some line where it's controlled by Millennium K-theory. Line where it's controlled by Milner K-theory. You have a map between two motivic homology groups. You want to say that it surjects. If I can, if you're in a Milner range and you're in degree one, then if you successfully prove that the subjection happens in degree one, then it just propagates. That's the kind of thing that's often very useful. It's not going to happen here, but I'm just saying that's like a common strategy. So that's four. So, five will be the first time you see the relevance to algebraic cycles. So, here's another line which is preserved. H2I mode XZJZI. So now I'm a skin. So this is isomorphic to the direct sum of I of the Chow rings. So So, another magical thing about motivating homology is that it is both arithmetically interesting in the sense that this object is interesting for fields. It varies drastically as the fields vary. But it's also interesting for the geometry because there's not a range where it's just purely algebraic type. So, of course, note that h2 dim x of x z dim x. Is isomorphic to zero cycles on X? So you see the relevance, at least in the smooth case of motivic homology, to this problem. All right. Okay, so so far, all these results were like kind of nice and proved by many, various other people. Well, Block and Levine, I would say. And now here's where Vervotsky won the Fields Medal. Okay, so there's this et al. comparison. So versus et al. comparison. I'm going to phrase it in a way which will provoke questions. And so please ask me questions. Elden, sorry, I'm just behind. Okay, so can we just go to that theorem over there? You said that JX mod is quasi-isomorphic. D0. Weight 0. J0. Yes. Okay. So I'm going to formulate this in a slightly strange way, which I think is like the right time. Yes. Yes. No, of course not. No. Completely irrelevant. It's irrelevant. Yeah, if you just recorded, I shouldn't say things like this, but like, yeah, don't look at it. No, it's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right. So yeah, so this is the first non-trivial result. Well, the first really non-trivial result, I would say. All right. So add. So, XR is a Zariski side of X. It's made up of opens inside X and maps between them. Okay. So, I'm going to talk about a comparison as like, so I'm going to take Zj mode, and I'm going to consider it in the small Zariski side. So, on the one hand, so let's say, so 1 over L is in, oh, X, so X is away from. So X is away from. So I'm away from the characteristic. So Z mod L to the R J mode is equivalent to the following object in the Zariski site. So I'm going to write R gamma et al blank mu L answer J. So this is the complex computing et al homology on X. Homology on X. There is a sense an open U to like the complex community with the et al homology. But I'm going to cut it. This is the smart truncation up to degree J. But I'm going to cut it in the Zariski site. I'm just going to write like this. I'm going to cut it pointwise and then sheppify in some high categorical sense. Correctly sheepify this. I mean, she's complex in some, they're shifting a complex. Complex in some, they're shapefying a complex, they're not shapefying like an abelian grouping. So, to make you feel comfortable, if I plug in a local ring of x, right, then the value of this is literally that, is the truncated eth homology. So, I just taking this thing, I just cut hand side, I cut the model for the Sorry, I always make this kind of mistake. All right. So, Vybotsky tells you that up to a certain chunk, et al. Comology is controlling motivic homology. In particular, you see this result, which is the so-called Benerson Lichtenbaum isomorphism, yes, is isomorphic to Hi eta of X. Of x mu l answer j when i is less than or equal to j. So this is this result should be attributed to Rosen and Wyvotsky. And this is what made them famous. So people see it like this, but this is actually not a usable version. This is fine, but a usable version happens on the level of complexes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, this is the always time it's interesting. You evaluate the right-hand side up to some degree, but it's even better, like the complex itself is calculated by a complex that comes from a tok homology. Okay. All right. So in characteristic B Yes. Yes. The tall style the tall actually tall maps actually. Yeah, are epsilon lower star up to a truncation? Okay, L tensor region. Yeah. Yeah. I just wanted to make it more complete, maybe. At least this side. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. Right? Six. Okay, so seven. Okay, so let's say characteristic of K is P. Right, this d also is characteristic not P, this dual characteristic P. So a similar statement happens. Okay, so this is due to Geyser and Levine, which came before Vybotsky. Okay, Z mod P with R J of X. J of X mode. So I'm still sticking with like working as a risky site. Is L car of tau less than or equals to J of R gamma e tau blank W R omega J log shifted by minus J. So I'll talk about this more in the second lecture, but this should be thought of as the mod key analog. But this should be thought of as the mod key analog, but the characteristic key analog of this mu L of this mu L you know thing. So this is a logarithmic touch with cheese pioneered by Deline by Iluzi in Milk. So, if I don't put a log, then this is the constituent objects in the dramatic complex, but this log part is smaller. I just isolate like the probability specs part. Okay, so there's a parallel. There's like a uniform way to state this theorem. They're both like syntomic homology. So, this is what syntactic homology does. It interpolates these two values. But, yeah, I just want to. But, yeah, I just want to keep it more concrete. So, another thing to appreciate is that, in some sense, multivic homology is obtained by some discrete etal sheaf, like this sheaf of abelian groups. This is a Helio sheaf of abelian groups. This is also a sheaf of abelian groups. And then I do something funny to it and then get motivated. But this origin somehow comes from sheaves of abelian groups in the eta side. Okay, so a couple more. Okay. So, a couple more before I finish up. So, eight. So, this is something that only really happens on smooth varieties. Zj mode X is equivalent to Zj mode. Zj mode of x times a1. Okay, so this is a1 invariance, which was in the smooth setting is like a key property of a typical homology. So this A1 invariance is a flexibility that lets you move cycle in the end. You can like push it around, you can do translations and then change, but you will have to give this up in a singular setting. But we'll quickly learn. But what you But what you do have in a singular setting is the following. So you have a, so you have a map C1 from pick X to H21, which is in fact an isomorphism since it has GM cohomology. And we have a Zj mode of X with a map. With a map, I'm going to leave some room there to Zjmot of X times projective bundle of rank R. Just the pullback map. But you can also do the following, Zj minus one mode of X shifted by minus two, and you direct some C1 cup and then pull back. Then pullback. Oh, C1, sorry, C1 of O1 top pullback. You can do that. And you can do this up to Z J minus R mode of X shifted by minus 2R. And this total map is an isomorphism, but this is the projective bundle form. Yes, so as x gets worse and worse, so right, so in weight one, right, uh so it does okay, so there's a motivic homology for semi-normal schemes for non-singular schemes. In this polar motivic homology, only up to H3 do you have a relation. H3, do you have a relationship with like gm or h4? If you well, there are some color examples in h5 and six and so on. So semi-normality, so there's a swan's theorem. Semi-normal is A1 invariant is the same thing as like semi-normality is the same thing as A1 invariance of pick. So that thing, that theorem also holds. Yeah. And so as you vary the weight, you can ask like, what properties of schemes do you get from like, you know, A1 invariance of X? So Noah and I thought about this. Yeah, that's like an interesting. Yeah, that's like an interesting open line of investigation. But you don't know if paywind invariant applies with this. So, right, so there's a conjecture of no, this is worth seeing. The question is: does A1 invariant? Can you just repeat that? Yes, question that Max asked: Is that A1 invariance? Of motivic homology implies smoothness. So let me answer by a conjecture. So typically homology has something to do with K-theory. So it's basically the E2 page of a spectral sequence conversion to K-theory. So in some sense, the E2 page contains more information than the ET page. I mean, well, not in some sense, that's true. True. So, any conjecture you ask about motivation homology, you should first ask about k-theory, because in some sense that's simpler. So, here's a conjecture due to Vorst, which should be advertised more, I think, is that X be a finite type scheme over a field, reduced, this variety really, then kj of x times a1 is isomorphic. Is isomorphic to KJ AR for all R. AR invariants for R, if and only if X is smooth. So this is known in characteristic zero by Cotinius Hasamayer, which ones Cotinius has a major. Critinius, Essemeyer. I guess Weibel Walker is one. No. Weibo is there? Slick thing? No. Well, selecting. So they wrote a series of papers with like SMI and Weibull governing the thing and many other collabs. Yes, for all Lj. But there's a bound on the J, like the dimension is enough, but this is classic zero. Yeah, known in characteristic zero. So known in characteristic P, if K is perfect by Kurt's strong and Taman. Right? Yeah, so it's a very good question. So, Matthew, as a student investigating a one-invariant typical homology and Vorses conjecture, I think they proved this result in maybe classic zoo or classic P, but when X is one-dimensional, so far, the only result that we have. But that's a great question. Yeah, so Arnapp will mention this, I think, talk about this Vorst thing. So, K-theory, K-3's A1 invariance is really. K3CA1 invariance is really a measure of regularity in some actually precise manner. Okay, so I think I'll leave it there. And then I'll start with drive-dom cohomology and personatic homology and things like that in the next lecture. There are already many questions. You're just making me, this is totally unrelated now. Yeah, great. You know, we don't know how to define all these weirdo singularities and characteristic P. Is there some k-theoretic interpretation of all these complex singularities that we could use to define things in characteristics? That we can use to define things in character CP. In a different conference, this will be our talk. Yes, yeah. Yeah, of course, you should ask me that in private or whatever. All right.
