And let me think for our should see there's going to be a delay on that, so we should get into the camera view.  That in that one's not working yet, doesn't work anyway. Oh, fuck it. Why is this one not work? Uh the element's probably did, but the wiring to change it out is significant kind of undertaking. It wasn't probably this microphone, it was probably this wiring. It was it was like that before we got here. I I I know, but Okay, don't have audio yet, but I'm not sure if that's I think as long as it's end zoom and then the problem is okay restricted to castle. That should be lying, that should oh, there we go. That should just be the mark many test, test, test. Yeah, it's okay.    I don't know if audio through is oh, there we go, I just started. Test, test, test, probably the gating. Okay. Yeah, so Zoom has it. The other machine doesn't have the audio yet. I think it's supposed to parasite off of Zoom, so that's not too big an issue. How can you solve that? I think the new Um I think the new stuff's all working. It clips quite hard in the microphone, so if I don't speak up, it like just vanishes. And if I speak softly at the start, it doesn't pick up you'll pick up somewhere. Let me stick this now. Let me stick this around. That can show you what we're seeing.  Yes? Yep. You're very quiet through the speaker to speak all distance. I'm hearing you from there from the speaker. Do not adjust on the touch pen. I need to adjust this one inside for a game. I want to consistently. I just don't know if I was hearing you through the speakers or through     Uh would you talk, please? Uh we're just adjusting the volume right now to get the layer. Keep talking. That's a little quiet, though. Okay, and this is okay. We need a couple of minutes to make changes in the GSP prime to adjust levels. Just give them a couple of minutes.           First, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first. Yes, yes. Okay, it looks like a number of each body. I would like to see more the search group and actually just call the security of when you're running it clear. And that was a change from the before when it was written. Yeah, okay. So something when you adjust to the audience, then when they give something up different. You want me to try that not talk downstairs? I can hear you testing I can hear you twisting like little beeps and stuff. I can hear that through the wall, so it might just be technical. I can hear it through the wall as well. Do you have me to try taking it upstairs and see if that makes a difference? Of course, we should be able to make it. I'm just looking for the first thing that will come out and sort of guess the thing. That's something we can use.  Your audio is still choppy. I can't make out what you're saying, because we need to be chopping over. I think if I should repo and all that. I think it's not very clear if you wire the trap on the problem, and you close that section that will click Oh, it's a kind of meeting top left right and look at you. What are those options called be like they keep going to one of the right? Yeah. Well, it might just be a very important thing.   Okay, is everybody okay? Yep, I can hear you. Can you hear me? Yeah, it's a little bit possible, but it's definitely matched with their boss. Okay. Okay, what's tennis? Test, tennis, tennis? Yeah, that's not too bad. Uh can you say something? We can uh say a tenant. Uh can you say something like a a sentence? Because I think it's still doing a thing. Yeah, so we are all back. Okay. Well I just have a phone colour again, so I'll try and figure it out. I'll try and figure it out. Chop the other bit.        That's just a multi-step.  Well it's a joke. It's really a question of marketing using strong markets to prevent spreadsheets and   Um do you have to put my features together? Um something's wrong with echo cancelling. I think the microphones are routed to echo cancel or something yeah, something's definitely issue with the uh echo cancelling it's overcompensating it. You have to try turning it off in the direction as well. Try turning it off in Zero, the name Zero has more than a week or two. Uh yes. I don't know where it would be done in Zoom. Probably not through the active thinking.
