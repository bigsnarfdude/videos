Okay, so there's no problem with technology. Okay, so let me first put up the obligatory slide that we all have to have. And it just expresses what we're talking about here. Sectional category of a fibration is talking about the smallest number of open sets, minus one, where you can cover the base. Where you can cover the base and have sections over the cents. If you've gotten this far in this conference and you don't know this yet, then I think there's no hope. So I'm going to go through quickly. So of course, the sectional category specializes in the case of the base path vibration to the Western external category, and it specializes in the case of the vibration from the free path. The fibration from the free pass space to the product x to the r by this map, and this gives us the higher topological complexity of the space x. This can be interpreted as saying that the robot has to make r minus two intermediate stops between the beginning point and the end point. This was introduced by Yuli Rudyak some years ago. Some years ago, and the basic estimate for the higher topological complexity is that so the category of the product x to the r minus 1 is a lower bound for TCR and the category of x to the r is an upper bound for TCR. I think I'm the only one to talk about higher topological complexity, mostly because these things are very, very hard to compute. Very, very hard to compute. So, there are some examples where we know them, and most things we don't know. And so, we make conjectures based on various things that we know. But it's like Donald Rumsfeld's old things, the unknown unknowns are the problem. So, one way to think of a sequence of numbers like higher. Of numbers like higher topological complexities is to globalize the situation. And what I mean by that is make a formal power series, a TC generating function of x, by putting as coefficients the higher T C's. And then you can look at examples of what these things are. Of course, what we would like is something similar to what Yuli Baryshnikov did yesterday. We would like to have Did yesterday. We would like to have a way of computing this TC generating function in terms of some formula. Well, we're not there yet, we're at the beginning of this type of thing. But let me mention that just recently there's been a paper by Kishimoto and Yamaguchi where they actually use the rational version of module TC, higher TC, and they get some results on this TC generating. This TC generating function. But here's something that Michael Farber and I asked in an earlier paper, which spaces have a T C generating function, which is rational, where the polynomial of this form, of this particular form, and the polynomial in the numerator happens to evaluate at one to the category of x. Now, why would we ask such a crazy question? We ask such a crazy question? Who would ever think of that? Well, it's only because we computed some examples. So, for odd spheres, we know what higher TC is, and the generating function has this form. It's X, it's the polynomial. When you plug in one, well, guess what? You get one. So, that satisfies the condition. For even spheres, you get this. And when you plug in one, you get one. So, again, you get the cat. You get one, so again, you get the category. You could even do some things where we know certain results. For example, the higher TCR of Un, the unitary group, is the category, it's the lower bound. So it's the category of UN to the R minus 1. And that's R minus 1 to the N because the category of UN is determined by rational coupling. So we're able to say certain things like this. And when we calculate the generating function, And when we calculate the generating function, we get something of the correct form. If we have a closed symplectic manifold, again, we can compute things. We know what the TCR is, and we compute, and we get the correct formula. And I'll explain this later when we talk about right-angled Artin groups. We get something interesting happening. And again, the generating function is of the correct form, and there's a connection with an underlying graph. So it's combat, and we'll talk about that later. So here's the basic result in thinking about this. It's that the TC generating function is a rational function of the correct form. Now, notice I didn't say the polynomial at 1 is the category. I just say that it has the correct form of a polynomial over 1 minus x squared, if and only if for all r greater than or equal to the degree of the polynomial, you get that the difference in going from TCR to TCR plus 1 is the polynomial evaluated at 1. Now, because this is a base. Now, because this is a basic result, I want to actually go through in the most naive way possible to show you why this thing should be true. There are clever ways with partial fractions. I don't want to do that. So suppose the generating function has that form. Well, then we can multiply the denominator over, and we get the polynomial looks like this when we multiply out 1 minus x. multiply out 1 minus x squared. These are formal power series we just carry through. And look what we have here. We have that eventually this is the coefficient. And so that means that if the polynomial has degree n for all r's bigger than n we get that. So we get some sort of limit on the growth of t Of higher T C's as we go above n so that stabilizes to something. Not only that, but if we get rid of all those higher powers then, if p of x has degree n, then when we plug in 1, you can actually write down what happens, and you see that this is a telescoping series, and we get that px of 1. we get that px of 1 is tcn plus 1 of x minus tcn of x. So this happens at n and for all the higher ones we know that we get the same gap. So this happens throughout all of the higher TCs. The difference between going from TCR to TCR plus one is the same number. And that's what happens when we have a What happens when we have a rational generating function? Of course, the other way works just as well. Suppose that we knew that the gap was always k for a fixed integer k. Well, then you can plug in in the generating function, and you see here at n, you get just a k to go to n plus 1. And then you just keep adding k. Well, you can factor these things out, and you get this expression down here. And just by taking the denominators and playing them across, we get that the polynomial has that form. Of course, when you plug in 1, all these things with factors of 1 minus x go away, and we just end up with k. So that's the idea. So this generating function being this rational function of the type we have is telling us something about the growth. Telling us something about the growth of the higher TCs. And that's nice to know. Let me make one comment before I go to the next, before I click on the next thing. It's long been known that the category of x cross y can be strictly less than the category of x plus the category of y. You could take, for example, You could take, for example, the classic example is taking two Mohr spaces, simply connected Moore spaces in the same degree, say, one with the group being Z mod P, the other with the group being Z mod Q. And when you take their product, then because they have incompatible Z P primes, P and Q, you don't get any mixture in the homology. And so the wedge actually is homotopy. Actually, it is homotopy equivalent to the product. And the wedge is a suspension because each of them are suspensions. So it has category one. So the product has category one, but that's strictly less than the sum of the categories. So that was long known. So it was for a while thought to be a torsion problem because we use Zp and ZQ. Of course, then Norio Wase disproved the Ghana conjecture. proved the Ghana conjecture. The Ghana conjecture said the category of x cross a sphere should be the category of x plus 1. But that's not true. And in fact, yesterday we also saw Sasha talked about certain groups of finite geometrically finite groups and the cohomological dimension of a product of two of them can be strictly less than the Can be strictly less than the sum of the cohomological dimensions. And notice that that did not happen with the same group. Ash proved that cohomological dimension of pi cross pi is two times the cohomological dimension of pi. So here's an interesting example then. This is due to Don Stanley using Hopf invariant techniques. He created a space X. It just has three cells to it. X. It just has three cells to it, and the category is 2, and the category of x cross x is still 2. And the category of x cross y is strictly less than the sum of the categories for any non-contractible y. Well, recently, just this year, Harbor, Kishimoto, and Stanley proved that X has some further properties. The category of any product is R. The higher T C's, higher TC's TCR is just r and when you plug this in you do get a rational generating function it looks like this px over 1 minus x squared but px is that thing and when you plug in one you get one which is not the category of x but it is the cup length of x so that means for some spaces the original question For some spaces, the original question has a negative answer. So, what's going on? What's happening? I mean, it's the question really is, we somehow use this non-additivity of category to induce a failure of the polynomial at one to be category of x. Is something going on here, something deeper? Well, so let's. Well, so let's make a definition. Let's say that x is ls logarithmic if the category of any product is the sum of the categories. Okay? Okay. So of course, this is like a logarithm. That's the name of that. All right. This is an interesting idea. So here's the theorem. If x is ls logarithmic and ls logarithmic and the gap eventually for r greater than n is always a fixed integer k, then k has to be the category of x. So that means px of 1 is category of x. So somehow this logarithmicity of x is telling us that we do get category of x as our gap eventually. Of course, we're still assuming that we have this rational That we have this rational function. That's what this stability of this gap means. Well, the proof is very simple, so let me give it to you. So let's see that k is less than or equal to the category. Well, if I list things, you now begin to see why this logarithmicity is important. Because here we can write down the Because here we can write down the gap. So, these things would have normally been just category of x to the r, but because x is logarithmic, we can write it as r times category of x. And you see that this gap is category. So, we always know that the gap here is category, so that means k minus s r plus 1 plus s r is category. Category. So we get these things. And these things, the SR and the K minus SR are always bounded by category. So we get category of X is equal to this thing here. But category of X and K are fixed numbers. So if K was strictly bigger than category of X, I could subtract the K and I would get a negative number on the left side. And this would tell me SR minus SR plus 1. SR minus SR plus 1 is strictly negative. But what does that mean? That would say that SR is strictly increasing for R greater than or equal to N. And SR is less than or equal to cat X. So that's a contradiction. So we can't have K strictly greater than cat X. We must have it less than or equal to cat X. And similarly, the other way around, if K was less than cat X, we again calculate and we get this formula. Calculate and we get this formula. And then again, we could subtract the cat x, and again, we would get a negative number that's fixed. And we know SR is strictly decreasing, but SR is always greater than equal to zero. So this is a contradiction. So category of X is equal to K. Wow. So that tells us something. If we could have another formula. We could have another formula for this generating function. And if the formula showed that we got a rational function, say, of the form that we had, but the polynomial at one was not cat x, then we have another counterexample to logarithmicity for x, an example similar to Stanley's. So somehow we have this non-conference. We have this non-additivity of category of products to be tied up with the structure of this generating function. So that's the conclusion. All right. Well, there are other things too. If you remember the examples I had, the examples I showed you for the generating function all had this Generating function all had this polynomial being of degree less than or equal to 2. So the question, I suppose, is: is that always true? Well, the answer is no. But the counterexamples that I can think of arise from right-angled Artin groups. So, what I want to do is give a little tutorial on right-angled Artin groups because I think these are things that Are things that you know what? Back in my symplectic geometry days, I used to tell people: look, if you want to see if something is true, everything in the world is true for Tori, go and look at something like mule manifolds, and then you can see. So, I think right-angled artin groups have that to recommend them for things in higher TC as well, because we understand the higher TC for right-angled art. TC for right-angled arts. So let's see, let me remind you what they are. You take a finite simple graph, and for each of the vertices, you make those generators of a group. And for each edge given by Vi Vj, you say, you make Vi and Vj commute in the group. And those are the only relations in the group. And that's called a right-angled Artin group. Group. So here are some properties. Well, what if you have a complete graph? Well, then all the vertices are connected to each other, so they all commute with each other. So that means the right-angled Artin group is just Zn. What if you just have a set of points for your graph and no edges? Well, then nothing commutes, so you get a free group on n. So, you get a free group on n generators. And you can even generalize that to say, what if I have a disjoint union of two graphs? Well, then nothing commutes from the first group with the second group, so you get a free product of the groups. And I have this thing here. If I take the graph join of two graphs, Of two graphs, then it is a graph join. A graph is a graph join if and only if the group that you get is a product of groups. Let me remind you what the graph join is. You just take one graph and the other graph, and you join all the vertices of the first graph to all the vertices of the second graph. So, for example, if I take these two graphs, just the two points A, C, points AC and the two points B D and then I take the graph join I get a square and the two points AC gave me a free group with two generators and the B D also gave me a free group with two generators so what I have for the right angled Artin group of the graph join is a product of the two free groups okay I have to tell you one I have to tell you one other thing. Any right-angled Artin group has a finite KH1. The cohomological dimension, which is the same as the category and the dimension, is just the size of a maximal clique in game. I use this word clique, I guess I've been, it just means the largest complete subgraph, induced subgraph in. subgraph in gamma and this is found this way the way you construct such a kh1 is to form a polyhedral product so the base are circles and you take the simplicial complex to be the flag complex on the graph and so you're attaching different products of circles Different products of circles. For example, let me begin by saying for each vertex in the graph, you take a circle. And then if a vertex, and so you actually get a wedge of circles, you take a wedge of circles. And then for each edge, you get two commuting vertices. You take a product, S1 cross S1, and you attach it to those two circles in the wedge. And you keep taking products of all these commuting things. Commuting things. And the biggest clique is a bunch of vertices which all commute with each other. And that gives you this simplex, and that's the highest torus that you end up putting in this construction of the KH1. And so that's why you get the dimension being the size of this maximal peak. Okay. Okay, by the way, since I've just told you this, how about the KH1s? So let's just talk about it as the right-angled Artin groups. Are the right-angled Artin groups LS logarithmic? Can you see? What do you think? Well, what did we know? We knew that if I take a product of two right-angled Artin groups, what does that correspond to? Art and groups, what does that correspond to? It corresponds to a graph join of the underlying graphs. But how do I get a maximal clique in the graph join? Well, I'm just talking about the same thing, of course. I'm taking the graph join of gamma with itself. Well, the way you get a maximal clique is to take the maximal clique of gamma and the maximal clique of the other copy of gamma, and you join them all by edges. That's in the graph join. That's in the graph join. So that becomes a maximal clique of twice the size that you had before. So that means that the category of H cross H is the same as twice the category H. So this is a, for right-angled Artin groups, this is an easy way to see this type of thing when we have this combinant parts. Here's something that's a little unusual. There's a construction in right-angled Construction in right-angled Artin groups called the double of the graph. What that is, is this: you take a vertex V and you take the star around V. That's the induced subgraph of gamma containing V and all the vertices connected to V by an edge. And then you identify two copies of gamma along that star. So the example here that's kind of a trivial one is to just take V, a vertex, and two. Vertex and two other disjoint two clique. And then the star of V is just V itself. And so when you take another copy and join it, that's what you get on the right. This is the double. Now, why do I care about this? Well, here's an interesting theorem from right-angled Arten group theory. It's due to Kim and Coberta. And it says that there's actually an inclusion of right-angled Arten. Inclusion of right-angled Artin groups from the right-angled Artin group of the double into the right-angled Artin group of the original graph. But what does that mean in terms of spaces? That means we actually have a covering space corresponding to the double. Okay, so let's keep that in mind. I'll remind you later. So let's talk about topological complexities of right-angle groups. So if I have a graph, I want to define the number Zr to be the maximal total cardinality of our cliques, which have empty total intersection. So for example, if I just I'm looking at Z2, then I'm just looking at disjoint in the graph, two of them. In the graph, two of them, just two disjoint cliques. But for higher ones, it's not pairwise disjointness, it's just empty total intersection. And here's the theorem. Higher Tcs of the right-angled Artin group, again, meaning the higher TCs of this group are exactly Zr. And this was a result that was originally proved. Was a result that was originally proved by Dan Cohen and Pruiza for r equals two. And then Mark and Greg and I did a generalization of the lower bound. And then Pandalos, Griez, Juzhinski did more general polyhedral products. And then Michael and I used the equivariant approach to TC. We also get the lower bound. And I guess it would. In an easier way, in the eye of the beholder, what is easy, but in my eyes, it was easy. So, the upper bond is determined by an explicit motion plan. Okay, well, that tells us everything we want to know. We can derive lots of things from this particular characterization. In particular, if you have a right-angled Artin group, then any of the higher Group, then any of the higher TCs, when you're above the number of vertices in the graph, just look like TCR is equal to TCR minus 1 plus the cohomological dimension of the right-angled Artin group. Remember, that's the same as the dimension of the k pi 1, the smallest dimension, homotopy dimension, and that's the same as the largest clique in the graph. Clique in the graph. And of course, what about the TC generating function? It has exactly the right form that we want because of the stability property that we just said. The difference in higher TCs is always just the category, the cohomological dimension, the size of the maximal cleave, whichever you prefer. So this was actually. So, this was actually the first thing that led us to this whole idea of looking at the TC generating function. And you can compute these for various things. So if you have a free group, you get that. If you have a complete graph, then of course H is Zn, and we get the same thing we would get for a torus. And that's our generating function. Again, you notice. Again, you notice that when I plug in or the polynomial has degree less than or equal to two on top of both of these examples. Okay. Look at this example. So there's our graph. So it's made up of a bunch of three cliques. What is the topological complexity? What is the topological complexity then? Well, you look there, you can't use any two three cliques. You need two cliques, but the three cliques all intersect. So if I take C1, the only thing I can really use is this edge over here, or this edge. But I need a clique. So that means that Z2 is 5. Well, what about Z3? Well, remember, all we need is the total intersection to be empty. So here I could take C1, C2, and C3 because the total intersection is empty, even though the pairwise intersections are just. So we get Z3 is 9. So you notice going from Z2 to Z3, we actually Z2 to Z3, we actually went above the maximal clique. So it's not always true that we just go up by the category or the maximal clique. But for larger ones, we do get this, and we get Zr is just 3r. And if you calculate, the generating function looks like that. And of course, what do we see? We see that the polynomial has degree 3. So we can have... Degree three. So we can have things with the polynomial evaluated at one, or polynomial being of higher degree. In fact, there's a whole infinite family of these. I'll describe the process. What did we do with the other, with the three cliques? We had a central three clique, and each two clique, each edge, we attached one extra vertex and made a new three clique out to the sides. out to the sides. And we do the same thing here. We have a central Kn, a central complete graph. And if we take n minus 1 vertices, we can add a new vertex to the outside and get kn which intersects the central one in n minus 1 points. And we do that for all the sets of n minus 1 vertices. There are n of them. So we get n complete. N complete graphs hanging on to the central one. And this is now a graph with right-angled Artin group we call Hn. And you can show, in fact, that the TC generating function has the right form, and the degree of this thing is n. So you can calculate all the higher TCs. I'll leave that for you. It's a good exercise. It's a good exercise, I think. But these right-angled artin groups have other things to offer. You can see from what we did before that the difference in the TCs is always greater than or equal to this cohomological dimension. Remember, for Z2 to Z3, we had to go up by four instead of three for the three-clique example. You can ask for which spaces is it true that this always happens? That this always happens? Well, it's kind of an innocuous question. And in fact, there's sort of a tautological result here. If that inequality holds for a topological group, then the group is LS logarithmic. You get category of G R equals R times category of G. I don't think there's any reason why this has to follow for groups. It could be just as bad as Stanley's example. I don't know. And in fact, you'll see this doesn't matter just for. In fact, you'll see this doesn't matter just for groups. It's just that the Tc should be obtained by the lower bound. So the proof is very simple. It's trivial. We have TCR plus 1 is the category of GR. We know that because it's a group. And that's by the product inequality for category, that's less than or equal to the category of GR minus 1 plus category of T. But that's Tc of R plus. that's Tc of R plus category of G and if this other inequality holds then we actually get equalities everywhere and if we get equalities everywhere then we get that the product inequality is an equality and by induction then we get G is logarithmic so and again this works as I say when anytime your TCR is realized by the lower bound so Bound. So, what a strange thing again that these inequalities for TC and how the growth of the higher TCs has something to do with whether or not category is additive for these spaces. Here's some quick uses for RAA groups. You know, Yuli Rudjak, and yesterday Sasha mentioned also that Dan Cohn did this. I assume it was in his work on right-angled argument groups. I don't know. On right-angled arguments, I don't know. But Yuli Rudyak wrote a paper where he took this example for X and he showed that Tc of X is K plus L and category of X is K. And he was showing that topological complexity could lie anywhere between the lower bound and the upper bound, 2K. But for Artin groups, we can see this pretty easily. So for higher TC, the same thing works. And why is it true? Well, you see, the group we're talking about Well, you see, the group we're talking about is ZK star ZL, the free product, but that's a right-angled Artin group. And how do you get it? You take a K clique and a disjoint L clique. So remember, we're trying to find for TCS, say, the S cliques which give me the maximal number of total vertices. And they have to have empty total intersection. So, what do we do? So, what do we do? We take s minus one of the k cliques if k is bigger than equal to l, and just one of the l cliques. That's the biggest we can get. So, that's very easy. Notice the second thing, the category of x to the s minus 1 is s minus 1 times k. Well, now you know why that's true. Why are right-angled artin groups logarithmic? It's because of the graph join construction. All right, remember this example I showed you before about this double? And remember the theorem that there's a covering space corresponding to the group of the double. Well, so what's the T C's? What are the T C's involved here? Well, the groups are just Z star Z2. That's the group of gamma over here. And the other one is Z2 star Z star Z2. And we can calculate what these And we can calculate what these things are. Well, the Tc of this group corresponding to this graph, we get two cliques, namely this clique and this clique, and we add up to three. And then from that point on, we can always just add the two clique, the maximal one, because we have a total empty intersection. For this one, we can take two cliques, and then we just keep adding one of the two cliques over and over. So for this one, we get three and four, and then we add the two cliques. Then we add the two cliques. So this is 2r minus 1. This is 2r. What is this? This is Sasha's example, the first example of a covering space that had higher TC than the original space. But we don't need monoidal TC or any other of the arguments. We just see this directly from knowing something about right-angled artin groups. This is one reason I say these things are good to know about. And of course, And of course, the categories don't change. We can't have that because we know the category of a covering space is always less than or equal to the category of the base space. And that doesn't happen here because that's given by the cleats. In fact, there's even a theorem, and the theorem has two parts. Let me look at the second part and say. Second part says, what prevents me from taking two cliques and getting Taking two cliques and getting Tc to be the sum of the two cliques. Well, they might have an intersection. But suppose you have two cliques which actually add up in the number of vertices greater than the Tc of the right-angled Artin group, but they intersect somewhere. But if the intersection is outside the star of V, then when I take the double, what happens? I get the second copy of the graph gamma and graph gamma and if I had c1 here I've got a c2 prime up here that doesn't intersect c1 and that means I can use them to add up and when I add them up then I get this quantity here and that tells me the Tc of the double is greater than Tc of the base space and this is the an example where you can do this V is up here V is up here. The star is this five clique. PC of this thing uses the five clique and a two clique down here to be seven. You'd like to have this four clique C1 and this four clique C2 add up, but they don't. But in the double, you can add them because they only intersect in U and that's outside the star of V. So again, we have this whole bunch of examples now where covering spaces have higher. Where covering spaces have higher TC than the original space. And I'm going to give an exercise to you. Write this down quickly and go compute the TCs. And I'm going to go quickly. So I have a couple minutes left. So I just want to tell you some further consequences of having LS logarithmicity. You know, at this point in the talk, I'll try not to say that word again because my lips. Word again because my lips won't get around it. So, for a polyhedral product, we can say some things. This is the definition, remember. I'm really only interested where the AIs are a point. So, what we're really doing is taking a simplicial complex with m vertices, and we're taking the simplices and then taking subproducts of x to the m, which correspond to the simplices in this way. So, just take this to be a Way. So just take this to be a point. This is the general definition. And if all the x i's are x, I'll denote this by x k with no extra adornment. But if x i's differ, then the polyhedral product look like that. And my old friends, Y. Félix and Daniel Tenray proved that if x is logarithmic, then the category of this Then the category of this polyhedral product, notice the same space x, is just 1 plus the dimension of k times cat x. And let me say that sigma is a simplex of maximum dimension, so it gives you the dimension of k, the number of vertices is exactly this one plus dimension of k. And I want to write it like this because later I'm going to give you a result which mimics this a bit. Okay. So we would like to know something about Tc of these things. First of all, let me just say if I have a collection of spaces and this condition holds, I'm not sure what to call that. I suppose we could call it something like generalized LS logarithmicity with respect to a set of spaces. Oh my God. I think that's pretty horrible. So you So, you might want to think about a name for that condition, but it's just saying that category is additive for this set of spaces. Then we can actually prove that a similar thing to what Félix and Ton Ray proved, that it's the maximum of the sum of the categories overall maximal simplicities. And there's a TC version, a lower bound at least. If again we have this activity, then the Tc of the polyhedral product is less than or equal to the maximum of categories. Again, for maximal simplicities. Again, these results are proved using open set techniques, which go back to the 50s, I think to at least to Austrand, maybe back to Comova. Maybe back to Komolda. I don't know. Sasha has used these, and I've used these with Jeff Strom, and then in a paper called an upper bound for topological complexity with Mark and Greg and Michael. So these things come in handy, and these are proved this way. And in fact, you can get a generalization of a result in Gonzalez, Gutierrez, and Jusvinsky if you have. If you have what you might call Tc logarithmicity or something like that, so additivity for Tc, and if Tc is a maximum for each space, and category is also satisfies this additivity, then you can find the Tc of the polyhedral product exactly to be the maximum of the sum of the Tcs. The conditions that are in their paper are exactly conditions which give you these results. Give you these results. So the proof is different, of course. The proof is again by these open set techniques. And again, if you have just the very same space X, then you want the T C to be the maximum and it should be L S and T C logarithmic. And then you get something similar to the Félix-Tonre result for Tc. Oh boy. Oh boy. Okay, here's the final theorem. This is what I want to prove. I want to give a lower bound here because I want to advertise the theorem of Mark and Greg and myself. So for right-angled Artin groups, we were looking for cliques which had empty total intersection, and then we could get a lower bound by the sum of the vertices. Here, I can't quite do that, but I can't quite do that, but I would like to. So, if someone can do this, that would be tremendous. But if I have a situation where I have R simplicities where at least two of the simplest C's are pairwise disjoint, then I get this lower bound. Let me show you how this works. So, I take sigma 1 and sigma 2 to have empty intersection, and I project from the polyhedral product to x to the sigma 1. It's well known. Sigma 1. It's well known this is a re, x sigma 1 is a retract. So this projection, this vibration, actually has a homotopy section or a section even back from x sigma 1 to xk. But Mark and Greg and I proved a theorem that says that if you have fibration with section, then the category of the base cross the fiber cross the total space to the r minus 2 is less than or equal to t. 2 is less than or equal to TCR of the total space. So in this case, it works out that this is what I have. The base space is that. I get this homotopy fiber. I get this total space. And I get TCR of this. Well, that's great. Now, how does my condition that sigma 1 and sigma 2 don't have any intersection? Well, I take the inclusion of x sigma 2 into xk. 2 into xk. And then I have the projection P2 from XK to X sigma 2. But if I take the composition P1 I2, that's a point since sigma 1 and sigma 2 are empty. The intersection is empty. So I2 actually factors through the fiber. And then composing with the map the inclusion of the fiber into XK and then the projection, I get that X sigma 2 is a retract of the fiber. But it's also But it's also the case if I take all the x sigma 3 to sigma r, it's a retract of the total space to the r minus second. So we actually have a retract of all these things of this. But that means that the category of this is less than or equal to this. And so we lower bound here. But now we can use our logarithmicity condition. These are just all subproducts. So we have the category of all these is just the sum of all these. These is just the sum of all the categories, and that's the number of vertices in the each simplex sum at times the category of X. And therefore, we're done. The end. Notice I don't thank anybody. I just say the end. Thank you. Well, I will. Thank you very much, John. This is great. This is fantastic. Let's go to the questions. To the questions. Are there any questions? Okay? It's not said that complexity of circle is one and very complexity is two. So we have some agreement. Do we use normalization? Yeah, I can't quite hear you, Yuli, so someone else might have to. So, someone else might have to rephrase your question. So, I can't quite hear. Me neither. But since we don't have agreement, at least now, might it just make sense for Susa to say what do you start to say? Historization do you use? I don't know. It's very hard to. It's very hard to understand what you're saying because your sound is not working very good. Maybe you want to write down your question? Maybe in the chat later or something, we can talk and maybe we can get it across. We're limited by our technology. I just say about organization. What is TC of circle? One or two? Of circle one or two. Oh, oh, I see. Uh, the PC of the circle is one. I know, I know, but oh, I just wanted my convention again. Oh, you mean trying to relate it to right-angled artin groups? Maybe that's what, uh, so remember, a right-angled artin group is a polyhedral product. Polyhedral product. So it's S1 to the K. So the category of S1 is 1, so that means that here we're looking at just the sum of the number of vertices in a simplex, but that's really the number of points in a clique. So this result is really the exact same result for right-angled Artin groups as what we had. Maybe that's it. I don't know. That's my guess. Okay, Mark, I think you have a question. Yeah. Hi, John. Hi, Mark. How are you? Good. Thanks for the talk. It's good to see you. Good to see you. So suppose you wanted to create a space X for which the growth of the higher T C's does not eventually become constant. So if I understood, can you take these H? If I understood, can you take these h n and take sort of some limit as n goes to infinity? Well, and get some infinite dimensional thing. But how will that help me if I, you know, I mean, I'm just a poor finite type of guy. You know, I want to stay in the world of finite complexes if I can. I don't know. I don't know. Do you conjecture that for a finite complex, you always get that the generating function is polynomial over 1 minus x squared? Well, we don't know that. I mean, that would be nice to prove. It's hard to believe, isn't it? But did you try hard to find a finite complex for which the difference doesn't eventually stabilize? No, I have not tried hard to do that. So that would be a good problem. I would like to see that. I would like to see that. Okay, thanks. If you can construct a high-dimensional space as a possible counterexample, then you run into the possibility that the numbers, the TCRs, are actually also infinite. Well, I don't know about that. I mean, as long as I have a finite space, As I have a finite space where the category is finite, I know TCRs will be finite. But determine the TCR. See, that's why I say this generating function, we're still in the beginning stages of this. I mean, what we need is a way to calculate the generating function in terms of other quantities. Some formula similar to what Yuli did yesterday. And if we have that, And if we have that, then we might be able to understand the generating function without understanding all the individual TCRs. I mean, that seems a hard thing in most cases to determine what those are. Alex, I think you have a question. I think he was interpreting projects. He was interpreting Ryjak's question. Oh, okay, okay. Well, okay, I have a comment, maybe. Are there any more questions? I would like to bring to your attention that, well, if you want to understand this TC generating function, This TC generating function.
