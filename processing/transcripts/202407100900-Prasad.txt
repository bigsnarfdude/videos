Uh I can begin. Yes, please. Uh, thank you, Monica. Uh, thank you, the organizers, for inviting me to this conference. I was very much hoping to be there, but then coming from India, it looked like much too long a trip. And eventually, I had a cold feet and I decided not to travel. Decided not to travel. I think even if I went to USA or to Toronto or Montreal, it would have been still a long way to reach to the conference venue. So I am missing all the fun in the conference, which is to be with the participants. All right, so I will share my slides. Great visible, yes. All right, so the theme of the conference is on branching lodge. My lecture is very much in that theme, in which I want to talk about a slightly more general question, one might say. Instead of looking at the branching laws, one wants to understand how a representation of a group restricts to a subgroup. To a subgroup. So, branching laws for complex representations of groups describe how a representation of a group decomposes when restricted to a subgroup, which in the case of compact groups is a direct sum of erudible representations. So, in this case, the branching log, if you have understood, then they Understood, then they tell you everything about how a representation restricts to H. When dealing with infinite-dimensional representations of a real or PRD group G restricted to a subgroup H, the branching laws describe irreducible representations of H which arise as a cosine representation. It is not clear if this allows one to describe how an irreducible representation. How an irreducible representation of G restricted to H looks like. For example, the irresponsible representation of H might appear as a sub-quosiant of the representation of G in many ways. And if one is looking at only quotient representations, then you don't see the sub-quosiants in that point of view. So this is Is always a question when dealing with decomposition, which is not a completely reducible decomposition. This lecture is an attempt to discuss this question. The more precise details will come along. Most of the lecture will deal only with PRD groups, though many of the notions and questions along the way will make Along the way, it will make good sense for real groups too. So I would say that there has been some or much progress on PRD groups, but corresponding questions have not been as much investigated for real groups. So I begin with some review of the GGP. GGP context and what are the main statements for GGP and then slowly go on to you know what I like to say homological analog of the GGP questions. So I believe this is the most important theorem which allows the subject to begin and then And then go further. So, the first important result about branching loss considered by GGP is the multiplicity one property, save for the pair SON plus 1 SONF, in which case it says that this multiplicity, which is dimension of the home spaces, is less than or equal to 1 for irreducible representations pi 1 and pi 2 of the orthogonal groups. This result is due to Eisenbert, Burevich, Steve Rales, and Schiffman in the non-Archmedian case, and by Binyong Son and Chengboju in the Archmedian case. I am happy that Deema Gurevich is there, and Chengboju is there in the conference. I mean, one might think that this should have been a very classical result, but I certainly heard Ralis say that. Certainly, I heard Ralis say that it was one of the questions he struggled with for many years. It may be mentioned that before the full multiplicity one theorem was proved, even finite dimensionality of the multiplicity spaces was not known, which were later answered in greater generality in the works of Sakharades and Venkates. For infinite dimensional representation, which is what we are mostly dealing with, there is also Dealing with, there is also the possibility that this multiplicity could be identically zero for certain pi. You know, one needs to prove that this multiplicity is a meaningful object. It is finite and not zero, not identically zero. Okay. With the multiplicity, one theorems proven, one then goes on to. One then goes on to prove a more precise description of the set of irritable admissible representations of SON plus 1 and of SON such that this home space is non-zero. So this is an intricate recipe involving the Langlands parameter and the epsilon factors and so on, which we will not get into. Which we will not get into. I think the aim of today's lecture is not so much to talk about GGP, but to talk about the restriction problem and not the branching problem. Precise theorems about the homes passage have become available in a series of papers due to Wasperje and then due to Mugla-Wospaje for non-Armedian. Non-Armedian orthogonal groups. These were followed by a series of papers by Bujar Plassey for unitary groups, both real and periodics. The case of real unitary groups getting settled by works of Buja Plassey, Hong Yu Ha, and Hangzhou. So I think many people contributed to the GGP conjectures for the real. GGP conjectures for the real unitary groups. Perhaps they were not building on each other, but it's possible that they proved independent theorems and eventually the full case, full GGP conjecture for unitary groups, real unitary groups was settled. All these works are for tempered representation and more generally. And more generally, representations which belong to generic L packets. Then there are works due to Cheng Chen and Jilin Luo in the Archmedian case for orthogonal groups, as well as there are works due to Kobayashi and Spei who are here. Okay, so as I said, the As I said, the point of my lecture is not so much to talk about the GGP conjectures per se, but to discuss some further developments, some of which has happened in the recent past. And I believe there are many more questions to be understood. And it looks like it's still a developing field. So, given the interest in the homicid. So, given the interest in the home spaces, it is natural to consider the related X spaces. And in fact, homological algebra methods suggest that the simplest answers are not for these individual spaces, but for the alternating sum of their dimensions. These hopefully more manageable objects, certainly more flexible, when coupled with vanishing of higher X when our. Vanishing of higher X when available may give theorems about the home spaces. We must add that before we can define the Euler-Poincar√© pairing, one needs to prove that X spaces are finite dimensional when pi 1 and pi 2 are of finite length. Further, one needs to prove that these X spaces are zero for I large. are zero for I large. So luckily vanishing of higher X groups is a well-known generality. For reductive periodic groups G considered here it is known that X i is zero for any two smooth representations pi and pi prime of G when I is greater than the split rank of the group. This is a standard application of the projective resolution of the trivial Resolution of the trivial representation of the constants of G provided by the Browetics building of G. So, vanishing is not a problem. Finite dimensionality takes some effort. So, for the proof of the finite dimensionality of the X groups, we note that unlike the Home spaces, where we will have no idea how to prove the finite dimensionality of the Home space if both are cuspic. The home space if both are cuspidal, because you know, cuspidal representations are a bit of a black box, one doesn't know the internal structure. But for questions about X spaces, exactly this can be handled a priori for I greater than zero, as almost by the very definition of cuspital representations, they are both projected. They are both projective and injective objects in the category of smooth representations. And projective objects remain projective on restriction to a closed subgroup. So somehow if one wanted to prove finite dimensionality of the X spaces for caspital representation, there is no issue. And therefore, one needs to deal with principal series. And then one can start to apply. You start to apply the usual methods of PRD groups. So, finite dimensionality of X when both the representations are full principal series representations is achieved by an inductive argument both on N, that SON, and on the split rank of the levy from which the principal series arises. The resulting analysis needs the notion of Bessel models, which is also a restriction problem involving a subgroup which has been Involving a subgroup which has both reductive and unipotent parts. However, so you know, this is the approach which I took and it certainly succeeded in my cases of these classical groups for GGP. However, there is a much more general finiteness theorem for X groups for spherical. For spherical varieties due to Eisenberg and Ethan Sayag. The approach via Bessel models, which intervenes when one analyzes the principal series representation of SON to SO restricted to SONF, has as a bonus explicit answers about Euler-Poincari characteristic, at least in some cases. So the explicit The explicit nature of analysis has its own utility besides proving finite dimensionality, but the finite dimensionality can be proved more generally. Okay, so in the work of Atan Sayag and Aijan Bud, sorry there is a There is this definition, which is quite nice: that of a locally finitely generated representation. Locally finitely generated representation. Suppose G is a periodic group, pi is a smooth representation of G, then pi is said to be locally finitely generated representation of G or also just. G or also just locally fine, locally finite representation if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions. For each compact open subgroup K of G, you look at the K fixed points of pi. This is a module for the Heke algebra and this representation pi K as a module for the Hecke algebra should be finitely generated for each K. The other equation. The other equivalent definition is that for each caspital datum m, rho, where m is a levy subgroup and rho is a caspital representation of m, pi m rho, by which we denote the corresponding component of pi in the Bernstein decomposition of the category of smooth representations of G is a finitely generated G module. So, you know, I might recall that. So, you know, I might recall that according to Bernstein, any smooth representation can be written as a direct sum of representations belonging to different blocks in the category. And this locally finitely generated means that the projection of the representation to each block is finitely generated. So I think my alignments don't seem to be ideal. Are you able to use? Yeah, yeah, beautiful. Yeah, this is better. So, although the following theorem could be proved by other means for the restriction. Proved by other means for the restriction of a representation of the classical groups for simplicity of notation and perhaps simplicity also of certain proofs. I state things for the restriction problem from GLN plus 1 to GLN. So the following theorem could be proved using Bernstein-Jelvinsky filtration and locally finite generation. And locally finite generation of the Gelfand-Grave representation due to Bushnell-Henyard. The generality of the theorem below due to Ayanbert-Sayag is quite noteworthy. It says that any rootsable admissible representation of GLN plus 1, when you restrict to GLNF, it is locally finite in the definition that I just gave. So this is. So, this is a finiteness theorem, but it is locally a finiteness theorem. And there is a more general version which we need not worry about. Okay, so as a consequence of this theorem due to Eisenberg and Sayag, the restriction of inverse representation is finitely generated in any Bungstein component. Hence, pi restricted to G L and F has not. Restricted to GL and F has non-zero erosible quotients by generalities because you know it is like the usual algebra that one learns such theorem that if a module is finitely generated then it has a rootsable quotient that's a generality a statement which we said earlier we did not know how to prove for a general restriction problem so finite So, finite generation implies that there are plenty of quotes. The following query is an easy consequence of standard homological algebra, where we also use the fact that if a module is finitely generated over a Noetherian ring, then it has a resolution by finitely generated projective modules. And the corollary is what I asserted earlier: that for a Eurasical representation of GLN plus one and one. Of G Ln plus 1 and 1 of G Ln. The X groups are finite-dimensional, and zero beyond the split rank is a generality. Good. Okay. Okay, so now I want to discuss a few specific results about GLN plus one. I think I think, in a certain rough sense, the picture for classical groups is much more complicated, but the basic case of GLN is what eventually goes into the proof. And these theorems have a certain simplicity to them. So, this is a well-known result about About branching loss for GLN plus 1, that given an Erodspose generic representation of GLN plus 1 and an Erosible generic representation of GLN, one knew that the dimension of the homicide is less than or equal to one dimension, but one, in fact, in case when both the representations are generic, the dimension of the home space is exactly one. So then there is the So, then there is the following theorem, which can be considered as the Euler-Poincar√© version of the above theorem. And the point of the next theorem about Euler-Poincar√© is that it is much more flexible than this theorem. And also the fact that it is, in fact, proved much more easily. Okay, so here is the theorem for an, so this is not necessarily reducible for any admissible. For any admissible representation of finite length for G Ln plus 1 and of G Ln, then the X spaces of high-dimensional vector spaces over C and the Euler Poincar√© is the product of the dimension of the Vitakar spaces for pi 1 and for pi 2. So the representations pi 1 and pi 2 need not be generic. If one of them is not generic, then the product is zero and then the Euler Poincar√© will be zero. Poincare will be zero. So, here is a curious corollary of this theorem. It says that if pi 1 and pi 2 are irreducible, then the only value taken by Eiler-Poincar√© is either 0 or 1. Because of the uniqueness of the Vittakar model, each of these terms is less than or equal to 1, and therefore the product is 0 or 1. So, Eiler Poincar√© is So, Eiler Pancare has only two options. Okay, using the Bernstein-Jelminski filtration and a form of Robenius reciprocity for X-groups, the previous theorem about Euler-Poincare eventually follows from the following EG lemma. And the lemma says that if B and W are any two finite length representations of a given GLD, then if D is positive, then Eila-Pancar is zero. Then Euler-Poincar√© is zero. And if D is zero, when the group is trivial, then of course the Euler-Poincar√© is dimension V times dimension W. So you can imagine that the proof of the previous theorem is some filtration and Euler-Pancare is additive in a filtration, and most of the terms are zero because of this lemma. This lemma, and then there is a one term which contributes this. Okay. Okay. So once again, maybe some alignment issue for me. Okay, so the following result conjectured by The same result conjectured by me some years ago was recently proved by Chen and Sawin for the general linear groups. And very recently, Rui Chen has proved it for all classical groups. This vanishing is at the root of why the simple and general result about Euler-Poincar√© translates into a simple result about home spaces or generic representations. So So, yeah, so here is the theorem due to China and Savin for irritable generic representation of GLN plus one and pi two of G Ln, all the higher x are zero. And this is also the case for classical groups, unitary groups or orthogonal groups. Or orthogonal groups, all the higher x are zero. So, you know, the previous theorem due to Chan, Savin, and Ryu Chen is about vanishing of higher X. But combined with the theorem about Euler. With the theorem about Eiler-Poincare, this vanishing of the theorem about Euler-Poincar√© could also be used to prove that certain x are non-zero. So here is argument for that. It's nice to see this argument. One knows that there are erosible generic representations of GL3, which have the trivial representation of GL2. The trivial representation of GL2F as a quotient. You know, this is what is called the distinction problem, and there are certainly, yeah, so for GL3F, there are generic representations which are distinguished by GL2. Similarly, there are irreducible non-generic representations of GL3, which have irreducible generic representations of GL2F as a cosant. For such pair, pi1, pi2, For such pair pi1, pi2 of representations, it follows from theorem 3 on Euler-Poincare that the Euler-Poincare must be zero because the Euler-Poincare is product of the dimension of the Vitakari spaces. And if one of them is not generic, that term is zero and therefore the product is zero. But Haume space is non-zero. And therefore, for such pairs of irreducible representations, we must. Representations, we must have that the x must be non-zero for some degree, in fact, for some odd degree. Okay, so here is a summary of the branching problem for the GLN case. I wish there was a way to maybe this. Maybe this is better. Yeah, so let pi1 be an eruptible admissible representation of gln plus one pi two of gln. Then we know that if both are generic, then the homispace is one-dimensional. If both are generic, then x spaces are higher x are zero. If both pi one and pi two are parabolically induced from unitary space modules of Levy subway. space modules of levy subgroups uh these are representations of the these representations are called representations of the arthritis these are irreducible unitary representations which are products of space modules on discrete series then there is a precise recipe due to ggp of relevance there is this word relevance Which is a necessary and sufficient condition when pi1 have a non-trivial harm. So, this has been proved by Chan and by Gurevich in the non-Archmedian case, but these questions make full sense for real groups, but they have not been considered as far as. Been considered as far as I know, and the classical group case is open for both Archimedean and non-Archimedean cases. Perhaps the work of Kobayashi and SPEI for orthogonal group deals with some of the representations of the SPEY kind for classical groups called AQ lambdas, but I have. But I have not had occasion to either talk to them or to look at their works to see how their work relates to this notion of relevance. Okay, so okay, so you know, I mean, just to back up, if both the representations are generic, then one knows the home space age and the X space edge. The X spaces. These ones in number three is dealing with non-generic representations typically. And one has a good understanding of homispaces. These are the representations which are of interest globally. And for them, there is a precise question which has been completed for GLN, not for other clients. Not for other classical groups, but it is open for reals. On the other hand, in number four, I am saying that if pi1 and pi2 are arbitrary pair of Erodsburg representations, then there is a recipe due to ky chan for when the home space is non-zero. But at the moment, the recipe is not so easy to interpret or to use. So, although the GLN case is the simplest of all. Case is the simplest of all groups. The branching lodge are not fully understood, one would say. And then the corresponding next questions: So, even when pi one and pi two are products of spay modules on discrete CV. Products of spay modules on discrete series, there is no understanding at the moment of when x are non-zero. So, this relevance condition is not a right one for x non-vanishing. So, there is some work to be done. Okay, so now this was the review of, so to say, older material, and I want to now talk about something new. I want to now talk about something newer. Maybe I take a pause. If there is any quick question, I could respond to that. Or since I have limited time, maybe I postpone it to the end of the lecture. All right. So maybe we continue. All right. So far, we have been discussing the question: which representations of GLN F appear as a quotient of an irreversible representation of GLN plus 1? Of GLN plus 1, is it possible to have a more complete understanding of what a representation of GLN plus 1 restricted to GLNF looks like? The question is not so well posed, which we try to explain. So suppose R and S are rings, not necessarily commutative rings, together with a morphism of rings from S to R, which allows one to restrict modules for R to modules for S. To modules for S. This is what happens when you do the restriction problem: that representation for G becomes a representation for H. So we think of reducible representations of groups as simple modules for rings. Thus, starting from a simple module M for R, we get a module for S through this morphism of rings and we call that module M. Call that module M now considered as an S module to be M. M S. The branching launch that we have been discussing about are about simple quotients of M S as S modules. Thus, we are trying to understand harm spaces as well as X spaces where N is a simple module for S. So, this is what we have been doing. The first question that comes to mind is: if for a finitely To mind is if for a finitely generated S module M, understanding the multiplicities of the dimension of the home spaces, does it determine the S module M up to isomorphism? Let us say in the GGP context. So, you know, if all the branching laws are understood, does it uniquely determine the It uniquely determines the representation restricted to the subgroup? That is the question. So, where based on low-dimensional examples, I feel that the question has an affirmative answer, though it seems not to have been investigated. So, in the GGP context, the branching laws, once they are known, then the restriction of the representation to the subgroup is uniquely determined. Group is uniquely determined. Equivalently, if you have two representations M1 and M2, which have the same branching large, then their restriction to H will be the same. Okay. So there seems to be no general template for understanding modules over rings, commutative or otherwise. For example, I believe one does not. For example, I believe one does not have classification of finitely generated modules. All our modules are finitely generated by this theorem of Eisenberg and Sayag. Even our polynomial ring CXY in two variables. How then is one supposed to understand this module as an S module? So although general modules may be hard to understand, it is possible that finitely generated projective modules over S have a simpler structure, which one Have a simpler structure which one may hope to understand. In fact, for the GGP questions, we are in the context of modules m over r such that this dimension is less than equal to m1. So we call such modules to be multiplicity one modules for s if ms is furthermore projective over s then Is furthermore projective over S, then it will be called multiplicity one projective module. And somehow the question is to understand without the bigger group, just what the modules are there on the smaller group, which have this multiplicity one property and which are projective modules. Okay, so vanishing of X groups in many cases, but not in all cases, suggests that the restriction That the restriction to G Lnf of an eruditable admissible representation of G Ln plus 1F is close to being a projective module without being one in all the cases. You know, to say that a module is projective means that all the x higher x are zero. And these theorems due to Chan and Saven and due to Rio Chen say that. Say that the higher x for generic or tempered representations are zero. So many x are zero, but some x may be non-zero. So since the category of smooth representation is decomposed into blocks parameterized by inertial equivalence classes of the caspital datum, one can ask if the projection of pi to the particular block, call it pi M rho, is a projective module in that block. A projective module in that block. This appears to be an important question to understand. Given an irresponsible representation pi of GLN plus one, for which blocks is this a projective module? So if this becomes a projective module, then in that block, all the x are zero, whether it is a irreducible generic representation for the For the subgroup, or not for any representation in that block, x of pi, pi prime will be zero. And this is often the case. So there is already some literature on this question for the restriction problem from GLN plus 1 to GLN, which I will quickly review. Then we consider the simplest case of more general. The simplest case of more general GGP problem for classical groups, restricting ourselves to one of the simplest questions on the tensor product for GL2, which corresponds to the restriction problem from GL2 cross GL2 to the diagonal GL2, which is essentially the restriction problem from SO4 to SO3. So, okay, so here is a theorem due to China and Sawen. It says that the restriction of an It says that the restriction of an erosible admissible representation is a projective module in a particular Binstein block if and only if pi itself is generic and all irrigible quotients of pi are generic. So it doesn't have any non-generic quotient. So then there is this second part of their theorem. Second part of their theorem, or another theorem of theirs, that if you have two erosible representations of G Ln plus one whose restriction to G Ln F are projective in a particular block, then pi 1 and pi 2 are isomorphic in that block. So, you know, these representations are the same. And as I am trying to emphasize, emphasize in most blocks when you restrict a generic representation it remains projective and therefore the representations are in fact isomorphic in most blocks and then there is this third part to their theorem which says that if pi is a smooth projective module in the eva horrible block of gln such that the multiplicity is That the multiplicity is less than or equal to one, then pi is isomorphic to this projective module or to this projective module. So there are exactly two projective modules for G L and F for which multiplicity is less than or equal to one. So two projective modules. So after this theorem of China and Savin, the unfinished Theorem of China and Savin, the unfinished tasks are given an irreducible generic representation of GLN plus one. Can we classify exactly the Pinstein blocks in which the representation is not projective? As I said, most of the time it is projective and then it is uniquely determined. More generally, if pi is a useful representation of G Ln plus 1, which may or may not be generic, can one understand projective dimension of pi restricted to G Ln F in a Restricted to GL and F in a particular block. So it may not be projective. If a representation is not projective, then the next thing one needs to understand is what is the projective dimension of the representation. Okay. So this theorem is due to Chin. It says that if you have a rootable representation of GLN plus 1 and you restrict it to GLNF, then it is. It to GLNF, then it is a projective representation if and only if either it is square integrable or it is of the form pi 1 cross pi 2, which are caspidal representation on half the dimension. So, n plus 1 is 2d and pi is pi 1 cross pi 2 and both are caspidal. Such representation. So, this is the complete list of representations which are projective everywhere. But if you are looking at a particular But if you are looking at a particular block inside GLNF, then on that block, most of the restriction problem will bring you to a projective module. Okay, from theorem 6 of Chin, it follows that just like caspital representations, discrete series are also always projective representations when restricted to GLNF. This seems like a general feature of all the GGP pairs. Thus, for a GGP pair, G. Thus, for a GG pair G, H, if pi is a discrete representation of G, one expects that pi restricted to H is a projective representation of H. There is no proof of this for general GGP pair. Chan has done it for GLN. Okay, so I have the feeling that I may have to overshoot by two, three minutes. I will end soon. The following, okay, so you know. The following, okay. So, you know, in the previous slides, I was talking about GLN plus one to GLN. This is about the tensor product decomposition of GL2F, where one can give a much more complete result. And in this case, we are able to say not only when the tensor product is projective, but when not projective, it is non-projective in exactly one Bernstein block. And the theorem. block and the theorem uh quickly says that if pi1 pi2 are irresponsible for infinite dimensional representation of gl2 product of the central characters is trivial then the representation pi1 tensor pi2 of pgl2 is a projective module unless both are irresponsible principles reach and they are kind of dual to each other and in which case it is not a projective module exactly in the block of PGL Exactly in the block of PGL2F containing the character chi. In particular, if at least one of the representation is a twist of this time bar, then pi1 tensor pi2 is a projective module in the category of smooth representations. Okay. So maybe I just take this remark. By theorems of Chinese Avin, there are two projective modules of multiplicity one in the Evahori block of GLNF. These are the two modules. So these are projective modules. Two modules. So these are projective modules for which multiplicity is less than or equal to one, exactly two. Where Steinberg is their Steinberg representation of the finite group G Ln FQ treated as a representation of G L and O F. In this case, the restriction from G Ln plus 1 to G Ln, if projective in the Ywahori block, picks up only the representation which is this one. So So, most of the time, when you restrict a representation of GLN plus 1 to GLN, the restriction is this unique. You know, for a generic representation, the branching is identically 1 for generic representation. And it also says that it is this representation identically for any representation which is a projective module in this particular block. On the other hand, there are four projective module. On the other hand, there are four projective modules of multiplicity one in the Evahori block of PGL2F, and these are the four representations. These are obtained as compact induction of finite dimensional representation. Steinberg is again the Steinberg representation of the finite group treated as a representation of the maximal compact. And here, K is the normalizer of the U-Auri subgroup. So there are four projective modules of multiplicity. Projective modules of multiplicity less than or equal to one. In this case, the restriction of an urban representation in this case, the restriction of universal representation to PGL2F can have all the four possibilities. So maybe that line is being cut out. All right. All right, so this is my last slide. Maybe I won't read, and maybe time to thank you for your attention. I am, of course, very happy to take any questions. Yes, yes, yes, Toshi, yes, yes. Can you hear me? You want me to go to a certain slide? Oh, if you stand here. So then you can like if you stand here, you'll see. Okay, can you hear me? Depender, can you hear me? Yes, yes, I can hear you. Okay, so thank you very much for your nice lecture. And I'd like to I'd like to mention about the history of what you mentioned in the first slide. History, yeah, yeah, history. In the first slide, even the about the multiples we want theorem. Yeah. And then even the finiteness of multiple not known when the multiplicity one theorem was proved. One theory proved if I understand correctly. You mentioned in the past slide, yeah. Uh, multiplicity one for uh uh not true in the real case. I mean, the in the real case, you know, I have not been precise enough that we are talking about the harm species of pressure with some topology. Pressure indications with some topology continuous linear. Can you show in the first slide? Yeah, uh, so yes. So it may mention that before the full matrix one theorem, even finite dimensionality of the matrix space was not known, which were later, blah, blah, blah. And this is true. I think this is true for the periodic case, but in the real case, But in the real case, 20 years earlier, it was proved. Okay, okay. So you are talking about this argument about finite dimensionality. Finite dimensionality are characterized by the real sphericity and uniform reboundness for complications sphericity. This necessary and sufficient conditions. And it was in the 19th century. And it was in the 90s by Oshima and myself. And many of the experts know about, for example, very sign or whether this result already. Okay, okay. So for real groups, the finite multiplicity space was a result known in greater generality. Yeah, yeah. So in the real case, the multiplicity boundness and finite. The boundness and finiteness, each necessary sufficient condition one, no, but not is new and so it's a stronger here by and two. So I just want to correct this point. All right. Yeah, yeah, thank you. Good, good.
