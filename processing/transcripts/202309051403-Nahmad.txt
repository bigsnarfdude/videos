I think I'm the only person from Mexico or Latin America, and I think we are part of BERS. We are actually there somewhere. So I'm really happy to be here. And I'm going to talk about something. I'm a developmental biologist. I was a physicist by training, but now I'm more in biology. So I'm going to talk about the process, a morphogenetic process that happens during development in our system, which is the Nervous system, which is the Drosophila wing disk, which is the fruit fly. I'll describe it in a second. And let me start saying that we are interested in development because development is an extremely complex process where you start with a very, very simple shape and then you get to very complex shapes. And one thing that we have been interested for the past seven years is to understand how. It is to understand how these processes happen at the level of a single organ. And I'm going to talk about a few problems that we have been trying to tackle, and then at the end, I'm going to focus on one open problem that we're trying to understand. And my approach in this kind of meeting, since this is more like a methods kind of meeting, I'm going to describe the biological problem. And hopefully, for one of you that you. You that for your methods, this problem would be trivial to solve, probably, and hopefully, we can get some insight from you. So, I want to start with this very famous cartoon by Waddington. This is called the Waddington Landscape. And basically, the idea is to try to understand development as a path in which a cell starts falling into this hill, and depending on the path that it follows, Depending on the path that it follows, it ultimately defines its phenotype. So basically, what was amazing about this Waddington landscape was not that kind of analogy from this cartoon with potential energy in the sense of physics to the developmental energy. But it's actually what he drew behind this picture, and this is what he drew. And this is what he drew. And this is in 1957, he already thought about these complex genetic interactions that happen like kind of below the surface that definitely define all the processes that we're interested in developmental biology, which are differentiation, migration, proliferation. And we are going to talk a little bit about how the interplay of this process happens at the gene regulatory level. Okay, so the organism that I'm going to talk about is the Trosophila, the fruit fly, the Trosophila melanogaster. And in particular, we are interested in the development of this organ, which is the organ, the precursor organ of the adult wing. This is called the wing imaginal disc. And one of the reasons that we use Trosophila is that we have this super powerful genetic. Super powerful genetic toolbox to do very complicated experiments. So, I'm gonna hopefully show you how we can do some very cool experiments in Drosophila using genetics where we can sort of understand what happens to the cells over time during development. Okay, so this tissue starts doing, it's defined during the larval stages, and during the larval stages And during the larval stages, it grows and grows and grows and then undergoes a morphogenetic process that at the end ends up in this adult shape. And obviously we are interested in understanding how the effectors at the level of molecules, for example, morphogenic growth factors, insulin or nutrition, or mechanical interactions, at the end drive these mechanisms, these processes that we're interested in. We're interested. And in particular, in the lab, we have been working on trying to understand how these different mechanisms talk to each other in order to coordinately orchestrate the developmental process. So for this talk, I'm just going to talk about a very specific gene. I'm going to try to simplify all the biology as much as possible. And the gene that I'm interested in is called Vestigial. Vestigial is a very, very interesting gene. Very interesting gene in many animals, in particular in insects. It's a well-conserved gene that drives wing development and it's called a selector gene for wing differentiation. And what you see here, this pear shape, is actually the larval wing disc, this precursor organ that drives the adult wing. And as you can see here, only the cells that are in Cells that are in this green kind of set of cells are the ones that are going to define the adult wing. The cells that are in yellow or in blue, they are going to be part of different parts of the adult body. So the question then is: so, what's the evidence, the biological evidence that pestigian is really a selective gene? Well, so experiments from the NAS. So, experiments from the 90s show that when you have a mutant of vestigial, you obviously only have these vestiges of wings, that's why it's called vestigial. You can also do kind of these local experiments where you protrude in a very particular places of the wind. For example, here, in all the posterior parts of the wing, you can eliminate using an RNAi experiment. This is part of the genetic rubric that I mentioned, but I'm not going to go into details. And you can essentially show that. And you can essentially show that if you put an RNAi for this vestigial gene, then you lose kind of the posterior part of the wing. So this shows that this is necessary, this is a necessary gene for wing development. But amazingly, vestigial is also a sufficient gene. So this is a kind of crazy experiment where I'm not expecting you to understand or to believe me that these are real winds, but these are winds. Real real wings, but these are wing-like tissues. So, what they did was overexpress vestigia in different other tissues, for example, the legs, and you can see that they develop more or less into wing sort of tissue. So, these Frankenstein-type experiments show that vestigial is necessary and sufficient for wing development. Now, the question in the lab for the past seven years has been a lot about how vestigial is established. Is established from a developmental biology point of view, and I'm just going to describe very briefly a few things that we know about the establishment of the mestigal pattern. First of all, along the dorsal ventral axis of this tissue, we have local signaling that drives mestigal into both sides of the dorsal ventral boundary, which is driven by notch signaling. I'm not going to get into details of that. Then there are other signals that are long-range have. Are a long range distance have longer range distance, which are called wingless and DPP, which again I'm not going to go into the details, but they specify vestigial also. They prime cells to be vestigial expressing cells away from the DB boundary. Then the cells that have vestigial expression, they have this positive feedback loop to maintain vestigial expression in a daughter cell. So once a vestigial cell proliferates. So, once a vestigial cell proliferates, it also maintains its vestigial expression. And finally, the process that we have been working more in the lab has been this process of recruitment, in which a cell at the boundary of the vestigial pattern can send that local signal to the neighbor and recruit the neighboring cell to become a vestigial express itself. So, I'm not gonna go too much into the patterning part of this process because this is not part of the topic of. Is not part of the topic of the workshop, but just a few years ago, a student in the lab kind of showed something that was really interesting. So, if you look at the prestigial pattern over time, what you see, this is in relative scale and this is the B V axis. So, remember, the prestigial starts expressing along the B V and then forms this gray kind of graded pattern. And what we saw when we do in relative scale is that there is this overscaling. Is that there is this overscaling of the vestigial pattern? So, if this was scaling perfectly, this would be like a linear, like horizontal line, but we saw that it has this overscaling property, which you can see here as well. And what is interesting about this is that when you eliminate this recruitment process genetically, you kind of lose this overscaling property. So, we show in this paper that a vestigial overscaling is due to this recruitment process. Is due to this recruitment process. Now, so why I'm saying all this, the reason I'm mentioning all this is because the motivation actually of what I'm going to tell you next is related to this experiment. So what Luis also showed in this paper is that self-recruitment only drives about 20% of the adult wing sites. And then we kind of scratch our heads and said, is all this It said, is all this complicated recruitment process only for 20% of growth? And we start thinking about other things that recruitment may be doing during this developmental process. And in particular, I'm going to say that one interesting thing about this phenotype, even though we saw this twenty percent increase in the adult, when we looked into the tissue in the in the wing disc, we saw that the wing disc has more or less the same size. More or less the same size. So then we wonder what happened to these cells that were not recruited. And this is what I'm going to try to motivate in this talk. And now let's go to the morphogenesis part. And I'm going to ask a few questions here about some morphogenetic processes that happen during the wing development. So, again, this is now an actual wing disc. This disc This disk is kind of, we put an arbitrary here line along this anterior-posterior axis. And if you take kind of a cross-section here and then look at kind of in three dimensions, so what you see is that early in development you see a pretty flat tissue except for these parts that are the notum, which are not part of the wing, actually the wing cells that we're interested in. These are actually outside of this, this should be around. Outside of this, this should be around here. And then you start seeing that some epithelial folds start forming in the tissue, and these faults start becoming deeper and deeper. And then at some point, at the end of the larval stages, these folds kind of pull all the tissue so that this part of the disc will kind of fall into itself. So this part here will become this part, and then the dorsal. This part, and then the dorsal and ventral sides of the wings become. So, this actually happens during the pupal stages, which are very difficult to image in the lab. To dissect these discs and to do this imaging is really hard. And we know that this is driven by some hormonal processes, this transition between larva and pupa, but I'm not going to talk too much about the again the details of the biology of this. What we found very interesting Found very interesting is that when you kind of dies a drosophila larvae, so if you wound the larva, you essentially make a hole, people have shown since the 70s that this induces a delay in development. So essentially the tissue, well that the animal needs to repair itself before continuing to preparation. And what we show with this is that this is an unwounded animal. This is an unwounded animal, and again, you have here vestigial expression. Daxus is just kind of outside of the vestigial pattern here. This is marked with GFP, and windness marks the dorsal ventral boundary. And if you take a cross-section now, you see, you know, in that wound-wounded disk, you know, the wild-type behavior. But now, when you do this wound and then you wait, even in the larval stages, In the larval stages, it extends, as we said, the larval development. And if you take this 20 hours after, you know, it's supposed to be now a pupa, but it's not a pupa yet, you see that the disc is folding itself right away. So this was very interesting because this shows that even though the pupa is delayed, the disk proceeds into pupal development, which was kind of striking. Kind of striking to find that. Now, I told you about this recruitment process because this is actually the reason why I told you about it. So what we showed is that in this experiment, this is not wounding at all. So this is just a genetic experiment where we use again this genetic tool synthrosophila to drive vestigial RNAi expression. So this is an RNAi that is. So, this is an RNA that's going to prevent mestigia to be translated in exactly the cells that are going to become wings. So, this recruitable population of cells. And what happened is you see a very similar phenotype to the one that I described before. So, it seems that the wing disc starts to averting prematurely. So, this is not a pupil wing disc, this is actually a larval disc. This is actually a larval disc that average prematurely, which suggests that at the end of development, of larval development, recruitment might be acting as a checkpoint for morphogenesis. In other words, we think that recruitment is essentially when recruitment is completed, the tissue knows that it needs to start averting. So we are kind of exploring whether this end of recruitment has something to do with. End of recruitment has something to do with these hormonal signals that I mentioned earlier. But we thought it was very interesting that this morphogenetic process starts happening prematurely when you genetically impair recruitment. Now, the second question that I want to mention briefly is not the whole version of the disk, like this folding into essentially this part folds into itself, Falls into itself, but actually the formation of these faults that happen at the edges of the wing kind of territory. So these are called the BH faults because are dividing the blade of the wing from the hinge of the wing. The hinge is kind of the part of the wing that is attached to the body. And interestingly, there is this paper from almost more than 10 years ago that shows that. Ago, that shows that this gene that is required for fall formation, which is called DOC, which again I'm not going to talk too much about it. But what is interesting is that there is a relationship between DOC, a genetic relationship between DOC and vestigial. So these experiments are mosaics of cells overexpressing vestigial. So when you generate ectopically vestigial in these green patches, as you can see, you lose dog expression. So this suggests. Expression. So, this suggests that Vestigial is actually preventing this morphogenetic process at the faults to happen. And we wonder if this was actually the case, because this was just done by overexpressing experiments, and with you two overexpression, many things could be happening. So, we wanted to see if this happens actually in the wildlife. So, what my research technician, Rafael Rodriguez, Research technician Rafa Rodriguez in the lab has been looking at is creating these mosaics of cells. These are only labeled with a reporter, so these are not overexpressing mosaics or anything like that. And what we want to know with these mosaics, just a little background on this, what these mosaics do is they are generated at some point in early larval development, so they are random. So they are randomly occurring in the tissue. As you can see, you know, there are mosaics all over the tissue. But the interesting things about these mosaics is that the size of these mosaic and the shape of these mosaic comes from a single cell that originated that mosaic. So, for example, all these mosaics that you see, they, you know, if they are separate mosaics, because some of them are kind of clustering together, but if they are separate, you know, But if they are separate, they are going to become a set of cells that are going to, all of them are going to be daughters of that originating cell. So this is a great genetic tool to really study what happened to these cells during wild-type development. And what we are interested in in particular is what happened to bestigial expressing cells during this process. So the hypothesis is the following. So if vestigial Following. So, if the stigma, as in the previous paper from 2012, is actually repressing this ball formation, then the cells that are originated in the part of the wing disc that are going to become wing cells, they are going to stay as wing cells and they are not going to enter into the fold. So these are going to remain part of that part. Part of that part, but the cells that are actually right at the boundary are the ones that are going to proliferate and they are going to start forming the fold. In other words, by doing these experiments, we can demonstrate whether the cells from the pouch, which is the part that our mestigal is expressed, kind of enter the fold or whether the fold is formed by just proliferating some other set of cells. So we are kind of testing this hypothesis using Of testing these hypotheses using these genetic tools. And what we did was to analyze this using confocal microscopy. And what I'm showing here, this is all preliminary data, which we would like to quantify more deeply. But what you can see here, if you focus in any of these mossets that happen here where vestigial is expressed, as you can see, they seem to be stable. As you can see, they seem to be staying in these parts. Like before the fall forms, you know, these kind of patches of blue or light blue, you know, they remain there. So it seems like a mosaic that happens really at the vestigial pattern, they will stay there, they will not enter the fold. But then you will say, well, but you are taking a mosaic that is really, really in the middle of the disk. What if that's not the case? And then Grafa found several examples. And Rafa found several examples, this is just one of them, where you have, you know, you clearly see these mosaics that happen really at this hinge part, which they are part of falls, which are not interested in, we are not interested in for this talk because they are outside of our region of interest. But we were interested in this kind of mosaics that happened here. And when we saw this, we thought that our hypothesis was false. Hypothesis was false, that really vestigial could enter into the fold. But when we look at this carefully in three dimensions, what we saw, and hopefully you can appreciate this, is that actually this mosaic that is here is formed by two separate mosaics. So there is one here that is marked here, but then there is a space and there is another mosaic here. So it seems so far, but we need to really do this more carefully and more control. to this more carefully and more quantitatively, we think that really the cells that are part of the green pouch that sorry, I'm gonna say that it's born in the pouch, it's gonna stay in the pouch and the cells that are actually in the boundary, they are gonna be actually forming the whole fold. So this is something that we want to explore more carefully and for doing this this is all fixed This, this is all fixed data, but we would like to do this in an ex-bigo system where we can image this actually process in live live using live imaging and show that really what's the fate of these cells. And this is really what I wanted to present. And we're interested also in the shapes of these mosaics and how they start forming during normal development. Development. So it seems that we don't know yet so far, but by looking at several of these disks at least manually, it seems like all the examples so far show that you have separate populations of the ones that are born in the pouch and the ones that are at the boundary. So it seems that mestigial is really preventing these cells from entering to the fold. To enter into the fold in one sense. And the other interesting observation is that the cells that happen to be right at the boundary between the pouch and the hinge, you know, this kind of region, they seem to mark the whole fold. So we think that this provides evidence that these cells at the fold are actually proliferating and by proliferating, they are creating these folds. But we are again. These faults. But we are again, we need to do, you know, some image analysis for this. So, for the biology part of the talk, which this is going to be kind of the end, I just show you that vestigial-dependent differentiation, this is a patterning differentiation process, seems to be constraining amorphogenetic movement of cells. And again, the reason I'm presenting this biology is because. Senting these biologies because I want to know if one of you would like to look into these more carefully using your methods. And the second, which kind of drives this hypothesis, is that vestigial expressing cells don't seem to be entering to the folds. So the faults form by proliferating the cells that are outside of the vestigial pattern. And the hypothesis and the And the hypothesis and the experiment that we are performing right now is that this has to do with the recruitment process. So, let me just for one or two minutes describe the experiment, that very challenging genetic experiment that we are doing. So, these are, we are marking now genetically these faults. So, imagine that in addition to this marking, sorry, not these faults, these mosaics. So, in addition to marking these mosaics, we are going to prevent recruitment. Going to prevent recruitment from happening. So, we are going to have an experiment where you have these mosaics in a genetic background without recruitment. And the hypothesis is that now the cells that cannot express vestigial will be able to enter into the folds. And we want to do this again both using fixed tissue data as well as using live imaging. And these are kind of future directions for this point. Future directions for this project. So, again, this is all what I have. You know, my kind of take-home message for you is that we have a very interesting biological problem where we have several challenging things in this system. So, we have this system that is in three dimensions, that falls are very deep and dynamic. These tissues are pseudostratified, meaning that not all the cells in the epithelia. Not all the cells in the epithelia are exactly in the same plane. And so far we have done this manually, but we would like to do this with not only in a fixed tissue, but with live imaging, and we would like to apply some more quantitative imaging analysis tools to analyze this data. And with that, I'll just show a nice picture. So, this is my lab. No, no, I'm just. No, but this is our food that you all know and probably love. So come to Mexico and visit our one of these days. And these are the people, past and current members of the lab, and also the work with them descendants from RAFA. And thank you so much for your attention. Any questions? So do you have any uh uh kind of idea of or visualization of how you know the the this this whole morphogenesis happen in time uh because you are looking at some of these yeah, so we fixed time point, right? So do do you do you know if there's some yeah, uh if this has been imaged or visualized is actually or Image or visualize, is actually how this feeling falls? Yeah, you can do this, so we can culture these wing disks. So, to do this in a live animal, it's possible, and people have done this. Susan Eaton used to work on this problem, and she actually looked at the morphogenesis of the disk and has very beautiful data of how this is happening. The problem is that if you do this, The problem is that if you do this through the larva, I mean you need a very powerful imaging tool, but in addition to that, and to get a high resolution of what happened to these mosaics, it's really, really difficult. You essentially can see the shapes, but you cannot kind of track individual cells as far as I know. So, this is challenging. But what you can do, and this is what we are trying actually right now, is you take out the disk outside of Labanumala. The disk outside of the animal, after outside of the larvae, you put it in growth medium, and then you kind of do this experiment outside of the animal. And obviously, you know, the advantage of doing that is that the imaging is much simpler. But the challenging part of this is that, well, first of all, we don't know exactly if these faults are going to form exactly as normal development, which was kind of the goal of the whole project. But the other challenging part of this. Another challenging part of this is that in culture this doesn't survive for a very long time. So, you know, we are trying to kind of balance these things. But I think using these tools, where you genetically mark these mosaics, you can really solve this problem and you can see like individual cells and track them. But that's kind of the image processing goal that we have. Processing call that we have. At some point, you said that the gene is only responsible for 20% of the growth, right? The overscaling, yeah, only the recruitment part of the gene. The recruitment part of the gene is only responsible for 20% of the growth. So I'm not sure I understood how you get the rest of the growth. Is it based on the patches? Because Patches because this okay. Sorry, let me go back. Sorry, I went very quickly through this. So, vestigial, the pattern of vestigial is very complicated established. So, you have this local signaling and the priming signaling, the proliferation of this vestigial. All these three processes drive this 80 other percent. So, what we did in that experiment was to block specifically this repo and process. So, we showed that because in the past Showed that because in the past, you know, people didn't know what recruitment was doing, even if it existed. So, in that paper, we showed that recruitment happens in normal development and it's actually contributing to 20%. The rest is happening through other patterning mechanisms. Yeah, sorry about that. I want probably to pass through through that data. I was I remember correctly one of the questions you were interested in. You were interested, for example, was how the codes are actually formed and the role of cell division in that. Do you have any information that you could share with? Yeah, very good question. So we originally were very interested in the mechanics of this fault formation, and there are several labs that have worked a little bit about. We know that one of the signals that drive Signals that drive this has to do with the hippopathy, and we know that there are some mechanosensing effects. So, some of the molecular details of what is driving these faults are being resolved. So far, you know, this question you are asking about whether what happened to cell proliferation, for example, in this part, well, the fold is forming, and I don't think that problem is solved yet, so we kind of abandon. Solved yet, so we kind of abandoned that project so far. But we are right now feel that the most interesting aspect of this is this interplay between this differentiation of mortogenesis. So it's not that we forgot about the proliferation. We think that the proliferation is really interesting for the cells that are really here at the edges of these two. So these two populations, the ones that are here and the ones that are here. That are here and the ones that are here, they are marked by two different differentiation chains. But there are specific cells in the middle that actually are really separating these two populations. And we really think that that process is really interesting. Try to understand the differentiation interplay with more genesis. Nice question. So related to your idea of doing the time label, what's the time scale is a problem? Time scale is problems? Very good question. So, these faults, as you can see here, this is real time actually. So, this is the fault start forming in 85. This is after egg laying, doesn't matter, really. So, it's about between 20 and 25 hour process. You're right, yeah, the whole process takes 25 hours. The question that we have That we have right now is: like, if we do, for example, only 10 hours, for example, and you know, there are protocols that have been developed to keep the disks alive for longer, but if we look early, like for example these stages, we will be able to see whether these cells here at the pouch are actually pulling into the folder or not. And you're right, so we're not going to capture the whole thing, but at least we're going to be able to see whether. To see whether you know in the early stages this processing could be happening. Alright, that was the discussion. Thank you again. So I thought the sequence to be clear. No, I think that it's pretty far. I don't want to have to say that. I think this is like a little bit of a drink.   This one? Maybe the last one. This is the player. Yeah. Do you plan on teaching the first funny? Oh, I think that's already just like complete for I think. I mean the line doesn't It has to do with the representative errors by the protects, but I just use it as a BCB or BC. Well, what the power is the DP file, say. Well, is there going to be valid models? Does it still mean those things into larger blocks? No, not the CS7, or maybe the bike cover. So we can run. Oh, yeah, drag cover. I mean, brake cover, but yeah, that doesn't value anything. Yeah. Oh, the very Oh, the very small side. Thank you. Because you showed these images at different labels and want to have size. What does different size? So each of these mosaics is different from independent elements. Yeah, they're independent population of cells. And some of them, if they are born very close together, they simply just see normal sets for their own. I even purposely thought. Yeah, no, we are generally remote, right? Yeah, but several sets that we can have. Oh, you're right. But I think it's a very But I think it's okay. We all have them. I mean, we are all generated. So the mosaic that you showed is the same thing. It should be fine. Each mosaic comes from a single cell and then they start only. Uh and they they start only from the primary and then on time t you just four and when you're showing six you're just the six uh independent experiment. So I know what you mean. You're talking about the one to two. I'm sorry, I didn't say that at all. Oh, so I guess the question is that we need to show what we see. Well we have this is this is controlled imaging so we have the system so this is down sorry it's an example so what you see here each of these one two three four five are like different yeah see that different slices so we we we did that because if we That because if we
