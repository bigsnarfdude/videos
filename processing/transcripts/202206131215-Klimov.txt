Okay. So thank you very much for participation. Actually, I should be there, but I got COVID last week and unfortunately still not very well. And okay, so let me start with my talk. The purpose of this presentation basically is to review. Review an approach we have been developing for analysis of many body quantum systems in the macroscopic limit. So, what's the deal here? We consider many partite multipartite system, many particle system. Basically, we have n-parthy system which lives in a large Hilbert space. And basically, what is the problem? Basically, what is the problem? We want to extract useful information out of the state, characterize it in some manner. And of course, all the information about the state is comprised in this coefficient CK. However, if we try to extract useful information, we face with considerable difficulties. For instance, for a small number of particles, we can do measurements. Do measurements, we can measure local observables or particle observables or compute them. However, of course, this approach is not very good in the macroscopic limit when the number of particles is very large. In this case, we can proceed with computing or measuring so-called collective observables. Something like here's where we sum up all individual subsystem observables. System observers. There are huge numbers of such measurements. And the question still persists: basically, how can we organize the information clarified either in Sika coefficients or obtained from measurements in order to get a global insight into the state? To say something about the state as a full big system and not some particular. Some particular characteristic. And from our experience, basic physics, basical physics, we can apply a statistical description, which basically consists in mapping the state of the system on a distribution function which lives in some classical phase space. And such an approach works very well for systems with a simple quantum system with. Simple quantum system with simple symmetries like Heisberg Weil or SU2 symmetries, which describe particle or spin-like system. However, such a, I would say, classical phase-space, continuous phase approach does not work if we want to apply it for the description of many part multipartite system. Fortunately, in this case, a discrete phase-space representation had been developed many years ago, and we can basically map states of a particle or many particles to distribution in a discrete grid, which I later called discrete phase space, although it is not completely true. For instance, if we have just a single spin. Single spin, oops, single, sorry, single qubit, as in quantum information it is usually called, then a state of such a qubit can be mapped into, for instance, positive function, and we can represent any state as a picture. For instance, such a superposition can be plot in this way. The same can be done, for instance, for two spins or for two. instance for two spins or for two qubits and then the disk at phase space is a grid which is four by four and again we can represent any state in form of a distribution we plot basically we can plot a state as something we can see a kind of nice picture and in general for n curated case n curated case we can plot state any state Any state as a distribution on a discrete grid defined on a discrete grid. In this case, this discrete grid or discrete phase space has a form of a plane grid where the coordinates are labeled with so-called d strings, which is an ordered collection of numbers from 0 to d minus 1. For instance, for 2q. For instance, for two qubits, we have four by four grid, and then may assign to each string a point in this phase space. Actually, each point-phase space corresponds to some basic operator which can be used as a whole for the expansion of dense thematics over a set such operators, but this is really not important for our putrid case. round and for putrid case for instance it could be a grid like nine nine by nine and the the it the the the axis would be labeled with also ordered composition of numbers from one to two and so on such such representation can be always done as i told you and i will use in this talk uh the so-called positive representation The so-called positive representation of quantum states. So I will map the state to so-called Q function. There is a strong reason why it is a Q function, and maybe experts would ask why not some other distribution like Wigner one, which see the interference pattern, but there is strong reason. And such a map is done by projecting, by taking the average value of the density matrix over the same. Value of the density matrix over the set of so-called discrete coherent states, which are constructed in a certain prescribed way. So just don't, it's not very important for now. And then again, we can map any state, any state, any pure state or any mixed state to a distribution. Such distributions look quite nice for small number of particles. But when the number of particles grows, Grows, then what we observe is just some random peaks distributed over the discard phase space. So, basically, such a representation is not intuitive at all. Basically, we cannot extract any at least visual information out of such a plot. In addition, such representations have some other shortcomings which are really important because we make you Because we making any type of phase-space representation, we want to extract useful information. For instance, one of shortcomings here, that there is no continuous limit in the macroscopic limit. Macroscopic limit, I mean when the number of particles is really large. For instance, if we would try to plot spin-coherent states in this discrete phase space, A discrete phase space. What we see, I don't know if it is seen well, but we have step-like form which never converts into a Gaussian shape. It does not matter what number of spin we consider. Another problem, for instance, is the effect of local transformations. Local transformation means that we have a state and then apply transformation to individual particles. So we do not change the current. So, we do not change the correlation structure of the state, but somehow displace each particle in some direction, I would say. Then, for instance, if we consider such a very famous in quantum physics, GZ states, which is basically a combination spin down and spin ups, then the state in the discard phase space, GSZ space. discrete phase space, GZ space, look like this. And then by applying, look at this, a diagonal transformation, we see a completely disordered picture, which is locally equivalent to this one. And of course, to make a delusion is very difficult. There is another problem. For instance, I can plot different type of states. For instance, I can plot completely correlated states. Completely correlated states. I mean, states that cannot be represented in the form of product of individual subspaces. Or I can plot a product state. And if I take a look on this picture, what I see? Nothing. Actually, this state, this is a coherent-like state for Q-treats, I think, looks kind of nice, kind of correlated, while this correlated state, which This correlated state, which in quantum mechanics has a name W state, looks like something very strange. Another problem, which I will talk about a bit, it is a problem of macroscapicity. Macroscapicity is a problem which we really want to find in quantum systems. So, basically, the question is: I have a state, can I measure? Can I measure some collective operator which is constructed by summing up some local operators so that the fluctuation of this collective operator would be large. Large means is of order of n square, where n is the number of particles. This is this problem which is not easy. It's not easy to solve since there's obviously huge number of possibilities to choose such. To choose such collective operators. So, for instance, in case of continuous representation, picturing, for instance, spin states, we can make such kind of prediction. Basically, looking at the picture of spin state on the sphere, we can conclude what is good to measure in order to have a largely fluctuating operator. However, in case of However, in case of discrete representation, for instance, I have again this GSZ state, which is a superposition of spin ups and spin down. And then I look at the picture and what I see, maybe if I associate discrete grid direction, direction, the discrete grid with some physical direction, I can say, okay, well, maybe measuring in this direction, I can really obtain something that fluctuates like n square. Like n square, and this is actually true. This direction can be related to the physical z direction and such operate as z square fluctuate as n square. But if I look at some other state, which is also very famous, domain wall state, which completely correlated state, and I take a look on this picture, what I see basically, nothing. How I can choose local operators in order to see if something collects. If something collective would fluctuate largely or not. Although I know the state, I know that there is a collective operator that fluctuates largely. So there is a proposal how to deal with how to improve such a discord representation and make it more convenient for analysis, especially for the macroscopic analysis. Especially for the macroscopic analysis. And the idea is to shrink the representation in the discard phase space to something more compact. So I think maybe it is worth explaining this point a bit just to understand what is going on. So what we can do for discord representation. for discrete representation i have i may have an operator an operator and the two and i can produce two discrete maps these maps are called dual maps or i will explain it a bit later so one map is so called as a positive map so called q function this is a trace like map which when we project the operator When we project the operator into a set of discord coherent states, and the P map. The P map is dual map in the sense that the average value of any operator can be obtained by summing up the symbol of the density matrix. Sorry, the symbol of the density matrix, the Q symbol of the density matrix with the P symbol of the operator. In this sense, they are dual. And these And this P symbol becomes quite singular in the macroscopic leap. But for us, what is important that exists such a dual representation of any operator and we can compute its average values by convoluting Q and P symbols. Now, the key observation can be done is the following. Let us now consider not an arbitrary operator. An arbitrary operator, but only collective or symmetric operator, operators which are invariant under particle permutations. So again, it's a very important point. We will fix only on the symmetric operators, operators that do not feel any particle operator, any particle permutations. And the key observation here is that the P symbol Is that the p-symbol of such a symmetric operator is not a function of phase discrete phase space variables, but only of symmetric function which be constructed on such discrete phase space variables. Such symmetric functions, such symmetric functions, they call in this science length of the strings. So recall that alpha and beta are so-called distance. Alpha and beta are so-called D strings. So they have a composition of ordered composition A1, AN, where each number here either runs from 0 to D minus 1. And we can construct D square minus 1 such symmetric combinations. So again, the P symbols of symmetric symmetric observables are functions of symmetric symmetric functions of phase space observables what does this mean this means that the computation of average value instead of instead of summing over the whole disk at phase space now is reduced to summing over these lengths of what of the Of what? Of the symbol of semantic operators, here the symbol of semantic operators and the q function trajected into the space of lengths. So here, this is a basic move when we change for computing of average values from summing over the whole face. Over the whole phase space, escort phase space, to the to the to the summing over the space of lengths, which are symmetric functions. What is the gain here? Instead of summing here over the whole phase space, which is which contains two to the oh sorry, D to the two n points. 2n points with some over d square minus 1 elements. So that what results we just have obtained, we can map the density matrix of an arbitrary state, arbitrary state, into the function, into the function, what leaves into a distribution that leaves and d square minus one dimension. square minus one dimensional space. I will call this macroscopic or measurement space space, which is spanned by these square minus one vectors, of course. And such space contains this number of points. And the important point here that this distribution contains full and non-redundant information about any macroscopic collective measurements in the sense that we can compute. That we can compute any collective observables only by knowing this distribution function. Basically, this distribution function is how the collective observables, any collective observable, which is semantic under particle permutation sees the state. So if I am collective observers, I don't I am collective observers. I don't see the state as a density matrix. I don't see the state as a distribution in discrete phase space, as something like this. No, no, no, no, no. I see the state as a distribution in D square minus one dimensional space. The structure of such space depends on the value of d. For qubits, it would be three-dimensional space with a certain geometric structure. For Q-trides, it would be. Symmetric structure. For Q-trades, it would be a dimensional space and so on. Of course, for Q-bits, for instance, we can plot distributions corresponding to different states. For Q-trades, we cannot plot them itself, but plot some trajections, some hyperplanes. Well, two words about the structure, algebraic structure of the map. The map from the density matrix to such a macroscopic distribution. Distribution also has a trace-like form, and the kernel operator has certain structure where only piece of it belongs to the symmetric subspace, which appears in the tensor decomposition. All the other subspaces appear in the decomposition also, of course, participate. Well, now, since Now, since for qubit case we can plot the states, I will mainly focus on the qubit case and qubit case, although most of the theorem I will discuss are extendable to the qubit case. So let's consider n-qubit case. In n-qubit case, we have a distribution in three-dimensional space. And curiously, in this three-dimensional can be associated. dimension can be associated with physical this physical directions directions in physical space due to very nice relation between the p symbols of the collective spin observables and these vectors that and the x's that define the distribution in this macroscopic space. And this macroscopic space has a form of tetrahedron, so any distribution is So, any distribution is comprised inside such a tetrahedron. Well, just to gain some experience, let me plot different states in this macroscopic space. For instance, spin-capion state would have a form of an ellipsoid. Singlet state, it kind of ball located in the origin. The size of this ellipsoid and this ball. Of this ellipsoid and this ball, curiously, is scaled like square root of number of particles. The GZ state, again, spin down and spin superposition, spin down and spin up state. It has an expected form of superposition of two ellipsoids, which are separated, by the way, by the distance of n. And n is the basically dimension of the phase space of this. Of the phase space, of this measurement space, and very important for my exposition, mixed state. The mixed state is just identity state in the whole Hilbert space, and it also has a form of a ball of this size, which is located in the origin. Now, a simple application of such map, I have a state. I have a state. Look at this state. What is this state? What I can say about such a state? I can plot in the discrete phase space, and what I see, nothing, a set of disordered peaks. And then I plot this state in the measurement space, in the macroscopic state. What I have, of course, it's a trick. I have a superposition of two pairs of state, which I can identify actually as a superposition of two JZ. As a superposition of two GZ states in X and Y direction, just because I have this experience, how such a GZ in Z direction looks like. Of course, this is just for fun and it's not serious. So let me, for instance, show how putriate state can be plotted. For instance, GZ state for putriates, then projected in an appropriate plane. What is the form? It is a form of three peaks as expected. It is a form of three peaks as expected. So, to each state, some peaks, some peak is associated. This is an exact basic, by the way, plot. Now, all this, of course, just for fun, we can picture, but what else can we say about distribution in this macroscopic state? And it results. There are very interesting properties of such states. First of all, first, the main property, the states The main property. The states are represented as a smooth, smooth distribution in the macroscopic limb. So, when the number of particles grow, the state becomes, acquires the shape more and more smooth. So, we can visualize it in a very acceptable way. Second property, any distribution is comprised inside or bounded. Inside or bounded by an envelope. And this envelope is a Gaussian function, which can be constructed by knowing only first and second moments of, in this case, spin observables. In Qt case, it's a bit more complicated. For instance, the completely mixed state is inside, you say, very tightly inside of the Gaussian envelope, and GSZ state, which is And GZ state, which is superposition of two ellipsoids, which are here, is also inside an ellipsoid, although this ellipsoid is very large. So it is extended over the whole measurement space, basically. And the simplest property of plots in the measurement space is its localization. So we can call state localize if its extension is much smaller than the dimension. Smaller than the dimension of the whole space. Actually, a typical extension of localized distributions is of order of square root of n. Unlocalized distribution are extended over the whole measurement space and, for instance, this is, I think, with and half extensions. Unlocalized state are extended. And a simplest localization measure would be. Localization measure would be just the volume, the volume of the volume of the volume of the envelope. Now we can immediately observe that there is a relation between so-called macroscopicity, existence of large fluctuating collective operators, and the extension in the measurement space. So, unlocalized states are obviously macroscopic quantum states. Unfortunately, this localization property is not invariant on the local transformation. Actually, it could be expected. For instance, if I plot GZ state and locally equivalent noon state, which are related just by applying sigma x operators, what I see, GZ state is not localized as a superposition of two ellipsoid y, the noon state. If I plot it, it just kind of it's just a kind of ball located in the in the in the sand so local transformation could make could uh actually shrink uh non-localized uh distribution into localized one and of course vice versa if you apply local transformation to this distribution we go back to the unlocalized transformation actually this local this local transformation play important Local transformation plays an important role, of course, as it is expected in all this business. And applying local transformation, what we can do with the distribution in the macroscopic space. We can displace it, we can rotate it, we can deform it, and in particular, we can change the volume envelope. Thus, a simple definition of macroscopicity as a volume of envelope is not quite good enough. Enough and we can introduce the good macroscopicity parameter as a maximum of the envelope over all local transformations. Of course, this definition is good looking, but how to apply it in practice is not quite clear. But what is, I think, is a valuable acquisition is that plotting macroscopic state, we can clear. State, we can clearly identify the direction of the measurements along with which we can see macroscopicity. So, for instance, measuring along this direction gives you an operator which fluctuates like n square. As well, for instance, we measure in this direction, we can do this. So, just plotting some states, we can see the best measurement. see the best measurement best measurement direction then this is applicable to any state not only symmetric state any any any any n qubit state um what else what states are localized always localized the localized state that cannot be delocalized by any transformation any local transformation so they always have a form They always have a form coincide of a small Gaussian distribution. Such states fluctuate like n, not like n square. And typical localized state, for instance, state that contains entangled clusters with a small number of particles, or for instance, Number of particles, or for instance, product state, which is a limit case when all the particles are independent. Such states are always localized. However, there are fully correlated and localized state. Such a typical example of such fully correlated and localized states, which cannot be delocalized, is the W state. So, W state has this form. You see, it is inside of a small. You see, it is inside of a small ellipsoid, and it cannot be made large. And we know such a W state is not a macroscopic state. Another example of a localized state is a cluster state, which is also localized and cannot be delocalized. Here we have pictures how these states look like in the discrete phase space. In addition, except of localization property, we can define Gaussianity of spin states or actually curved states. Gaussian states would be those that in the measurement space are well described by Gaussian envelope. Well described in what sense? That if we compute high order We compute high-order moments and exactly and compute higher order moments of collective observables by using the Gaussian approximation, where recall we use only two first moments of collective spin observables. Then the difference asymptotically is zero. And there are many such states. For instance, product states, Bellag states, identity in Hulhilbe states, cluster states. All those states are Gaussian. Gaussian states. So they are well described by its envelope. But of course, there are localized and non-Gaussian states. Again, a classical example is W state. If we just take a look on this state, we can see that it is not Gaussian shape. It does not have Gaussian shape. It kind of shape has a V shape. However, However, this Gaussianity property is also not invariant under local transformations. For instance, applying local transformation to the W state, just changing signs somewhere, we obtain a perfectly Gaussian state. So these two states are locally equivalent, but one of those is Gaussian, Gaussian, and Gaussian, and then another one is non-Gaussian. Actually, one can prove that any state, this theorem, any state can go Gaussify it in the macroscopic space. So given any state, I can find a set of local transformation which converts it into a Gaussian state. So it can be described by Gaussian in the law. Now, can we, knowing all this, can we make Knowing all this, can we make, can we apply all this visual technique to something useful in practice? And it results that yes, because one can prove the following theorem. A theorem tells the following, is as follows. Any factorized pure states approaches to its Gaussian envelope in the macroscopic limit. Macroscopic limit. So any factorized state in the macroscopic limit is well described by its Gaussian envelope. This allows us to introduce a first quantum correlation measure, which is a maximum distance of a local transformation from the distribution, which represents our state to its own Gaussian envelope. So basically, the equation. So basically, the equation is like this. We compute the maximum distance from the state to its own Gaussian envelope and maximize it over all local transformation. If we can go far from the Gaussian envelope, the state is definitely contained quantum correlation. Why? Because factorized states can Characterized states cannot be taken out of its envelope by local transformations. Of course, this measure runs from zero to one. And in many cases, such measure can be computed analytically. For instance, for GIZ state, it is one, it is maximum. Of course, GIZ state, what form does it have? It has the form of two separated pixels. Pixel is very far from the Gaussian envelope. It's very far from this Gaussian envelope. And for W state, this is a limit, can be computed analytically. We can find it. For the main world state, it also can be computed analytically. But of course, if we want to apply this correlation measure in practice, it does not work very well. It does not work very well. Why? Because we have to optimize over local transformation, which in practice is impossible to do. However, another theorem. The theorem says that distribution corresponding to symmetric states are maximally non-Gaussian in the local equivalent class. This means that if I have a state and I look for local transformation, that makes it as more symmetric as... It is more semantic as it is, I will approach to this maximally non-Gaussian state. For instance, for noon state, we know that noon state is locally equivalent to the JZ state. This correlation measures also is also known. Simple application. Let's consider, for instance, the Ising model where the phase transition point corresponds of the value of the coupling constant equal to one. Coupling constants equal to one. So when the coupling constant is zero, we start with the JZ state, which is the ground state, actually as a plot. When the coupling constant is large, we arrive to the ground state, which is the eigenstate of SX operator, which is such a Gaussian distribution. And at the phase transition point, the state looks actually the state from the point of a collective. From the point of collective observables, it looks like this, like this. And of course, it is not Gaussian. It can be computed, optimized numerically, and it has certain value. Of course, it is for N14, maybe for a large value of N, it grows, but it's more complicated to compute. Now, but results that not all the states which are described by Gaussian envelope is Envelope is actually factorized. As an example, we can consider the cluster state, very important in an application in quantum information. One can prove the following theorem that the distribution, macroscopic distribution corresponding to the cluster state is asymptotically invariant under local transformation and tends to the distribution corresponding to the state. To the distribution corresponding to the completely mixed state. Let's think a bit what does it mean? We have a distribution, a distribution corresponding to a pure state, but in the asymptotic limit, when the number of particles is large, it looks exactly as a completely mixed state. And if you try to compute high-order moments of spin variables, we will come. Variables, we will convince ourselves that it is like this. So, of course, the correlation measure in this case is zero. Actually, here the plot of the cluster state and locally equivalent orthogonal state. And here, the distance, how it decays when the number of particle grows, basically goes to zero quite quickly. And here, the phase, the discrete phase representation, which are different. Are different. So, the first correlation measure: the separation of the distribution from its Gaussian envelope, it's quite not, it's a good measure, but not good enough. We need something else. And we can introduce the second correlation measure, second macroscopic correlation measure, which basically is the distance from the distribution to the identity distribution. Identity distribution, of course, not the distribution, but the distribution optimized over all local transformation. So this distance from the distribution to the identity distribution basically tells us how invariant our macroscopic distribution is on the local transformation. So basically, it measures the invariance of the macroscopic state under local transformations. Local transformations. And in many cases, it results. This measure also can be computed. For instance, for GZ state, it asymptotically tends to one, but it tends quite slowly. This is analytical expression. The same for W state. It also tends to unity. So we can move it out of the identity state, but also quite slowly. For single state, singlest state, we cannot move very far. Move very far. So it is quite close to identity. Domain wall, yes, we can move quite far from here. And of course, the cluster state cannot be moved away from the identity distribution as we see. An application. Let's consider a unitary evolution of basically any state with efficient dimensions, sufficient logic. Efficient dimensions sufficient large enough under action of such a Hamiltonian. And what we can plot: we can plot evolution of the distribution corresponding to a pure state. Let's start, for instance, with GS state and see how this state, how this distribution evolves. This distribution evolves under action of this Hamiltonian. It is short movie. And this is it. And this is it. It does not move more. So what we observe? We observe that the pure state and the unity evolution evolves into a state which is indistinguishable from the point of view of collective observation. From the point of view of collective observers, from the completely mixed state. Actually, it's a kind of, it's a sort of thermalization process. So, of course, the density matrix does not tend to the identity distribution. Of course, it does not. But if I am collective observables, any collective observables, what I would see, it is a Would see it is a non-unitary evolution. Actually, here is the plot, the distance from the distribution, from the initial distribution to the identical distribution. Of course, in this case, in this case, the correlation measure, in this particular case, is second correlation measure is zero. But it results that for many, many, many states, I mean, for states with large States with large effective dimensions. This is a true correlation measure because it is completely invariant on the local transformation. And the reason is probably quite clear. The effect of this Hamiltonian or locally transformed Hamiltonian basically is the same. Okay, well, so what we have, we can do the following. Having Having a state, any state, not I should stress, not necessarily a symmetric state, we can analyze it from the point of view of collective observables. So basically, collective observables are coarse-grained observables, what we basically deal with in microscopic work. And we can find at least two measures. Least two measures that allow us to judge their correlation properties. One is the distance, is how non-Gaussian state is. More non-Gaussian state, more correlated in some sense, more correlated state is. But if the distribution is very invariant under local transformation, Very invariant under local transformation, it is also a highly correlated state. So we have, we can plot, we can associate to a state points in this two-dimensional plot. Here, the first correlation measure, here the second correlation measure, and see where, for instance, coherent state is located, is located here. Actually, it is one, but since it is exact. It is one, but since it is an exact calculation made, I think for 30 particles or 20 particles, maybe 20 particles, so it is not reached identity value. So it is here. So the correlation measure for the coherent, the first correlation measure, which tells us how non-Gaussian state is close to zero, and the second correlation measure is close to one. Why? Because it's a Gaussian state. A Gaussian state and can be moved out of identity state. I'm finishing, unfinishing, yes. And for instance, GZ state is located here. So it is non-Gaussian state and also very non-invariant under local transformation. Cluster state is here. It is Gaussian state, but does not change under local transformation and all some and some other states. And also and some other similar state functions here. So basically, these two characteristics describe us a sort of collective correlation property of quantum states. And the question, of course, there are many questions, for instance, what how we can apply such properties in practice, but this is a probably a different story. Thank you very much. Different story. Thank you very much. This is it. Thank you, Andre. We have time for just one short question. Andre, just a simple question: how does this visual depiction of the state? Of the state responds to rotations in physical space, rotations, rotations in physical collective rotations. Yeah, so I just rotate the system. It's just solid, it just solved it. Yeah, what's the effect on the visualization? It's just a rotation. I think here, I think I even have here example. This is rotation. This is rotation of the state. This is a solid rotation of the state in the space. When you apply collective rotation. So any collective transformation, collective, I mean, collective group transformation just produces solid rotations. But if the transformation is non-linear, then of course we'll see splitting and deformation and squeezing. Formation and squeezing and whatever you want. Okay, thank you. So it is a covariant under group transformation. But of course, on the level of discrete representation, if we consider discrete representation, then we cannot talk about any covariance, any covariance at all. Again, here, for instance. Here, the same, it is also a collective rotation here presented. A collective rotation here presented. So, from the point of discrete phase space, collective rotation produces just a mess. Okay, let's thank Andre again. There are more questions for him, of course, in the discussion session later today.
