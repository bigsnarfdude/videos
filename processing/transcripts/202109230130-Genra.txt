So I will talk about just the algebra, principle, OSP1 trend. This is in terms of one, it's just a very simple zero model algebra of some example. So very, I think it's very, very easy. So first I introduce the algebra. So now we've jiggled the basic algebra. Related vascular algebra. So we take A and B. We can define star product and dot product. And delta A is just a conformal rate of A. Then we can define the algebra, the V. Lots of people wrote just A of V. This is just a V of quotient V dot V. This is associated algebra. The multiplication used one star. And if you take M as a lower bounded motion, M is a lower bounded module with some lowest weight is m0. This is a shifted component reading, and then in the top lowest weight space, it's just a zero-glow module. And this correspondence gives a nice one-to-one correspondence for simple module of V and simple module of the algebra. This is a very famous theory by Zoo. But now we want to consider sub-particle case. So very subparticle case. So that is the particle case might be not the deep lighter, usually case of a half-winded circulator. In this case, we need to consider, we need some generalization due to cats on one, more general case at the source. We want to define A star B by using gamma A and A dot B also gamma A and gamma A as shifted cohomorph. The shifted cohoma rate, gamma A is defined by A is integer glass. If A is integer glad, this is just a coincidence with usual commodity, but A is half integer graded, we need to shift minus half. So anyway, we can define logo using a little bit complicated formula. It's defined by integer part quotient by integer dot integer part plus half integer part star half integer part. This is the algebra and the third associative in general. And the further for future in general through algebra by multiplication, and this is also has a nice one-to-one correspondence between a simple module P and the same module algebra. So this is very strange definition because you need that people can say why you don't need to use delta A in the definition. The reason is existed one. Accepted one. So let's consider just some straightforward generation. We denote A star three set B as just the same delta A and A dot three set B dot B as also delta A. So in this case, also we can define three set algebra in the same formula. This is also associated with algebra. By definition, V is z related. and b as z related and the large block coincides with precedent large block that if p is proper half integer lighted the simple module of this line block is corresponding to simple lower bounded but swifted module because in this case zero mod of this zero mod is shifted by conflict that confirm weight contains half in in half integer so this means that So this means that this action is constructed using by halfway element. So that's the reason why we cannot use this logic to get simple, just use a simple motion. Anyway, so here we have an example. So if G has a simply algebra or a simple super algebra supercase, we consider only a basic classical case. Anyway, Anyway, a fine vertex algebra and get the algebra just a universal enveloping algebra. And the Virasoro vertex algebra case, the algebra is just a polynomial. But interesting cases is super n equal one, super pure sorrow vertex algebra. This is a flow power half linear. And you see the algebra of super Piosoro is just a polynomial. Very interesting. Very interesting because 3Set1 is different. 3SAT1 is generated by L and auto-generated G and some relation between G and L. This is as a vector space long to free module of polynomial V. So we want to configure the algebra of W algebra. So we take F as an important element in the even part. important element in the even part. And associated with this G and F, we can define W algebra by doing the token reduction and some that is some cohomology. In this case, we consider F is Fringe boundary potent element, then we denote it by WKG. This is called the principal W article G. And G is a simple Lyra Japan case with indiglayed and certifying famous Fading-Franker duality. Of freedom frankly duality. Okay, so I'll cover up to prove that if GS simplegebook case, the algebra of this principle of algebra is isomorphic to center of a universal enveloping algebra by using a cost and filling. Anyway, in this case, the simple lower bounded merge of this W algebra has corresponding one to one corresponding. As corresponding, one to one corresponds to a simple module of the center of a universal enveloping algebra. And so on cats generalize our current theorem to any W algebra that they use twisted algebra. The result is three algebra of W algebra, G and F, is isomorphic to a finite W algebra associated G and F. The finite W algebra is also defined by some cohomology, that is, the finite analog. Homology and the finite canonical go so we want to consider non-trivial but the very simplest example just principle W algebra of OSP1 to n this is super algebra taking v as a half integer graded and the even part is integer graded and odd part is half integer graded and any one case without And n equal one case, this w algebra is isomorphic to n equal one superficial. And generally, this is called factive region of WBN algebra. And the interest point of this algebra is the disc super algebra also satisfying the Fregean functionality. And also, therefore, get show that the twisted algebra of this principle W algebra of OSP1 to M. Of course P1 to N is isomorphic to a finite W algebra, so P1 to N, and it's bridge manipulate element. So, remaining question is what is algebra, I mean non-swifted algebra is. The answer is just same as the other case. So, you see, the definition of Dojo, but very complicated and far from usual, but the other. The W algebra, the algebra of W algebra, but yet the result is the same. The algebra of this principle, W algebra with V1 to N is isomorphic to the center of universal enveloping algebra with V1 to N. So F1 to N also has a high strand isomorphism. So this center is a purely even sub-algebra and isomorphic to while we invariant or coordinate to link of near space of carton sub-algebra. Of carton subalgebra. And this is in n equal one case. This center is generated by just a cashium element. So this coincides with the result by carton one for supervirosola case. And this is natural normal google alarms with the result. And the correlary two is just due to the seldom. There's the injection between a simple local bound module of French part of the algebra is d1 to n and simple module. n and simple modulo center of any part of m the algebra with equal to n so uh it's actually difficult but i have more 20 minutes so i will explain how to prove this 71 so so to prove several and one we have three steps so first one is i prove that uh this logic This algebra of this W algebra is coincides with even part of the precise algebra. And the second part is due to death x. It means that even part is isomorphic to even part of finite Target algebra. And the last part is even part of finite algebra is isomorphic to the center. So first of all, I explained the first step. So now we take P as principal Tappy algebra. Yes, principal tabular algebra, this has long been changed by odd generator and n even generator, n field. And this odd generator, odd field G has home homomorphic n plus half and even field w to j has home rate to j and thanks to the forecast first is pvw general eight by eight if g and w to w four dot to dot w to n. W4 dot W2N and we can show that non-fluid is PBW generated by W2W4 to W2N. So now this means that Zoolog is isomorphic to even part of 36 as a vector space because G is unique for the generator of Swiss algebra. So this means that even part is generated by. Even part is generated by even generators, so at least we can get vector space isomorphism. But now, so the product for A and B, a star product, twisted one and a non-thwist star product coincide because if A and B is integer, even element, in this case, A and B are integer related. So in this case, the shift of conformal weight coincides with the conformal weight. With the conformal weight. So, the definition of the star block is coincides. So, anyway, this isomorphism is isomorphic because algebra associated with algebra. So, this means that we get probably so the algebra coincides with the even that of the precedent algebra. So, the point is how to group 7, 3. So, we explained the schedule for group 73. So we take e to j s w to j and in n plus half is equal to g and we i zero i call it i zero is just the index set for e and define some order from i zero and also define the lexographic order on i as equal to non-negative integer times index set for i for e any i zero and for n for label i is a pair For label i is a pairing of t and alpha. T is non-negative integer, alpha is the index set for e. We have uh we define ei as derivation t and e alpha derivation translation operator. And we define the vector i equal i1 dot is ordered if and only if ij and ij plus are ordered and ij equals ij plus one, then Then corresponding element is either this definition. Now V is strongly generated by this E W to J and G. The normal product of EI1, EI2, IS, but I beta is order if S is a basis. But now, thanks DesoCat, if you replace with normal product by We also get base because we load just as star and we take we define sigma one so it's a complicated finance so we define sigma one this is um just uh some different some complicated element the set of elements of the form of derivation t1 e alpha one star dot T1 standard derivation T alpha s minus some coefficients but the non-derivative element. So I back with condition F I back the code. E alpha j is an even element and sum of tj is positive. The last condition means that at least in the first term derivation appears at least once. And sigma matrix is a set of elements of the form 2 is a set of elements of the form I1, I2, and IS in the even path element. And I vector is order, but Eij is both. So this means that the sigma 2 is some element in the basis, element of S star, that containing all the elements. And define sigma, the sigma 1, sum of sigma 1, sigma 2. Sum of sigma 1 and sigma 2 and w is a spanning set of these elements that we omit the condition i delta is ordered. So this means w contains a not ordered element for i. So by definition, a function set of signal mark is contained in w. So we take j and just even dot even plus what star mod and the larger one is And the larger part is by definition even part coordinated by this J. And the numerator even part has a nice basis using f star intersective even part. And I console, I claim it's J is W J is equal to W is equal to spanning separate sigma. We want to show the equality. So by definition, So by definition, as I said, the spanning set of sigma is contained in W and we can easily show that W is contained in J. But using the induction of S, we can prove that the opposite inclusion between J and W. So we have J equal to W. That to prove the opposite inclusion between spawning set of sigma and W is a very difficult because It's a very difficult because through this last step, we need to show that the not ordered element can be written in terms of ordered elements. So this means that we need to change the order between the basic element, generator element. So to prove this statement, we need a lemma. So if we take g1, g2 is odd, then g1 star g2 plus g2 star g1 is some even element. Some even element.bacuum. So this means that we can change the auto and ot, then the commutator part is some element in j. So this is so useful to prove the last step. And anyway, we get the equality. So a sigma, all elements in sigma is ordered. So this means that sigma is the basis of j. So but the sigma means, so this means the logical. The larger volumes if PV are generated by even generator because sigma means that sigma two sigma two contains all the elements. So this means that the even co-sent by chain for, I mean, sigma two means that we can eliminate some element containing odd. And sigma one means that if derivation happens, we can omit it. We can omit it. I can omit and written in terms of non-derivative elements. So, anyway, we obtain the statement. Okay. So, now we have this first step and the second step is due to the cat. And finally, we will show that the last step is fine W algebra, even part of fine W algebra. W algebra, even part of fine W algebra is isomorphic to synth. So to study fine W algebra, we take beta 1 to beta n as a simple root of p1 to n, such that beta n is odd, and delta plus is a set of positive root, and n plus is usual, you know, sum of positive root vector space, and the n plus is integral n plus is also positive sum of positive. Also, positive sum of the positive root space except for beta n and chi u is a pairing between u and the principal important element. And i chi is the left idea of universal embryo check law generated by u plus chi u that u is the element in n plus. And the interesting lemma is the following: so finite up algebra associated to OSP1 to n and its fringement repository. To n and its fringe menu for the element is isomorphic to n plus adjoint invariant space of some coherent by u covers the i chi this result is essentially proven by the drawing to contain the full hierarchy cat by using the result of ganking to sell them but this selement is only ganking to sell them only follow only proven only proving for real jackla case so they only they can only prove real jplar case uh i mean if for fine wgf this type of statement because but recently uh last weekend she showed that super gangian failure as i said here uh some right hand side adjoint space can be written by the zero cohomology i mean the cohomology homology. I mean the cohomology, they he believe the cohomology vanishing and the isomorphic is a joint space. And then using the Nagasaki and using the same argument of dantric constraint through heroin check, we obtain the lemma shape. And this result is the Poisson version of this statement is known by Wi-Ring Su in the context of the classical limit of WRJ. So this is what So, this is what I need first. Secondly, we need to introduce an interesting object named ghost center. So now we take G as basic classically sub-algebra, that the old part is not previous. And then I'm going to need to introduce an interesting sub-algebra of universal energy algebra named Gauss center. This is sum of the center plus Ag. The Ag is Angel center. defined by this super anti-commutator relation because if a as this element anchenter mean that a b commut with b a that the parity happens that the corresponding parity for a is opposite to a because you see an a bar plus one bar so that's the reason why this is called ant center so the due to gling this both center is just isomorphic This gauze center is just isomorphic to the center of even part of universal framework in algebra. So this means that the gauss center is a purely even sub-algebra. And she constructs some interesting element T in L center. First that if T vanishes a bound module of G, then an equilateral bound module is fairly generic idea. This is some not so This is some natural super generalization of the sepulchre cell. So, this is this means that this biomodule is very, this is the structure of the biomodule very close to the biomodule reaction. This biomodule is called the strongly typical biomodule. Anyway, this t is very useful to know the structure of biomodule. And this t is named Cashmere growth because the square of t is Growth because the square of t is and belongs to the center. And this t is first studied by Pinkson and Newsom for sp12 case and with p1 to n case and Gorek generalized t for any Besch classical algebra. And Gorek-Landman proved that if G is with P1 to N and center if generated by T over center and annihilation. The annexivator of any bar module is generated by its intersection with the ghostocenter. This is the second duphro, the other superversion of some duphrocellum, and this is why she introduced this ghostenta. Anyway, we have the nice gostafenta is just some direct product of fenta plus anti fenta and update the generation. And update a generated by T. So our self-m is finite W algebra associated to OSP1 to N, and principal element is isomorphic to Costa center. But this seldom looks a bit strange isomorphism because fine Target algebra associated with P1 to N and P1 to LM and it's super algebra, but ghost of center is like center pure. ghost center is purely even sub algebra but yet we get isomorphism as associative algebra and this correspondence even part of final algebra corresponds to just a center and odd part corresponds to an architect the proof is not so equipped so we know that pi w algebra part is a pbw generated by g w2 double w2n G w two double w2n and using high sand isomorphism this high sent isomorphism we know that half does adjoint subspace of this quotient space or even part of this adjoint subspace so this means that these adjoint subspaces as I said in the lemma are isomorphic to fine W algebra so we get isomorphism between even part of pine W algebra Even part of point W as well to 10. And considering a map from anti-center to all the part of this adjoint space and mapping T to G, in GSS, we can prove that in GSS, isomorphism of all the part is anchented at the vector space. And showing that the remaining two clubs are 7, 7, you only need to show that the image. you only need to show that the image of scale p is equal to scale g that this can be proven by using the mi-valued so anyway we have proved that the logical principle of osp1n is isomorphic to center of the inverse amber n the separate thank you
