Okay, so our next speaker is Nacho Lopez. Again, he gives good talks, nice talks, so I'm already advertising. So let him prove himself. Okay, thank you very much. Well, I'm going to talk about measuring the closure as to more graphs, but basically. Is to more graphs, but basically focus on the next case. And well, here is my day, but it's joint work with many, many people, with Exu 15 years ago, with people in this table, Joel, Christina, etc. And the good things are that I can jump through here. Are that I can jump through here because Medibility, but the problem everybody knows Graham explains very well. He asked for a nice formula for the more bound, for the mixed case. Remember the mixed case, you play with three parameters, the undirected degree, the directed degree, and the maximum distance, which is the diameter. Distance, which is the diameter, and there is a natural upper bound for the number of vertices that such a graph should have. And the formula basically plays with a recurrence relation. And if you do it in a matrix way, maybe what you obtain is a bit nicer from the beauty point of view. So I think that as mathematicians we should look also for the beauty of the results. But the beauty is every person has a personal so a personal I mean everybody probably the beauty is not the same for everybody but I think that this formula is quite nice and also it's Nice. And also in this table, which is this formula applied to these values, in both phase you can see the Murban for the directed case and how it grows when you add the directed arcs. So for emeter 2 you have just the number of arcs grows linearly and with coefficient 1 and then it's a different way. So this is the relationship between So this is the relationship between the undirected Moore bound. The undirected Moore bound and the directed Moore bound, they have very nice formulas and they are very easy to write. But it's not the case for the Lux case, for the general case. But if you see in this way, you see the relation. And then maybe you can figure out something different. Okay, so. Okay, so again, the next morphs, well, this is something that Graham mentioned. This is a quite old problem. It's from 1978. It's a nice paper from COSAC, but nobody pays attention to this paper at the moment. And until 2005, there is nothing done in Luxembourg Refs, nothing done. Nothing done, nobody pays attention. And then in 2005, Mirika Millia starts to look at this problem and then explodes. And there is a lot of papers now about these move-ups. Of course, it's a generalization of the directed move-ups and the undirected move-ups. And you know, there are basically. Mographs and very few directed more graphs, only for the trivial cases. And for the undirected case, you know that it is still an open question. And I know that we are here to solve problems, but I don't recommend to study. Okay, because it could be a punch in your face. And maybe you can start from as Waller, the ones that Rahman presented before. He put these necessary conditions for the existence of proper mixed murales, that is the case when you have at least one arc and one edge. And again, Mossack. In 1978. 1978. And this gives you a way to produce, try to search for mixed more graphs. If you play with this equation, for instance, put just C equal to 1, then you have R equal to 1. And then whatever set that you play here, you can find the cost drivers, for instance, pina mixed rubber. Pay not mix more. This is the smallest case. But if you put here a 3, then you have r equal to 3, and then for z equal to 1, you have this one. Again, Bossark. But basically, this is the situation. Yeah, I've explained this. The first unknown case is 88 vertices, but if you want to play with You want to play with something, I would recommend. You recommend the case R equal to 22, right? And set equal to 2. Well, my suggestion is R equal to 21 and set equal to 1. And this is what they call the little monster. It's smaller than the big monster. And it has very nice, nice properties, this case. For instance, For instance, is the only case which set equal to one that remains open. Okay? And their existence is related if you remove the x, if it exists, and you remove the x of this mixed graph, then you should obtain an angular graph with diameter 4, which is this angular graph. Which is this time regular? Which, of course, its existence is not decided. Okay? But I mean, this problem is related to more extremal problems. Okay? Well, so the point is that there are a few more reps. So we suggest to study We suggest to study graphs that are in some sense close to moon graphs. Okay? This is what the talk is about. So, and there are three, remember, the degree aimeter problem has involved three parameters. The order of the graph, the degrees, and the parameter. So you can relax one of them and you obtain a different variation of the plot. Of course, the graphs of order close to Moore bound, this is the second one. This is in fact the degree diameter problem. To find graphs as largest as possible with the other parameters fixed. But we can do something that Jov mentioned before. What if we remove some art? Well, this is from the girl's point of view, but from the diameter, you can... But for the diameter, you can add some edges. Or if you want to allow some vertices to have a degree a bit longer than what the program says. These are all neural graphs. This is only one picture from the situation, and it's quite old. And the one that I'm going to talk here is the parameter relax version. When you relax, the diameter version version version When you relax the diameter condition. How? Some vertices you want that have the eccentricity, the maximum distance, as the value k, but some other you relax the maximum distance, allowing a bit a bit that they have some vertices a bit farther away than k, k plus delta. Well, in fact we claim with delta equal to one. In fact, we play with that equal to one. Okay? And this is what is called mixed, sorry, radio volunteers. And here we claim with the next version. For instance, let's go to the undirected case, which VR is cubic case, R3, and set equal to zero. If you see at zero in this parameter, then you're in a pure case, undirected. In a pure case, undirected or directed. Okay? So we have one more graph, we know. But if we relax the condition that every vertex must have eccentricity to that vertex reach any other vertex in two steps. And you alone that some vertices must have these stems, three, then you have four more. Okay? Okay? So the set of, there are five radiomographs in this case. Okay? And the vertex in white are those that its behavior is the same that the behavior that has a vertex in our graph, any vertex in our graph. And the black ones here are those where we allow the uh the distance a bit more, three in this case. Three in this case. Okay, I'm gonna tell three. Okay, so relaxing this condition just while this relaxation is very small, but it allows a lot of graphs in some cases. There are many parameters where we know that moon graphs doesn't exist, quadrature moon graphs, there are plenty of them. We did We did this with EXU a lot of years ago, in 2020 or something. Now we are working in the big scale and again we have a lot of graphs. Of course it can be done in more cases. So now the point is that we have a lot of population of graphs and we would like to rank them according to their proximity to Egypt and Moore. This is the the closeness measures. Is the closeness measures that I want to talk about? Of course, the number of white vertices that I see before, it could be a measure. But the problem is that it's not a finer measure. Because for instance, in this case, or in the case before, let's hear. Here, this one has four central vertices, but the other three has just one. And this one has two. So this will be the close. So, this will be the closer to this one with this measure. Okay? But here, for instance, the maximum number of vertices is four. And this graphs has order 11. But there are 38 of these graphs. So, which one is the best? Which one is the closest? We need finer measures. Okay, one is playing with the distances because one thing. Because one thing that characterizes a mura is the murtree. And what we have is you can compute the status, which is the sum of all distance for a given vertex in a Moor graph. And in a radial Moor graph, this is more than the value that you have in a Moore graph. So you have a characterization of So you have a characterization of Moon graph in these terms. And using this, you can measure a distance for a graph to be a new graph using a pinor, for instance. And basically this is the idea. Let me jump through here. For instance, in this case, every vertex here has a status of 15. Status of 15. What it means is if you have removed tree in a cubic case, you have three vertices here and six. These are at distance one and these are at distance two. Cool. The sum is 15. This is what it means, this 15. There are 10 vertices and the estatus is 15. Okay, so in the set of order demographs, the best that you can do. Or a demographic, the best that you can do is this. This is the best that you can do. Two vertices with the status 15 and 8 with the status a bit more, 16. And this gives a normal of 8. This has only two central basis, and this has 4, but this is closer from this point of view. Okay? Well, you can play with this and. With this, and this is the previous one. And even in the cases that you don't have more graph, but you know what, if it exists, you know what it will be, the sum of the distances in the root tree. Use this value and you know it. And taking this into account, then you can find the one that has this number. These numbers closer to these ones. Another one, EPA. For undirected degree 4, here we have a tie between these two. And when you have a tie, you use another norm, the norm2, and you can, sometimes you can untie. And this one is, no, this one is better. Is no, this one is better than this one. And for mixed case, because we did this with the effectual I don't know, in this case, well, mixed case, it's more fun because you have more situations, this one at the closest to a hypothetical mixed mugraph, it doesn't exist, and here we have a tie, a tie because they have exactly the same. Because they have exactly the same values. So we have a type what we do. Change the measure. And well, in fact, these two graphs are constructive. And this gives us the idea to use a spectral measure to give a different point of view. And why radial moorafs, I think that they are good to search, to come to the first problem, to search for moors. Because we have some theoretical things that says that if you have a moon graph and you modify it a little bit by trapping some edges or arcs under some conditions, then you obtain a radial moon graph which is the best possible. Which is the best possible with this closeness measure. So look at the other way. You can use this, use the space of any more graph as a searching space to find more graphs in case where their existence is unknown. This is one possibility. For instance, and you can start with a radical graph which is very bad. This is the measure of the closeness. Of the closeness. And you start from very far from here is the mugraph. We say non-zero. And then you can play with a simulated learning algorithm something that cross edges, cross edges, sharp edges, basically. And if your graph is better, then, okay, you keep it. And then you Okay, you keep it. And then you go and you allow with an extra to go worse, but to avoid local minimax or something like that. This is not. And if it is, for instance, this is a case of reduced to 1 degree 7. If it is, you find it. This is Kaufmann singleton, for instance, starting from a regular graph. So this is a possibility to play with. In some cases, where the existence Some cases where the existence is unknown and the methods maybe they are difficult to prove their non-existence. Well, at least it gives you an idea if it exists or not. Because if you're in this case, you probably just said it doesn't exist. Until you find it perfect. But as I said before, sometimes the spectra plays a Sometimes the spectra plays a prominent role in the parameter problem because basically the non-existence of some cases is proven using spectra. So basically a Mu graph basically satisfies of diameter two, satisfies its adjacency matrix, satisfies Energy matrix satisfies this equation, and you can see this as a polynomial on the adjacency matrix, satisfies this equation. And of course, another way to measure the closeness to a Mu'raph is taking a Radi-Mu'raph, take its adjacency matrix, evaluate this expression, and look. Expression and look how close is to being the all-white matrix. It's a different approach, and then to descend, we use how close of a matrix, we use the spectral norm of a matrix, which is this one, and the closest is the one that has this smallest one. And for instance, this one was the best. This one was the better, the best with the status normal, with the previous one, with the distance X. And here I take another one, which is worse than this one. So this one is close than G1. But it's not the best. The best is this one. This one in this case gives the less. So this is the closer with this new normal. The closure with this new norm, spectral norm. One thing that is curious is that all the best graphs here, the automorphism group, is the trivial one. They are quite symmetric. This one is quite symmetric. But when you play with mixed cases, you have arcs, little changes produce that the automophorous group becomes trivial. And And the last one approach, using the spectral vector, by using where the eigenvalues are located. By seeing this is the idea. Let me jump through this. This is the background. And remember the mathial equation that I said that any A mixed MURAF of Lemet M2 must satisfy. So, what we can do is take your candidate to become a MURAF, compute its spectra, and replace the values of the spectra here. Because if it's a MURAF, what you get is all zeros. Because this the spectra of the MURAF is encoded here. Is encoded here with the zeros of this polynomial. So if you have the old zeros vector, then you have a mixed Moore graph. The problem is that the complex system two, I mean you have cospectal graphs that one is a mixed move graph and the other is not a mixed move graph. And so here this measure sometimes This measure sometimes can graph. But anyway, I think that is a nice way to approximate more graphs. And moreover, I don't know that I would finish again. Again, the norm equal to the this is this this is the the The wheeler with the status measure, with the distance. And we can do it, it's for only the distance, but we can do it better with this one, which is a distance two from the Mu graph. Let us look at the spectra of these graphs. So the Mu graph, it doesn't exist here. But if it exists, the spectra will be, the eigenvalues will be three and these two other, which are the roots of this. Which are the roots of this phenomenon. In fact, why there is no mu graph here? Because we know that the spectrum will be this, but the problem is the multiplicities, which are not integers in these cases. Okay? But you have the values of the M values. And look at these graphs. They have, of course, everybody has this specific value, which is the peroff, which is the peronigen value. The peronic in balance, the long number, which is the bigger, the largest, because the negularity. Then we also have these ones, these four times, and these three times. And then we have other sporadic eigenvalues, which leads to you these values, two and four. Okay? And ah, yes. Ah, yes. This okay. The largest English value is three. So the theory says that every regular graph with degree three, the eigenvalues must be inside this circle. This is one mixed random graph chosen at random, and all these points are all the eigenvalues. There are 11 because logo is 11. Because the order is 11. Okay, they could be some repeated. In this case, they are non-repeated. This will be always because they're regularity. And now I'm going to play all the spectra for all 94086 graphs. What do you think? They will be at random here, the points? Because the matrix is not symmetric in the X-Case. So you have complex values here. So the answer is. So the answer is no. They lie only in this particular region and they give a, I don't know why, these holes here surrounding some values. If we take a closer look, the structural marks on the cultivation. This is the Duplicate marks. For me, for me. Why the spectra is... The spectra gives this picture. Here, the size of the points are the occurrences of the values in all these graphs. Of course, this has all these occurrences because it's graph. But here is lambda 1 and lambda 2, which are the values of the mu graphs. So, what I mean here is that radio mu're graphs are a good approximation of mouse in this sense. Of Mirage in this sense. Why? Because they preserve also the spectra. Well, but you have more things here, but they look like diaspora. But why these gaps, these holes? Why also 1 and minus 1 are so many times here? The real line, of course, don't match to be to lie in the real line, but they are. Line, but they are more often in the ray line than in the complex plane. It's fantastic. Okay, we have some generalizations for other diameters using other equations, but I'm not going to speak about here. Okay, some research lands, maybe new measures. If you feel that If you feel that the closeness to a murgraph, in fact, why are you doing this? Because I fail. I failed to find mural graphs. So I'm a loser. I'm a loser. So what a loser do? You can't get the prettiest girl in the town. So maybe you go to the surroundings. Surroundings. So that's that's maybe the I don't the comparison is not good. Yeah, that's why only half of the room left. Maybe there is, maybe you think about another way to get close to a moon graph. I don't know. Just put a measure and see what happens. This spatial fraud mu graph is very interesting because until now, Because until now, for each value, there exists a radium graph. But it seems that for this case, there is no radium graph. This is for you, Jeff, this question. And of course, the research in particular versions of the problem is very nice. What would the order be? Sorry? What's the order? 27, I think. Second, I think. I think okay. I think she is sorry. Tell that it's time, it's time.
