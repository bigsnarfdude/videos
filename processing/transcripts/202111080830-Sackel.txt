Well, yeah, so thank you for that introduction. As Baptiste said, I think the goal of some of these first talks is to be understandable, maybe more than comprehensive. So if I don't cover everything that's in these slides, I think that's okay. I just, you know, you should feel free to interrupt with questions, any questions that you have, because in the end, the main goal is just that we're all. The main goal is just that we're all on the same page. So, the first thing I want to talk about is, you know, just we have this phrase locally conformal symplectic. And I think sometimes, you know, it's important to sort of realize why it's called this. Why do we have the word locally in there? Why do we have the word conformal in there? So, if we start with symplectic geometry. Symplectic geometry, we know what a symplectic manifold is. It's just a manifold together with a two-form, which is closed and non-degenerate. And locally, it satisfies the Starbuck theorem, stating that, you know, locally, omega just looks like the standard omega that you would find on R2n. So, what should conformal mean? Well, conformal is a term, I guess, that's Formal is a term, I guess, that's used quite a bit to say that some sense of scale, you're allowed to have things be equivalent up to some sense of scale. So we call something a conformal symplectic transformation. If you have a map from, say, one symplectic manifold to another, it's said to be conformal symplectic. If when you pull back the symplectic form, you get some scale of the other symplectic form. form and here we impose that c is locally constant so we have that the scale factor we're going to suppose that it's positive that's not necessarily something that we need to do we could in principle actually have also negative factors if we wanted but it's very typical to suppose that we have a positive factor and we suppose that it's locally constant there's good is not not connected in your assumption i'm not going to assume yeah i'm not going I'm not going to assume, yeah, I'm not going to assume connectedness throughout for the most part. And we'll see why in a second. So one of the points to make is that actually this locally constantness is extraneous in dimension at least four. So if you have that, you have two symplectic forms and you pull back, you get some positive locally constant factor. Sorry. Constant factor, sorry, some positive scaling factor, that factor is actually automatically locally constant. So in dimension two, we should just, we kind of just impose it. We say, let's just take conformal symplectic to mean that the scale factor is locally constant. Okay, so what is a globally conformal symplectic manifold then? So we should think about it as you have a symplectic manifold, but you lose a sense of scale. You're allowed to Lose a sense of scale. You're allowed to take the symplectic form and scale it by a positive locally constant factor. And so, you know, if you take CPN with the Fubini-Studi metric, and then you take CPN with a thousand times the Fubini-Studi metric, in globally conformal symplectic geometry, these are just the same object. And so if you think about symplectic geometry, you know, you have that there's all sorts of embedding problems, but naively, those embedding problems don't make sense in this global. Don't make sense in this globally conformal symphactic world. So you lose a sense of scale. Now, globally conformal symphactic geometry is not really a good setting to do things in the sense that it's just symplectic geometry where you've lost the sense of scale. But one of the things to note is that you can't just glue globally conformal symplectic objects together. You might come back with some extra scale factor. So you can imagine that if you had a So, you can imagine that if you had a manifold that was covered by two open sets, and you start at some point, you start walking around, and everywhere that you're walking around, you keep track of what your symplectic form is. So you start walking, and then you enter this first region. So you start here, and you enter this first region, and you're keeping track of the symplectic form as you go. Well, okay, now you've entered into this other region, which has some symplectic form. Other region, which has some symplectic form defined up to scale, and they should match on the overlaps. So there's one scale that matches on the overlap. So that allows you now to continue through here. But now when I come back, I might have that coming back, I came back to the same symplectic form, but it was scaled by some positive factor. And so what that means is I couldn't have glued this to a global conformal symplectic object, just because I couldn't have glued these two symplectic objects. These two symplectic objects together. The scales might not quite match it. So the idea is essentially one of sheafification that you should think about, that you should think about on open sets, you want to be able to have some sort of framework where you can glue things together to actually produce a specific object. And therein lies locally conformal symplectic geometry. And here's the first definition of it. So we start with a manifold. So we start with a manifold, M, and we take some sort of collection of charts. So there's some open cover, and on each set in the open cover, we have a legitimately symplectic form. And they satisfy that on the overlaps, you have that the transitions are conformal symplectic. So we have that if you look at the restrictions to the intersections of the open sets, you have that the symplectic forms differ from each other by a locally. Differ from each other by a locally constant factor, by positive locally constant factor. And I should note that a lot of times I'm writing exponentials everywhere because in the end I don't like writing logarithms, but again, you know, you can choose which way you want to write things. And just, you know, typically what you would do if you have a manifold, you want to consider what a smooth manifold is, you can think about it as either an equivalence class of It is either an equivalence class of atlases or a maximal atlas. You can do either of those things here. You can consider, you can call what I've just discussed an atlas, and you can say an LCS manifold then is a maximal such atlas, a maximal LCS atlas. So locally, if I just take a small open set around a point, then open set around a point, then locally locally conformal symplectic geometry is just globally conformal symplectic geometry because you know we have that there's some chart where we have a symplectic form on it and we have this Darboux theorem. Everything looks the same locally. And one takeaway from this definition, if you want to compare locally conformal symplectic and symplectic, is that any symplectic definition or theorem, which is equivariant under positive Which is equivariant under positive scaling factors, or which can be stated and proved in a local to global manner, is likely to be true for these LCS manifolds. So because we've just basically defined everything in such a way that we're saying, okay, we're forgetting everything up to this positive scaling factor, but we're still thinking about it as covered by legitimately symplectic charts in some sense. This takeaway should hold. Now remember that on the overlaps, if we had omega alpha and omega beta, there was some constants, some local locally constant functions, C alpha beta, on the overlaps. And these form the check, these have the check-cocycle condition, these satisfy the check-cocycle condition. So we obtain an element of the first cohomology of M. And that element of the first cohomology is called the Leekley. Of the first cohomology is called the Lie class. So, geometrically, what you could do is you, you know, we had this picture before where we walked around in a loop and we came back with some where we ended up at the same symplectic form, but scaled by some positive factor. And essentially, geometrically, the Lie class is just the negative of the holonomy. So, if you walk around, and maybe I should say there are sort of sign choices implicit. I've tried to. Sign choices implicit. I've tried to use the same sign choices throughout this presentation, but depending on where exactly you read, it might be slightly different with an opposite sign. But the lead class, as I'll say, is the negative of the holonomy. So you come back with the scale factor, and that's the negative. And of course, if you walk back around any path and you got back to the same symplectic. Path and you got back to the same symplectic form, then that simply you could have just thought that there was one symplectic form on your whole space. And okay, we're saying that we're in this sort of conformal world. So this will be globally conformal symplectic, if and only if the Lie class is zero. So one way to think about this is the following. You know, suppose that we take two of these sets in our atlas, two of these sets in our atlas. Two of these sets in our atlas, and we glue them together on regions where omega alpha equals omega beta. We just take them and glue them. So you can imagine I had lying over M, I'm taking the same set, but so I have this blue and this red set from before. I'm taking the same set, but where I'm imagining, let me see, where I'm imagining maybe here, maybe here I had some omega and on this upper guy. And on this upper guy, I have the same set, but I have, I don't know, 1.1 times omega. And I apologize for terrible handwriting on this. Didn't expect it to be like that. You know, so I follow this around and on this other set, so this is omega alpha and omega alpha. And maybe here I have omega beta and I multiply and get 1.1 omega beta. But now when I come But now, when I come back, I'm going to see that to get from omega alpha to omega beta, you know, maybe this was, I had to multiply by two or something. So, what I can do is I can just say, okay, well, instead of gluing this thing, I can just sort of say, you know, take this thing where I'm not gluing it together. Just sort of glue all of these copies together only where omega alpha equals omega beta. And so, what we end up with in that case is the following definition. Is the following definition. So a locally conformal symplectic manifold is a flat principal R plus bundle with an equivariant leafwise symplectic form. So if you like, on each leaf, so I have this bundle over M, and on each leaf, we said that, well, here, on this leaf, we just had omega alpha, and on this leaf, we just had omega beta. Those are legitimately symphonic forms. So you can imagine this kind of So, you can imagine this kind of principal bundle where on all of the leaves I have legitimately symplectic forms. I see a confused look, so maybe I'll ask if there's a question. So, you start with the lookaries, I can't hear you. So I can't hear you. I don't know if it's just me. Or maybe, maybe. Do you hear me now? Yes. Yeah, I forgot, but you so I'm confused. So you start with a singular class. And I don't care how you get the R plus bundle out of yeah. So I have on. So here's the picture on the base itself. So this is this is on M. I have one chart here. I have one guy. Start here. I have one guy here, and I have another guy here. And so on each of those sets, what I have is, remember that I have all sorts of, so if I call this u, I have all sorts of things. I have everything that's of the form u e to the c times some omega u. I have this full collection. Those collections, what I'm doing is I'm Those collections, what I'm doing is I'm saying don't glue those together. None of those match up. But consider there's this infinite kind of family of regions. Okay, so for each open set in your atlas, you have already this U times R. Yes. Okay. Or R plus. Okay. Okay. And now what I'm saying is you're only gluing them together where they actually, where the symphlectic forms actually equal each other. Okay. So this problem of like coming back with. So, this problem of like coming back with a different factor that's representing now the fact that when I go around, I might have come back to a different leaf. But I get, I still get this principle bundle where this, you know, each leaf now has a legitimately symplectic form, and that symplectic form is equivariant with respect to the action on the fiber. Okay, so I will say that this is. So, I will say that this is my sort of favorite way to think about locally conformal symplectic geometry. So, I'm a little bit biased towards this, but to me, this feels very conceptual because the Lie class, if you like, it becomes something topological. It's the holonomy of a bundle instead of being geometric, instead of being represented specifically by a one form. Okay. But I'll say more about that in a second. But I'll say more about that in a second. So, if you have this principal bundle, one of the things that you could do is, you know, locally, this principal bundle looks like a bunch of sort of stacked pancakes. And what you could do is you could take a section of this bundle. So, some, you know, some section of this bundle. And at every point, you know, at every point, you have that. Know at every point, you have that you're passing through some specific leaf, which has some specific symplectic form. So once I have a section, I actually get a two form on the base itself, which is kind of tautological by picking out which leaf I'm passing through. And there's a way to write that in terms of the connection form. So if I choose a section, then I have. Section, then I have that instead of just having a holonomy, I get a connection form eta, which is a closed one form. And locally, what I have is that omega restricted to the set U alpha is some positive factor times omega alpha. So it satisfies that eta restricted to u alpha, it's closed, so locally it's exact, dg alpha, and that's what the scaling factor is. Okay. And it satisfies, if you like, there's this operator d sub eta, where if you just check, we've defined this omega in terms of these omega alphas, where omega alpha is closed, we have that omega is just sort of d eta closed. It satisfies this equation. So if you like, d eta is something like. Is something like, how should I say? e to the g alpha d e to the minus g alpha locally. So the fact that omega alpha was closed, now we basically remove the scale factor e to the g alpha. So we see that omega alpha being closed tells us that omega is sort of d eta closed. So if you like, you can forget about everything. So, if you like, you can forget about everything that I just said and just remember that there's some way to say what a locally conformal symplectic manifold is in terms of differential forms, which I think is sometimes more comfortable and is how a lot of the literature is written. So we have that a strict locally conformal symplectic manifold is a triple, m eta omega, where eta is a closed one form. That's the connection form corresponding to the section. Of the corresponding to the section. A non-degenerate two-form, which isn't necessarily closed, but it does satisfy a twisted closeness instead. So it satisfies that d omega minus eta wedge omega equals zero. And so an LCS manifold, then, what is an LCS manifold? Well, I said in order to pick out one of these strict LCS manifolds, what we had to do was we had to. What we had to do was we had to pick a section, but we can always change that section by the graph by some amount. And so, what we get is that a strict, an LCS manifold should be a strict LCS manifold up to some sort of equivalence that comes from changing the section. And that equivalence is this gauge equivalence, which is that we can take eta and add an exact one form, df, so long as we modify omega by multiplying it by e to the f. By multiplying it by e to the f. Okay. This operator d sub eta, it satisfies a bunch of properties which are which are quite useful. So first of all, the cohomology is always finite-dimensional. We have that the cohomology is essentially topological in this. In this eta. So if I take eta and I add dg, then I get an isomorphism between these cohomologies just by multiplying by e to the g or e to the minus g. Probably won't be able to figure out the sign off the top of my head, but okay. There's a functoriality. So if I have a map from m to n, then I get a pullback map on Get a pullback map on cohomology so long as I also pull back this twisting form. There's a cut product or a wedge product, I suppose, where what I can do is I can take an ith and j-th cohomology class, but I don't necessarily need the same eta. I can take eta and eta prime, and the amount of twisting that's being encoded by these eta and eta primes, they add. So, for example. Um, so for example, this is telling you that this twisted, this Lichnerowich-Duram cohomology is a module over ordinary cohomology. There's a Kunneth theorem. So this is sort of the usual Kunneth theorem, but where I have to have that the one form on the product is basically given by, you know, pull back the one form on the first factor and add the pullback of the one form on the second. Add the pullback of the one form on the second factor. There's Hodge theory for this. So there's an L2 decomposition, just like the standard Hodge decomposition. And if M is closed and oriented, then we also have Poincaré duality. So we have that the ith cohomology with for the eta class. For the eta class, we take the dual, we get just the cohomology, but with minus eta instead. By the way, if it's not oriented, then you can still work out a theory, but you have to basically encode also. So Ada, you might also endow with a first Stiefel-Whitney class, and then you also have to include the first, you know, you have to twist by the orientation of M. Of M. Okay. So, just some guiding principles on these definitions. So, we have basically two types of things. We have this principal bundle or this atlas definition, and we have this differential form definition. So, the principal bundle or atlas definition has on-the-nose symplectic geometry built in, right? We were looking at symplectic forms sort of which were actually symplectic. Sort of which were actually symplectic, they were closed in sort of the standard way. Whereas the differential form version, we had this twisted symplectic geometry with this operator d eta. In the principal bundle version, we had that the Lie class was topological. We had that it came about as some sort of holonomy. Whereas here, in the differential form version, the Lie class is geometric. You've chosen a representative of it, which is the Lie form. Which is the Lie format. And finally, for the principal bundle, you know, if you're used to symplectic geometry, then I think that the principal bundle is sort of topologically conceptual, what's going on, because you know what tools already work in symphlectic geometry. That being said, most tools that work in, you know, most sort of basic tools in symphlectic geometry, they also work on the differential form side without much extra effort. So a lot of times it's Extra effort. So, a lot of times it's just easy to prove the same theorems for differential forms for this twisted version by analogy. Okay. So that's the first part of the talk. Is there any question about this? Okay, I'll go on. Okay, I'll go on then. So that brings me just to a handful of examples that I want to say. So the first example is the following. So suppose that I had a closed one form on a manifold X, and I consider the cotangent bundle with the standard Louisville form, PDQ. So what I can do is I can just take, I can, you know, beta, I said it was closed, so I can just. I said it was closed, so I can just take beta or really the pullback of beta as a closed one form, and I can define omega to be this instead of just d lambda, I make it d eta lambda. Okay, so there's something to check. You should check that omega is actually non-degenerate, but it's not too hard to do. But you obtain an LCS manifold in this case, um, which uh Which I don't know if it has a standard name. Maybe somebody knows some sort of twisted coat, some sort of twisted cotangent bundle. It's twisted by beta in some sense. A remark is that omega we see is explicitly d eta of lambda. And in that case, we call the LCS structure exact when the two-form is d eta. The two form is d eta of a one form, and I should say that you know, for the if you want, you could also define this in terms of the other definitions we've had so far. So for an atlas, for the for our atlas where we have this u alpha and omega alpha, you could say that omega alpha is itself d lambda alpha, and lambda, the lambda alphas have to satisfy the same, they're the same up to scale. So there's that's that's one way that you could say it. One way that you could say it, or in the principal bundle version, you know, where we had these symphlectic leaves, you just had that the leaves themselves are exact symphlectic, and there's also something to say about finding an equivariant primitive, but it's actually automatic once the leaves are exact symphlectic. So you, okay. So you don't you don't need to do too much. Okay, um, the next example. The next example might be called the LCSification. So, if you start with a contact manifold, an explicit and an explicit contact form, alpha, you can take its symplectization. You can take r cross y and take d of e to the t alpha. So this is a simple, you know, r cross y with this is a symplectic manifold. And the L C Sification is LCSification is an LCS structure on R mod Tz cross Y. So what do you do? So maybe I'll just say the differential form version first. So the differential form version, what you do is you take eta to be minus dt, and you take omega to be this dt plus alpha, dt wedge alpha plus d alpha. And this makes sense why you would want to take this if you like. why you would want to take this if you like d of e to the t alpha is just e to the t times dt wedge alpha plus d alpha and so we see that this form is just what we're taking down here and essentially this e to the t tells you that when you move in the t direction that when you move in the t direction you're scaling the you're scaling the um you're scaling this form so that's being encoded by the fact that we've taken this le form minus dt here okay this example is also exact uh in fact omega is just equal to d eta of alpha and this is actually automatic in this case if you look at the cohomology the minus dt A cohomology, the minus dt cohomology of r mod tz cross y, you get that at zero. And if you like, this is a simple computation by the Kunneth formula. This is just the cohomology with respect to minus dt of the circle tensored with the cohomology of y. Of y and now you can check that this, so negative dt is never is never exact in this case. And you can check that in this case, we get that this is equal to zero. You can check it for h0 quite explicitly and then apply Poincaré duality if you like. like. Basically for the circle, the only time that you get cohomology, the only time you get cohomology is if you have something exact for the twisting. Okay. More generally, if I have a covering map from X to Y, then what I can do is I can take an LCS structure on Y and I can pull it back. structure on y, and I can pull it back to x. You know, in terms of differential forms, I'm just pulling back the forms themselves. In terms of an atlas, I just look at the pre-image of the atlas and then look at the maximal atlas that it generates. But conversely, if I start with x omega being symplectic and I know that my deck transformations are conformal symplectic, then that L C S structure will descend to an L C S structure on one. LCS structure on y such that the pullback is the original thing. So, in particular, you know, you can think alternatively, here's a fourth definition of locally conformal symplectic, that an LCS structure on M is actually a globally conformal symplectic structure on the universal cover, such that the deck transformations are conformal symplectic. A remark is that you don't actually. A remark is that you don't actually need to take the full cover. You can just take the cover corresponding to the cohomology class eta, basically, the cover which kills the holonomy, the minimal cover which kills the holonomy. And so you can just consider a globally conformal symplectic structure on that. And a locally conformal symplectic structure on Y, then it turns out, is exact if and only if the globally conformal symplectic structure on each Structure on each of these M etas, these sort of minimal covers that you need is exact. By the way, maybe I should make this remark also because I don't think I made it, but these guys, these lifts, these are the leaves of the principal bundle. So if you like the principal bundle definition. And you want to know what the leaves are, you know, because it might be that you come around some direction and you actually go, you know, get back to the same place. These are just what each leaf is in the principal bundle. There's also a bunch of non-exact examples. So here's a non-exhaustive list for sure. Non-exhaustive list for sure. If you take a globally conformal symplectic structure, which is not exact as a symplectic manifold, then it's not going to be exact in this world either. So there's plenty of examples there. Like any closed symplectic manifold, if you look at the globally conformal symplectic structure it generates, can't be exact by Stokes' theorem. There are certain solved manifolds that were described by Bunyan. That were described by Banyaga, which are not exact. Also, if you have what we might call, and I'll talk more about sub-manifolds a little bit later, a two-sphere, which is an LCS sub-manifold, then you can't be exact. Just because if you have this symplectic two-sphere, then the restriction would have to be exact. So you can't have that because that's a Because that's a closed manifold. It has no H1, so it would have to be globally conformal symplectic. And there was this remark that Apostola Benvluski proved that any compact complex surface actually has a locally conformal symphlectic structure, in fact, taming the complex structure. And so it turns out that any compact complex surface with a rational curve has a non-exact locally conformal symphlectic structure. Exact locally conformal symphactic structure. And also, just a point to make, which is that there's an H principle for symplectic manifolds. And so you can just apply that to this locally conformal symplectic setting directly, which in dimension greater than or equal to six, it suffices to find a homotopy class. If I have an LCS structure and I have a homotopy class, Structure, and I have a homotopy class of map from a sphere into M such that the pullback is non-zero in this cohomology, then that automatically means that this couldn't have been exact. So I don't know if this last point is written anywhere, but it follows just directly from the fact that LCS geometry is really just. L C S geometry is really just in a neighborhood of the sphere, there's no cohomology, so you're just looking at standard symplectic geometry. Okay, are there any questions about the examples portion of the talk? Am I right that for this last point, probably is there like a Probably, is there like a normal bundle condition or something like this? So let's see. So you're looking. So I mean, as stated, as stated, this should be true just because it doesn't matter what the neighborhood looks like. You're still just applying the H principle to something of co-chair. Applying the H principle to something of codimension at least four in a symplectic in a symplectic manifold. But there it might be that, you know, in terms of what the neighborhood actually is, you have to classify symplectic vector bundles, symplectic vector bundles over S2, conformal symphlectic vector bundles over S2, where like the scaling factor is discrete. So like the classification of symplectic vector bundles that you need is basically over Basically, over simp, it is over the group simp cross R with its discrete topology, R plus with its discrete topology. And that will give you what the neighborhood looks like. Okay, yeah, great. Great. Okay, any other questions? Okay, so I now, the last thing I want to talk about is just what are isomorphisms in locally conformal symplectic geometry? And in particular, you know, how does the Moser trick apply, which is one of the main tools that we use in symplectic geometry in order to say that there's some flexibility in the theory, for example, to prove the Darboux theorem. So, you know, in terms of an isomorphism, we have In terms of an isomorphism, we have all these various definitions, and we can say what it means in all of these. So it's a diffeomorphism such that if you look at the Atlas version, you can just say that on charts, if you look at what you're doing between charts, you always have that the transformations are conformal symplectic. If you look at the principal bundle version, and in part, this is why I like the principal bundle version a lot, you have that. You have that, you know, so the principal bundle comes with these leaves, which are legitimately symplectic. And what an LCS isomorphism is, is it's a bundle isomorphism which preserves the symplectic form on the nodes. There's no scaling factor in this. An LCS isomorphism is actually a symplectic isomorphism of each leaf. And finally, for forms, you just have. And finally, for forms, you just have the pullback is gauge equivalent. You have a gauge equivalence of pullbacks. So that's saying, you know, gauge equivalent, if they're gauge equivalent, they're really generating the same LCS structure. So that's all it could possibly mean. I should say that, you know, I've said sort of three versions of this definition, and there's something minor, there's something. There's something minor, there's something minor, some minor point to say, which is that I said it was a diffeomorphism, and I really meant on the manifold itself, not like if I'm looking at the principal bundle, the full principal bundle. But it turns out that if it's an LCS isomorphism, then you can extend it uniquely through the principal bundle. There's sort of only one way to possibly extend it because we have to send leaves to leaves. So, anyways. Anyways, um okay and you know just a remark is that the Lie class is topological, right? If we look, we have that we're taking an isomorphism of principal bundles, so the holonomies have to get sent to each other, or if you like, from the symplectic, from the differential form perspective, we have these one forms, and we have that the pullback of the cohomology class is the cohomology class. Class is the cohomology class. So we can ask then which vector fields, you know, if we now fix the LCS manifold, we can ask which vector fields are actually generating automorphisms in this category. So, for this, let me just use the differential form perspective. Yeah, again, you don't have to, but let's use the differential. Do, but let's use the differential forum perspective. So, if we look at what we're saying, remember that the pullback of this eta, of this twisting closed one form, has to stay the same because the lead class is topological. So, in the end, you're only allowed to add some exact term, some dgt. And in order, you know, now that we're adding this dgt, what that means is that. What that means is that the pullback of omega has to basically be e to the gt omega. And okay, there's an extra locally constant factor that I could include in either of these terms. And I'm just basically saying include it into the second term, into this first equation. And when you include it into this first equation, it just gets killed. So suffices to study this pair of equations. And in particular, the second one. If you take a derivative of the second one, Second one, you end up getting that, so you can compute that this sort of twisted Lie derivative of omega is equal to a constant times omega. And one of the things maybe I should note is: so I've written what the lead derivative is in general in this setting, but of course, omega itself is closed with respect to this d eta. With respect to this d eta. So this second term I could ignore, and I just have that d eta of the interior product of x into omega is some constant times omega. So that's great. We have that we're looking for vector fields which satisfy this equation for Cx, some locally constant function. Locally constant function, and we see that. Uh, oh, I should have probably switched the size the slides a little bit because I haven't defined this exactly, but if x satisfies this equation, we'll say that x is in this sort of math frac simp. So that's what we'll say it means for, I should probably put L Cut L C S's everywhere, but for this talk, everything. Is everywhere, but for this talk, everything is everything means LCS. Okay, um, so there's an assignment from these locally conformal symplectic vector fields to the first cohomology, which is just given by take what this constant Cx is. And this is called the extended Lie homomorphisms, the homomorphism. And it's a morphism of Lie algebras where on H0 of M, I'm taking. Where on H0 of M, I'm taking the trivial, you know, I'm thinking of it as abelian. And it's independent under gauge equivalence. So what this means is that, you know, what does it mean to be a morphism of Lie algebras? This just means that C sub X Y is equal to zero. And I should say that, you know, what is this CX really? You know, I just said that it was independent under gauge equivalence. And I think that's sort of easiest to see if we rephrase this in terms of what's going on in the universal cover. We're literally just, you know, if we take now the lift of x itself to the universal cover, we just have that the Lie derivative of that legitimately symplectic force. Of that legitimately symplectic form, it's not twisted anymore, is just a constant or a locally constant function times this lift of omega. So if you like, it's like scales of Louisville forms together with symplectic vector fields. And the sign of Cx is telling you whether or not you're expanding or contracting this legitimately symplectic form. This legitimately symplectic form, or alternatively, from the principal bundle direction, it basically tells you whether you're moving up or down in the fiber direction on the principal bundle. So you can imagine that if Cx is zero, you're basically just moving along the leaves of this principal bundle. But if Cx is greater than zero, you're also sort of pushing up in some direction. So we can define three. So, we can define three flavors of infinitesimal automorphisms. There are these symplectic ones, which have general locally constant functions. There's sort of, and I don't know good notation for this, but there are the flat ones, which are the kernel of the, so I think I say that, the kernel of the extended Lie homomorphism. These are the ones such that if I take the interior product with omega, I get something which is d eta closed. Which is data closed, and as I said, this preserves the leaves in the principal bundle. And finally, there's this one which is Ham, where instead of just having something which is d eta closed, you could have something which is d eta exact instead. So just like Hamiltonians would be for usual symplectic geometry, we have that there's some, we have if I give you a function h. give you a function h and I take dA to h I can find some x h because omega is non-degenerate which generates it now one thing to note is that if I take something which is just constant a constant function then because eta is non-zero I might have that the right hand side of this is non-zero so the vector field doesn't need to be non-zero so I obtain something called the Lie vector field Obtain something called the Lie vector field in this case, and it's very much not gauge variant. It depends on the choice of eta itself. So if I add an exact form to eta, then this Lie vector field will change. And lastly, one thing to note here is that if I have something which isn't exact, then actually automatically the zeroth twisted cohomology, this Lichnerowich Durant cohomology. Durant cohomology is zero. So, actually, there's a correspondence now between Hamiltonian vector fields and Hamiltonian functions. They determine each other because there's no sort of locally constant functions. And these are, you know, these are nice. These satisfy sort of all the properties that you want. They're nice enough Lie algebras. And maybe I won't say much more about them. Maybe I won't say much more about that. See, I have nine minutes left, so I might skip a slide or two. You know, you can say, so you can say that, you know, for a closed LCS manifold, you can say that these Hamiltonians, you know, they're simple. So there's something to say. And not only that, There's something to say. And not only that, but there's sort of Erlangen-type results for these where, if you have the groups, you know, any of these groups, LCS symplectomorphisms, LCS flat symplectomorphisms, or LCS Hamiltonian isomorphisms, then they actually determine what the LCS manifold was itself. Okay. Let's see. Let me see what I want to say. Let me see what I want to say. Right. So if we're, if we have exact, if we have an exact LCS manifold, then we also have a Louisville vector field. So if we've chosen a primitive, lambda, for omega, then we obtain this vector field z lambda, which is just, you know, what do we need to input into omega in order to get lambda. And you know, this again, this is actually gauge and barrier. When we work with universal covers, this is legitimately the universal, this is legitimately the Louisville vector field once we've chosen the primitive upstairs. So you'll notice that z lambda, if I take, you know, if I take this z lambda, then because omega is d eta of lambda, I get that this has just constant equal to one. As just constant equal to one. And when m is connected, for example, I just get that LCS symplectic vector fields are just the flat ones, but together with these expanding ones, Z lambda. And if you like, you know, in general, if M wasn't connected, then you would get that there was sort of one Z lambda for each component where you're exact. So, just some exact examples. We had this L C Sification, and what we could do is we can consider the Louisville vector field for this, where we've chosen the primitive alpha. And in that case, that's del T. And that makes sense because remember, we said that when we pushed up by del T, when we pushed up in the del T direction, we had that on the universal cover, which was just the symplectization, the symplectic form was expanding. So it's just the Louisville vector field there. And the Lie vector field is just, so if I take the Hamiltonian, which is one, I just get the Rave vector field in the direction of y. So you can think about, you know, we said that this Lie vector field isn't gauge invariant, and here we see it explicitly. It can be thought of as kind of an analog of an analog of like. An analog of like a rave vector field, but for locally conformal symplectic things. So, just like in contact geometry, you have to pick a scale before you can talk about a rave vector field. Here also, you have to pick a leaf form before you can talk about a leaf vector field. And actually, you know, in this case, we have that second cohomology, we have that all of the cohomology of the We had that all of the cohomology of M twisted was zero. And so that means that there's no difference between flat LCS symplectic vector fields and Hamiltonian LCS Hamiltonian symplectic vector fields. Probably H1, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. H uh no, no, H2, because we're still talking about because we're talking about whether omega is data exact or not. So this is omega being data close means that it's data exact. So every symplectic, every flat symplectic thing is Hamiltonian. Isn't it the, don't you have a flux homomorphism? Don't you have a flux homomorphism going from like if it's flat, then you get that the one form is closed and it's not clear if it's exact or not. Yeah, I don't believe this point, actually. What? So you say that on the L Cation, anything symplectic is Hamiltonian? Anything flat symplectic is Hamiltonian. And this is because. And this is because remember that flat symphlectic, this meant that d eta omega was equal to zero, right? But then no, no, no, no, no, it's g eta x omega is equal to zero, huh? The construction of, yeah, I think, yeah, you're you're right, you're right. Uh, this should be right, you're right, this should be I think it's just not true. Yeah. I think it is true. I think it's just age one is zero. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. If you say if, but then you have to remove because then you say if, right? No, but it is true in general. It's symplectizations. Yeah. For this example, we have that the whole twisted cohomology. That the whole twisted cohomology was zero. So this is because every contact vector field is Hamiltonian in the contact field. I know I'm stupid. Okay, that's just H1. Okay. You're right, though. It should be H1. Yes. Okay. Like in general, I think there's also probably a flux homomorphism going from sim flat to H1 eta, which is a Lie algebra homomorphism. That Lie algebra homomorphism and Ham is like the kernel, right? Or something like this, I think. Yeah, that's right. That's right. So you can also take this twisted cotangent bundle. And I know I'm almost out of time. So I feel like I want to just say what the Moser trick is. And maybe I'll stop there so that I can just say that. Okay. Okay, so in terms of the Moser trick, you have that there's still a Moser trick in this setting, but you have to know what it means. You know, remember the Moser trick, you had to have co-homologous symplectic forms in order to apply it. So you have to know what that means in this setting. So let's call an exact homotopy of LCS structures on M. Well, with differential forms, you could consider it to be, you know, I'm not modifying the homotopy, I can't modify the. which the I can't modify the homology class, the cohomology class of eta t, so I'm allowed to add exact forms. And then you know I have this omega t is multiplying by e to the ft. So what it means to be exact in this case is that the derivative of this e to the ft omega t, as I modify this thing, that that should be d eta t exact. So if you have that, we call it an exact homotopy of L C S. An exact homotopy of LCS structures. And there's a version for principal bundles, which is just, you know, you can think about it as instead of being sort of the usual co-homologous thing, you're allowed to scale also by a locally constant factor. Okay. And we have, there's this theorem of Banda and Kotchik, which is that exact homotopies of LCS structures can be realized by families of LCS isomorphisms. So once you understand what an exact homotopy What is an exact homotopy in this category, then you just have that there's still a Mozart. And so this allows you to prove neighborhood theorems. So maybe just as an example, you have the Lagrangian neighborhood theorem, where if L is a Lagrangian submanifold and you have the restriction of the Lie class, you have that an open neighborhood of L. open neighborhood of L in the manifold is isomorphic to an open neighborhood of the zero section of the corresponding twisted cotangent bond. So, okay, I think I'm out of time anyway. So hopefully I haven't gone over, but maybe I did. But thank you very much for listening.
