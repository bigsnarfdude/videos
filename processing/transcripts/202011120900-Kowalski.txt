Good morning session. So it is my honor to introduce Piotr Kovalski from University Czech Waslavsky, who will talk about model theory of group actions on fields. Thanks a lot, Moshe. Thanks to the organizers for inviting me to giving a talk here. Well, it's my first ever conference online. Online. So, well, it's I like the talks, it's pretty useful for me. So, thanks also for the invitations. I have opportunity to listen to all these good talks. Okay, I am a bit nervous for two reasons. First, I never gave a conference talk like this. Second, all these nice talks I heard were also nicely into the main topic of the conference. Topic of the conference, and my talk doesn't seem to be like this. So, in many conferences, the main topic is kind of used often like an excuse to talk about things not so much related to it, which doesn't seem to be the case with this conference, but it is the case with my talk. So, I'm sorry for the people who will maybe not find it so interesting because of that, but maybe. Because of that, but maybe it will be still entertaining. Okay, what? Ha! It's moving. So here I'm trying on this slide still to connect it to the topic of the conference, the algebraic dynamics. So as we saw on several talks, in several talks, fine model theoretical analysis Fine model theoretical analysis of some particular theories. This is a theory of differential fields and theory of difference fields, actually. The trichotomy results there often have applications to the Fantine problems or to dynamical problems. So I'm saying here, maybe you can see the triggering caps there, so I'm sorry. So I'm saying here that this model together take a program. This model-theoretic approach to algebra dynamics often goes through particular analysis of particular theory and most naturally affects or theory of difference fields, fields with endomorphisms, which is ACFA, this particular theory. And this approach was fruitful, as we notice in this conference as well. The dynamical results. The dynamical results of Shasidakis Koshowski, Medvedev Skanlon, and others, which use this model together analysis. Okay, then I'm getting closer to my topic. So invasive difference fields, the ones where endomorphism is automorphism, it's inventible, they are the same as actions of a particular group of group set by a given field. Yes? Field. Yes, choice about the morphism is the same as the choice of the faction of figure group on one generator. So this is about ACFA, let's say. So in my talk, I just replace set by arbitrary group and then look what is the corresponding model theory. Is it nice? Does it exist at all in a way? Okay, so ACFA, ACFA is. A CFA is like a nice theory of difference fields. It's a theory of large difference fields. I will make it precise soon. So, actually, for any group, the first question is whether this nice theory exists at all. And this will be kind of the main topic here. Okay, and this is an icon situation, three kinds of groups. This is joint work. This is joint work with Oslan Bay Axlan in the case of virtual equipment groups and toxin groups, and with Daniel Hoffman in the case of finite groups, which are, of course, special cases of victual equipment groups. But it's like that, so the list of co-authors is alphabetical and anti-chronological. So it was first with Daniel, then with Oslo. Okay, so now I'm going to tell you. Okay, so You. Okay, so what is the setup? Just some terminology. So we have this fixed group G, which will act on fields. And I just say a G field, short name to a field together with action of G by field automorphisms. Like we have G sets, so let's say we have G fields, a field with an action of G because they related to the structure of the field. So then we have to. Field. So then we have natural notions. If we have two fields with action of g, we can have equivalent extension. This I will call g-field extension. There is also natural notion of jiggling, jiggling extension, etc. So everywhere like a normal notion, but with compatible group action. Okay, and then we look at it as a fax organic structure. So what does Structure. So, what does it mean? So, like a ring is a vexed order structure because we specify two or three binary operations and two constants, plus minus times 0, 1. I have also action of g, so I make it a vexed order structure by adding one Unage function, which I also call g, by any element little g from capital G acting on my k. Yes? Like vector. Yes, like backdog space, like backdog space is a is like vector space is a backdoor structure because we have in like a function for all scalar multiplications. So just formality, this may be slightly confusing, this little g I don't want to distinguish, but formally it's supposed to represent three things at the same time, element from the group. Element from the group, a function, this is how the group acts, and also a formal function symbol, which is replicated, which is in a given G field, it has particular identification as this function. Okay, and of course, if Tech is, for example, Z, then it is not very smart to look at all elements of Z. That would come. Elements of z that would correspond to looking at some automorphism sigma and also adding to language all its powers. So, of course, we don't do that. So, it's often convenient to consider the language where only a useful set of delegators is specified. So, for example, for difference fields, we just look at one automorphism sigma. So, we may think about the sigma as a chosen generator of infinite size. Generator of infinite cyclic group set. So, in practice, usually we don't look at all these elements of the group, we just look at some convenient set of generators. So, this is how we look at actions on fields for a fixed group, how we look at actions of this fixed group on fields in a fixed octave way. Okay, and then I think I want to specify. I think I want to specify. Okay, so here, so I get this ACFA. I said it's a nice theory of large different fields. So now I want to say what does it mean to be large in general? And actually, it's a very, very general definition in any theory. But in the case of G-fields, it amounts to saying that all solvable Solvable difference polynomial equations have solutions. So, first, what is here? A difference G polynomial equation. So, I just take a system, let's say n is always the same, but to have too many indexes, it will not make any difference. So, I take a finite number of elements of this group G acting on K, finite numbers of Finite numbers of polynomials over k in some finite numbers of variables, and I plug the results of the action of G2 variables to these polynomials. So in this way, I get the system of difference equations related with this action of group G. Okay, so these are my difference polynomials, G polynomial equations, which in a lot of Equations which in a large G field they should have always solutions. What does it mean? Of course, there are some equations which are obviously contradictory. And actually, what does it mean is the biggest issue here. So the formal name of large here is existentially closed, abgrid EC. Existential means that the formula I'm looking at is exist X. I'm looking at is exist x v of x, and this v has no quantifier x. So here it is existentially closed. If any system like this of different polynomial equations, which is solvable, has already solution in K. And what does solvable mean? Well, the most natural thing is that it can be solved in some G-field extension of K. Some more giving. Some multi-viewing. Okay, so it's that's the definition. I think everything is very natural. Such equation is solvable if it can be solved somewhere upstairs. And the field is large, existentially closed. If it can be solved upstairs, it can be already solved in the field. Okay, so these are my large, large G fields. That's the definition. Now I That's the definition. Now, I think several comments about them. Do they exist? Yes, it's a very general thing. It's the same, even easier, if you construct algebraic closure of a field, you kind of formally have solutions. Okay, and then you have some inductive process, and you get your algebraically closed field. The same of these existentially closed G fields also. Fields. Also, you know, if there is a solvable difference equation, it has a solution somewhere. So you add this solution on this bigger field. And the only possible problem is to get the limits, to get to the unions, unions of this extension. So for that, one has to know that the union of G fields is a G field, which is obviously true. So it's a general property of inductive theories. Property of inductive theories. Inductive means that the union of models is a model. That in this case, any GPU has a large existentially closed GPU extension. So they definitely exist. The question is, what are they? If the action is trivial, then we just have fields. So then there's equations like polynomial equations, and it's exactly Hilbert's Maushtelenzaz. But the domain version of it telling you that the class of existentially closed fields is exactly the class of algebraically closed fields. So that's the description as it should be. In the case of different fields, so the action of Z, then we're going back to the original theory, the class of existentially closed Z fields coincides with Coincides with quite classical now transform-Maliog difference clause fits some models of this nice theory ACFA. Yes, which we have many results about, which yet some application dynamics. Okay, now something to be careful. So it happens that any model of ACFA as a pure field, it is algebraically closed. However, it is a Closed. However, it is rather unusual. For other groups, for most of the groups, it is not true. There is actually a criterion. I can tell you later if somebody asks. So usually for other groups, usually existentially closed G field is not algebraically closed as a field, which should not be very surprising by Arctic and Shigalay theorem. If you have a finite group, well, which has more than two elements, it's More than two elements, it cannot faithfully act on algebraically closed fields. So you don't even have reasonable G fields at all there when the basic field is algebraically closed. So it should not be surprising that existentially closed models are usually not algebraically closed fields. Okay, it's good to have it in mind. Okay, so then one can ask: okay, but we have this one example that we have the complex field. That we have the complex field with complex conjugation. Complex conjugation is, of course, ogdag2 in the volatile automorphism. So this pair is the same as action of C2. Ah, by Cm, I mean cyclic group of ogdagm. Okay, let me adopt this notation. So complex field with complex conjugation is actually also not an existentially closed pseudofield. Close pseudofield, I can just say why. So, okay, I have to find a solvable, a solvable difference C2 polynomial which has no solution in the C with conjugation. And the polynomial is saying that absolute value is minus one. Yes, absolute value of z is z times sigma of z. Z times sigma of z. So this is different equation. Obviously, you cannot solve it. It cannot be minus one in C, but it's rather easy to find extension, C2 extension to the field of rational functions where it can be solved. So the C with complex conjugation is not large as a C2 field. Okay, so basically, if you have a finite group which is non-trivial, G. Which is non-trivial, then existentially closed G field is never algebraically closed. Okay, so this was some information about this large, large G fields. I'm looking no questions so far. But if you have any question, please ask either in any way you like. So they are not like So they are not large in the sense of being algebraically closed, but still these underlying fields of existentially closed G fields are still kind of large. So I'm saying they are pseudo-algebraically closed. So first for any G field, we also specify its subfield of invariants denoted by C like constants. Okay, it's also often Okay, it's also often confusing. Because if G is finitely generated, it is definable, but if it is not definable anymore, it's definable as infinite intersection. So we call it type definable. Let me recall that if it is pseudo-algebraically closed PAC, if any absolutely reducible variety over it has a rational point, so then I will. So then I want to say as last general information about existentially closed G fields that they are always perfect PAC. And if it so happens that G is finitely generated, so these constants become definable, then it is PAC as well. Okay? So this we have, this kind of largeness we have, but for a for algebraically closed, we cannot usually hope. Cannot usually hope. Okay, so these are. So now I still didn't get to this theory. What should be a nice theory of them? So that's again a special instance of general definition. So if there is a fact stock theory, okay, so if there is a set of sentences in this language I specified, sentence means you can use quantifiers finitely many conjunction. finitely many conjunctions this dungeon disjunction again should finitely many and the structure i specified before to say something so if there is fx or like a theory whose models are exactly existentially close g fields then we call this theory gtcf and this is our nice theory to study ferber and this is an instance of general construction of model companion in model theory. In model theory. So, if it exists, it's a model companion of the theory of G-fields. So, maybe for non-model theorists, let me go back. One could wonder why this definition here is already not giving me my theory. Okay, so let's focus a bit. If we fix this formula phi, the system of equation, then we have. Equation, then we have a condition. We have a mathematical condition saying something about solution and solvability, but this is very, very much not Fextog. We are quantifying here over all possible G-field extensions of K. So we cannot express it as such. We cannot express it as something fixed or we are not allowed to say in this language for all possible g-blupt extensions. Gbupt extensions. This is not Fextog formula. So, actually, the issue here is to find something Fextock Deg which specifies which systems are actually solvable. And this is actually like a non-trivial issue. So I'm back here. So let's see some examples. If the group is trivial, Well, then I said existentially closed fields then are algebraic closed fields. So this theory is basically ACF, the theory of algebraic closed fields. If the group is free, like if one generate ox, it is Z, you get ACFA. If M generagate ox, it also exists and it's called ACFAM. If group is finite, okay, then there is a little star. Okay, then there is a little story behind. I don't have time to tell it exactly. So we go to this paper with Daniel Hoffman, and at the very end of it, actually I was always surprised that nobody ever picked up this topic, natural topic of looking at finite group action on fields in modern theoretical way. And it turned out somebody did 10 years before. I guess he wrote something like Ph.D. Got something like PhD thesis, and then I think left mathematics. So it only stayed as a PhD thesis, and it was brought to our attention by Zoe. So actually, there is a large integrated section in these two papers. So anyway, that's the story. So about the theory exists. If G is finite, then GTCF exists. And now, okay, now is the moment when you may notice things are not quite. Are not quite clear what is the general picture. Khrushchevsky showed that Z times Z T C F does not exist. So if you take a very natural theory of fields with two commuting, as actions of Z times Z, Z times Z are just two commuting automorphisms. So if you take a very natural theory like this, then you cannot axiomatize large models. You cannot axiomatize Models. We cannot axiomatize existentially closed different speeds like this, which may be slightly surprising, but it is true. Yes, so if you think about which groups are good in this sense, when this theorem is axiomatizable, then it's quite hard to say anything so far. Finite ones are good, three are good, three abelian are not good. Okay, so the main, like the main topic. Okay, so the main topic of today is somehow to understand which groups are good in the sense which ones have axiomatizable theory of big G-fields. So I guess this is the last slide of introduction. So now I plan to talk about finite group actions, but a bit confusingly, I'm starting as an actions of Z. This is actions of z this is like the most the initial the initial example of geometric axioms here so let me specify these axioms of ACFA so now we take this difference equations we look at them geometrically so we have kind of graphs yes for any variety over k okay so by vague Okay, so by vagality, I always mean fine k vagality, k irreducible, kreduced, finite type. So it's the same, the same as prime ideal in the ginger polynomials of finite many variables over k. Okay, if I have such a prime ideal, I can hit it by sigma. So from v get new variety sigma v, which is also appropriate for fiber product, and then I have more. And then I have morphism between k-rational points. So, actually, any G-polynomial equation, well, any difference equation, system of difference equation, I can understand as intersecting graph of such a function with some sub-varieties of the product. So, okay, so we have to say kind of which pairs of varieties like this. Like this give solvable systems of different equations, and that's exactly the geometric axioms of Zoe and UDI. So it says that if you have a if we have a like let me make experiment and draw something I may repeat it. So if we have Sigma V here we have graph graph of this sigma on V here we have our W projecting generically here and here then that should be this point in the intersection. the index section a comma sigma of a so for my drawing okay so i think this picture this picture should be rather clear so that's the axioms the axiom says that we can always forgot these w's is w which project generically on both cognates we have such a point in the graph inside Inside. Okay, so now I want to find vections of these axioms for other types of groups, not for Z. What to do with that? I guess I should add to so you all solve the picture, it will vanish now. Is it a faster way to do that? Anyway, it will happen. Okay, so this was the axioms of. So, this was the axioms of ACFA. Now, what happens for finites? Okay, some ah, question, question. I'm reading, I'm getting. How does GTCF behave? So, I'm getting the question. How does this GTCL behave if GTC replaced by a file like index subgroup or the library? Yes, yes. It will be answered to some extent when I get. Answer to some extent when I get to the actual finite groups. Okay. So, general answer is that only after analyzing particular class of groups, one can apostrophe get such conclusions. But I cannot get any, I do not have any general theorems saying anything for such a general question. So the question is: okay, if I have something could happen for general. If I have something could happen for G, does it also happen for a finite index subgroup or a finite index supergroup? In general, I cannot say so, just after analyzing, just after analyzing a particular class. We will see it very soon. I was all, yeah, but not, actually, it's not easy to get such conclusions. Okay, so this was an example of geometric axioms. Now there is also one more other example. Now, there is also one more other kind of possible axioms. So, these fields C and K, K and the fixed field, they have some calo-atomatic properties. In this case, K is just algebraically closed. But C is pseudo-finite, besides being perfect PAC, the absolute Kalovaki group is Z head, which means by X C is pseudo-finite. So, one can ask: does this imply existentially? Does this imply existentially closed and not? So, in, I'm not sure about proper credits, but in the book of Wichdon, actually, it's written that for with probability one, if you take out homomorphism of Q alge, then it satisfies these two items, but it's never a model of A C of A. Models of A C F A characteristic zero have infinite resonance degree over Q. Okay, so I will. So, I would say and formalize it at the very end that ACA is not axiomatized by Galova axioms. You need this geometric axiomatization. Okay? I will get to this later. So, for finite groups, okay, if you remember axioms for ACFA, then for finite groups, we did something similar with Daniel, but now But now, okay, ACFA has, we have just one automorphism, it's like one specific generator of set. Now I just look for the entire group G as my set of generators. So my W is in the product of V hit by all elements of the group. So I'm basically asking when this W gives a solvable difference equation. So still all projections should be dominant, but the group is not free. But the group is not free. I mean, it has a multiplication table, so this W should respect this table. I call it the integrativity condition, referring to iterative Hasserschmid derivation, because kind of some other topic, integrative Hasserschmid derivations are controlled by finite group schemes. Here also finite group schemes, make a different one, but there is something in common. Psychology activity. Well, as you can see, if we apply this Gi to W, then we get into another product. But of course, there is always a map. It's not a projection, it is a pergmutation by this GI. So it should, on W, these two things should have the same image. That means that kind of W sits iteratively inside and gives you solvable system. Solvable system of G equations, and then the same conclusion. There is a solution here such that now this tuple, when we apply the elements from the group acting on K on this vagal ETV, then it is in our solutions at W. Okay? So it's like ACFA axioms, but with this extra integrativity condition corresponding to the fact that our Corresponding to the fact that our group is not free anymore. Yes, it should respect the relations the group has. So this is geometric axioms for finite GTCF. And also actually Galois axioms are also enough. What are Galois axioms saying now? Both fields are PAC, maybe not Galova, but the field is strict, meaning also the same terminology as for Hasse Schmidt, that the action is faithful. Is faithful, but the last one about Galova groups, the restriction map from the absolute Galova group, so C alge of Xc to K of X C, which can be identified by G by this thickness, is so-called Fratini cover. So it is onto, but it's not onto on any proper closed subgroup. Okay, such maps, continuous maps between profinite groups, are called Ratini covers. Called Ratini covers. So existentially closed GFs have all these. The sysbacks are a property because this curgly, because this Galo-Wag group is actually bounded, it can be shown. And actually, the convex also holds. If you have a G3 satisfying all that, it is existentially closed. So I would say I'm saying that it's also GTCF, it's axiomatized by Galois axioms. By Gallo axioms as well. Okay, I will just quickly say: so ACFA, it was important that ACFA fits nicely to this stability or simplicity chiergy. It is simple, that just think it is nice model theoretically. How about GTCF? Okay, they are really bi-integratable with the pure field C of the constants. Field C of the constants because it's a finite extension and everything is definable in C. Since C is PAC and bounded, it is super simple of S rank one, and then GTCF becomes super simple of S rank E. ACFA is also super simple, but of rank omega, of infinite rank. So it is kind of nice, but all the structure actually comes from the field. So it's really about talking about model theory of one PAC with C. Of one PACPC. Okay, and we get something, but that's really only for model theorists: like a slight improvement of like a general theory that it has elimination of imaginaries after getting finitely many extra constants. I think in general, Anand and Zoel showed it with infinitely many constants. But I don't want to stop on this too much, since unfortunately, I have two more sections. Sections. Okay, so we are done with finite groups. So joint work with Daniel. Now, the fact with Oslo. Okay, we were thinking, can we somehow put model theory of actions of three groups and model theory of actions of finite groups in some ambient, ambient joint context? Well, and I guess a very natural class of groups for such an. Class of groups for such generalizations. So, this goes back a bit to Serge's question. There are virtually free groups. So, groups having a finite index subgroup, which is free. Okay, so in this particular case, the answer is yes. Yes, so if we, as we will see, it will be also axiomatizable, but the way it is done, okay, it's really not something using it. You will see how it is done, but it can. We'll see how it is done, but it really cannot be the way it's done cannot be generalized to any situation like this, in abstract situation like this. Okay. So our axiomatization, we will axiomatize this actions of victual groups. It's in a way double-geometric. It's not Gallo axioms, they are geometric. So axioms are geometric themselves, as per ACFA, but they use But they use the geometry which is underlying a given victualic group in the sense of geometric group theory. It was crucial. Without this, you wouldn't be able to do anything. This geometric description of victual equip groups was crucial for us. So the theorem is, this classical theorem, that if we have virtually free groups, sorry, if we have finitely generated groups, So, if you have a finitely generated group, then it is virtually free if and only if it is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a finite graph of finite groups. I may explain later more, but what does it mean? Okay, it means okay, so first you take finite groups and you can take three products, but also with amalgamation. With amalgamation. So, actually, think about a tree where vector vector in each vector is there is a finite group sitting, and on edge, there is a finite group sitting, which embeds onto this vector group. So you can amalgamate the whole situation. You can take free product with amalgamation as this tree tells you to do it. You to do it. Okay? So that's the facts part, but your finite graph may have also another, may not be, need not be a tree. So there may be some loops remaining, even loops around one vertex. And for all these remaining loops, you have to do corgaspoordini HNM extensions, which I may also describe later if people ask what are they. Okay, so it may be extremely. Okay, so it may be extremely complicated picture because any finite graph may be given a structure of graph of groups. So they may be very, very complicated. But this is the full description of virtual equipment groups. And this is what we use. So actually we describe just a general procedure how to kind of change axioms doing each one of these operations described here. Here. So, okay, we do so. If G is finitely generated and virtually free, then this tiger exists by kind of gluing the axioms for finite groups over this graph of finite groups, by gluing the axioms for particular finite groups, GTCF, gluing along this graph. Yes, so how complicated? It may be complicated if the It may be complicated if the gap is complicated. Let us see the simplest example to get some feeling. So we have the simplest possible gap, just two vertices, C2 on each vertex. Okay, I guess I'm able to draw it. Instead of showing my two fingers, annotate so the graph is C to here, C to here. Okay, and here basically nothing, or if you like, single group. Okay, so that's the corresponding graph of finite groups, being of course a degree. So it corresponds to three product generated by two involutive elements. Another description is infinite directial groups, so semi-direct product of Z and So, semi-direct product of Z and C2. And then, okay, so G fields are the same as fields with two involved automorphisms, the sigma and tau. So, now you can perhaps see how are we gluing the axioms. So, we have to say when some. So, we have to say when such a W, such a sub-variety, gives a solvable system of G equations. So, we just give two conditions. We project it here on V times sigma V, and we say it should give a solvable systems of C2 equations there, and we do the same projecting of V times tau V. Okay? So it's like a free amalgamation of the axioms. Amalgamation of the axioms, you can say, and then you get the same conclusion. So you can perhaps imagine what happens if there is a group here, you have to amalgamate axioms of a group, well, and with the H and an extension, you do something else. So confusing part how that fits here. So note that Z, okay, I didn't say about this as an extension, that, let me write it. Let me write it. Z, Z, Z is an H and an extension of the trivial group by identity on it. So it comes kind of very trivially. So the very way, the ACFA axioms are actually not the part of basic axioms here. They are part of the gluing process, which you see on the level of HNNX. On the level of HM extensions. Okay, it is a bit complicated, but maybe you get some rough picture here. Questions to that? So now I have to undo this drawing. Okay. Okay, so just one second. Okay, so this was the general theorem. This theory exists, and its axioms are obtained by this way of kind of gluing the axioms. So, of course, it cannot, there is no clear way how to apply it in a general case referring to the question when I just have a finite index subgroup and I know there are axioms for finite index subgroup. This was something very, very This was something very, very articulate here. Okay, and now the question is: whether the theories we obtain agnize. And the answer is actually no. Only the theories we already know are agnized. All the new ones are not. So let me tell you why. Okay, some terminology, organic group H, H hat is the profinite. H hat is the profinite completion, invex limit of profinite quotients. For any profinite group, Curly H, Curly H twiddle is the univexal Tratini cover. Let me not get into definition, that was definition of Ratinikov, that is also kind of like just one, and it's unique up to isomorphism. Okay, and profinite group is small, it has finitely many closed subgroups of a Many closed subgroup of a given finite index. So we showed with Auslan that if the group is virtually free but kind of new, so not finite, finite generated virtually free but not free, then such a profinite group, first we take profinite completion, then we take universe altratinic copper, and then we look at the kernel. So actually this kernel, okay, it is clay. It is claimed that it is exactly the absolute Calova group of the model of G-fields, or the underlying field of existentially closed G-field. But it's not small. So by results of ZOE, if a PAC field is not bounded, the absolute Galois group is not small, then it cannot be simple and apparently also not NTP2. Also, not NTP2. So, somehow they are not nice. So, the theorem is that this theory is simple if and only if theory we already knew. So, the new ones are not simple. Okay, can they still be nice? Sorry, I'm rushing, but I want to finish on time. Okay, but then I guess this all neural stability is anando. As Anand was calling it, I kind of stopped my education at the level of simple theories, so I'm not very familiar with that, but recently, theories which are called NSOP1 are extensively studied. So let's just think about it. They are not simple, but still reasonably nice. And Nick Ramsey suggests that argument that this the RBGCF convectually together. For virtual EPG, I didn't write for the virtual EPG should be an SOP1. And actually, it is all hanging, this argument, on this description of Galois group. So we need to show one particular fact about absolute Galois group of these underlying fields. If this is shown, we'll know it is NSOP1. So still quite nice, but in some new sense, not simple. In some new sense, not simple anymore. So, that's about these theologies. Okay, now the question: so, what is the property of groups? Can we specify the class of finitely generated groups such that the steer exists? We conjecture, maybe prematurely, then the condition is exactly they are virtually free. I must say I don't believe it anymore so much. We'll try to test some other. We try to test some other groups like Coxeter groups to see to actually disprove it. Okay, but this was confirmed, this conjecture is confirmed for commutative groups. But of course, the structure of anti-generated commutative groups is very, very easy. So I don't believe it now it's true. Okay, so of course if z times z embeds in g, it is not actually free. Not virtually free, and it looks like there should be a proof which we still do not have that if z times z embeds in g, then gtcf does not exist. So that would be on the direction of showing negative results. Yes, but this is much smaller class of groups. So as I said, if it embeds in G, and G is not virtually free, but there are many, many groups which are actually pretty nasty ones. Which are actually pretty nasty ones, like all these groups here, infinite bag assigned groups of tagsky monster, they are finitely generated, but they are periodic. So even Z doesn't embed there. Okay, and there are usually sources of context examples. I guess this will be the tackling such groups, like all these crazy groups will be the most difficult target of understanding. Target of understanding when for a finitely generated group GTCF exists. So let me finally get to the last part, which is our newest work with OSLEM. So what happens when a group is not finely generated? And we kind of cannot easily access geometric axiomatization because we cannot just take a product of varieties hit by all generators. It becomes not vexed or it is infinite. Not faggot stargate, it is an infinite product. So it's hard to control the full action in faggot orgate way. Okay, so one way to deal with it is to hope that actually the theory is logically nicely approximated, which doesn't need to happen. So a very general thing, which I stated in general terms, but then I will explain. Variables, but then I will explain what it means in case of groups. If you have a chain of theories, like think about the chain of G fields when G's are growing, okay? If they all have model companions, like this theory is GTCF, and if they form a chain as well, then the union of this chain of model companions is a model companion of the original chain. This is actually mean the PGC. I mean it appeared because in paper of David Biggs and others, this is rather easy observation. Okay, what does it mean in our situation? So in our situation, assume that G is union of some groups Gn which are understood such that G T m G n T C F exist. So by the Pliberus theorem, if this Gn T C F form increasing chain, then we are done. Chain, then we are done, but then things get subtle. So, thanks to Alice, Alice Mediged did it for Q. So, of course, Q is union of infinite cyclic groups where we have, where we allow creator and creator denominators. So, we can generate it by one over any factorial. Assumptions are satisfied, so we get this theory, we get the union, she called. She called, which was called by Alice Quackfeigas. In our terms, it will be QTCF. That's the positive situation. We noticed with Auslan, it is also satisfied for the Trupper group. Okay, so C P infinity union of all cyclic P groups. But then if instead of cyclic P groups, you take their products. You take their products, then you don't get a chain. If I have time, which I don't, I may explain it on the last slide, why not? And similarly, let's look at this funny group CP like primes, which is a direct product of all of all cyclic CPs. So here C2, sorry, typot it should be TCF here, sorry, it should be TCF here, CP squared TCF. Cf here. Cp square T C F is not a sub the org of C P square square T C F and C two T C F is not a sub the org of C2 plus C3 which is C6 T C F. But still, this default thing exists. This theoram here, it was only one implication. It is not even only if. So the last slide. So if us then we looked at toxin groups, mean commutative toxin groups. Commutative function groups, so they are union of finite commutative groups, and then actually, it was nice, we get a full answer, which is again perhaps a bit surprising. This theory exists, ATCF exists. So, okay, so A decomposes is a direct sum of p primary parts, yes, of p groups. So, the condition is that each of them should be finite or with a peripheral. So, group like profile group plus CP, this is forbidden group. This we shouldn't have. And then it is here we exist. It is strictly simple, not stable, not super simple, which is easy. Simplicity is kind of logically local property. So I'm one minute over time. So this story is axiomatized by Galileo axioms, which I'm specifying. And actually, not by geometric axioms, because it's Geometric axioms because it's not the union. So, action should be fable, k should be perfect. There should be a choice of these AIs such that each of them is PAC, and then it should have prescribed small profinite groups, all the absolute calor groups. Okay, so this axiomatization. So, okay, so two minutes of time. I stop here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? I have a question. Yes. You know this, I wonder, there's this famous theorem. I can't remember who did it. Maybe Mueller and Shook or Dunwoody or someone. They prove that the finitely generated groups with context-free word problem are cursed. Context-free word problem or precisely the virtual? Yes, yes. Do you expect there to be some connection with the TCF to TCF and the word problem for a group? Yeah, so it was intuitive. Morally, there is lots of connection because they are exactly victual. So yes, there are lots of equivalent conditions, like also the Calic graph is of finite tree width or something. If you look at these conditions, If you look at these conditions, they kind of morally tell you that yes, but technically you are able to use this geometric condition. Maybe there could be another approach using that. Yeah, but there are many equivalent conditions, yes, like the one you said, which are logical in nature, but we couldn't employ them. But I'm sure there is there are some maybe some deeper philosophical or other connections. We are looking. The connections. We are looking, we are definitely looking at this. We are trying to use them, but at the end, this bus second theory turned out to be useful. So there should be something there, but I don't know what is really there. Thanks. Well, I may show this slide and say nothing. I have a question. Have you seen about a Have you seen about a a theory where the the f the field is endowed with a valuation? So when you endow your field with a valuation. So you have a group. Yeah. So take a group respects valuation or something. Yes. Yes. Okay. No. But actually Daniel, Daniel Hoffman, then he started like an abstract product. Vega abstract project, so he applies group action to any theory, so one particular instance, and I think it's a good idea to look at that. But okay, I guess so people were doing like action of Z, so valuation and automorphism. So many people were looking at probability of this, but I don't know about any other work with other groups, but it's definitely good. With other groups. That's definitely a good idea to look at it. So that's my answer. I know I was wondering if it's with Z2, your theory doesn't exist, but if you add a valuation, is it known? I mean, that's quite ah, so this is an even better question. No, no, it's not known to my knowledge. Ah, what like? Okay, good. So what I think, the TOG is. Okay, good. So, whether the theory of valued fields with two commuting automorphisms, whether does it have model companion in model theoretic terms? Ah, maybe somebody knows. I don't know. Zoy here? I don't know. I don't know. Good question. I don't know. But yes, actually, it feels like, okay, it feels like with some extra constraints, maybe it would be possible. But this particular case, I have no idea. I don't know. Good question. I don't know. I don't know. Good question. I don't know more questions. Okay, let's thank Piotr again. And we have five
