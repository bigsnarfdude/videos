Part one today about an introduction to setting theory and part two tomorrow. Okay, thank you for the introduction. Thank you for the opportunity to give a couple of lectures here and to participate in this meeting. I think it's the third time I've been here, and it's an absolutely fantastic place to. Fantastic place to meet and discuss mathematics. So, I'm very happy to be here. So, that's to discuss the basics of silting theory. It's actually quite an introduction to silting theory. And this is actually a difficult thing to talk about now because the subject has progressed so much that I have to narrow the scope a bit. So, I'm going to concentrate in this series of two lectures on finite dimensional silting theory. Dimensional silting theory, but there's a whole rich theory of infinite dimensional silting theory which shouldn't be neglected. So, my plan is in this, I'm going to talk about the classical part of silting theories of a relationship with COTI structures and T structures, Kunigang correspondence, mutation and silting reduction. And in the second lecture, I want to talk about some more recent developments, particularly for two-term category category of two-term. Category category of two-time suiting objects, G vectors and G fans, and we've seen G vectors in the previous lecture by Crystal. Okay, so if I'm not large enough, please tell me. And if the microphone isn't picking me up online, then please let us know. And if anything on the board is not readable, I accidentally. Is not readable, or I accidentally degenerate into writing small, please let me know. Okay, so the motivation is as projective-minded objects in Stefan Cunning. In Stefan Kunning's way with words, he's quite good at coining nice words. So, this is a brief history of the subject as I see it. So, one would start in, I think, the 50s and 60s looking at pro generators. So, these are projective objects. So, projective generator of a category. Projective generator of a category and this detects Morita equivalents. So if your question is when two algebras or more generally rings have the same representation theory, well, it's when one occurs as the endomorphism algebra or endomorphism ring of a projective generator of the other. Unfortunately, from a representation theories point of view, you're interested in representation theory. You're interested in representation theory. If the representation theory of the first ring was hard and the other one has the same representation theory, you'd not really improve your situation. So it was observed in the 70s and 80s that you have tilting theory, but certain chunks of the representation theory were similar. And this is more useful because maybe one representations of one algebra are simpler than the representations. One algebra is simpler than the representations of another algebra, and now you can compare chunks of the simpler one with those of the harder one and get more understanding. This is tilting theory. And this detects derived equivalence, and sometimes it's called derived Merita theory for that reason. So, the reason why the representation of the That reason. So, the reason why the representations theories are similar is because the derived categories are equivalent. But we can generalize still further and look at other similarities in representation theory. We get silting objects, and these parametrize. Realized I picked up the wrong set of notes. So, this is version one of the talk and parametrize module categories mod gambda mod mod gamma sitting inside the bone drive category okay and d cluster tilting theory is the the CY version the Clavio version A collabiat version of silting. So, in some sense, you could say silting theory sits on top of cluster tilting theory in some way. And cluster tilting theory is an orbit construction of silting theory. So, maybe this is kind of the motivation pictures. Okay, so first thing I want to talk about is a relationship with co-t structures. So throughout, D is going to be a home finite. Grossmit K linear triangulated category and sigma from D to D will be its shift. So, definition one, a subcategory. A subcategory M of D is pre-silting give home from M to all positive shifts of M is zero. If additionally think M is equal to D. So the smallest triangulated subcategory closed on the direct summance containing M is the whole of D and M is pre-silting. Is pre-silting, then M is called silting. And the difference between silting and tilting is, so tilting, I would change this to all non-zero shifts, and I would get tilting and pre-tilting. Pre-tilted. So you see, this is here, this is just the projective-minded property, no positive extensions. So this is essentially a characterization of projective objects. An object M is pre-silting or silting. If the additive category generated it by it, add M is pre-silting. And quite often I was thinking about objects rather than subcategories. Examples So Jan School. So Jan Schoer is still in Germany, so I can say if we give A3. I will have an example which isn't A3 in this talk in case it's online. I bet I better not swear. So here we have, hopefully I've drawn it correctly, part of the bounded derived category of the. Of the A3 quiver. And I'm going to take a couple of quick examples. So the first one being the simple projective projective at two and a projective at one. This is a tilting object. And if I take If I take three plus two three plus instead, no, the shift of one, two, three. This is a silting object and it's not tilting. So, two very basic well-known examples. So, next, I want to link silting with coating. With core T structures. So let me remind you what T structures and core T structures are. I've got to define them both together. So a torsion pair in D. In D is a per of additive. By additive, I mean closed under finite direct sums and direct sum and so an pair of additive full subcategories X and Y such that two conditions. Two conditions. There are no morphisms from an object of X to an object of Y. So I'm going to be a bit lazy with my orthogonality conditions. This means if I take any object in X, it has no morphism to any object in Y. And the second condition is D is generated by X and Y in the sense that D is the star product of X and Y, meaning. Product of X and Y, meaning that every object in D can be written as a distinguished triangle with the outer terms in the first one in X and the second one in Y. So this defines the notation star product, which we'll use reasonably frequently. A torsion power. Is a T structure if the X part, usually called an I is closed under the shift, which happens in the presence of the other two conditions if and only if the Y part is closed. If and only if the Y part is closed on the inverse shift in this case, H equals X intersect shift of Y is called the heart is a beam and a COTI structure. A COTI structure is a kind of dual concept where I switch the rows of the shifts and in this case M equals sigma x intersect y the cohort is this time not necessarily Belian if it is it's semi-simple because it's pre-siltic okay by picking up this I've got proposition By picking up this, I've got proposition six and theorem eight, so I'm missing definition seven. I hope I can remember what it is. So, quick reminder. Quick reminder: a subcategory X contained in D is controversial finite. If for each object D and D, there exists a morphism F from X to D with X in X such that Whenever I apply the functor hom some object in x comma blank to the morphism, I get a surjective map. So that is every other morphism from x, from an object of x to d factors through this one. One and I should say in this case, f is called a right x approximation or sometimes a pre-cover, an x-pre-cover. And there's a notion of covariant finite finiteness. Such that this map, home x, comma, is such is, yeah, okay. I put it here, but I should finish my sentence. Yes, so we can, so the map is subject. All right, covariant is finite, it is dual. And functorally finite equals contravariantly finite and covariantly finite. So I expect most people know this, but this is. Most people know this, but this is just a reminder. And the first observation of observation being in Mexico. Mexico. So Mendoza Signs Santiago Suto. I think Suto is the only one who's not Mexican. And independently, IHARA and Miyama. Aihara and Yama, very short, but there's a bijection between bounded. Oh, I haven't said it's one of the things that's missing XY torsion per is bounded if D is the union over all shifts of X. Of X and all shifts of Y. So this means that each object of D is in some shift of X and is in some shift of Y. So there's a bijection between bounded Cauty structures. In D and silting subcategories on D. So bounded COTI structures and silting subcategories are the same concept. And the map works by sending the Caulti structure to its cohort. And sending a silting subcategory to cosusp of sigma minus one M and susp of M where cosp of sigma minus one M sigma minus one m is equal to the union um let's say j greater than less than or equal to minus one sigma j m sigma minus two m up to sigma minus one m and susp m is Susp M is analogous from J greater than equal to zero m star sigma m star sigma to j So let me remark on some nice properties Categories with silting subcategories and silting objects, where this came from. So, remark five, which I think goes back to Aihara Niyama. Is so first if D admits a silting object then row X Y in D home Upon X, the shift big enough of Y is zero. So the homomorphisms between two objects are concentrated in finitely many homological degrees. So it's kind of the finite global dimension type property. The second observation is the which will be referenced. Is the which will be relevant for tomorrow's lecture more than this one is k0 of d is a free abelian group with the rank of k0 of d equal to the number of indecomposable objects in n m up to And M up to isomorphism. So, in particular, any two silting objects have the same number of indecomposable surmounts. And now here's the part of the lecture where I ask a question, and Osamu tells me the answer, which is the general question: is if M is pre-silting with rank of a gross entity group then Then M is tilting, and I think I know this statement in the level of generality of gentle algebras, and I think it's open in general. So this is an open question, I think. Okay. The proposition six due to Yama and Yang tells us the connection between priest guilty. Connection or between pre-silting and COTI structures. So suppose some growing up of projective space, and someone proves that the draw startup roll up of projective space has a single. Category has a single component of the exceptional question. And then probably from that example, we can construct this kind of example of this question maybe, right? No. So this is the example of calc, right? Yeah. So I don't know how to cook, but I think that would be a good place to start. The examples I know, there's the other two counter examples of this completion. Examples of this completion conjecture, which are in gentle algebras, but then you pass to a Verdier quotient, which doesn't have any silting objects at all, but in the original one, you still have silting objects and they all have this maximal rank problem. So this is non-progenital algebras, but this would be a good place to look, I think. Yeah. So that's a good point. But I haven't thought about it. So suppose P is pre-silting satisfying two conditions A P is covariantly finite in In the left purpose of all negative shifts of P and controversy finite in the right pub, what have I done? I've switched my signs. That makes more sense. That makes more sense in all negative shifts of P Second condition for all D in D home or homomorphisms from big enough shifts of P from D. P from D has zero, and all homomorphisms from small enough shifts of P to D as zero. Then the left perp of sigma greater than or equal to zero P susp Susp P and cosp the negative shift of P for right curb of negative shifts of P are COTI structures with cohort. So, both of them have cohort P. So, here you have a fairly general relationship between all COT structures and pre-silting subcategories. So, in particular, this condition B is automatically satisfied whenever your category has a silting object anyway. So, this is something you get for free. And if you have a silting object or pre-silting object rather than a subcategory and you're in the home finite Kruhl Schmidt case, And you're in the hom finite Krol-Schmidt case, then condition A is also automatic. So, most categories in the small world, you might be interested in these conditions automatically fulfilled. So, you have a pretty general relationship between silting objects and quality structures. Now, I have to remember what definition seven is. So section two depending which question tells me what the definition should be. Tells me what the definition should be. Now I want to, we've discussed so this relationship between silting and COTI structures is pretty canonical. It's sort of, I had no assumptions on my categories at all, just on finite Gaussman categories. So these are very closely related concepts in general. Now I want to specialize to Cases where we have a link with the T structures. So a T structure, I should say bounded T structure X Y is algebraic if it's part Part H is a length category with finitely many simple objects. So, an algebraic T structure is one whose heart has Has finitely many simple objects, and every object has a composition series, so satisfies the Jordan-Holdenholder theorem. So i.e. H satisfies the Jordan-Holder theorem and the relationship of finite dimensional algebra. For finite dimensional algebras is the Koenig-Yang correspondence. This holds in a bit more generality because you can do it for non-positively graded differential graded algebras. And that says, so if lambda is a finite dimensional algebra, there's a bijection, then there's a bijection between silting sub. Between silting subcategories of the perfect derived categories, so the bounded homotopic category of projective lambda modules and algebraic p-structures in db lamp. In db lamp. And this sends a silting object or silting subcategory to a d structure xmym given by the right orthogonal of all negative shifts of m and the right orthogonal of all non negative shifts. Negative shifts of M and writing M equals add little M silting object the heart HM which we call is sigma X oh I've done it the other way around X M intersect the shift of Y M is equivalent Ym is equivalent to the module category of the endomorphism algebra of M. Okay, so this theorem is the one which tells you that your silting objects or silting subcategories are parametrizing the module categories you're getting inside your derived category. So, this is the theorem which is telling you what. The theorem, which is telling you what one of the purposes of silting. So, I want to illustrate this correspondence with an example. So, but first, a couple of remarks. So, first Because you have this close relationship between a nice set of t structures, this is not necessarily all t structures, but it's a particularly nice set of t structures inside your derived category. This means your silting theory controls a lot of the homological algebra. And in some sense, in some occasions, your silting theory controls so much, but it controls all of it. And this case is. And this case is, for example, silting discrete algebras. So let me just say silting impacts behavior. And we'll see this in the two-term case tomorrow in the context of G-Fans or V-structures. So e.g. if lambda Lambda is silking discrete. So i.e. the set of silting objects such that M or silting subcategories such that M is contained in add lambda star add Star add shift of lambda. Well, it's not strictly true. So let's say n silting. So the set of silting objects between two silting objects or set of two-term silting objects with respect to any silting object. That set is finite, so it's a strong. So it's a strong homological finiteness condition. This implies all t structures are algebraic. That's the theorem together with Manuel Saurin and Sasha Spanarova. And this is a crucial ingredient in showing that the stability manifold. That the stability manifold for silting discrete algebras is contractible. Thank you. What puzzles me? Why is it actually called Aja Plite? It's not a anatomy condition. Yeah, I guess we have the stability conditions. We have the stability conditions people to thank for this. So, this comes from algebraic T structures, and these are the ones which they could manipulate by algebraic means. And I think this is where I think this is the origin of a term. So, unless the global dimension of lambda is finite, then the boundary Then the bounded derived category has no silting objects. This is one point where I should give a nod to the infinite dimensional theory. The infinite dimensional theory has a notion of silting objects, which works both for finite global dimension and infinite global dimension. So this is one place where the infinite dimensional theory will give you a richer theory, but there's still something to be said in the finite, in the small world, which is. In the small world, which is, however, if M in KB proj, so a perfect object is silting this time in KB proj, then there are triples. Let's get this right. Course susp negative shift of M non-negative shifts of M and the other one is dual left perp of non-positive shifts of. Non-positive shifts of M negative positive shifts of M and susp sigma M. So the three triples and here the first two parts are a triple that's a core T structure and the second two is a T structure and notice this T structure is that one Is that one, and this Caulty structure is this one, and ditto this one is a code T structure and this one is a T structure and it's this these triples which essentially underpin this bijection so this is what's controlling this bijection Controlling this bijection. So, this core t-structure here, so this is these are both in the bounded derived category. The core t-structure in each case fails to be bounded anymore. But when you restrict it to the homotopy category, the perfect derived category becomes bounded again. So, these triples, which are essentially controlling this bijection. And so let's draw an example of these triples. So, quick example. If I take, so this is the one which is not of type A3. Three. It's even simpler. So I take the dual numbers, and the AR quiver of the Joule numbers looks something like this. So this is my notation for a Z A infinity AR component. And I have the indecomposable projective object here for shift. Object here, the shift of it here, and the negative shift of it here, and I have some kind of mesh inside here. Okay, so it looks something like this. And then I have a line, so an A infinity infinity component, and a simple object is here. And I'm going to draw it twice. Simple object is. Simple object is here because recall the AR quadrature module category is a truncated tube. Okay, so let me draw the let's see if the colours work here. So green, red, and blue. Let's try this. So, here I'm going to take coming out of P, so everything over here and this line going on from S which I've drawn twice, this is sigma less than zero p orthogonal. Um, my P doesn't look very P-like here. Possess of sigma minus one P looks like this. So this is uh This is this co-T structure, and to see the T structure, we have this part and code such sitting inside it. So this is sigma less than or equal to Greater than or equal to zero p perp, sorry. But this is an example of what's happening in infinite global dimensions. So this one here is the standard t-structure whose heart is this guy. Okay. So I'm not going to quite get to where I wanted to get, but that's okay because I've got another lecture. So let me briefly describe mutation, and then I'll probably defer the reduction to the next lecture. The section 3: mutation and reduction. The definition 11 is now I have M soaking subcategory. M prime containing m functorially finite in m not necessarily in d it only needs to be functorially finite in m then I'm going to take L lower m prime of m is equal to It's equal to m prime star sigma m intersect the left perp of sigma m prime is the left mutation and m prime of m given by given by sigma minus one m star m prime intersect the right orthogonal of negative shift of m prime is the right mutation so let me briefly say how you compute this so l m prime of m this is just a very condensed way of writing condensed way of writing the additive closure of M prime union for set of L over M such that there's M prime of M no I need to take M prime of M take the corner of this Where I run over all objects of M, where this is a left M prime approximation. And so this is how I compute the mutation. So easy is to see this in an example. So let me give an example. And then, after the example, how stop we refer to the reduction statement, the beginning of next time. So, example. Well, so again, back to A3. So, I've got So I've got three, two, three, one, two, three. Negative shift of one, two, one, two. I dread to think how many hours of my life I've spent drawing this. My uncle, he's not a mathematician, randomly sent me a GIF yesterday because when I told it, he found out I was coming to a mass conference, randomly sent me a GIF, which had an ARC. He has no idea that I do this. Okay, so let's have a look at the silting object here. So I'm going to take this tilting object here. Maybe I use colour and then I stop. So here's my three colours. So my silting object is this. By this, I mean the direct sum of the objects circled. A subcategory generated by one, two, three. And if I take the minimal left approximation of two, three, I spit out one. And if I take the minimal left approximation of two, where it doesn't have a morphism to this, so I spit out the shift of two. So it's this. So the left mutation of one. Of one, two, three at of one, two, three plus two, three plus two is equal to one, two, three plus one plus the shift of two. Okay, so what I want to talk about next time is essentially I want to make the Make the photo, so I'll give the bit of a trailer. Is so the slogan I want to get to is mutation is shift. I want to talk about Danta Dignikov next time and then describe some of the rich combinatorics that occurs in the two-term case. So, thank you very much. So, thank you very much. Yeah, thank you very much. And are there questions or comments? Yeah, that's a good question. So there's a recent article by a student in so the question was, what's the maximum level of generality that the Koenig-Yang bijections are known in? So the maximum I'm confident to state is if you have a non-positively gradient. is if you have a non-positively graded DG algebra. But there's a recent paper I haven't digested which puts some context of which formalizes the setup or you have some kind of cosual duality which imitates that setup. Was that the one in the archive last week? That's the one on the archive last week and I think that's probably the state of the art at the moment. And I haven't read it yet. Sorry? Yeah, look as pompful. Are there more questions possibly also from the online participants? Well, apparently not. Then we think David again. Think, David, again.
