The opportunity to speak about my work on opinion dynamics. I've been thinking about opinion dynamics for several years now, and just recently, through conversations with colleagues, I've got interested in this question of a number of ways. So that's the lens I'm going to put on it today. This is a plot of polling results in Canada following the 2015 election. And you can see that opinions stay relatively stable for a while, and then interesting stuff is going on. Interesting stuff is going on. And this is not because somebody has said you have to wear a mask or you have to stay inside. This is just opinions evolving through people talking to each other and interacting with their environment. And so I got interested in this behavior. And the question I asked was, if we take these intrinsic opinion dynamics and couple them with disease dynamics, what do you get? Before I get too much further, I want to thank my collaborators. Thank my collaborators. So, I'm going to talk about three projects today. The first two are with Steve Crohn and Bert Bohmgartner from the University of Idaho. Steve on the right is a probabilist, and Bert is a philosopher who does models. Awesome. And so he was the one who led the behavioral dynamics and cognitive theory aspect of the model. On the first project, the undergraduate student working with us, Stephanie. Undergraduate student working with us was Stephanie Hamilton. And on the second project, the undergraduate student working with us was Noah Marshall. They were both amazing. And then the third project, I'm doing with my collaborator, Ian Moyles, who's also a Canmod-funded researcher, and our graduate student, Avi Kor, who is watching today. Okay, so with this team of people, we started by building the opinion dynamics model. The opinion dynamics model. So, I want to get this explained and then we can couple it to disease. This is the simplest version of the opinion dynamics model we created. What we have is we have a two-issue topic, or sorry, a yes-no. We have one issue with a yes-no end. And because we're going to be talking about disease, let's call this prophylaxis. So, at one end, we have non-prophylactic individuals, and at the other end, we have highly prophylactic individuals, and in the middle of the Prophylactic individuals, and in the middle, we have individuals that are more moderate within their opinions. Any of these groups can interact with the other groups. So that's what these red arrows are. They're actually supposed to be more red arrows, but I thought I was getting too confusing. So I've just drawn one set of red arrows. But imagine every single one of these boxes is connected to every other box by a red arrow because they can interact. However, movement can only go along the black arrows. So if So, if a highly prophylactic individual interacts with a highly non-prophylactic individual, their opinion will shift one step. So, one of the individuals is the focal individual, the other one is the interaction partner. So, if this is the focal individual and this is the interaction partner, this individual will move one step to s minus one. So, we can't have big jumps. So, the red arrows are the interaction. Red arrows are the interaction pathways, and the black are the movement pathways. Okay, we had other aspects of our opinion dynamics model, so if you're interested, I'd be happy to talk later, but let's stick with this simple one for now. Okay, so in the highly mixed case, we can write an ODE for what's going on. So, let's just again focus on this box, the highly prophylactic individuals. So, that box, in So that box increases when S minus 1 individuals move to the S minus 2 box. So that happens if this is our focal individual interacting with a prophylactic one, the movement will be one step this way to the left. Okay, so that's what's going on here. And I'll tell you what the W's in a minute, so ignore them for now. So this is S minus 1 individuals becoming S2, and then all of these other interactions lead. These other interactions lead to s minus 2 becoming an s minus 1. So if an s minus 2 interacts with any of these other boxes, it becomes an s minus 1. Okay, so what are the w's? The w's are the weights or the influence. But unfortunately, the word influence starts with I and infected starts with I, so it's a problem. So we need another word, so we call it weight. So I'll use the word influence and weight. So the influence one group has on another. One group has on another is this W. So W minus 2 is the influence accorded to the S minus 2 group. W1 is the influence accorded to the S1 group. And we can, the simplest assumption is that all groups have the same influence, so that's uniform weighting. But we can also make assumptions where, for example, extreme opinions have more weight or moderate opinions have more weight. And we looked at all those different cases and they affected. Those different cases, and they affect the dynamics in this group. Okay, so that's the opinion dynamics. Now, let's couple it to disease. So, this is our standard SIR model where the S group now has four boxes that are shifting according to the opinion dynamics model I just discussed. And to keep things simple, let's assume uniform weighting in the absence of disease, but as soon as there's some But as soon as there's some presence of disease, this box affects the weighting. So I'm not pointing at the movement arrows, it actually affects the weighting, and then that eventually affects movement. Okay, so we looked at several different kinds, several different ways in which the weighting can be changed by prevalence. The simplest is you The simplest is linear. So, as prevalence increases, the weight, this is the weight of the prophylactic group, this is the weight of the non-prophylactic group here, the moderates in between, and the weighting changes linearly with prevalence. We can also assume non-linear changes in weighting. So, this is saturating, where now the influence can only grow so much. Because of the mask, there's this funny thing. Because of the mass, there's this funny flip-flop in here where the ordering changes, which also has an effect. So we call these the linear influence and the saturated influence. Okay, so now if we write the ODE down, this is the same as the one I had before, except now we've got this movement to the diseased group, and then all of these weights depend on prevalence in the population. Okay, what does this look like? Okay, what does this look like? So, just for comparison, I'm showing this is the SIR model with no opinions. So, everybody is in the non-prophylactic group. So, if everybody's in the non-prophylactic group, the disease comes through, the recovery group is really large because everybody gets sick and we have one wave and we're done. If we put everybody in different boxes, but we don't allow movement between those boxes, then the final side. Then the final size is smaller because we've got more individuals that are protected and we get one wave. It's just small. Okay, now let's look at what happens with influence. So if we allow individuals to move between those different opinion groups and we have linear influence, final size is similar. It's actually smaller, but not much from this case. But now we can see where people end up. So people most Where people end up. So, people mostly end up in the moderate opinion groups. With saturating influence, the final size is smaller still, and most people end up in the moderate prophylactics group. Okay. But in all cases, we get one wave. We never saw more than one. All right, so then NOAA came along and COVID came along, that first. And COVID came along. That first paper was written before COVID. And Noah had some other questions, and he decided that he wanted to simplify the model and just have two of them in groups. Okay, you're either prophylactic or non-prophylactic. Never mind the other stuff. But then he also introduced a cost. So there is constant pressure for the prophylactic group to become non-prophylactic because, damn it, it's a pain to carry that mask around and all the other things. Otherwise, the model is the same. And so the equations look like this. Here's the movement to disease, as usual. This is, because there are only two groups, we can simplify it a bit. So this is just the net movement from non-prophylaxis to prophylaxis. And so we take the difference between the weighting, the weight accorded to each of these groups, and then there's the interaction. There's the interaction. Okay, and infected and removed as usual. Now we used, so NOAA used non-linear influence functions, so bypassed the linear influence case. And then here's the cost of prophylaxis, this C here, and then a saturation parameter. So in the absence of disease, we have uniform weighting, though there's this cost of prophylaxis, which means it's going to be a constant movement towards the non-prophylactic curve. Non-prophylactic group. Okay, so here's a plot of the influence functions. So here's the prophylactic group. They gain influence as the infection prevalence increases. And then this is the non-prophylactic group. And this is the difference between the two. Okay, well in this model we can get four waves. So this is the baseline. This is the baseline rate of the opinion dynamics. So that's that weight function. If we look back where it appears, I mean, it's a weight accorded to the opinion of that group, but of course it also affects the rate of movement from one box to another. So as the rate of opinion dynamics increases along that axis or the weight of infectiousness, Of infectiousness increases on this axis, we get a different number of waves. This is no wave. And then one, two, three, and four waves. And so there's a balance, right? So if we're up here, if the infection dynamics are fast enough, you'll never get more than one wave. I suppose we haven't investigated it here. But at least within this space, you'd never get more than one wave. But if you're down here, then as the opinion. Down here, then as the opinion dynamics increase, you can go from one to three waves. Down here, we can get up to four waves. For a fixed rate of opinion dynamics, as infection rate increases, you go from no wave to one wave to two to three to two to one. Okay. We find that on peak size is monotonic. Is monotonic. So it doesn't matter whether you're increasing opinion, the rate of opinion dynamics or the rate of infection. In either case, peak size changes monotonically. So if opinion dynamics are faster, so when I say peak size, I mean the highest peak. So the highest peak gets lower as opinion dynamics get faster or gets higher as infection dynamics get faster. As infection dynamics get faster. Final size, however, is non-monotonic because that depends on the number of peaks. So, final size, as opinion dynamics increase, final size will decrease until you get another peak forming. And then it'll increase for a while as that peak gets smaller. And then it'll increase when the next peak shows up. So, depending on where we are in this space, we can have And in this space, we can have final size increasing and decreasing. But we always find that the second peak is lower, or each subsequent peak is lower than the first one, because there are fewer susceptibles left. Okay. This third project is with my current student of NEETs. So the model looks similar. Similar, there's still this cost of prophylaxis, though in this case it's framed as a loss of fear. But now the infectious group only affects the rate at which non-prophylactic people become prophylactic, and the recovered group affects the rate at which prophylactic people become non-prophylactic. So the influence structure is a little bit different than it was. You're looking puzzled, Jonathan. Looking puzzled, Jonathan. I'm just wondering why. Why? If I meet somebody who's recovered, then I then it's like, oh, well, maybe the disease isn't such a big deal. I'm going to quit wearing that. Other questions? Okay. And this is a simplification of a model by Epstein and co-authors. In their model, they actually have three groups. And so Avniet simplified the model down and did a bunch of analysis. The model down and did a bunch of analysis that Epstein hadn't done to explain the behavior. So I just want to look at this simpler model and compare it to the other. Okay, so the ODEs again are similar. What I want to point out, so here's the two disease. What I want to point out is that the influences are all linear in this case. So this is movement from non-prophylaxis to prophylaxis through two. To prophylaxis through two behaviors. One is the interaction between these two groups, and that has a rate. And then there's this effect of prevalence. And so, and has a different rate. But the rates, this is linear, right? So it's increasing linearly with prevalence. And the loss is similar. So the movement from prophylaxis to non-prophylaxis is, here's this colour. Non-prophylaxis is here's this cost, the loss of fear, and then this is the effect of running into people who recovered and you decide it's not such a big deal. But again, it's linear. Okay. So here's what the time series looks like in this case. I want to focus on the middle box to start with. So what we're changing is the rate at which fear is acquired. So we're changing this parameter. Changing this parameter here. So, the rate at which increasing prevalence affects movement from non-prophylaxis to prophylaxis. So that's the only rate we're changing. So if you change that rate, and it's, I don't know if you can see these numbers, but it's small here and getting bigger here. So if it's small, you get one disease peak. Disease peak. This is the infectious population. If it's a little faster, you start seeing a second peak emerge, but this time the second peak is larger than the first thing. As it gets faster still, so the rate at which fear is acquired by meeting sick people, the peaks become more separate, but the second one is still bigger. And then eventually, the opinion dynamics are fast enough so you just get one peak, it goes away very quickly. Get one feet, it goes away very quickly. What's happening in this, so this is the prophylactic group. So the prophylactic group increases and decreases, as you would expect, so it decreases when the epidemic goes by, but eventually that movement towards prophylaxis becomes so fast that they end up stuck there. So we've got a lot of people that are still in this. That are still in this highly prophylactic group, and the final size is quite small because they stay there after the disease. Okay, so in the analysis that Ian and Abniet did using asymptotic analysis, which is really cool, they can show where these bifurcations will happen. Okay, all of this is a prelude to my Canmod funded. To my Canmod-funded work, which is Mijan's work. Do you want to wave? Mijan, a PhD student. He's taking this opinion dynamics and disease framework and then trying to fit the output to data to see if we can say something about opinion dynamics in the population. It's a little trickier here because, of course, there are policies going on as well, but this is what we're working on, hoping we can say something. In particular, we're focusing on the In particular, we're focusing on the southern interior of BC and the Yukon as being fairly different populations and quite different from a Vancouver population, for example. Okay, so what have we got? So it looks like fast enough opinion dynamics can lead to multiple ways. But in the first model, even if we increase the rate of opinion dynamics, we didn't get multiple ways. And I think that's because. Think that's because we had these multiple levels of entrenchment, and so movement towards one end or the other of the opinion spectrum was necessarily slow, because you had to go from one box to the other. The third model, we only get two waves, and I think possibly that's because the influence is always linear. There was no non-linear influence in that model. So these are my hypotheses here. We need to check them. What's meaning that sometimes the second peak is larger and sometimes it's smaller? I do not know. After that second model, I thought I understood the story, and then the third model came along, and I clearly don't. And then, of course, a big challenge is going to be measuring grounds. We clearly have multiple levels of entrenchment. How quickly can people move along that spectrum? I don't know. So, what should those opinion influence functions look like, and what should those dynamics parameters be? We don't know. So, this fitting exercise that Nijan's doing is a challenging one, but we're hoping to get something in it. So, thank you all for listening, and I hope I've left one.
