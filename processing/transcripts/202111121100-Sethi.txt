Yes. Can you see the blank iPad? Yes. Yes, we can see it. Very good. So I have a lot of fond memories of past BAMF workshops where we congregate and discuss issues of the day. And those memories are very nice. Mummies are very nice. And I also remember in the past, I tended to give maybe to the detriment of the participants, Blackboard folks, at these events. And I thought I would try to continue that tradition. So the organizers asked me to discuss some aspects of no-go theorems. I should also apologize that the week has been very crazy because last two weeks have been very crazy. So I didn't get to participate as much as I would have liked in the early days of the workshop. But I look back at some of the slides, particularly of the string. Particularly of the string cosmology discussion, and they're very provocative. And I want to present a different perspective on some of these issues. And I want to tell you the kinds of things I'm thinking about today. So let me start with an outline. The other thing I like about doing it more Blackboard style is it could be a little bit more of a free-flowing discussion, hopefully. So feel free to interrupt with any questions or comments. So let's just So I'll structure the talk as follows. I'll start with some discussion of no-go results. That was the request to explain why it's difficult to construct the city solutions. And then I'll very briefly discuss sort of what I currently view as the status of the 2B landscape. Again, I really regret not being able to attend some of the earlier discussions. I think it would have been a lot of fun to hear answers to some of these questions. And finally, I'll describe current work, which is toward a construction of non-classical string solutions. And then let me start by explaining before it gets lost in the weeds what I mean by that. So, normally we've been discussing situations where we'll compactify down, say, to R4 across some Clavier, maybe the base of a Clavier fourfold. This is F-theory. And turn on some fluxes perhaps in this story, look at some warp. Story, look at some warping, and then try to understand something about the physics of these backgrounds. This tends to run into problems, as I'm going to explain, in terms of actually giving us solutions with control, solutions in which we can even discuss things like ADS. Are there ADS solutions here? As deformations from R4, are there DS solutions? And this tension is basically the tension. And this tension is basically the tension of swampland versus landscape. Now, we can't really be as a community in a situation where a fraction of the community claims to have solutions that are decided, that are reliable, and a fraction of the community says, no, there's general principles that should rule out such solutions. We don't know what they are, but we have some inkling that they should exist. Exist. That's not tenable. So, at some point, I would hope that we could come to a consensus about what we actually understand today and what we could robustly say has been understood, has not been understood. The approach I want to take is one that I hope will lead to a computationally useful background. And the idea is to start with solutions either of the form R4 cross something. Which are classical string solutions, which means that there'll be conformal field theories on the well sheet. So there'll be some associated conformal field theory. And I want solutions which are not supersymmetric, specifically not supersymmetric. So we just had a really interesting discussion about do we know examples of spaces that are geometric and non-supersymmetric? That are geometric and non-supersymmetric, and they're very hard to construct. It turns out there's sort of an analogous story for compactifications to six dimensions, even at the level of things like asymmetric warberfalls, where if you try to break supersymmetry, you tend to generate tachyons and get something unstable. It's actually kind of weird. But I want things that are not supersymmetric, but which will give rise to a one-loop vacuum energy. So I want some one loop. One loop string induced correction. And I want to compensate that one loop correction by shifting whatever bare cosmological constant we started with in a way that will lead to some hopefully stable minimum. So it sounds a little bit vague, but later on I'll try to present something which is pretty concrete. So this is a situation where So, this is a situation where the deformation away, say from Minkowski, or it could be a very flat EDS, will be very small. It'll be a water G string. And if G string can be made very small, we could hope to get, we can answer questions. So the aim here is to answer questions like, are there scale-separated ADS? Which we can't really get classically in string theory. And even better, this is the real hope. Can we get this either? Get decided. I'm not a skeptic of the existence of metastable decisive solutions in string theory, although I have been a very vocal skeptic of the constructions. And the hope is we can end up with some framework where we will have a description that will give us some computational power. So we could actually reliably see that it exists and actually use it to learn something about quantum gravity in these backgrounds. Backgrounds. That's the sort of goal of this work. Okay, let me start with some overview of no-go results. So, sorry, I want to make one more comment here. Here I'm including loop corrections, string loop corrections, but there's nothing string non-perturbative. I have no idea how to reliably get control over string non-perturbative corrections in almost any of these settings and hope to say something concrete. So that's the idea. Let me start with some no-go results. What's our task? Well, our task is to understand dark energy and string theory. That's my goal. Dark energy in string theory. That's my goal. Yeah. You know, our observed dark energy, as we've heard in this workshop repeatedly, is tiny compared to M Planck, but it's about 70% of the observed critical energy in the universe. This massive hierarchy is something that is hard to explain and has been a major challenge for string theory from the beginning. Major challenge for string through from the beginning. So, the two leading ideas at the moment are landscape, just massive numbers of solutions, and we can perhaps tunnel from one to the other. Or a swampland, where, or by swampland, let's say time-dependent dark energy, something other than vacuum energy. Now, this was codified by Farfine collaborators in things like the refined December conjecture. Which involved conjectures like the slope of any potential coming out of string theory, which we Which we can call lambda, should be greater than order one, or this is or it's kind of a weird conjecture to have an or in there, or the shape of the potential was constrained. Again, to be order one. If you confront simple models of V with data, so for example, if you model with a single field model, example, if you model with a single field model, say, to constrain lambda, something like an exponential, or you model as a single field model a cosine to constrain C, you find that C gets pretty small, say at the 68% confidence level. That was from data from maybe two years ago. So one can start saying, well, conjecture. One starts saying, well, conjectures like this, numbers of order one, there may be things to explain. To make this conjecture a little more precise. It still seems the most likely explanation for dark energy is vacuum energy. And we're seeing something that's well approximated by a metastable decisive solution. So, what's the problem in string theory with such, we're trying to find such solutions? Solutions. I apologize if I'm going to review a few basic things and then I want to get to what I think is to me a sharp, a relatively sharp no-go theorem that we can try to build from and evade. So the goal here is basically to frame the no-go theorem and then to frame a way to evade it and hopefully find something. So let me remind you how these no-go theorems originally came about. And the first approach we'll take is a space-time approach. I'm going to do two approaches. The first will be space-time. The second will be from the Wall Sheet. So there is a classic no-go that goes back to Gary Gibbons. Who realized that if you study supergravity in d equals 10 or 11 at the two derivative level, so you study an action root g r plus stuff for the matter fields that yields stress tensor appearing in Einstein's equations. Obeys the SEC condition. So stress density T obeys SEC, which is the strong energy condition. This is the heart of all the problems, really. It's supersymmetry up at the UV, and it Up at the UV. And it will descend down to compactifications, will descend down to almost any simple attempts to evade it. So, what is the statement? The statement of SEC is that the time components of Riemann, of Ricci, are positive. Or if you want, more precisely, it'll be some time-like forward point. Forward pointing back to, but it's basically saying R00 is greater than zero. And in situations with acceleration, you have to violate this. So we need SAC violation to achieve acceleration. And our universe looks like it's accelerating. So the proof of this is very straightforward. I'm going to frame this in one corner of string theory, which is the corner from which we'll... Theory, which is the corner from which we'll strengthen it to a statement about the Wall Sheet. So, if you look at, say, heterotic supergravity in 10 dimensions, the fields are a metric, a diletton, some H field, and some gauge fields. And there's a two-derivative action, which I'll write at once, which in string frame frame is r plus 4 d phi squared some kinetic terms all standard no funny signs nothing strange going on minus a kind of weird normalization for the gauge field with an alpha prime plus terms of order alpha prime and you just write out Einstein's equations Einstein's equations. So they're one half red phi, grad phi, plus stuff. Then you evaluate R00, which here is one half pi dot squared plus stuff. And you see that all the terms are positive. And that's it. And then you extend this to compactifications by saying, I'll compactify on something, and the something could be warped. So some compactification manifold, M. and you pick a metric a warp metric in general with some space-time g mu nu plus some internal metric gij and you relate the higher dimensional um recipe tensor say indequal tenden Tensor, say indequal 10 in this case, to the lower dimensional Ricci tensor by formulas out of Bob Wall's book in terms of the wall factor here, the some power maybe eight. You multiply by w to the eighth, you integrate over y, and you conclude from this that r00 in lower dimension also obeys strong energy. So, compactification of anything standard. Magnification of anything standard doesn't help you here. So, the same argument, also, by the way, same, essentially, the same argument. The Roman's Mass actually is not included in this argument, right? I mean, you have to show it separately. Good. So, the Roman's Mass was the case, including Roman's Mass was shown by all the Saint Redunius. All the same reunions, yeah. So it's just separate, it's separate. I have to say that it's a little more subtle. I mean, of course, most of the argument is just as simple as that, but this might point to the fact that maybe the Romance Mass is a nice direction to go to. Of course, that's my personal obsession. So now we'll shut up. So the Romance Mass is a really interesting direction to consider. Really interesting direction to consider. What is missing is you have a theory of massive two-way supergravity, thanks to Romans, but we don't know, for example, the analog of the higher derivative terms that you would add to it, which seem to be critical in this context for things like fluxes. So you're constructing ADS solutions largely, right? You mean me? Yeah. Right, the higher derivatives terms are missing in. I mean, we don't know much about higher derivative terms in general, right? Not just with the Roman's mass. Of course, the situation with the Roman's mass is a little worse. It's worse because there is no quantum theory in that case. So there is the Perspino perspective, right? So you can use the in the you can include the You can include the Ramong Raman fluxes in the pure spinner formulation. And so, presumably, you can also include the. Yeah, you can try in the pure spinner to turn it on, but it's not a small perturbation when you turn on the Ramis mass. And it's a really interesting discussion, but I would say. Yeah, I agree. I did. Sorry, Barriers. I could shut up. If you had localized fluxes, you could try to do that. But I think for the Romans theory, you want an analog of string theory. And there's no analog of string theory. That's sort of the upshot. Log of string theory. That's sort of the upshot. And that's what makes it so difficult to determine things like other orientable planes, other than using approaches like the one you were investigating by looking at space-time. Because there is no a priori definition from string theory, unless you could dualize something in a way that you could trust. There are tools. Well, there is the situation with the OAIDs in Volczynski, Witten, for example, the dual to type 1. For the dual to type one, I mean, that's a case that we trust, but um, yeah, so the cases where you have o-planes and you have regions, I mean, your point, your point is well taken, yeah. It's just it's just harder, but for this argument, you're absolutely right. This sketch that I just gave can be extended to the Romans case, but it should be there's one extra hoop to jump through. Um, very good. And the same argument also rules out not just accelerating universes, but flat universes, for example, but flat universes for example of the form of or cross you know clavier if we like clabiows with flux compact solutions with flux they're also excluded basically by the same kind of argument um so what what can evade this story you might say well maybe i can throw in a brain or anti-brain or do something um along those lines but none of that will really work brains anti-brains etc Brains, etc. Those are all objects with conventional stress energy. And as long as you assume you have a static solution in the internal space, these don't work. Okay. String theory is a lot more interesting than conventional sources of stress energy. As we just mentioned, you also have things like orientable. Just mentioned, you also have things like orientable planes, which are in perturbative string theory completely fixed. And I have actually never seen any reason to believe that they are not localized objects and actually develop some dynamical degrees of freedom, unless you go to something very strongly coupled with or split into collections of brains, like in F-theory. So, in perturbative string theory, these are fixed. In perturbative string theory, these are fixed, localized objects with negative tension. They do violate sec. That's the first thing. So there's some chance that perhaps the violation they induce is sufficient to give us an accelerating universe. But it's very hard to. But it's very hard to check in general. It's very hard to check because you need to know something about high derivative interactions that are supported on these planes. To do this from a space-time perspective, specifically four derivatives. And today, we still don't know the collection of four-derivative interactions in total that. Of interactions in total that are supported on D-brains and O-planes in string theory. One day, I hope we'll know this, but it's still quite a daunting task. There's large collections of couplings that are known from various arguments for using duality and so on, but there's no complete understanding of the total set of couplings. So we'll take a different approach. I like duality, and most of the physics we're discussing here can be found also in this heteronic frame. Also, in this heroic frame, but in the heroic frame, we have some advantages, some big advantages actually. One, the leading high derivative interactions are known. And two, we understand the wall sheet description. That's going to play a role for us in just a moment. Let me add some pages. So this argument originally from Gary Gibbons can be extended nicely in heteroik. If you ask what are the dual couplings that play the role on orientable planes of, for example, allowing you to. Planes of, for example, allowing you to obey these no-go theorems in, say, type 2b, those couplings are of order alpha prime. And the order alpha prime action in heterotic, I'm going to include the gauge model, which we already discussed, which is still two derivative, but they just appear together, gets modified in a very nice way. It gets modified by just the inclusion. It gets modified by just the inclusion of a Riemann squared term, though it's kind of a messy Riemann squared term. But we know it. That's the nice thing. And in addition, the definition of the H field is modified to now contain Chinese interactions. And this is Berkshire and Deroux. And the root. Okay. So now you say, okay, I've got this action, it's kind of a mess to work with, but I just go ahead and I grind it out. I write out Einstein's equations. I write out the Dillaton equation of motion. Those are the only two you actually need for this. You use Einstein, you use the Dillaton equation of motion. And you find. And you find on doing this calculation once again that R00 locally is not positive. So again, some hope for actually generating an accelerating background. But then you have to impose one additional condition. If we compactify into four dimensions, down to d equal four, we'll impose the condition that Will impose the condition that the Planck mass, the 4D Planck mass is finite. And we can model space-time, say, in a nice way by taking a space-time to be something maximally symmetric just with a cosmological constant. You could do the same argument also works if it's time-dependent, like FLR. It's time-dependent, like FLRW. But let's just do a maximum symmetric 8. And then you work out lambda. And lambda, which would be zero at the two-derivative level, is now not zero. It is at least potentially not zero. It's given by some expression, but the expression is a sum of squares. It's actually a messy sum of squares plus terms of order alpha prime squared with a minus sign out front. Minus sign out front. So the conclusion that you draw is that you can't generate positive lambda. You can only generate potentially negative lambda thanks to this perfect square arrangement. Actually, pretty non-trivial the way everything summed up. So again, sort of the inclusion of orientable planes looks like it's not going to save the day. There will be no uplifting and no acceleration. Okay. Last approach for nodal occurrence, and this is the most powerful that I know of. It's possible there's something better out there at the moment, but I'm not aware of it. So we've discussed in the discussion session, there was a discussion of cancer. Discussion session: There was a discussion of: can we have non-geometric backgrounds? Could we have non-geometric fluxes? Could we have all these ingredients which are exotic from the point of view of large volume spectrifications? But they're things that we could potentially understand if we had a world sheet description. So we're going to work at tree level in the heteroic string here. And the tree level action has an infinite set of high derivative interactions. High derivative interactions. We're going to get r plus the one we just looked at, alpha prime over four, trace r plus squared, plus alpha prime cubed, r to the fourth, plus lots and lots and lots of stuff. And at tree level, there are certainly solutions of Minkowski and ADS type. And there are solutions with flux, which evade that flux no-go through. These are the non-KLO type backgrounds, non-Kalar torsional backgrounds. So it's definitely buying us something. Buying us something to get stringy and heterotic. And the question is: could we get the sitter out of this, or is the sitter just excluded? So the argument is cute. This argument is due to sorry, maybe I shouldn't say who's on Maxfield. I think Ilarian is here, right? At least I showed him earlier. At least I sort of know the Ilarian, my colleague David Kudasov, and myself. And the argument goes as follows. Imagine we want to get to the Sida4. So we have something with the Sida4 isometries. But the isometry group of Desider IV is SO41. And that's got to be a symmetry of whatever Wall Sheet theory you write down. Whatever World Sheet theory you write down, as long as you have something in space-time, which has, you know, you would morally call a decisive solution. So these should be realized as symmetries. That means there'll be currents associated to these isometries, and these currents should be considered. And these currents should be conserved. Now, what we'd like to do is usually rotate our world sheet to be Euclidean. So we'd like to wick rotate x0 to ix0, but you typically can't do this. You typically can't do this because, for example, in most of the ADS compactifications we study, there is some kind of flux that threats space-time, and that flux will become imaginary. But in this case, life is good or pretty good. Life is good, or pretty good. The only flux in the heterog string is an NS flux. So it's H3. So you can thread space-time if it were the SIDA3 with an H flux, but in every case like the Sidder 4 or larger, there's no obstruction to us making this quick rotation. So DS3, and actually interestingly, DS3 is going to play a role in the third part of the talk. In the third part of the talk, is let's call it problematic in the sense that it could evade this theorem. I actually like the potential for constructing DS3 a lot. So in all other cases, we can make this rotation and our decider space becomes a sphere, becomes compact and nice. And this gives us the ability. The ability to say that these currents, instead of being just conserved like this, are now separately conserved. They become holomorphic. So we've got some symmetries, Cax Moody symmetries associated to our isometries. Isometries. So J J has a level and J bar J bar also has a level by conformal invariance. So any putative well sheet description. So, any putative well sheet description of one of these heterotic backgrounds is going to have this nice current algebra. It actually has two copies now of the isometry group. And that's something we wouldn't naturally expect, but it seems hard to evade this. I should say this is not what happens in Minkowski space. Where rotation generators don't become hack-smoody. And the difference is the difference in the nature of the vacuum. With the vacuum in Minkowski space having scattering states to go down to zero energy, it's not normalizable in the same way. And this argument requires a normalizable vacuum. So to get gravity out of this, we demand, so to get gravity, things that look like gravitons, we demand positive levels on both sides of the string. One side should be supersymmetric because we're dealing with the heterotic string. So one of these should be promoted to a super character. Should be promoted to a supercax movie. Let's say the left. And that constrains k to be larger than or equal to 4. What this level is telling us is basically the size of our sitter space. So our ds land scale. Let's call it L squared is proportional to K in string units. So we will want K to be large to have something that we will call a macroscopic decision space. Okay, what else do we know? We want a critical string theory. So we'll want So we'll want C and C bar. We're putting supersymmetry on the left, so this should be 15 and 26, a bosonic string on the right. But the nice thing is we can factorize out a contribution to the central charge from our current algebra and be left with a coset theory which has to fill out the rest of the central charge. So there is a nice game we can now play. A nice game we can now play that the supercax movie itself already uses opt. Let's do it like this. This is like k minus 4 over k. I'm going to do this in the case of four dimensions. Four dimensions. This is for DS4. And that leaves some amount of central charge as kxmoody plus C coset or 15. The two have to sum back to 15, and we will also want C coset to be positive, to have a unitary theory. Theory. Well, once K gets big enough, K of order 21, I think in this case, C coset is less than three halves. But that means it must be. it must be must be and then equal one minimal model with C coset sort of 30 over k minus 1 and then you can match on the central charges with the minimal models to these values and ask what values of k are Values and ask what values of k are possible. The minimal models are usually labeled by some value p. And you get a couple of discrete solutions. So you find that k minus 4p takes values in this set. This is 18. This is 18 with P12, 21 with 6, and 27 with 4. The point is, they're small. There's at best a couple of small desitters that you could hope to build at a sort of order string scale. And there's no macroscopic desitter possible here. And it's just a symmetry argument. We just use the symmetries of desidter to each. Symmetries of the sitter to eat up some central charge and then constrain what was left if you had a critical string theory. Now, this argument obviously includes the supergravity argument, includes the supergravity plus alpha prime corrections, but it includes a lot more than that, actually. So, under what conditions, you know, what did we assume here? So, the dilaton. The dilatone doesn't have to be stabilized. The model can have hackyons. It doesn't have to be stable at all. There's simply no stable or unstable solution. I think it's the most complete no-go theorem I know of today. So, if you try to make a story like I turn on some flux, I add some instant hunts, I get a decision minimum, I get, excuse me, I uplift it, get the ass. That's what he seems to. That story seems to break down, at least at tree level. What we're missing here are string loops and string non-perturbative. I like this approach because it's systematic. There's no separate ingredients being thrown in left and right. It's sort of all there, and we know what we don't have. Don't have so if there's going to be a decision or hiding out in heterotic, it's got to involve some of this stuff in some way that hopefully can be made tractable. Okay, 1140, good. That's an overview of no-go theorems. Any questions on the no-go theorems or comments? Or someone has a stronger version? I mean, Alessandro might have a stronger version. Excuse me? Oh, go ahead. No, no, I have my name. I thought you might have a stronger version of these. No goals. But since you involved me, any version, what about approximate? Let's say. Yeah, you break the currents in some way. Yeah, what about an inflationary background? I actually had the same question. Yeah. So inflation. I actually had the same question. Yeah. So inflationary, so inflationary backgrounds we can't constrain with this argument where we require these symmetries. But I guess you could. So there's two problems with inflationary arguments. Sorry, the space-time argument, including order alpha prime, extends to FLRW. So there you can do time dependence. The real issue with time dependence is how do you treat it on the world sheet? How do you rotate the theory? And how do you How do you, um, yeah, it's a very uh deep question of how one should work with time-dependent string backgrounds. I have no good answer. I wish I had a good answer to that question. So you could say, you know what? We should never insist on a desider vacuum, an exact metastable desider vacuum anyway. And perhaps that's the way to evade this. But you could ask, you know, if I allow the currents to be approximate in some sense. To be approximate in some sense, like almost CAC smoothie. Could you get any mileage out of it? It's not clear. But certainly, in direct analogy to having an ADS vacuum that preserves the ADS isometries or having Mikovsky space preserving, well, Mikovsky is another trickier issue. It's certainly preserving Poincaré. This seems to not exist with this here. Okay. Let's end the part two: status of the Minkowski 2B landscape. And then I'll return to what I'm actually trying to do right now. So how can we have such a big divide in this community? I saw the slides discussing string cosmology and Cosmology, and I saw the statements made earlier. And it's very hard to understand how those statements are reconciled with what I think is a reasonable understanding of the constructions at the moment. So let me give you the reason for my unease with this. So let's do this all in type 2B. Type 2B or M-theory? Now I say in M-theory because F-theory vacuum. Theory because F-theory vacua of type 2B nicely studied on compactification in M-theory. These were reduced to 3D vacua of our M-theory background. So what's the setup in 2B? The setup in 2B is either an oriental fold of a Clabio three-fold or the base of some elliptic four-fold, if we're doing more generally F-theory. For this point, For our part of the discussion, it doesn't really matter. So we might as well just stick with an orientable old of a clavier as something more familiar. Cross R4, and we thread it with some set of fluxes. It's important that there's both an H flux and an F3 flux. And there is also a Phi flux always present that threads space-time. This is the flux background of 2B. It does not exist at the level of supergravity. That's what Gary Gibbons told us. No super solution. Period. There's no debate on this point. Now you can say in standard law. Say, and standard law goes, let's reduce on this background, and we will get some kind of n equal one effective theory. And n equal one supergravity in four dimensions. That n equal one supergravity is characterized by a Kayla potential and by a super potential. From which we can write down the physical potential in the usual way, just from Westenbager, saying so, there's some physical potential, you know, V this is a starting point for all these all these discussions. Discussions. And people argue that the resulting k is no scale, which means it has this form. And then they play around with trying to find a W naught, which is given by a flux superpotential, goes to some period calculation. Goes to some period calculation on a given club. And that's been the story. And there have been some spectacularly small W-naughts found recently by Liam McAllister and friends in using ideas basically for mirror symmetry, trying to cook up examples of this kind. And if this is true, then there's an enormous, I mean, if these are valid starting points for an analysis, then there's. For an analysis, then there's an enormous number of such blocks back to on even a single clavia. The landscape is right there. You pick your favorite clavia forfold, you'll probably get gazillions of these things. While you can give us an estimate how large that number is. And then there's some steps added to this. You add, whatever this means, instant tons to your constant. To your constant to stabilize the volume. And finally, there's some uplift procedure from adding antibrains. Okay, the first point I think one should stress is if W0 is not zero, then SUSY is broken classically. And these are not solutions of the space-time theory ever. Space-time effective action in any approximation. In any approximation, there is no approximation in which these are solutions. So, the real question one is asking by trying to study a flux background with Susie Broken is, what do you mean in string theory by studying an off-shell configuration? How do I start with an off-shell configuration and do something? I don't know. There's no prescription in Polchinski for dealing with off-shell vacua. There's no prescription from the wall sheet. There could be some hope from string field theory, but I don't think anyone yet has developed enough technology to ask that question. Because intrinsically, such backgrounds, if you pick just a random metric, say just pick your favorite non-reachy flat metric, compactify on it. It doesn't really make sense in gravity. Stuff starts moving, things tend to get singular. Moving, things tend to get singular in the far past, far future. If you can even construct the solution, we don't really know what we're doing. That's the situation you have if you start at a point in the moduli space where supersymmetry is broken. W naught, I'm going to stress it again, W naught is an obstruction to solving the space-time equations of motion. So when I see slides where people say we have these solutions, it's a little bit weird because It's a little bit weird because they're not solutions. Of course, what they mean is that they use effective field theory. Good. So if you say these are solutions to this effective field theory, with a K given by this and a W given by this, then they will be solutions. Because if your Kayla potential is no scale, then you will generate no physical potential. You will generate no physical potential in space-time, and you will there will be no obvious obstruction. Okay, the particular doesn't require you to start from a vacuum and then you perturb it. I mean, you just put the ingredients together. And I mean, I agree, of course, that there is no prescription in Polshinski, but there's no prescription in any text to deal with off-shell string backgrounds as a starting point yet. No, but. No, but in quantum field theory. No, so there's a huge good. So there was absolutely no problem in quantum field theory with starting up a potential and constructing quantum corrections. Because if you start in quantum field theory and you're not at a solution, you usually have a well-defined ultraviolet theory. And from that well-defined ultraviolet theory, you can compute what you mean by an instant loop correction, what you mean by an instant home correction. You mean by an instant home correction, and it's easy to construct examples that will give you whatever you want-you know, some stabilization, maybe have a runaway or something like that. That's because you know the ultraviolet definition. The problem with string theory is, if you, or quantum gravity in general, is if you start with something that is not a solution in any approximation, I'm going to explain this effective field theory comment in a moment, then you don't have an ultraviolet definition of the theory. Definition of the theory. And if you don't have an ultraviolet definition of the theory, because the classical background at best is cosmological, likely to be singular in far past or far future, then string theory doesn't give you a formulation where you could determine what quantum collections mean. Quantum collections are always computed around some background. I think on this point we could probably agree. No? Yes. All I meant to say is that, I mean, of course, if you believe that fair tip theory still applies in this situation, then yeah, I do. So, okay, good. So, Alexandra says, What's wrong with effective field? So, I like. Effective field theory. So I like effective field theory. So first, I'm just going to state the claim again. This is what we normally do when we compact the buy, and we sit here at some solution. These backgrounds do not look like this. These backgrounds actually look like this. You sit here and you want to roll somewhere. Even this is too generous. Like, we don't know even this picture. This is the best case. Let me put it like that. Let me put it like that. If one can make sense out of these backgrounds at all. So, why am I saying this? Let me come back to the effect of hilarity in like one minute. So, our entire discussion of flux landscape over the past 20 or so years has sort of been in the spirit of many flux vacua on. Many flux vacua on a given clavier, but that's not how it looks to me actually at all. That looks like completely not where the landscape is coming from because classical flux vacua are not of this type, are not solutions. You might as well just pick some random points in the moduli space and talk about them. There does appear to be a landscape. So the landscape to me. To me, it is coming from the fact that there are of order 10 to the 3000 or more clavier fourfolds. It's why I'm so fascinated by the number that's come out. So there's a geometric landscape that we understand something about today. That geometric landscape would involve picking a Claviel fourfold, picking a choice of flux, and then hunting. Of flux and then hunting around for a solution that's supersymmetric with w naught equal to zero. And this is an over-constrained system. Albrecht was measuring some of the modular properties that could help with finding solutions to the set of equations, but there's basically order one or no solutions on any given clavier per clavier. That's That's a collection of an enormous collection of legitimate starting points for semi-classical string analysis. Sorry, could I interject a question? Yeah. When you say that's order one or no solutions, you mean including all possible fluxes for a fixed flux? For a fixed, so let's say a fixed flux solving, say, TAPO cancellation. Good. Yeah. So let's just. Good. Yeah, so let's so there's going to be a very large number of fluxes. Let's forget D3 brands. There's a large number of fluxes that satisfy tadpole cancellation. Each one of them should give us such a vacuum, right? Well, it's not obvious that you get any solutions. It's actually very, I mean, it's very hard to find solutions. It's overconstrained. So when you say order one or no, you think that it's quite possible that most of the fluxes that satisfy the tadpole condition will give you no solutions and the one. Give you no solutions, and the one will be rare. Is that what you're saying? That would be my guess. Yeah. I mean, maybe with more technology, we, you know, one could try to make a large number of those fluxes per collab here have at least one supersymmetric solution. But, you know, it's, I mean, counting, counting, just naive counting for an over-constrained system is just telling you, you know, it should be sort of order one. And when you say it's over-constrained, Good and when you say it's over-constrained, can you quantify the extent to which it's an over-constrained system if you have some large number of degrees of freedom? Yeah, I mean, so the prior condition that people will solve is something like a critical point for the potential. Yeah. Super potential. And here you're adding the extra constraint that W itself vanish. Yeah, good. Okay. So this is H31 worth of conditions plus one. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Sam. So I think, you know, it's not that we don't have a landscape. We have a landscape. It's the landscape you've been describing in terms of these constructions. I just don't see any landscape from flux vacuum that breaks supersymmetry here. Now, it could easily be the case that if we understood how to compute quantum corrections to the superpotential around Around a semi-classical starting point like this, a supersymmetric solution, that we will find lots of minima somewhere that we can trust. Maybe. I mean, there's lots of questions about how you should interpret the effective field theory result. I mean, if there's a big crunch between you and some minimum, is that minimum really part of some connected moduli space that you could understand? It's no mean fee. And I think Tom Banks is like trying to emphasize this many times. Trying to emphasize this many times: it's no mean feat to change the asymptotics of space-time, and having vacua that actually will change lambda as opposed to just finite excitations in the interior of some space with fixed lambda is, it's not completely clear, effective field theory makes sense for that kind of question. But here, I think for this question, effective field theory does make sense. I mean, this is a precise statement of solutions in the spirit of I build a clavier to solve space-time. To solve space-time equations of motion, and I get a semi-classical starting point. Good. Actually, one more comment before I come back to Alessandro's query that affected appeal to, which is, you might now ask about instantons. How am I supposed to understand instanton corrections in this background? And here also, there's a discussion which I do not understand at all, because these backgrounds always have a space-time flux. A space-time flux. It is tied to the warping, it is tied to the fluxes. To discuss instantons, we usually interpolate from Minkowski to Euclidean space. So if we interpolate, so for instantons and quantum effects in general, we go to Euclidean space, but this background is complex. Because the background is complex, it's not even obvious to me what kind of brain would give rise to a space-time potential. Hopefully, this is just a technical issue of, you know, how should you deal with a background? I mean, the analogy here is with Chern Simons. This is very much like Chern Simons. So this is more like More like Shern-Simon's theory than Yang-Mills. Where when you interpolate, the action becomes complex. And your fuel configurations that correspond to instantons are usually complex field configuration. Don't really know what that means in the context of a gravity background. Perhaps one can make sense out of it. This doesn't, to me, this is an interesting computational question. Interesting computational question: Can we understand the physics of this background and formulate what we mean by an instanton? And here, there's good reasons because this background exists, there's good reasons to believe we should be able to do that. Though I don't know how right now. Okay. Oops. I should speed up a little bit. Let me try to answer a little bit Alessandro's objection or comment, which is why don't we just trust effective field theory? Why don't we just trust effective field theory? But I do trust effective field theory. The point about the discussions that occur around these backgrounds is that this is not the right effective field theory. Why? I'll sketch it. Let me sketch it in M-theory, where we don't have to use, go into detail. Use go into details of oriental volts, blah blah blah. It's all the same reasoning that will apply in F theory. Imagine you had R3 cross your favorite clavier four-fold, and you turn on some flux again. Again, the action at the two-derivative level is just Einstein-Hilbert plus some stuff, and that stuff includes the coupling. The coupling, the flux coupling that we will use to cancel some type of. And there is no solution, thanks to Gary Gibbons. If you add to this eight derivative terms, for example, the r to the fourth plus dot dot dot dot dot, there's a C wedge X8, the famous coupling that we need, which the Beckers originally used to construct these solutions. This will generate our gravitational tadpole. Generate our gravitational tadpole, the thing that will actually allow us to evade no-go through. So, this will allow flux. But we also need this r to the fourth because this will cancel the stress energy, cancels the flux, stress energy, stress energy, which is of order chi over 24. So you can't. You can't just focus on this coupling and ignore everything else at the eight-derivative level. These are all connected by SUSY. It's one SUSY multiplier. Now you have a problem. If you do a consistent Pluto-Klein reduction and you say, I need this guy because I need to evade this no-go theorem at the supergravity level, and I need this guy because I've got to cancel out the stress energy from my flux, then this term also does something else. Also, does something else. This r to the fourth also modifies your k from no scale to something with a scale. Always. And because it does that, your consistent reduction is not a no-scale supergravity. If you want to evade the supergravity no-go theorem, the price you pay is Price you pay is your low energy theory is not no scale, so you cannot ignore it, even though many people seem to. So that's the reason why effective field theory is good, because effective field theory is telling you that if you turned on a W naught, this term would generate physical energy and you would not have a solution. I don't really see where one could debate this, except pointing out that there's some error in this set of claims. But that's the picture, as it looks to me, about the. Basically, you're saying they didn't actually derive the correct effective field theory. That's right. That's completely right. That's completely right. You can truncate, you can fool yourself into truncating at no scale if you only look at couplings in this multiplet that, say, generate a tapo. But when you actually look at the action, these terms are all connected by SUSY. Any reduction that will generate a supersymmetric effective action must include all of them. We don't know what they all are, by the way. There's a bunch of couplings in here that. A bunch of couplings in here that are just unknown today. But what we do know is that this one will generate a modification of k. And that's telling you that you fail to solve the equations of motion. I don't really see what approximation would ever allow you to ignore that. This does not apply to the solutions I built in 99, which are supersymmetric. So in that case, we So, in that case, we insisted on W not equal zero in today's language. And there's no obstruction to, I mean, the situation then is much closer to a Clavier threefold compactification of type two. The Clavier threefold metric, the Richie flat metric, is not a solution by itself, but you just correct it order by order in alpha prime. There's no obstruction to correcting it. Here, there is an obstruction. There is simply no solution. I'm running late. I apologize. Could I have maybe five minutes more to just? Maybe five minutes more to just sketch. Sure. I think technically you're just eating the discussion time. So I think it's as far as I understand, it's fine, but I should. Okay, so I will throw in just a few more comments. So I ask myself now, what do I actually want to understand in this story? What is actually going to be useful? In this story, what is actually going to be useful for me to understand? And I really want a case where I have some measure of control that I can compute something that I believe in, and something that might teach us something about quantum gravity in space-times that are either non-supersymmetric, and it could be ADS there or Minkowski, or hopefully, metastable to citad. So for this now, I want to return momentarily to the no-go results. No go result. I don't know how to deal with string non-perturbative effects. They're hard to incorporate in a framework that lets you compute things, but I have some idea how to deal with loops, string loops. So now I go back to the very beginning where I was saying, what do I mean? Where I was saying, what do I mean by this? I want to aim for either to sitter, or I want to aim to say something about scale-separated ADS, or the very provocative and interesting conjectures about non-SUSY ADS and the lack of CFT, the pros lack of CFT by Uguri and Baffa and And Fray Vogel and Matt Clebon. So it would be nice if we had a family of non-supersymmetric string solutions that were stable, perturbatively stable, weakly coupled, that we can analyze. I don't think we have such a family today. And so the hope is to build such a family. How do I want to do this? So, again, the idea is to balance a one-loop potential from the breaking of SUSE against balanced against a shift in Lambda, the spacetime cosmological constant. And/or fluxes. There's reasons here to be cautiously optimistic about the potential signs of V1 loop. So in 10 dimensions already, if we look at tachyon-free strings, tachyon-free non-supersymmetric strings, there are three examples. There are three examples. Two are oriental volumes, and one is the heterotic O16 cross-O16 model, but they all have a V1 loop that's positive. So three examples with V1 loop greater than zero, as opposed to negative. Negative would be the sign that would cause you to run away to infinite string coupling. So they're restorative. Infinite string coupling. So they're restorative from that perspective. They have the right sign to kind of take you toward the sitter. How do I want to do this? The problem we always run into when we break supersymmetry is everything becomes unstable. You have any moduli in the game, they tend to want to run away, you get potentials, and it becomes a mess and kind of hopeless. So I want to build a string island. I use this terminology because my colleague here. Terminology because my colleague here built string islands. So, a long time ago, Dabakar and Jeff Harvey constructed a series of super symmetric, so they built SUSY asymmetric orbit volts with only the delaton, it's a modulus left. The delaton at some modulus left, so you freeze out everything except the delaton. This was in type two with um only the delaton. So I like this story a lot. So they have an example morally, what would be a four manifold? Something that will play the role of a torus or k3 from starting with t4. From starting with T4, they picked T4 with a special lattice. The details of a lattice, we don't have to worry about too much here. And then they modded asymmetrically by a Z5 symmetry. So this asymmetric global foaming is some arcane technology from a long time ago that probably most people have forgotten or never used, but it's Never used, but it's an orbit fold quotient where we choose to act differently on the left and right of the string. So they do an asymmetric orbit fold by Z5, and they end up with a theory with 16 supercharges in this case, and no module A. So this is sort of in the list of backgrounds. Backgrounds that you could put the type 2 string on, but it's a totally non-geometric one. So, sorry, they overfall by a Z5, and I should make one extra comment. The reason this works is they add to this plus shift. So, Z5 on one side, say on the left, plus a shift on the right. Treating the string asymmetrically. It's a really nice construction that they used. So, I was like very. So I was like very happy with this construction and I was like, let me take this story and try to break Suzy. Sounds like it should be easy to do. So I'll take the type 2 string on T4 and I'll mod in some way that will break Suzy and hopefully give me an island. So I want no tachyons and no moduli. And no moduli. That would leave only the dilett to play with. And then I can start playing a game of balancing the one-loop potential for the dilettant against curvature of space-time and flux. So I've been working here with an undergraduate, Zinni Akara, who's graduating now, and Daniel Robbins. Robbins, who's an expert on these asymmetric corporal fellows. And we play with models in type 2. And to our surprise, every attempt so far, all attempts in type 2 have led to tachyons. Telling us something, maybe again about the power of Susie in this story, some underlying specialness of having morally special holonomy in the game. Because here I would have thought we could have found something that, you know, it's not an exhaustive study, but we were just trying out different cases, but it just we just kept running into problems with tachyons. So the current aim. Current aim is to extend this to heterarch. That's nice because heterarchic, SUSY is only on one side. So we've already morally gotten rid of SUSY on the bosonic string side. And on the super string side, we can try and do the same kind of Z5 quotient that Jeff and the teacher did. So heteronic on T4 modeled it again by Z5 plus shift. Now the heteronic string. Now, the heteronic string is good from the perspective of it's easy to break Suzy, but it's bad from the perspective that it seems to already have lots of moduli. We have all of the Wilson line moduli for E8 cross E8 floating around. So we start with the E8 string. And here there's a nice story. I'll take one minute to just sketch, which is on this. On T3, there's a standard component in which E8 cross E8 is unbroken. And you preserve all SUSY that we study as an Ryan compactification, but there are also non-standard components with the same SUSY on equal footing. So there's a component here in which you turn on a what's called a triple. What's called a triple? It's a flat connection, so zero field strength, but non-zero churn sign invariant. So I had a table somewhere. Oops. All right, forget the table. So delete pages. Yeah, yeah, I have to. I should should have actually. Should have actually, if I knew how to like just paste directly into it, it would have been it would have been useful. But the turn-simons invariant for this triple connection for E8, there's one case at Z5 and one case at Z6. And this has to do with their construction as asymmetric overfolds. So these can be constructed as asymmetric overfolds. But very close to symmetric. I mean, it's asymmetric only in the sense that we're acting on the gauge bundle and then geometrically shifting on the three torus. So nothing's really happening to the three torus. But the choice here is one fifth in the Z5, two fifths, three fifths, four fifths. And in the Z6 case, for each E8 bundle, we have one sixth. Bundle, we have one six and five six as potential choices of Transimon's invariant. We to get anomaly cancellation to work, we have to embed one Trans Simon invariant in one E8 and the opposite Trans Simon's invariant in the other E8. So we could do, for example, one-fifth and four-fifths. And that would work. So the nice thing about this story is that once you do this, in this particular case of Z5 and Z6, you get Case of Z5 and Z6, you get complete rank reduction. You're left with the marginalized space of Wilson lines just being a point. So it begins to look much more like a type 2 story, except you don't have supersymmetry on one side. So the lattice, which would have been gamma 420, but say T4 reduces the gamma 44 as it would have been in the As it would have been in a type 2 setting. So that's very neat. It means we've already gotten rid of all of the Walton Line moduli, and now we just have to freeze our Taurus, our four Taurus, hopefully with the Z5 action, and see what the one loop potential looks like. Okay, so this is in progress still. I mean, we're hoping this is going to work. No tachyons. The main issue is tachyons here, but I'm being optimistic that we can. I'm being optimistic that we can, and we have a big lattice to shift in now on the non-supersymmetric bosonic side. So, odds of us finding a shift vector that works is pretty good, I think. And what am I going to do with this? So, normally, if you have a compactification like R6 cross a quotient of T4, and you get a one-loop potential for the dilaton, now there's assume there's no other marginalized but the dilaton, it will run away. So, it'll either want to do this or it'll do this, depending on the. This or it'll do this, depending on the sign. But what we'd like to do is replace this by ADS3 cross S3 cross T4 mod this G with NS flux. This is a very heavily studied story, this ADS3 plus S3, usually with a conventional torus. This is one of Maltzena's original backgrounds or the S dur. Backgrounds or the S Door, one of his original backgrounds. The nice thing here is that there's a classical potential for the dilaton. So the dilaton is already stabilized at a value. The value is e to the phi is of order Q5 over Q1. And you have an ADS length scale already, which Which scales like L string squared, I think q5. So tunable. So we can tune our G string to be small, hopefully. This one loop guy will then be a shift in some direction of our background. But this is bulk, non-supersymmetric, hopefully computable, and hopefully with a perturbative well sheet. And so we can begin to address questions. And so we can begin to address questions, some of the swamp line conjectures like: is there a CFT holographically describing this anymore, or is that no longer true? I'd like a framework where I can actually compute something. And if we can get this to work, this should be such a framework. I've run over substantially. So let me stop here and thank you for your patience. Actually, as the final speaker, maybe we should all thank the organizers for their hard work as well. Okay, yeah. Let's thank everyone. Okay, yeah, let's thank everybody who helped organize this, including Sav for being the last speaker. Okay, so more questions for Sav or any other items? I think we got some time. I see Wadi's hand, so please go ahead. Thanks. That was a nice talk. I'm really interested by your perspective here. I mean, so you're basically saying that as soon as you break supersymmetry, you're in trouble. As you break supersymmetry, you're in trouble because you're not necessarily using the right effective field theory. So, I have two questions which are kind of related. One is: there are these cases where, like, I know we looked at some cases in the paper with Sean and Oliver and Alexander about 2A, where you could get supersymmetric flux vacua, and then you could do this thing called skew-wiffing, where you basically just switch the signs on some of the things related to supersymmetry. Of the things related to supersymmetry, and it still looks naively like it obeys the effective action equations of motion, but you break supersymmetry. And the skew-whiffing thing is from some ancient other class of solutions, which were basically found in a similar way. You write down a supersymmetric solution, you flip a couple of signs, and everything still looks like it's well-behaved, but it's no longer supersymmetric. And the second question, which is sort of part of that, is that all of those solutions naively have tachyons, but they're Have tachyons, but they're within the Brighton-Lunar-Friedman bound. So they're actually apparently stable theories because you apparently have an ADS solution with a negative cosmological constant and this tachyons are kind of stabilized. So do you have any comments either on the skew-wiffing thing or on the BF bound question? Like are you, when you find tachyons, are you sure that they're below the BF bound? No, that's a great question. So for the tachyons, the The tachyons, the problem here is that they tend to be string scale because we frozen the torus at size string scale. So there's nothing that lets them become large. Yeah, small. It's the negative mass width. I mean, so they're large, negative mass. They're like very large negative mass width relative to having, say, a reasonably flat AES-3. If this becomes true. AES3. If this becomes stringy, what you could do here, Ashley, you could make it like order one. This is the direction that Gabadio and friends have been investigating heavily. Then maybe even with tachyons, it's a question of numbers. Are they going to fall below the BF bound or not? And that's something we haven't checked because I was just kind of hoping we'd get a clean example with like no tachyons and not have to worry about it. But no, it's a very good point. But no, so it's a very good point. One may be forced in type two, for example, to only have stringy solutions where the tachylons are sort of within BF. Now, the other thing you mentioned, the two-way cases you think of, are these ADS solutions or Minkowski solutions? They're ADS solutions. So I believe we have some ADS solutions. This is like from a long time ago. I haven't thought about it recently. But if I remember correctly, when we did the flux compactifications in ADS. Compactifications in ADS, um, you know, there were a number of things that came out of it. One was it one was actually some no-go theorems, like the one you described, you know, where you get sums of terms of superpotentials. But we did find these parametric families of vacua, which were, I believe, supersymmetric and ADS. But if I remember correctly, you could flip some signs in the solutions and you got something which was basically exactly the same solution, but it was no longer technically supersymmetric because there was just some sign that was different. There was just some sign that was different, and that meant that it was no longer supersymmetric. And I've never really understood whether the physics of those is suddenly radically different and it's destabilized by stuff that comes in out of nowhere that you didn't expect, or whether actually you would expect that these are just fine, nicely behaved. And your general philosophy seems to suggest that there should be a problem with them. And so I'm curious whether you might. I think I remember. Are these the massive, these are massive two-way solutions? These are massive two-way. Absolutely. Massive two-way. Okay. So I think I okay. Okay, so I think I think I okay, so I had some concerns with those solutions, even in the supersymmetric case, right? Okay, I mean, you could your answer could be you don't believe in the solutions in the first place. Yeah, I think that would be my answer because I think they were starting from, you were starting from a collabiato, I think. Yeah, we're starting from a collabiat. We're doing massive 2A. And, you know, like Greg Moore has perennially complained about massive 2A because it doesn't have a nice limit of M-theory or something. I think you may have also. You may have also complained. I've also complained, but for different, I think, slightly different reasons. So, if I remember right, the ingredients were something like this with maybe an orientable plane in there somewhere, like an 06, maybe. So, Greg would be worried about what does this mean, a massive 2A. Like, given that there's no Walsh definition of an O-plane, how is one supposed to make it? I had a more basic. So, my philosophy again is: I need a semi-class. Philosophy again is: I need a semi-classical starting point that I understand. And the problem with massive 2A is: let me forget the O-plane for the moment. Collab Yao with flux, or even without flux, it doesn't really matter. Cross R4 or even cross ADS is not a solution because of the Romans parameter. And in this case, it's not a solution in a way that gets worse as the volume gets bigger. Because the Romans mass is the one flux that doesn't dilute as you go to large volume. It's always there. A large volume, it's always there, so you always have a dilettante here, which is not accounted for. Um, now I know if I remember right, you guys did an effective field theory reduction on this. Yeah, but used like Grim and Louie's 2A reduction stuff. Yeah, correct. Yeah, so it's unclear to me whether it makes sense to reduce massive 2A around, you know, it would be like reducing on a sphere, sort of, and asking. We're using it on a sphere, sort of, and asking what the effective theory would look like. Um, sorry, a sphere is a bad example because it's very symmetric, but I mean, you could do that. Sorry, that you could do. But here, I think what you'll find is the O-plane is localized. So, if I wander, you know, away from it, it doesn't do anything to the Einstein equations. So, if I'm looking at the metric, so normally with localized O-planes, which are not like O8 or O9, you know, co-dimension two or bigger. Too or bigot. The solution sort of has to approximate a solution of the ambient supergravity theory at large volume. Yeah, no, I see what you're saying. So, you would question the existence of the solutions in the first place. So, the skew-whiff ones, you're not even going to worry about because you don't think the things that you're getting there from are, I think Alessandro has a question. I don't want to dominate all the time. So, thanks a lot, Saf, for a nice talk. And thanks to the organizers for organizing a very nice workshop. Again, I've also enjoyed the workshops in Burrs up in Canada, and it's great you guys have this one now going down in Oaxaca, and I hope someday. We're now going down in Oaxaca, and I hope someday we can actually be there in person. Okay, yeah, thank you. See you guys. Hi, Max. Good seeing you. Actually, I have a bunch of questions. I don't know where to begin, but so what you hit on, so your set of solutions has been a long Has been a long point of contention between Saab and myself. So we have talked about it for a long time. And about this, I would like to point out that I had a work on an approximate uplift of that solution. Of course, this doesn't prove that it exists, but it's a 10-dimensional realization. Well, I mean, a 10-dimensional realization where you don't have to, you know, believe. Sorry, but Alessandra, yours was SU3 cos SU3 structure or SU3 structure? SU3 cross SU3. Yeah. Yeah. So not clabia. Anyway, sorry, I didn't want to go in that direction. We'll fight about that another time. No, no. I mean, there are solutions which are not clavial, for sure, as starting points. But clavial is not a good starting point. It's not a good starting point, right? Starting point, right? Like I said, I don't want to be sidetracked. Actually, so it's since I didn't quite understand why you were talking about this going through that solution to so it was the point to exhibit solutions without tacklings or with tacklings without tackens. So what do you want exactly? Are you con happy also with tacklings above the DF bound? With takens above the DF bound, or you actually wanted to know who you're asking the question, you, you, you. I mean, because so my point is, my point is that there are a bunch of solutions without instability, without perturbative instabilities, let's say. So, with vacuums above the bef bound. So, there are even some distributions. even some so this is a is an example when you when you say solutions are you are you saying ads solution so there are ads solutions so you know there are some old um mpq manifolds and so only m32 is supersymmetric but if you look at mpq which is a generalization in the old days people looked at the perturbative stability and they claimed that therefore p over q inside some For P over Q inside some window, then there were no perturbative instabilities. Of course, I didn't review their computation. It might be true. I mean, if you want, it's a different story. If you want not even any fields with negative mass, that's a low harbor. But of course, as you know, the issue in all these new conjectures is not even that because even if you find a solution with no perturbative instability, there is the issue of non-perturbative instabilities. Yes, yes. No, what I want is a quantum theory. That's the difference. So I don't want a supergravity theory. I want a theory where I can actually compute something about the About the holographic description directly. I want a family of string solutions that I can actually work with and compute something. So that's a worksheet model. I want a world sheet model. Yeah. I want a world sheet model where I can say, look, this is what I mean by string theory in a non-supersymmetric background. What technology do I need to develop to understand that? So, do I understand correctly that at the end, in the end, so far, you didn't. In the end, so far, you didn't get any without any tackles in type 2. So, in type 2, without any tackles, but without any tackles above the BF bound, or oh, we didn't check. See, see, these these were all in, these this was just in CFT. So, this is just a statement about T4 quotients. So, to ask about the BF bound, you'd have to marry it with the ADS3 cross S3, and then I could tune the cosmological constant there to be whatever I want it to be, basically. Whatever I want it to be, basically. So the problem, the real problem is that the tachyons have a mass of order string scale or mass squared, you know, of order string scale squared, ms squared, with some numerical factor in front of it, you know, a fifth or something coming from the twisted sector. So then there's a comparison between that and a string-sized ADS-3. And I really want to have a macroscopic ADS-3 at the end. At the end. So, the kind of tachyons that come out of asymmetric global flows tend to be, unfortunately, extremely negative mass, you know, very high negative mass squared. And so, either you want to deal with stringy gravity theories, which one could do. I mean, it's interesting in its own right. But I really just want something simpler. And that's the reason I was just hoping for no tachyons. By the way, I don't think it's killer. I mean, it might be killer in type two, but I don't think it's killer in. But I don't think it's killer in Heterotic to get this out. I'm still quite hopeful we'll get a tachyon-free model out of this with no modulate, an island in the story. Then the question becomes extremely interesting because there's an interplay between the mathematics of finding consistent asymmetric bulb of holes, which is not a solved problem by any stretch, and then computing the one-loop corrections of the cosmological constant and balancing them against quantum modifications. Against quantum modifications of Lambda. And you could hope to get things like scale-separated ADS from this. Because you're not doing anything in the context of supergravity. All those no-go theorems are thrown out the window. But they're still structured. I mean, they're still structured from string theory. It's not giving us anything. It's not that we can just cook up whatever we want. There are rules to the game. I want some rules to the game. I want some rules about what is good physics, what is consistent physics, that makes sense. What is consistent physics? That makes sense. That's the reason for all my earlier objections. There are no rules that make any sense to me. But this set of constructions is, I think, potentially promising. It might crap out with some issue that we haven't understood yet, but I don't see it at the moment. I should say the only reason I focus on T4. Focus on T4 today is that, well, A, the lattice is easier to deal with, but is precisely because I could embed it in that ADS3 cross-S3 setting where the dilatone is stabilized then. So then I really have a solution with no marginalized fixed string coupling that's perturbed away from its supersymmetric value. The six-dimensional theory reduced on this torus quotient really is completely non-supersymmetric. There's no sign that it was. There's no sign that it was ever supersymmetric unless you go all the way up to the Planck scale. And there, you could really ask: are these you know, is it defining a unitary CFT or not? And if it is, then I think ADS CFT is okay in this setting. And if not, then we should see some sign of non-unitarity. I think Ilarian has a comment. Has a comment, yeah. Hey, everybody. Um, actually, more a question, Savdeeep. Now, there's not so much a comment. So, uh, this is very, very cute setup. Um, since at some point you you're going to deal with a runaway potential for the dilettant, right, that you're going to fix up with, uh, for example, a stabilizing flux or something like this. Yeah, is there? Like this, yeah. Is there any reason not to start with the 10-dimensional non-super symmetric? Yeah, that's a great question. Yeah, so I thought about actually starting with, say, O16 cross O16 already and compactifying it. One would still, the only reason I didn't want to start with it initially is one would still need to kill the flux module, the Bolson Light modulite for the O16, cross-O16. O16 cos O16, and then rigidify the torus with some appropriate asymmetric quotient. And it looks basically like the same order of difficulty as doing this case. Because in this case, I can start with the E8 cross E8 supersymmetric string, kill off all the Wilson I moduli with a relatively easy asymmetric quotient, which still preserves supersymmetry. And then I was hoping I could just piggyback off Jeff's and Atisha's construction in four dimensions, which, you know. Which nicely broke Suzy on one side, generated no tachyon, and killed all the modules. So that was the only reason not to do. I mean, I think if it works, basically I want a proof of principle. I want one case that works. I'm just hunting around for the simplest example that could actually give us a concrete realization. And then once one has it, there's like tons of questions to play with. I mean, the question you might immediately ask is, Immediately ask is what do you mean by string theory in that background? What are you supposed to compute? How are you supposed to compute incorporating the fact that the G string is shifted a little bit? How do you do Fishless Husky in some way that actually is computable? I think Ashok Sen is sort of, his one PI version of string field theory. Oh, sorry, 1 PI version of string perturbation theory on the Wall Sheet has sort of given away to potentially do that. A way to potentially do that, right? Those, yeah, those kinds of answers in the spin 32 compactification seem to be in that direction, yeah. Yeah, yeah, all those models, they were always perturbing back to some SUSY vacuum. And here, the goal will be, okay, it's going to be non-supersymmetric. Let's see if we can learn something from this. And I should say that the Gabba DL program of trying to reconstruct, you know, they do the case of K equal one here. They do the case of KQ1 here, the very stringy ADS3, and attempt to reconstruct a symmetric product of T4s as the holographic description. And there's a lot of that construction that just works. I mean, it works nicely. So if this worked, and if one can make it work for K41, you might hope to really construct something about the dual theory. Maybe that's high in the sky, wishful thinking. But I mean, we first need this thing, this ingredient. First, need this thing, this ingredient to fit in. But it doesn't look hopeless, I think. Thanks. More questions, Prasad? Well, as we are in a string final workshop, I would like to assume something very simple about the generalization of this theory. I mean, so there you are compactifying the theoretic on a four-dimensional space. So you see that it would be easy to It would be easy to go away, I mean, like to have no problems with this no-go worksheet theorem you have by doing a similar construction of compactifying the delta on some orbifold constructor more or less like that. Yeah, I mean, so the reason to do T4 here, it's a great question. The reason to do T4 here was simply to have a nice setup where we could deal with the delaton. With the dilaton. I mean, the dilaton could be made classically stable. This thing has a nice holographic interpretation in the Susie case already, and we can kind of explore those questions. But if you want to do string pheno with this, what you really would want to do is take T6, find an analogous quotient, and then ask, can you find a stable minimum for the dilaton, balancing it against just cosmological constants, A? And actually, in thinking about this talk last night, I found, I think Sanyoti and friends in some Oriental examples have tried to do exactly that. Though their examples are, I think, are all the form ADS across something. And the hope here is you get something to sitter across something. So the question of the landscape might change to a question of what is a spectrum of one loop cosmological constants that you can generate. Cosmological constants that you can generate from string theory, say, as an example, from asymmetric global magnifications. There's a huge set of choices here as you increase the size of the space. Much like as you go up from geometrically from a four manifold to six or eight manifold, you just get a massive increase, you know, exponential increase in the number of things. So, there you could ask, what is the range of values? I mean, just how big or small can these things get? Get. It's really kind of neat to think about. So I'm excited about the prospects, but cautious until we have something that works as a proof of principle, you know, that one can play with. I had hoped we would have had it today. I mean, this type 2 one was close. This tachyon showed up, which made it suspicious. But yeah, so this is not doing. Yeah, so this is not doing, this is not addressing things in string piano, like how you get the standard model of this kind of story. Because I think the first question for me here is just can you get acceleration? That's the most zero-off order question and then worry about the technology to build particle physics into it. Okay. Thank you. Great. Oh my God. I totally forgot. Thank you so much. I unfortunately have to introduce somebody in a talk that we're supposed to have started. It a few minutes ago. It's been a little bit of a crazy week, as I mentioned. I told you. Well, thanks, Sav. I mean, I guess hopefully someone's done it. But thank you. Let me stop the share.
