Please go ahead. Thank you, Thomas, and thank you, Hans. Thank you guys for organizing this conference. I just am very sorry that we cannot see each other in person and just unplug from all the minutiae of our daily lives. But anyway, so I wanted to tell you today about our ongoing project. Our ongoing project on trying to understand how two cells move together. And this project is by no means close to completion. You will probably see in the talk that there are more questions than answers. So it's rather kind of a conversation than finished projects. And for this reason, just feel absolutely free to interrupt me, ask either. Ask either in the chat or just by interrupting. So, okay. First, the slide, which probably is not even in need of being shown at this meeting, phenomenon of collective cell migration and health and disease is one of the most fundamental phenomenon in cell biology at the top of. Cell biology. At the top of the slide, this is an example. It's rather a cartoon of how multiple cell sheets closing the wound by moving into the wound. And in those case, number of cells and diversity of cells is just enormous. And it's not really a cluster of cells, but rather like a semi-infinite cell sheet. Cell sheet. So at the bottom left, it's a collective invasion of a small cluster of cancer cells. Again, no need to discuss the importance of that. And at the right bottom, it's one of the most fascinating and delicate process of border cell cluster migration and the resolution egg chamber. Chamber. So that's largely speaking what I'm going to discuss: how small groups of cells migrate together. And from those cartoons, you see that the cells have different roles in the cluster. It's very much part of the conversation these days that at the front their leader cells, then their follower cells, and you will see that this is true in our systems. So another concept. So another concept that I wanted to mention in the beginning, hopefully many of you also heard of it, but this is a little bit more specific and maybe some people haven't heard of it. So my impression from listening to talks in collective cell migration that these days the most fashionable, the most hot topic is the supracellular migration concept. And it was kind of around, but it Kind of around, but it was emphasized and promoted tirelessly by Roberta Meyer and Adam Schoward, starting from their paper in science three years ago. And so what they reported from very beautiful microscopy images of small cluster of cells migrating together is that cells are not individuals in this cluster. Cluster rather, the group looks very much like one giant cell. More specifically, they were saying that the special distinction between the cells at the periphery of the group and even those cells are not the same. Rather, cells at the rear of the periphery, they mostly do contraction. And this contraction squeezes the cells. The cells at the very rear into the interior, while the cells at the front of the periphery do some protrusive activity. And then cells in the interior either actively or passively are being pushed forward. So, of course, the more microscopic mechanical processes and mechanisms behind that. And mechanisms behind that are very much in question. But I'm very much in favor of the supracellular concept. It just doesn't have to be taken as proven at this point. It's rather work in progress. So the so-called model organism for us is the Siona intestinalis. It has a lot of A lot of advantages. One is that it's invertebrate, so you can do whatever you want with it. You can shred it. There's no issues with treatment of animals. It has a genome which is very economical compared to ours, yet all the crucial genes are there. And it has muscular and vasculature systems. Musculature systems not unlike ours. So it's also a super close relative of vertebrates. So for all these reasons, it has been one of the favorite model systems for developmental biologists. It's of course not as famous as Drosophila or Serigans worm or yeast, but there's a significant community working with this organism. With this organism. So we are not that much interested in the development of this organism, but in one super important sub-process. So most of the cells of the embryo of Siona have very determined fate, very much like in C. Elegance worm, and they don't move relative to their. Don't move relative to their neighbors' staying put, which makes development much simpler than, for example, in Drosophila or especially in higher animals. However, there are two cells called TVC cell pair. TVC stands for tranventral cells. It's not important to understand what it is. It's rather geometric definition. So those cells, they Cells, they are heart progenitors. When they'll start dividing later, the heart and vasculature system will be built from those cells. We are not interested in that. We are interested in the fact that only these paired cells at some point move from one place of the embryo to another. Like, if you want to more clear picture how they move, it's kind of. It's kind of envision this. So at this point, the embryo is the bulk of the embryo, the body, which is, let's say, my head, and the trunk, which is my body. And those two cells are originally at one of my nipples. Sorry for unpleasant connotation of this. And so those cells curl like this, up, up, up on my chest, on my neck, to my chin. On my neck to my chin. So that's pretty much what we're interested in. And the sister pair of cells crawl from another nipple also to the chin. At some point, they meet together. Not going to discuss the developmental significance of it. It's the process of this migration that we're interested in. So this is one of the striking micrographs of those two cells moving together. So they move on the relatively Move on the relatively stiff ectoderm, which is deformable but pretty firm sheet of cells enclosing the embryo. And they are squeezed from the top. So the bottom for them, the floor is ectoderm, the top or the ceiling is endoderm. That's a much more deformable, elastic body of the embryo. And those cells move together. And the important well-known thing is that those cells keep the order. There's a leader cell and the trailer cell. The leader and the trailer. Here, the bright things are the nuclei of those two cells, and you see the cells of the endoderm squeezing despair from above. So one can, of course, track those migrating cells. Those migrating cells, there are four cells originally, and those two cells start migrating. You can track the nuclei. This is the sister pair of cells from the other side. At some point, they meet. So we can render the surfaces and volumes of those cells. This movie is much more messy, but at this point, boom, there's a very short interval when two cells move together, the other two cells move together. Two cells move together, and so the red stuff is deformable in the derm. You see that the cells are not much deformed from the bottom where the hard floor, but they press into the ceiling, into the elastic ceiling. And finally, one can of course image cytoskeleton in the cells act in myosin. So in this case, the image is the signal from LIFE Act, white signal. And so you Signal and so you see that in the process of migration, transiently at some point there's much more acting at the leading edge of the leader cell than anywhere else. There's of course always a lot of stuff at the boundary between those cells which we do not completely understand. So looking at all these messy movies and All these messy movies and images. What can we do? So, our goal is to understand the mechanics of this migration. And at this point, let me also tell you. So, why this system? You normally hear people talk about clusters of cells or big sheets of cells when they talk about cell migration. But our logic was very simple. I love single cells. Love single cells and we understand what individual cell does much better than cell collective. So, wouldn't it be logical when we want to start to understand collective cell migration to look at the simplest collective system? And of course, two cells is the simplest. So that's our logic here. Plus, the fact that this is physiologically realistic, it's actually happening in life embryo, it's a clear. It's a clear 3D problem. It's pretty hard to reduce it to 2D. So it has all the hallmarks of the realistic cell migration that we want to do. The drawback, of course, is that it's not that much attention to this system. So we are pretty much flame blank here. So I will tell you mostly about this cellular puts model. Cellular POTS model that we did for those two cells. And then I will tell you what is my dissatisfaction with this model and what is the much more simple analysis that we are starting to do now. So first we tried cellular pots model. I gotta say for not very deep scientific reasons, there are basically two reasons. The software is out there and from the From the few papers I read that use cellular pots model, what I admire is the ease with which you can do 3D modeling. As almost everybody knows, especially I'm sure, for example, Hans Wotmer knows, the serious mechanical modeling in 3D and serious numerical simulations are extremely hard. So why not use it? So, why not use a model that is already out there? So, this model is conceptually really simple. The cells are characterized by effective energy functional H here. Of course, one shouldn't take this energy literally. It's rather mechanical energy. So, the idea is that this mechanical energy corresponds to To actual mechanical forces. And those forces, if we are lucky, can be written in so-called potential form so that we can derive effective energy functional. So there are three standard terms in this energy functional. One, the cells are trying to minimize the area. That's the first term here. The second term is the cells try to keep their volume being equal to a target volume. So the energy simply starts growing when area grows and volume deviates from the target volume. And the third class of terms is the so-called adhesion energy. Simply is saying that, for example, when two cells increase. When two cells increase the common area, the adhesion energy decreases, which effectively means that those adhesions, each individual molecular adhesion, decreases the free energy. Similarly, cells' adhesion to the floor, to the ectoderm, decreases the energy. Those are three terms. So it's very intuitive what happens, for example, if Intuitive, what happens, for example, if we get rid of the adhesion terms? Then the cells want to be spheres, right? Keep target volume, minimize the area, and not really adhere to the surface. And then if one cell, like this sphere, is on the surface, we start increasing adhesion, then it creates a half dough. And eventually, if the adhesion is very strong, it will be like a pancake. It will be like a pancake. So that's kind of the idea. Now, introduce adhesion of the cells to each other, we'll see kind of half domes pressed into each other. Very intuitive. Now, of course, we want to make the cell move. So there's already experience with that from a few groups that published papers modeling cell motility in the framework of cellular reports model. Silver Pots model. The idea is to introduce an additional energy term such that the gradient of this energy gives us forces that are effectively pushing the fronts of the cell forward and pulling the rear forward. I will show you what we used for those terms. And then the model used like at each time step the boundaries of the cell. The boundaries of the cells are breathing, and the system checks if microscopic deformations lower the energy and then this deformation is accepted or increase the energy. If it's increasing the energy too much, then the deformation is rejected. So, let me first tell you: obviously, there are some parameters. One of the cool things about cellular possible. Cool thing about Seller Pots model: there are very few parameters, but there are some. There's effective cord extension of the surface, there's effective stiffness of the volume, and of course, adhesion strength. So one can, of course, easily experiment with all these parameters, and we did it keeping in mind that we want to reproduce semi-realistic shapes. Reduce semi-realistic shape of those cells. So, for example, if we do the very weak cell cell adhesion, the cells just segregate. If we do strong cell adhesion, also intuitively what happens, the cell cell boundary becoming really large and elaborate, and of course, the cells do not move in the realistic geometry. Then we started playing with the different distribution of Different distribution of retractive forces at the rear of the cell. For example, making them concentrate more at the very rear versus broadly distributed of the rear half of the cell. Same with protrusive forces, and we can create this way cells moving with different geometry. And you kind of can see that in a relatively wide region of this parameter space, we get relative. Parameter space: we get relatively normal cell shape, and we can rule out some of the extreme cases. So, after doing all that, this at the bottom is the snapshot from actual simulation. We reached the cell shape which best resembles the reality. I will show you some quantification later, and this has. Later, and this happens very interestingly when the protrusion of the leader is strong, the retraction of the trailer is strong, while protrusion of the trailer is weak and retraction of the trailer is weak, which immediately argues for the supracellular arrangement. You see, the cells are not trying anymore to be individual, rather. Anymore to be individual, rather, the leader tries to be the front of giant cell, and the trailer tries to be rear of giant cell. And let me start complaining about the cellular pods here. The problem is I don't have great physical intuition for why this gives us the best results. That's one thing. Another, look at the distribution. Look at the distribution of those forces. So, in the view of the cell from above, those distributions look pretty logical, right? But if we look at the cells from the side, the best distribution of the retraction force is not bad. It could be like myosin cables pulling the rear surface to the center of the cell. However, we don't see in microscopic images any of those cables. Images, any of those cables. What is the most unpleasant feature is that we need the protrusion force to be distributed significantly away from the ventral surface of the leader, which pretty much suggests that there should be probably some active network here effectively pushing, right? But we don't see this elaborate network. It seems from It seems from microscope images that all actin and myosin really is at the dorsal and ventral surfaces, and the inside of the cell is kind of empty, well, empty of dense status calculal structures. I will get back to all these points later. For now, let us see where the model with this distribution of forces gets us. So, first, let me also tell you that with those forces, we can relative. Can relatively well quantitatively shift the geometry of the observed cells. One thing we can measure the rough sphericities of the cells in our videos and we found the distribution of forces that give very similar sphericities and then same thing aspect ratios. We are relative we matched the aspect ratios of those cells relatively well. Those cells relatively well. So I'm showing both two cells and one cell. As I'll say in the middle of the talk, there's some chemical perturbation which allows those cells to decouple and then they also can move individually, however, much less directionally. But still, we can quantify the movement and see the shape of those cells. So here's the cellular pod simulation in 3D of one cell. It really strikingly resembles the cell in the embryo. However, we shouldn't take it very seriously yet at this point. And these are simulated two cells that, of course, also strikingly resemble what happens. Rely on what happens in the embryo, and that this to remind that we are doing actually all the simulations underneath the elastic layer of endodur. So, this is view from the side. Okay, so now at this point, we have a model which resembles morphodynamics. So, we kind of have a good handle on. Kind of have a good handle on morphodynamic. The question is: is this model predictive at all? So I will show you a few simulations and respective experiments which show that there's some predictive power to the model. One thing is so we can upregulate protrusive activity in the trailer. It requires a very tricky genetic. A very tricky genetic technique by targeting a certain chemical, which is called Rho DF, which activates some machinery of the branched protruding actin network. We can target it to the trailer cell. And then the trailer starts to produce more than it does in wild-type cells. And then the simulation shows a pretty intuitive thing than when. Intuitive thing than when a protrusion of the trailer is stronger, first it tries to go around the leader and then it decides to go at one side of the leader, it tries to overtake the leader or rather catch up with the leader. This of course skews the orientation of the angle between the trailer leader axis relative. Relative to the direction of the movement of the cell. And so, the experiment shows the same thing: that the cells are becoming more side by side. This is the quantitative data. So, the experiment notably shows less difference than the theory. But, qualitative effect is there. So, another question. We are We are fairly certain, based on some biological data that I'm not showing here, that the protrusion in the leader cell is upregulated after the cells are polarized for matility. And this initial collective polarization is shown in this cartoon, which is a rendering of actual experimental images. So, in the beginning, the cells are always side by side, those are By side, those are two other cells which will produce all muscles in the embryo and which are left behind. And so the cells very rapidly, before they actually detach from those muscle-producing cells, they get into this leader-trailer configuration before the protrusion in the leader is significant. So, how could that happen? We hypothesize that it We hypothesize that it could be due to differential adhesion of those two cells. Again, the hint is from some experimental data that I'm not showing here. So what we did, we simulated two cells. One of this red cell has weaker adhesion to the substrate, to the ectoderm. And another blue or pink one, sorry, I'm Daltonic. Sorry, I'm Deltunik, has stronger adhesion. And the result is always that stronger adhesive cell gets to the front. Physical explanation is probably that it's very important for effective protrusion to adhere firmly at the front, right? That doesn't allow the cell to pull back from microscopic protrusions. And for retraction, of course, weak adhesion is perfect, right? Is perfect, right? You can pull the tail like that better. So it's qualitatively very clear why this is happening. So experiment interestingly shows the following. When we, again, using some very fancy genetic manipulation, are able to make one of the cells inherit a construct which weakens its adhesion to the surface. To the surface. This is control, and these are two of those inhibitors. Then, with higher probability, the cell with weaker adhesion becomes the trailer. So the model is able to make those two intuitively clear and very nice prediction. And the last thing I wanted to show you is not really. Really testing the predictive power, but this illustrates how the model highlights the design principles behind this motility. So, I didn't mention yet why are we thinking that the cells are supracellular? So, jumping ahead, if we look at those two cells from the side, this is cherry-picked image. This is a cherry-picked image. It's super nice. Normally, the images are much messier, but even this cherry-picked image, it gives you the total sense that two cells integrate into one giant cell. The boundary between those two cells, what you see here, the signal is from the membrane. So it's really the surface of the cell. So this is the boundary, right? But it's kind of very It's kind of very suggestive from the shape that two cells becoming one giant cell, right? So far, I don't mean anything more profound in the supracellular idea. So we could compare how effective, how fast the movement is in a few cases. One, how fast is it for signals, single cell? Signals, single cell. Another, how fast is it when two cells are completely equivalent? We can equalize protrusion and retraction in both cells. And transiently, if they are placed back to back, they move in this leader arrangement. Then we can test how two same cells move side by side, all under the endoderm. And then we can do this. And then we can do this supracellular arrangement, which we actually simulate all the time. And so see what happens, for example, under stiff endoderm. The single cell, one cell, is rather slow. Why? Well, because it experiences all these significant deformations from the stiff endoderm around it, forces from these deformations. Two cells side by side are either. By side, or even worse. I'm not quite sure why two cells side by side are worse than a single cell, probably has to do with this common boundary between them. And maybe one can do some hand-waving arguments explaining that, but that's the fact. And then two cells back to back are better. Why? Well, intuitive explanation is that two cells pull together their Two cells pull together their resources in protrusion retraction, but they work roughly against the same deformation as the single cell. But the best result is from supracellular arrangement. And the reasoning could be that even if we have if we put two cells back to back, there's still this There's still this dimple between them. And so the endoderm kind of gets there and exerts partial resistance to the second cell. This is in a way like a sports car, like totally streamlined for locomotion. So that's where we are with this project. Oh, one last thing I think I wanted to show you. Think I wanted to show you is right there, but I already so it's a test of one of the things I showed in previous slide. We can observe the case when instead of two cells moving together, those are two cells left behind. We can introduce some perturbation, and one of the TVC cells is left behind, and another moves alone, and then it moves slower. Interestingly, it moves. And interestingly, it moves slower about 20-25% slower, moves alone. And that's pretty much what we see here, difference of about 25%. So that's not so bad for a super simple theory like that. So, in the second half of the talk, what I wanted to tell you was the The what else? We started off with different kinds of modeling. One reason is my slight dissatisfaction with all these assumptions about protrusive retractive forces we have to do, we have to put into the cellular pots model. It's kind of if we put those elaborate forces in, why do we even have, why do we need cellular pots model, right? Cellular Potts model, right? The whole point of Cellular Potts model initially I thought would be not to have elaborate protrusion retraction forces. Second, of course, is, well, those elaborate forces mean some structures, cytoskeletal structures inside. What attracted me initially to the cellular pots model, that the model is all the model of the 2D surface of 3D cells, right? Of 3D cells, right? That's why it computes so fast in 3D, because we are not doing anything non-trivial in the bulk of the cells. But turns out the cytoskeletal forces imply that something in the bulk. So we wanted to take a step back and also connect to experiment more. And so I already showed you the striking micrograph of two cells from the side. We decided to see. side we decided to see what we can do if we start analyzing the shape in 2d we just want to examine the vertical cross-section of those two cells not the view from above the view from the side which of course makes it a crude caricature but still let's see what can be learned from it so uh what's the uh physical idea now there are um very small number of papers uh which use Of papers which use the so-called contact angle physics to try to understand movement of the cell. One of those papers was published seven years ago by Verkovsky's group, who applied it to keratocyte. I honestly think that keratocytes have nothing to do with contact angle, but never mind, the idea is excellent. Is excellent. So the idea is this. Let's look closely at the front, or actually, the same idea applies to the rear of the cell. And imagine that the cell, imagine for a second, that the cell is droplet of water on the solid surface. Then the physics is very clear. Physics comes from the so-called Young-Dupre laws. And those laws are simply And those laws are simply saying that we have to balance all the forces at this point. What does angle have to do with it? Well, first of all, what are the forces? The forces commonly used in physics is the surface tension pulling the water droplet toward the solid, surface tension pulling the water back. The water back. So you can think in energy terms, it's respective energy of wetting and de wetting. But for biological reasons, for us, the best thing to think about it is the following. What is called here gamma MS is the effective force from adhesive complexes at the front. So adhesion is beneficial energetically. So the cell wants to protect. So, the cell wants to protrude and lay down. Interestingly, you don't need the special force to move the cell forward for it. Just some ratchet and the adhesive lowering of free energy is enough, right? So, make the front of the cell adhesive, and the cell will crawl forward. This force is like de-adhesion. We can forget about it for now, but there's also. It for now. But there's also, of course, active force possible, which is there's an actin network growing and pushing the front forward. So there's this combination of two forces, active, actin pushing, and also active, but in another way, adhesiveness, which also tries to make protrusion. What is against it? Against it is the surface tension of the dorsal surface, presumably. Surface presumably created either by in-plane fluid tension of the membrane, or for cells more normal than keratocyte, this is actinizing contraction of the cortex at the top of the cell. And so where angle comes in, well, originally those forces are not exactly equal to gamma, and so the angle here adjusts so that that surface tension. Surface tension times or rather cortex tension times cosine of this angle equalizes this force. That's all the whole math here. So the mental image we have in mind is what is well known in physical and mechanical engineering community. Put the water droplets down and create a gradient of Of the adhesiveness or of the wetting potential of the surface, the droplet will start moving forward. There were lots of experiments with it made by physicists and engineers, and those droplets actually strikingly looks like ourselves. Strikingly. One shouldn't read too much into it, but maybe there's something there. And there's, of course, some efforts by in By in the biophysical and soft matter community to explore this notion, I'm, for example, a big fan of this recent paper, which considers three possible ways cells can move. And one of them is what they call capillary gradient of capillarity, which is the same thing. If the contact angle at the front is kept different than control. kept different than control contact angle at the rear the cell starts moving okay so uh the model we have in mind now is uh i i prefer to call it not the contact angle which is rather dry in ocean but double bubble right and all we use is young dupre and laplace law uh laplace law of course says that uh pressure in hydrostatic pressure inside the cell is uh 10 Cell is tension divided by the radius of the surface. So we have four special points here: front of the leader, rear of the trailer, bottom at the cell-cell boundary, and top of the cell-cell boundary. At each of those places, there are some forces, and Young Dupre says that all these forces have to be perfectly balanced. For now, I will not be talking about what Not be talking about what are these different color arrows. Rather, I want to do the following. So, all of these forces. So, let's say, let's examine three of them for now. Tension of the cortex of the leader, tension of the trailer, and tension of the cell-cell boundary. If there's no additional force like this gray vector, three vectors of tension should be equal to zero. Now, if we normally Now, if we normalize the tension of the leader to one, we can't measure these forces yet, so we can just say that one of them is the scale of the force. Then, because in 2D, these are two scalar equations, we can find tension of the trailer and tension of the cell-cell boundary if we know the angles, all the angles. But we know the angles, right? So, what we do, we take this image, right? This image, right? And we did it for close to 20 minutes, like that, and measure those two angles. After we measure those two angles, we can find tension of the trailer 1.07. So it's 7% higher than the tension of the leader. So the rear is more tense. But the tension of the cell-cell boundary is 0.2. So it's very weak. So the tension here is weak. Tension here is weak. Okay, and then we can, of course, measure the radii of the curvature of the cortices, right? And we can, using Laplace law, find the pressures in trailer and leader. And note the remarkable thing, tension is predicted to be higher in the trailer. Okay, that's why the cell-cell boundary always looks like that in the image. Always looks like that in the images. So the pressure here is higher. Note that this is a sanity check because we did not assume anything about those pressures. We just used two angles to measure the tensions, measure two radii, and then we can compute the pressures. Discinnity check extends even further because we can compute now the radius of the boundary between the cells by dividing. Between the cells by dividing the computed tension of the boundary by the differential pressure between the trailer of the leader. And so predicted radius is 0.9, measured as 0.72. It's actually pretty remarkable for this extremely crude idea. Okay, so we think we are on the right track here. Now we want to understand: so, what's happening at the bottom here? Well, Well, what is happening at the bottom? Well, we have this effective force pushing the front forward. I call it F-leader. Again, it may not be active pushing, it may be just high adhesivity. We have effective force pulling the rear backward, and we assume that when the When the cell moves, the dragging of those three points on the surface is exerting viscous drag, and viscous drag coefficients are the same at front, middle, and rear, which is most definitely not true. But this is the simplest mathematical idea. Now, if this is true, then we can compute the viscous drag because we know the tension of the boundary and we know Of the boundary, and we know this angle. And here's the viscous drag, which is an order of magnitude smaller than tensions of the cortices. And then, from knowing tensions of the cortices and all the angles, and now we know viscous drag, we can compute what is the effective force pushing forward the front and pushing or pulling the rear. Turns out, force pushing the front is. Force pushing the front is indeed to the right, so it tries to make the leader move to move to where it's going, and it's order of magnitude quicker again than tension of the cortex. And interestingly, the force at the rear is negative, meaning that it's actually trying to retract the rear, right? Most likely, the adhesions here are weakened and they are moving this way, okay? So, Okay, so all this makes us think we are kind of on the right track. We are exploring, yeah, of course. What I didn't say, this is kind of reverse engineering. Now we can, instead of what we are doing here, we can start with assigning the tensions in these three cortices and then just solving trigonometric equations and Trigonometric equations and Laplace law and Yang Dupre equations, and then for small force pushing the front forward, we get this shape which is reasonably resembles the image I showed. If we increase, for example, the adhesivity at the front, that's the interesting deformation of the cells we can see. So we are exploring it, but I wanted to finish with one interesting One interesting question for which I have no answer. I'm just pondering it for now very hard. Actual numbers are definitely going to change, so don't take all these numbers literally. But what we see so far in all this analysis, a very interesting thing, that tension in the leader and the trailer in Bursal surfaces. Surfaces is relatively similar, and this is the highest force those cells are exerting. Tension in the cell-cell boundary is much less. What does it tell us? Well, maybe this is the trivial thing about this multi-about supracelularity. You want to make one giant cell out of two cells. Well, don't do anything with its boundary, right? Make it relax. And then they just And then they just merge into a double bubble, will merge into single bubble. But interestingly, the ventral forces are even smaller than this relatively relaxed cell-cell boundary. And that we were thinking about what does it mean? Well, my favorite idea is that this high tension here is needed to keep those cells. Is needed to keep those cells kind of the hemispherical dome. Because, not to forget the nucleus inside and other organelles, those cells have to maintain the shape to protect the organelles from the pressure of the endoderm. And movement, yeah, well, there's movement. Maybe we don't need much forces for the movement. Note also that if those forces were comparable to those forces, fluctuations. Forces, fluctuations of the ventral forces would lead to like big deformations of the cell, big deformations of everything. While small forces here, kind of fluctuation of those forces would leave the shape intact. Maybe this is it, but or maybe these are kind of anthropomorphic musings. So that's what I wanted to end up with. That's where we are. End up with. That's where we are at the moment. So here are people who did all that. The modeling is done by my former postdoc, Haisen Yu, who is now a postdoc in, she's doing a second postdoc in Georgia Tech. Also by former postdoc, Kalina Koppas, who's just starting her tenure track position at Northeastern. And the experiment is done largely by Jelena Bernatska. Largely by Jelena Bernatska, who is a biologist here at NYU. And her lab is joined with Lionel Christian, who was also at NYU, and now he's director of Institute of Marine Biology at University of Bergen in Norway. Thank you very much, and I am open for questions. Let me see there's something in the chat. Yeah, thank you very much, Alex. Yeah, thank you very much, Alex. I invite questions, please use the chat, or maybe if you just want to talk, that would be fine as well. I'm totally fine. Can you hear me? Yeah, there you are. Yes. Okay. So in your last analysis, Alex, it wasn't clear to me where the active forces that the cell is exerting actually come into play. I mean, you're looking. Come into play. I mean, you're looking at the static shape and calling these the tensions, etc., etc. But where do the active forces that the cell is exerting on the substrate come into play? Right, right, right. So very good question. I forgot to mention that, of course, those snapshot of the cells and those two cells, we well, in the experiment, we see that cells glide. Glide forward with constant velocity. So we are not really working with static shape, we're working with the cell which is moving without changing shape with certain velocity. And so the active forces, that's what I was trying to say. So this analysis, unfortunately, doesn't tell you what is the origin, biological, physical origin of those forces. But the active forces are F L and F T. So those are active forces. So F L could be the acting pushing at the ventral surface forward, or it could be the strong adhesions that are forming here. And then you don't need the actual force. At the rear, it's most likely this de-adhesion, the fact that adhesions here are weak, so energetically, it's favorable to return. So, energetically, it's favorable to retract this point. So, basically, you're extracting the forces on this model, you know, under the assumption that the active forces are generating these tensions, etc. Correct, correct. And so, of course, in the cortices, the tensions are generated by myosin that we already have data for. A second question is: is it under Second question is: Is it understood why these two cells migrate together and what their final goal is? That is an excellent question. Not very well. So the only hint comes from this perturbation when we decouple the cells and they move separately. Then there are two problems. One, they don't arrive to this sweet spot, they have to be at the end. Why they have to arrive there? Why they have to arrive there again not clear, though simple developmental biology experiments show that if they do and don't, there are heart defects for the animal that grows. But so what we do see is that individual cell have almost the same potential to move, but have much harder time finding the right spot and arriving to the same spot. So the simple argument could be that they move together simply. That they move together simply so that they arrive together. And also, we are starting to think that you know, there's one very interesting thing about chemotaxis, which is very intensely modeled. So, when one cell undergoes chemataxis, which is pretty noisy, its trajectory meanders, it makes lots of little turns. What we see in two cells moving together, the trajectory is much more straight. The trajectory is much more straight. And the mechanical analogy here is: imagine you are an unexperienced skier going down the mountain and meandering. Now put the heavy load behind you. You'll go slower, but much more straight, because this heavy load kind of averages out of all your meandering. So we are thinking that maybe the trailer is this heavy load there. So that's where we are. We don't from my answers, we you probably can see that we don't understand it, but it's clearly a super important thing. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, we have a question here from Paul. Paul, do you want to ask your question? Conclude a guiding principle of end cells. Right, right, right, right, right. Excellent. It's almost a staged question. So, what I didn't show you is Is another thing that we are trying to start to explore. So, Jelena recently managed to find some genetic perturbation, which makes these two pairs of cells, which migrate separately, first get together and then move in a train of four cells. And remarkably, four cells move in a single file, leader, then trailer, trailer, trailer. Trailer. While obviously the simulation with cellular puts model without changing parameters does what you could guess. Four cells kind of get into the state clusters, like left leader, right leader, left, right, and move very clumsily in these clusters. So there's obviously some design principle here. Cells want to move in a single line. Why we don't know. Why we don't know, and what do they do to get there? We don't know, yeah. Yeah, thank you, Alex. And then, I mean, these four cells, again, the last thing, from the shape of the intercell boundaries, pressure is the lowest in the leader, higher in the second one, higher, in the third one, highest in the very trailer. Again, why? We don't know. We don't know. Yeah, Alex, there was another question from Paul Colisa. Maybe you can just read it. Yeah, very nice talk. You mentioned the pressure of the endoderm and at the trailer cell trailing edge, the endoderm has to reconnect with the ectoderm. How much does this influence contraction of the trailer cell? Yeah, Paul, this is a great question, and we just blatantly disregard this. So, this actually makes us nervous because obviously, one of the things that has to happen, endoderm has some weak adhesion to the ectoderm, and moving cells have to get in between them. So, obviously, it requires some forces there. And at the rear, endoderm has to reconnect to ectoderm, which we see, but it's not in the model. We see, but it's not in the model. We will introduce it in some later installment of the model. For now, we're thinking that we have enough complexity without that. But maybe this is something important. Excellent. Thanks again. So are there any other questions? If not, then I thank you again, Alex, for a very interesting talk. And we have about four minutes before. About four minutes before.
