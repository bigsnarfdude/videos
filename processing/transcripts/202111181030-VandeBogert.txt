Thank you very much for the introduction and of course thank you to the organizers for the invitation. So I wanted to start this talk before I go completely off the deep end with community development book, I wanted to start the talk with some motivation that comes from ideas that many of you in the audience will care more about. And so the motivation comes from these objects called moment angle complexes. Complexes. And now I should preface this by saying I'm not an expert on lament angle complexes, really. So if you ask for more difficult questions related to this construction, I will likely not be able to answer it on the spot, but I at least wanted to give a connection to the material that will be kind of the bread and butter of this talk. But this starts with actually pork varieties. The story, let's set up some of the Let's set up some notation. So, P is going to be a simple n-dimensional polytope. Remember that the simple part just means that each vertex is the intersection of n facets. And then also assume that there are n facets. And so, many of you are probably familiar with a common way of finding a fan is to Finding a fan is to take a polytope as so and look at the normal fan of the associated polytope. So, kind of the standard one is for P2. I draw this polytope, assume these side lengths are equal. This is indeed a two-dimensional simple polytope. There are three facets corresponding to the edges. If I take the normal fan, or if I take the inward planting normals, then this induces the following fan. Following fan, right, which is, if you are familiar with this kind of thing, this is exactly the fan for P2. But from a more topological perspective, topologists are very interesting and another interested in another construction related to this polytope. And so what you can do is you can form, if you can take a dual polytope, which basically just reverses the order of everything, your facets become your vertices, and containment becomes inclusion. Containment becomes inclusion. So in this case, it's basically self-dual, by the way. But there's a simplicial complex associated to this polytope, to the dual polytope, and so I'll give this a name. So this is a simplicial complex of the dual polytope. I'm sorry, did you say the triangle is cellular? Uh yes, the value of three new edges and the containment. Basically, if you want to look at the postet associated to the simplicial complex, you're taking the dual postet, and this postet is sort of dual in this case. Does that answer the question? There is no integer structure, right? Integer structure? There is no latest like historical writers in your picture. No integer lattice in this plane. Oh, yeah, yeah, yes. No, I haven't put this into a lattice. That's correct. Oh, yeah. Oh, okay, see. Yeah. Okay. So this is the simplestial complex of the dual polytope for P. That's what this notation is. And then you can form what is called the moment angle complex in the following way. So we're going to view. Way. So we're going to view S1 as living inside of D2, living inside of C. This is the unit disc, and this is the unit circle, closed unit disc. And then what you can do is you can form what's, this is an example of what's called a polyhedral product in general. And it's kind of like the, if you're familiar with Stanley-Reisner theory, it's very similar. Stanley-Reisnite theory, it's very similar, but it's like a Stanley-Reisner ideal on the level of spaces. It's an interesting construction. And so to introduce this, I have to introduce just a little bit of notation. So I'll let Mi sigma, where sigma is going to live in Kp. This is going to be defined basically case-wise, as it's going to be S1 if I is in sigma, and it's going to be D2. in sigma and it's going to be d2 if i is not in sigma. Alright and then I will use the notation d sigma to denote a tuple so m1 sigma, m2 sigma, dot dot dot, all the way up to m capital M lowercase m sigma, where m is the number of factors. Where m is the number of facets. And so, if you want to think about this, is why I said this is kind of like a Stanley-Reisner thing. This is, in some sense, it looks exactly like a generator for a Stanley-Reisner idea. It's basically saying you look at a certain slot, you say, okay, is it in this face? Yes, okay, then it's just going to be S1. If it's not in there, then it's going to be all of D2. Then the actual moment angle complex is the unit. Complex is the union over all sigmas of these d sigmas. So it's associated to the polytope as the union overall sigma. In case of P, I'll give you the notation of these D sigmas. Alright? And so I guess I should write this. And so, I guess I should write who this was introduced by. So, this was introduced actually in the context of trying to study cohomology of torque varieties by Davis and Janiskievic. I will try to. It's a long name. I think that's Janiskievich, something like that. Introduced originally by them. And so the interesting connection with these and Gollidness is kind of the following result. Is this a complex? Is this a complex? Does it have a differential? So it has a simplicial decomposition. Yeah. Kind of by construction. Yeah, yeah. And so actually the cohomology we're going to talk about, basically the integral collomology of this thing is identical to Is identical to, well, it's literally isomorphic as algebra's. Let me state the result basically. But yeah. And so yeah, if you're a topologist, then you ask, you say, well, by construction, this has a simplicial decomposition because it's indexed by the simplicial complex. And so you would say, I want to look at the cohomology algebra associated to this. And we have the following theorem. So So, this is why I had notes for names because that's the concept of names and then also this was introduced by friends in 2006. And it's basically the following fact that. And it's basically the following fact that if you want to look at the cohomology algebra of the moment-angle complex, so again, this is an algebra with the cut product, if you know what that is. It's not too important if you don't, because I'm going to translate this into something that is easier to understand. This is isomorphic as algebra to a purely commutative algebraic object. Commutative algebraic object, something that I'm very comfortable dealing with. This is isomorphic to the Tor algebra over Z. Basically, I adjoin enough variables as there are facets in the polytope. And I'm looking at the Tor algebra of the associated Stanley-Reisner ring, so k sub P against P. Alright. So this is the proof of this is. This is the proof of this. Is well, I don't know it basically off the top of my head. However, I do know, as I said, I really know how to deal with this object. These are things that, from a commutative algebra perspective, have a very long history and are very well understood. And then one of the other things that you might be interested in if you're a topologist are the existence of higher order massey products. And so one possible question is, I'm not going to define massive products, I don't need to. I'll tell you what it means when they're all trivial later when we talk about Golgeness. However, one question as a topologist is, when does this colomology algebra No non-trivial higher order mass of products. And the answer turns out, because of this isomorphism, asking that this cohomology algebra has no high-order massey products is identical to saying that the standard To saying that the Stanley-Reisner ring is what's called a Gaulet ring. Alright, and so answer. This is. So maybe I didn't. I said this out on called put an arrow. This is the Stanley Reisner ring. Really? All right. And so this is our. We have been messing around in topology and we have suddenly stumbled onto something that is very well studied in commutative algebra. But I also want to convince you that even though it has a really long history, Gollard rings are very mysterious still, and there are a lot of open questions about them that it seems like they should be. It seems like they should be easy to answer, but no one has any clue how to answer them. Alright, so are there any questions before I get on to the. Could you define what the gold ring is? I'm going to. I'm going to. You can basically take it as this if it's known non-trivial higher order massive products. Right, but you need to tell me what is this an algebra over. You took the, I mean, for an abstract ring. It's an algebra over Z. No, no, no. You were taking the torr over some. The torr over some polynomial ring. Yeah. But it inherits the Z algebra structure as well, because I'm taking tor over Z. But if I wanted to make a definition generalizing what you wrote, I would say something like a ring A is a goload ring if the Tor algebra over something of A into Z is formal, has normal hierarchy. Formal as normal higher massive product. What is over that ring? What is that ring that? This one, right here? This is just a polynomial ring with... Right, no, but for an arbitrary ring, if I want to say it's a gold ring. Maybe you're going to tell us. Well, yeah, the one issue is you almost always want it to be, if you want to refer to it in terms of ideals, you assume that the ambient ring is such that either the homogeneous maximum ideal. That either the homogeneous maximal ideal, or if you're in a local case, is a complete intersection. So you want the ambient ring to essentially be regular. Other questions? Alright, so I'll start the definition. So, I'll start the definition with a trivial massey operation. Well, actually, let me start with notation. So, I'm going to temporarily assume I'm in a polynomial ring over a field. However, it all goes through the same if you're over Z. I'm just going to use a field for simplicity. So, assume that R is now the following. And then I'm going to build like K be the Kazul complex on the generator. On the generators x1 up to xn. And so the definition I'm about to give is a specialized version of the more general definition for a trivial massey operation. But again, I only really want it for this context. So I'm going to take an ideal sitting inside a bar. Then, by the way, the Kazoole complex is essentially the exterior algebra, just with an added differential. With an added differential. It is definitely a DG algebra. This is a standard exercise, so if you want to try it, you can try it. So that means that when I tensor with, say, R mod I, it's still a DG algebra. That's just the homology has changed. So I will say that if I tensor over R mod I, this admits a trivial Messi operation. If we have the following, so first you need to enumerate the basis for the homology algebra of this. So V is. I'll index them by some indexing set lambda. So for H of And so I need this piece of data, and then the second piece of data is the actual massey operation. So there's a function. So I'll denote it mu, which goes from basically an infinite product. So when I put b to the i, this may So when I put b to the i, this means the Cartesian product of these things. So I'll write that up here. All right, and it has to satisfy two things. The first thing is basically saying that when i is equal to one, you're basically choosing lifts for this basis of the Kazool homology algebra back up to just this Kazool algebra. I'll call it the Kazool algebra, even though it has another name. That's another meaning. So that's the first condition. Let me write this down. So I guess satisfying. So one, as I said, if I just input a single element, then this output's an element such that the class of this element. Such that the class of this element back in the, so I'll say the homology class is equal to the thing that I started with. Alright, so again, I'm choosing lifts of this basis. And then B is this decomposability condition, which, if you know the definition of a higher order massey product, you'll recognize this as basically saying that zero has to live in the second. So we have the following. So we have the following. For so if you do d of mu, so d is the differential of the Kazoo complex. So if I do d mu of h lambda 1 up to h lambda p, then this breaks up in a sum of lower order mu functions. So this can be rewritten as So, this can be rewritten as the sum, well, p minus one h lambda p. And I'm going to put a bar on this, and then I'm going to put a small aside. If I plug a bar, this means do negative 1 to the degree of that element plus 1 times that element. Alright, just for helping out with the notation. Alright. Okay, so... Can I ask something? Sure. Is the absence of non-trivial massive products or operations, is it equivalent to the DG algebra being formal? You said, so formal means. You said so, formal means there are no higher-order massey products, so no non-trivial ones? No, no, no. For me, formal means it's quasi-isomorphic as DG algebras to its homology. As DG algebras. So K cancer rh mod i is a DG algebra. The homology is also a DG algebra with trivial differential. Are those two DG algebras quasi-isomorphic? Algebras quasi-isomorphic. SDG algebras. There's a notion of homotopy equivalence or quasi-isomorphism in the category of DG algebras. Are they the same? I don't know. Is that a sufficient answer? In another way to say it is there is a homological perturbation lemma that allows you to turn a DD algebra into an A infinity algebra. Can you get that A infinity algebra to have no higher products, have all The rather have no higher products, have only M2? No, I don't think so. I don't think, I'm still going to say I'm not sure off the top of my head how. They are the same. They are the same. They are. It's not the. It's generally not quasi isomorphic to its homology in that way. Even if it's... I mean, they're they're generally it's generally not quasi isomorphic to its homology. Quasi isomorphic to its homology for Andre's question. That was his question. Is that Daniel? Thanks, Daniel. Okay, we can find this all. All right. Other questions? Okey-doke. So, as you may have suspected, the reason I introduced this is because I'm going to define an ideal to be God if this associated Kazul algebra, if the associated homology algebra. The associated homology algebra has a trivial massey operation. Right, so I will erase this. So math overflow says nothing. What? Math overflow says nothing. Math overflow says what no? It says that if there are non-formal things, Here's a nice little bit of the modelized basic curve that we can see it was 6.0. Can you send me a link? So this leads us to the definition of gollen. An ideal, I will call an ideal golem. This is technically the standard abusive notation. I really should say R mod I is gollen, but it doesn't matter. So the Kazool hom, if the Kazool homology alphabet, Well, if the Kazoole homology algebra admits a trivial massey operation, then that's what it means to be called. And so I'll give a few examples, and also I want, as I had alluded to already, that there are some open questions related to this that are strikingly simple to state, but somehow amazingly difficult to But somehow amazingly difficult to actually solve. So, I guess I should give some examples of non-gullic things. If you look at the definition of a trivial massive operation that you just set p equal to 2, this tells you basically that all products, just standard products in the Kazoolet homology algebra, have to be trivial. And so, if you can enumerate examples for which that is not true, these are definitely not goggles. not true these are definitely not gallant. Alright so some non-examples would be complete intersection ideals, so ideals generated by a regular sequence. This is just because if you're a complete intersection then this associated Kazooletomology algebra is just the exterior algebra, which has all, basically all the things are non-trivial multiplications. So complete intersections and more generally I can say Gordon Steiner deals also. It's fairly well known. It's fairly well known in commutative algebra that if you're a Gorenstein, then you can choose a resolution for which the homology algebra is what's called a Poincaré duality algebra, and these things are definitely not trivial. More generally, Gorenstein ideals are not colorful. A pattern that is recurring in the literature, though, is that it seems, it is often the case that when you take powers of ideals, these things Take powers of ideals, these things always have to be called. Powers that aren't just the first power. So, some known results. So, the first one is really nice. So, let I be a proper ideal. I guess I don't really need that assumption, but and assume that the characteristic of the field is zero. Of the field as zero, then it is known that not only i to the n and also any higher symbolic power, so this notation is symbolic power are god for all and at least two. So this is a result due to Herzog and Heunkey, which is fairly recent. Hume cube, which is fairly recent, so from 2013. And so, if you don't like this characteristic k equals zero assumption, it can be removed. It's just that you have to assume that this is a monomial ideal of L. All right. So, monomial ideal. Then Well, and at least two. This also has Herzog on it, but a different second author. So this is Herzog in the Mano Key from whenever, 2017. All right. So these are two examples that I've been particularly interested in. There are definitely more results than this. Related to this is a question that was originally posed. A question that was originally posed by Velker, so I can write that. And it basically says: if you have two proper ideals and you take their product, then is it God? Alright, and so in general, the answer to this question is actually no. So the first counterexample was given by Testefani. So maybe, how much time do I have? Pretty good. Okay, I'll go off on a small tangent on this. So this counterexample is strikingly simple, and the reason for it is because no one was Reason for it is because no one was looking for a counterexample because there was a paper from the mid-2000s that had proved this statement is true for monomial ideals. And so I think that just no one was looking for a counterexample, so this is why it took so long to find it. So this is you justify from 2016. And okay, I guess I'll mention I also gave that was one counterexample and then I gave infinitely many counterexamples recently. Count examples recently. Anyway, however, the interesting thing, what I was alluding to as well, is if you assume you're only in a polynomial ring with three variables, this question is still open. No one has a counterexample, and no one knows how to prove it. So somehow, having fewer variables makes it harder to prove. Or more difficult to tackle. Oh. However, still open if i and j are contained just in three variables. Although if they're monomial ideals, this is not. The answer is actually yes. There is no counterexample because it's just true in three variables. And this is by Dow and Destafon. I think 2019 sums it up right. So, what do I want you to do? So, what do I want you to take from this? Well, one of the things that you might notice as a pattern is that gulledness results are either stronger if you assume that it's a monomial ideal. This is for arbitrary ideals, and I had to assume the characteristic was zero. However, this one is totally independent of characteristic. And then also, this question is still open for arbitrary ideals. However, it is possible to solve it for minor ideals. And actually, this is a running theme. If you want to prove a Galenus result, it's much Want to prove a Galdness result, it's much easier to deal with monomial ideals. You just have access to much more structure. And so the question is: can you take advantage of this? So I'll say the pattern. Goldenness results are easier for the NOVIN ideals, unsurprisingly. And the question And the question is: how can we take advantage of this? Use results for monomial ideals ideals to deduce information about arbitrary ideals. Okay. So at least a partial potential approach to this is to use Grogner degeneration. And so I will give a small introduction to Grogner degeneration, but it is essentially, if you are more geometric, it is the fact that you can, for a given term order on a polynomial ring, you can deform it. Polynomial ring, you can deform an arbitrary ideal into its initial ideal in such a way that it's a flat family. So let's talk a little bit about this. Dang it. Okay, sorry, I walked was a buzzing edge. So I'll give it, you know, I'll give the definition of an I'll give the definition of an initial ideal just in case. But yeah, so I'll let less than denote just an arbitrary term over on the polynomial ring. And then the initial ideal, probably you've all seen this, but I just wanted to give the definition so we're all on the same page. So the initial ideal is denoted in I. I'm not going to bother putting the term. I'm not going to bother putting the term order right there. It's not important. But this is defined to be: you take all the initial terms of the elements in this ideal. Initial terms just means take the lead term with respect to this term order, such that f is in the ideal. Alright. Then the theorem slash definition, and really I don't know how t who to attribute this to. Who to attribute this to, the fact that these things exist? It's kind of like a folklore result in computative algebra. But it's basically the following fact. So, given a term order, there exists so I can find the same thing. So I can find a flat kt module, which I'll call m, but this is basically the quotient where I've taken my original ring, I have joined a new variable t, and I'm going to mod out by what I'll denote i to the h. This means I've homogenized this ideal with respect to this new variable, such that the two interesting things are the following. I can say at least what the fiber looks like over two points. Fiber looks like over two points. And they're the things we want. So if I tensor this module over k with k of t1 t, so in other words, set t equal to 0, same thing, then this gives me the initial ideal, or the quotient by the initial ideal. And two, if I set t equal to 1, it gives me the ideal that I started with. Okay. So again, if you're more geometrically oriented, this is a flat family where the fiber over 0 is the quotient by the initial ideal, and the fiber over 1 is the quotient by the original ideal. Alright? And so the question. And so the question that I had was: when can I use galledness of this and deform it to this and have the same results hold? And the answer is not always. However, I'll give a condition that I will show actually will get the job done for us. And the definition that we need is something that I call finer invariant Tibeti numbers. Invariant to Betty numbers. So with res I should say that this definition is implicitly with respect to some term order, but I'm going to not write it explicitly. If the following is true. If the following is true, basically that beta ij, so beta ij is the graded Betty number, beta ij of i is equal to beta ij of the initial ideal of i for all i and j. I should say that just based on the fact that a Grobner degeneration exists, you always have an equality going that way. And so I'm now asking, I want equality to hold overall. Quality to hold overall. And so a definition is no good without any examples. But we do have examples, and actually I wanted to give kind of a general class of examples that'll get the job done that encompasses some already known cases. So assume I has linear resolution. So, Beth, if you're not familiar with this, this just means write down the minimal free resolution, all the differentials have linear entries. Then, if I can find a term order for which the initial ideal is a square-free monomial ideal, then I has fibrin variant vetted numbers. So I want to actually give the proof of this because it's strikingly straightforward. Although, okay, it's straightforward because it uses a really nice result. So it's kind of cheating. So the proof uses a very recent result. I don't know the year. Do you know the year of the Conca-Barbaro paper? I think it came out like last year, like in 2020. So it's a very recent result and it's very strong. But it basically says that if your initial ideal is a square free monomial ideal, then all the extremal homological data has to coincide with the original ideal. In particular, the regularity has to be the same. The regularity has to be the same. So, if I conca farm borough, the regularity of I is equal to the regularity of the initial ideal of I, just by this square freeness. However, that means that this also has linear resolution. All right? But if you are used to dealing with initial ideals, you might be aware of the fact that the Betty table of the initial ideal can always be, sorry, the Betty table of this ideal, the original, can always be obtained from the Betty table of this ideal by what are called consecutive cancellations. May be obtained. So I'll put in quotes consecutive cancellations. This result is due to a ring of paper from some year. So I'll put paper right there. Put Piva right there. And I'll give just a small idea of what a consecutive cancellation is. So, my toy example is: assume you have a Betty table with some entries like this. A consecutive cancellation means that you have subtracted a term from consecutive diagonal terms like this. But if you think about it, if both the original ideal and the initial ideal have linear resolution, Have linear resolution, no such cancellations are possible. Which means that they have to have the same bedding table. So the bedding numbers agree everywhere. Alright, so since the resolution is linear, no such cancellation can occur. Alright, so that's the proof. This also gives a corollary that was already A corollary that was already known. I should say this is due to Booker from 2012. His proof is different from this proof, but this proof implies this. That if you take an initial, sorry, if you take the ideal of maximal minors of a generic matrix, then these have fiber invariant bedding numbers for any possible term order. Generic has fiber and grant buddy numbers fiber and bearing. And so the reason this is true is due to an old result of Sternfelds and Zelovensky that basically says the standard generating set for maximal miners force was called a universal Grubner basis, and for free it's going to be square free. And so you just combine that vector with this result to get what you want. Okay, any questions? How am I in time? Good. So, why am I talking about Feynman variant Betty numbers? Well, again, the title of the talk kind of indicates why you can view these Grob number generations as deformations. And the question is: when can I transfer gulledness across this deformation? And the answer, at least one answer, is if you have fiber invariant vetting numbers, this is a true statement. This is a true statement. So I'll call this a theorem, but the proof is not that difficult. So if I then I is golly if and only if the initial ideal is golly. All right. So I guess what do I want to say about this? Well, let's do some applications. That's what I want to say about this. So, applications. So, I guess based on the abstract, I've given kind of the main application, but I at least wanted to give a little bit of history. To give a little bit of history for the ideals of maximal minors. If you are familiar with resolutions and minimal free resolutions in general, the ideal maximal minors is resolved by something called the Egan-Northcock complex. So this is minimally resolved. And so if you want to compute, if you want to deduce gulledness, one method of doing it is, in general it's very, very difficult, this is one of the problems, is to produce an explicit DG algebra structure on the minimal free resolution, tensor with the residue field, and then just descend to homology and look at the algebra structure there. This must coincide just by torb. This must coincide just by Tor balancing with the original algebra, with the algebra structure on the Kaguel on the algebra. There is one problem with this, is that you cannot always find an associative algebra structure. Associativity may fail for arbitrary linked complexes. However, I guess what I will say is that in characteristic zero, it is known that the Egan-Northcock concept. It is known that the Egan-Northcock complex, so I'll just say if, let me put in parentheses the N. Alright, and so this was proved by Strini Boston probably, I think, in 1989, potentially. But I do want to make one comment about this is it's a really nice algebra structure. It's very complicated, and the proof that it's actually associative and is a DG algebra is very difficult. Is very difficult. It's a very difficult computation. It's like at least 10 pages of just lines and lines of computations. And moreover, you're dividing by way too many things for this proof to ever go through in positive characteristic. However, you can use this once you have an associative algebra structure. If that algebra structure has all of its coefficients in the maximal ideal, then this does imply that the thing you're resolving is galled. That the thing you're resolving is galled. Alright? So this can be used. I bet I'll write again, there's no hope to extend it to positive characteristic. So, but the nice thing is, with the results that I've already given, we can actually give a very, very quick proof of this result that is completely independent of characteristic. And so, alright, as a theorem, so originally due to screening boss and characteristic zero and I will put myself, and then also this for the higher powers, this is Herzog and unique key from 2013. If the characteristic of If the characteristic of k is 0. Alright. And it is the fact that if i is the ideal of maximum minors of a generic matrix, then every power of pi is a gola wheel. For all. And at least one. So it doesn't even have to be at least two. Just at least one will get the job done. And so I want to say just a little bit about the proof. I guess I'll probably end early, actually. Any questions, by the way? For the proof. So one thing related to this is the initial ideal. So we're going to use Grobner degeneration and the fact that this ideal has fibromyalgiant many numbers. So golladness of this ideal is equivalent to golladness of the initial ideal, or any term order, actually. But you can just use a diagonal term order if you prefer. Diagonal term order, if you prefer. Then, so the initial ideal of I is an example of what's called a rainbow monomial ideal. Another version, another way to call these, I don't like the second name, is to call it a D-part-type de-uniform clutter. The facet ideal would be. The facet ideal would be deep type, be uniform clutter. And I guess I'll state this as a theorem. I have proved before that if you have a rainbow monomial ideal with linear resolution, then it has to be Gollard. And the proof of this fact is not too bad. It's basically the fact that you can embed a rainbow monomial ideal into something that we know is Gallid, and then you can prove that the maps on Tor are injective, and this will imply Gallidness. So, well, once you write this statement down, you just combine this with the statement that I had written before. This implies immediately That the initial ideal of pi is volume. So fiber invariance tells us that i is a colored. So it's a pretty short proof in the case that n is equal to 1. And then for the case that n is greater than or equal to i. Is greater than or equal to one? Then there's a result of Konka that basically says if you take powers of the initial ideal for maximal minors, it commutes with taking the initial ideal. This is something that is just not true in general, but maximal minors are, I don't know, with respect to Groeerner. I don't know, with respect to Grodner bases, maximum miners are about as well behaved as one could possibly be. So, a result of Conca. That if I take the initial ideal to the nth power, this is the same thing as taking the nth power of the initial ideal. If you choose a diagonal term order, you can show that this must have linear resolution. Must have linear resolution. And you run through the same proof and show that this implies that I to the N has fibrin variant ready numbers with respect to a diagonal term order. However, the nice thing is that the term is a very important thing However, the nice thing about this, so this means that galledness is equivalent for these two things. Galledness of the original ideal is equivalent to galledness of this power. However, I had stated a result that said that any power of anomaly ideal has to be galled. So essentially, I can transfer that result to this ideal, but galledness of this ideal is equivalent to galledness of the original power. And so, well, that's the proof. Well, that's that's the proof. So I guess I will say, recall powers of monomial ideals are Gallic regardless of characteristic. And so again, fiber invariance implies that the original idea is colonial. Okay. So I'm going So I'm not quite done. I just wanted to end with a few questions just kind of stated out loud. So this is the end of the main content of the talk, but just some questions related to this are, when is it true that this is a really interesting question to me, and I think it's probably too hard to answer in full generality, is the following. The following: Suppose you are handed an ideal with linear resolution. When does there exist a term order for which the initial ideal is square-free? This is a really interesting question because it automatically implies that with respect to that term order, the Betty numbers are fiber invariant. And so you can basically reduce the study of algebra structures on the homology of this ideal to just the algebra structures on the homology of this initial ideal, which is a much easier problem to deal with. And then the second question is to And the second question is to, probably more difficult but also more interesting, is to take a ring bulinomial ideal. I didn't really say exactly what these are, but these are ideals that are Alexander dual to deformations of interesting classes of ideals. But can you run through? There is going to be an associated simplicial complex, so for a rainbow. You can do the moment angle complex construction backwards and look at the resulting torque variant, basically. Backwards. So this yields some polytope. Who knows what it looks like? Take the normal thing. knows what it looks like. Take the normal fan of this polytor. What properties of the torque, basically are these torque brands special in any way? Take the normal fan and then ask about the drug variety. Anyway, those are the two questions I'll leave off with. So I'm done. Any questions for Keller? What's an example of the code that you get this week? Good question. Good question. I just thought of this question last night, so. No, I mean there are easy examples potentially that I cannot do off the top of my head, but you can just run a really small example, and the polytope shouldn't actually be that hard. For instance, I think you can get PN using rainbow and obviously articules. I'd have to check the details, but I'm pretty sure. It's not the same as formality? Maybe formality is not why. I still have never dealt with formality, so I'm not even comfortable with the concept. So what is formality again? So there is a concept of if you have a DG algebra, you can ask, if you have two of them, there is a concept of quasi-isomorphism of DG algebra. Of quasi-isomorphism of DG algebras. Yeah. So you can form roof diagrams for DG algebras. Two DG algebras are said to be quasi-isomorphic if there is a sequence of roof diagrams that connects them, which are all quasi-isomorphism. Okay? Just as DD algebras. Yeah. And the DD algebra is said to be formal if it's quasi-isomorphic as it Be if it's quasi-isomorphic as it is the algebra to its cohomology, to its homology algebra. Yeah. So I still have no insight into the. So that says that there is no higher homotopy information in the DG algebra than there is in the collomology. I read on Math Overflow, the one implication is if it is formal, all the higher massive products are zero, vanish. But the reverse implication. But the reverse the higher mass products do not contain all the information to be able to decide if it's formal or not. They have to be zero for it to be formal, but so it would be interesting to ask the question when are those rings formal or not. That I have no idea. I knew like somewhere in my mind I thought banishing massive products and enough. Sorry? I hadn't thought banishing massive products was enough. Apparently not. Apparently not. That was a nice example. All right, let's thank Hillary again. We're back at two local time.
