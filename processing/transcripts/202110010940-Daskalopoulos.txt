Toti Dascalopoulos with us, and if you are ready, Toti, we can start. So she will speak about the type 2 smoothing in mean curvature flow. Please. Yes. So thank you again for the invitation. And it's too bad we're not all there. We're not all there. But so, what I will talk today is about certain type 2 singularities and mean curvature flow and the continuation of the flow through these singularities. And whatever I will talk today is joint work with Sigurd Angenet and Natasa Sesson. So, every time I write a theorem, I'm not going to say that this is joint work because every This is joint work because everything is joint work. So, the crucial point in these type 2 singularities I will discuss today is that the mean curvature of the hypersurface remains bounded at the singularity. And I will discuss a little later the significance of this of the fact that age is bounded and how this is related with some problems. Related with some problems. And in the examples I will consider, the solutions will be O4, cross-O4 symmetric hypersurfaces embedded in R8 that are asymptotic to the Simon's cone at infinity, which I define later. But this can be generalized in any dimension above that. And the singularity And the singularity, besides singularity, it would be attained at the origin. So let's start from the beginning. Let's recall the mean curvature flow is the evolution of a hypersurface by its mean curvature. So if you have a hypersurface M sub T, a family of embedded of embeddings from a fixed manifold to M sub T, then the flow where The flow we're discussing is df/dt equals the mean curvature. And it's an old result by Huiskin, which you can easily see using the maximum principle, that finite time singularities always occur if the hyper magnesium hypersurface is compact, because eventually the compact hypersurface is going to extinct. Surface is going to extinct, therefore it has to be singular at some finite time. And so, in this talk, we will consider finite time singularities. So, this means that the singularity happens at some capital T less than infinity. And by singularity, we mean that the second fundamental form goes to infinity at the singularity. And of course, oh, something happened. Okay. Of course, this finite time singularity also happen in the complete non-compact setting. So both of them are considered for the purposes of this talk. Although eventually our setting will be non-compact. And from my point of view, because of Point of view because the compact setting has been discussed so much, the non-compact setting is also interesting. So, an old question in the field in mean curvature flow is the following, very simple question, is that does the mean curvature always blow up at the finite time singularity? Of course, the same question can be asked for infinite time singularity, but I don't really know if any Don't really know if anybody has addressed that because most of geometers even now care about the compact case. And as we said, the compact case always, the first time singularity would be a finite time singularity. But the question is, does the mean curvature blow up at a finite time singularity? And which I already wrote here. And equivalently, what does this mean? Because what What does this mean? Because what happens at the singularity is that the second fundamental form blows up. So, if equivalently, you may ask, does a bound on the mean curvature imply a bound on the second fundamental form? And of course, the interesting part here is the case where the mean curvature may change sign. Of course, the principal curvatures will change sign and lots of. Sign and lots of tricky things can happen at the singularity. Now, in the mean convex case, what is mean convex? H is non-negative, Huiskin showed a very nice quantity, the second fundamental form over the absolute value of H decreases in T. Therefore, H is never bounded at a simple ion, right? Because if H is bounded, If H is bounded, then right, then this is controlled, the denominator is controlled, therefore A over H decreases and he shows that H cannot be bounded by the simpler. Now the general case, in the general case, the answer of this problem is very hard. And actually in most of the cases, Actually, most of the cases are still unknown. Let me show you, let me tell you what is known. As we all know, singularities are either type 1 or type 2. And type 1 means that the singularity obeys the regular scaling of the equation, and type 2 is the unusual scale. So what was known, what was shown by Lin and Selsum, Lee Selsum, Lin and Selsum, Lee, Selsum, and Zhao, is that at the type 1, in type 1 singularities, the H is never bounded at the time where the second fundamental form blows up at the singularity. Therefore, in other words, the second fundamental, a bound on H implies a bound on the second fundamental 4. On the second fundamental truth. And they also have results, it follows from some of these works, they deal also with other special assumptions on the initial data, for example, some L1 bounds on the principal curvatures. But in the generality, the question remains for Remains for type 2 singularity. So, does the mean curvature always blow up at a finite time type 2 singularity? So, this is a well-known problem which I invite every, I tried to do, but a little bit, but we tried, but it's a hard problem. So, let me tell you what was known, a very nice, very recent result by Very recent result by Lien Wong, it was published in 2019, deals with compact surfaces in R3 and so 2D surfaces. And they showed that, again, the mean curvature always blows up at the first singular time. Now, what is the tricky question here? The tricky question here is what is Is what is going on if you scale? Um, if you assume that this is not true, what you are trying to prove, let's say that the mean curvature blows up at the first signal of time, is this means that there is a case where h is bounded, but the second fundamental form goes to infinity. What does this mean if you rescale around the singularity? Around the singularity at the scale of where mod A squared, the second fundamental form, blows up, then you end up with the minimal surfaces as a limit. So the question, right, and then you need to classify the possible limits, the possible minimal surfaces, and derive a contradiction. So this is what is going on. What is going on? And so, to deal with this problem, you at the beginning, I thought that maybe you can do some estimates on the flow, which will tell you that the second form can be bounded by in terms of age or not bounded. But it turns out, at least in my experience, that this is not only what you need. What you really need. Only what you need. What you really need is a combined methods from geometric flows, which will give you, of course, enough information about the limits, and then minimal surfaces theorem, maybe some geometric measure theory and checking. So the result of Leon Wand again follows this kind of ideas, and the general question is unknown. Unknown. So, what is unknown is the answer to the general question for dimensions between three and seven. Now, in similarity with the minimal surface theory, one expects that in higher D, there are types to singularities with bounded mean curvature. And this is what I would be discussing more today. Discussing more today, and especially we'll be discussing the continuation of the flow past the singularities. So let's now, so I will be discussing more higher dimension and will be discussing examples of type 2 singularities in higher dimensions where the result that, for example, holds. That, for example, holds in 2D and is expected to hold up to dimension seven, which means that H blows up at the singular time, doesn't hold here. So let us recall what is the Simon's cone. The Simon's cones is the 2n minus 1 dimensional hypersurface, which is the cone mod X equals mod Y. So it's very. modified so it's like it's um it's a hypersurface that has o1 cross o1 symmetry and has mean curvature to zero except at the origin where it has a singularity now there is a minimal surface which was discovered by alien carr in 1996 which somehow singularizes the simon's cone at the origin The Simon's cone at the origin. So it's a minimal surface, it's still a minimal, and it's smooth everywhere and it's asymptotic to the Simon's cognitive thing. And this minimum surface is, as we say, smooth and we will refer to it as the Allen Haart minimum surface. All right, so now let me show you, let me tell you now. Show you now this type of two singularities I will be discussing, which were first discovered, which were discovered first, of course, by Velasquez in 1994. So what the Velasquez again considered ON cross-o-wan symmetric hypersurface evolving by mean curvature flow. Evolving by mean curvature flow. They're embedded in R2N, the 2n minus one dimensional. And they have the following. So they are asymptotic to the Simon's cone at infinity. And near the singularity, so he constructed solutions of the mean curvature flow that they obtain, they have a singularity, the solutions are complete. The solutions are complete, non-compact. Again, asymptotically at infinity, they're asymptotic to the Seimon's cone. But if you look at what happens at the singularity, of course, the singularity ST approaches, let's say, capital T happens at the origin at the smaller and smaller scale. And so if you look at what So if you look at what happens at parabolic scales or at type 1 scales, at the regular scales, where y square root of t, then you see, you just see near the origin the Simon's call. But if you focus much closer to the singularity and you rescale at by at the scale where Where the second, the second function, at which the second fundamental form blows up at the origin, then you see the uncar minimal surface. Of course, if you go back and see what happens at the original scale, you see that you have a singularity. And the question has been whether the mean curvature remains bounded at this singularity or not. Singularity or not, right? Because at the and again, the problem here is to check whether the mean curvature remains bounded very close to the singularity. So you know that very close to the singularity, you go to a minimal surface, but you don't know that the mean curvature remains bounded a little bit before the singularity. And although, nevertheless, Velasquez had conjectured. Nevertheless, Velasquez had conjectured that this is true, but was never so. It was never shown. Actually, it's not easy to be shown. So this is somehow an analogy. I'm not saying that the examples are very different, but to the examples by Convier. I mean, again, it's to the theory, it's not to the examples themselves. The theory and the examples, the context, The context of the examples by Pompieri, the Giordi, and Giusti for minimal grounds. Right, so it took a while to be shown that in this Velasquez solution, actually AIDS, the mean curvature is bounded. And what Stolarsky and Stolarski, a young mathematician, found a very nice proof of this in 2020. Now the proof is not easy. Again, it's not hard using the asymptotics of Velasquez. Velasquez constructed the solution and gave pretty good asymptotics, formal asymptotic, not formal, actually proved them, mass asymptotics for the behavior of the singularity in the different regions. In the different regions. Now, you will see a little later because I'm going to continue these solutions in a bit, so we will have to know somehow the asymptotic. So, you will see the flavor of what Velasquez showed. Now, in terms of Stolarsky, again, the hardest part, what Stolarski did, he had, of course, to carefully bound the mean curvature in all regions. There are three regions in the map. Three regions in the mass asymptotics, as usually happens: the outer, the parabolic region, and the tip region. Now, the closer you go to the tip, the harder is to show that the mean curvature is bounded. And to do that, he combined, he refined the asymptotics of Velasky solution and he used some sophisticated blow-up arguments. So, again, it's not, you cannot. And it's not, you cannot be just shown by classic PDE method. You just need to like somehow a priori estimates, etc., using what you know to improve somehow the priori estimate. It's more by doing global argument and classifying the limits. All right. And so this is somehow the past results and what And what I will discuss from now on is continuing the Velasquez solutions past the singularity. And again, by continuing in a smooth way and in a way so that the mean curvature remains bounded for all t all the way up to t equal to zero. So for this purpose, I am assuming that we have this velocity. We have these Velasquez solutions which have a singularity at t equals zero because I want t equals zero to be my initial time at which I will continue. And I more or less taking initial data, which is a little bit more general than what Velasquez has in his formal asymptotics, but more or less, I would like to take an initial data which obeys the asymptotic. The asymptotics of the Velasquez singularities. And I'll tell you how this reflects on the initial data we are taking. And Velasquez had already suggested a formal way of doing that, and you will see later the formal asymptotics. Now, Now, so jointly with my collaborators, we provided the existence and the regularity of the Polaskis formal extension. We only did it in 4G, although for simplicity, we expect that without big differences, this can be generalized in hierarchy. So in other words, what it follows from my work, for our work, is that there is a solution which has a singularity at a certain time, but it's smooth before and after the singularity, and the mean curvature remains bounded at all times. So let's see what see what are what is the pde under this o4 crosso force symmetry so we will restrict to 80 seven dimensional surfaces in a four and with o4 crosso force symmetry all right and so take any profile function for describing this hypersurface so let's say m0 is our initial data M0 is our anisia data. And so the profile function, so this M0 is described completely by a function u0 from zero infinity to R. And we are assuming that near the origin, our initial data has this behavior where k, so it's x, x comes from the cone because eventually. comes from the cone because eventually like from the Simon's cone and so because closer but if when so X comes from the cone but the second the second order you will see where it comes from this but the second order term is k0 for some constant k0 x to the 2k minus 1 k0 is a k0 is a positive constant and this little k is an integer which is bigger than equal to four and i would like to remark that both k0 and k are parameters to the problem and these parameters come again from the construction of the singularities of of the Velasquez solution so all this comes from what are comes from what are the asymptotics of the Wolansky solution. So this and but this K0 and K can be changed as long as K is an integer bigger than equal to foreign K0. But for our purposes we fix those parameters and we are going to see how these parameters, especially this little k, will affect the scaling at the different regions, the blow-up of the second fundamental form, etc. Etc. Now we also make some other assumptions which are satisfied for the Velasquez singularities and they are just technical. Not the reason to bother you with those. And now we would like to discuss the solution of this initial value problem. So you, the PDE for you is just a simple PDE. Simple PD, the only problem is that, so it's there's no problem with the ellipticity constant because ux will remain bounded all the way up to t equals zero. The little problem comes, of course, from little u being zero near the singularity, therefore the equation becomes single. And now this is the Now, this is the initial data is u0, and because we would like to deal with smooth solution, the ux, the limit of ux as x approaches 0 would be 0. So the theorem we proved says that under those assumptions that I told you on the initial data, we construct, we show the existence of a solution. A solution to the mean curvature flow, which is smooth for time positive. Of course, at time zero, the second fundamental form blows up at the origin, but the mean curvature is finite. And this combined with the result of Stolarski and the Laskers shows, as I told you, the existence of the solution which exists before and after the singularity and H remains bound. And age remains bound. So, for the remaining of the talk, I'm going to show you the I will show you the look of this result. Now, Monica, you would tell me when it's time to stop because I don't see my watch in my. You have 10 minutes, but I will tell. Minutes, but I will tell you. I will tell you. I have 10 minutes. Okay, okay. So, um, so let me just show you now very fast the formal expansion of the solution, not very fast, whatever. The formal expansion of the solution. All right, so there are three regions. There are three regions. There is the region far away where you see the Simons, I mean, where you see more of the Simons cone. Then there is the parabolic region where X behaves like square root of T. And then you see the inner region at which you see the Alan Carr minimal surface. All right. And now, I don't want. I don't want to bother you with the outer region, for the outer region, like the formal asymptotics, come just from the fact that the solution u is u0 plus approximately the initial data plus tu sub t. And u sub t is at time t equals zero in terms of the initial data is just this. So these are the formal asymptotics in the outer region, which are not so important. Region, which are not so important because the outer region is not troublesome. Now, in the intermediate region, you do the parabolic scaling and you end up with this PDE for V. We're not going to reinfuse so much the PDE, but it's a well-known rescaled PDE. Now, what mostly we're going to do is the approximation of this PDE. So, if we would like, so eventually our construction. So, eventually, our construction is based on barriers. And so, we would like to somehow see how the perturbation from the Simon's hole behave. So, we set V to be Y plus F. F is the perturbation. And then it turns out that F sub tau behaves like L of F plus a quadratic nonlinear term in F. A non-linear term in F, which is supposedly to be an error term, where L of F is this linear PDE. And so this approximation, so assuming that more or less what the first, the next term in the asymptotic solves the linear equation, it turns out that the V of y tau is one. Y tau is y plus this term and where phi k are just eigenvalues and they are the right eigenvalues of this operator. So this so this is so the second order asymptotics just come from the from the From the operator L. And this was very similar also in the velocities asymptotics for the type 2 solution. Some signs change. All right. And now, so we are expecting that the solution in the intermediate region behaves like y and e to the k minus three halves tau phi k of y. Now e to the tau is t. e to the tau is t so this is like the same as t k to the three halves and check all right so given this now the phi k this um this eigenvalue has two different behaviors for y large and for y small for y large it behaves like y to the 2k minus 1 over some constant in k and this gives you the behavior This gives you the behavior and the scaling of the equation close to the to the for y large, which is close to the outer region. Now in the inner region for y small, phi k of y behaves like 1 over y squared. So then you obtain that v behaves like y plus k1 e to the 3 gamma tau over y. the 3 gamma tau over y squared. And now this where gamma, 3 gamma is this k minus 3 over 2. So gamma is this new, just notation, is just this new constant that comes. And why did I call this gamma? Because this constant gamma that again depends on the initial parameter k determines the scale at which you means the scale at which you see the Allen car minimal surface at the origin. So if you reach the inner region scaling by this e to the gamma tau, then the PD for the scale solution is this one, this one, and this exactly is what gives you equals to zero, gives you the Alan-Carr minimum surface. And car minimum cells. All right, so these are the expand, the total expansion. So then, what it follows, and I don't want to spend much time on that, is that these three regions follow, you have three regions, you have the outer region, you have the intermediate region, and then you have the inner region where you see the Allen Kai. All right, and in the outer region, you more or less, in the intermediate region, you more or less you see that the sign. And you see that the Simon's pole plus something else, which is a correction that is needed if you're going to prove something better in the inner region. And so our result has two parts. The first is the construction of the solution and the other part is to show that H is bounded. Of course, we need to construct the solution in such a way which makes showing Which makes showing His bounded easier. And so the proof uses the construction of very refined barriers. So we construct a sequence of barriers, upper and lower, which become more and more refined as you approach t equals zero. So you take a sequence of delta n goes to zero, you take a sequence of time that goes to zero, and you zero, and you construct these barriers. Now, and once you construct these very refined barriers, then you construct the solution. Now, the way you construct the solution is the solution U comes as an approximation of solutions U sub n, which solves some initial value problem starting at S n. Starting at Sn, at a very small time, a little bit above zero. You cannot start at zero because you have a singularity. And so the reason we need this to go through this approximation procedure is because we need to choose our initial data U of Sn, which I write here, here. You need to construct the solutions Un. Construct the solutions un, which start at Sn, and you need to choose the initial data of Xn, of course, between the two barriers, but in such a way so that at the limit, you're going to get something that, of course, has the best information you can get in terms of regularity, and especially in terms of the convergence to the Allen-Car minimum surface at the origin. A surface at the origin. So, this is the tricky part. So, the first tricky part is to do the barriers. The barriers do not match, the obvious barriers do not match well in overlap regions. And the hardest part is always between the parabolic and the inner regions, not the outer region. And the second part is the construction of the solution. And the second part of the proof is actually to show. Is actually to show that the bound on age. Once you have the solution, the way I described it above, to show the bound on age. So the solution we construct has H bounded in the whole region. And it's not hard to prove that H is bounded far away. Actually, it's easy. They just use some derivative estimates. Derivative estimates, the hard part here is to show that age is bounded in the region, more or less in the parabolic and inner region. And I'm just gonna, in two minutes, I'm gonna tell you how we do that. Of course, it's a little, it's technical, so just the idea. So we bound H, which is U sub T little H, we call H. little h we call a u sub h to be u sub t which is the mean curvature that satisfies this equation and so and and so what we are going to do we are going to bound the the approximating functions uniformly which is equivalent because this is the one with the ones we construct and We construct. And so just let me recall the scaling Z in terms X is the original variable and Z is the variable in the inner region, which is the hardest region to show the bound on H. And the way these two variables connect, Z is T to the minus K over 3x. T is the original time. This is the original time, the angry scale time. Now, first using derivative estimates, one can show. So, this is the straightforward argument. Some derivative estimates you need to work with them, but it is straightforward, is that H, which is Hn, which is more or less capital Hn, is bounded by T to the minus K over 3 and then best. This is more or less like Z to the negative 4. So, you see that in the inner region. then you see that in the inner region that you care about more you're off by this t to the minus k over 3 because you want to show that you're in your regional scale h is bounded and so you need to improve this bound so to improve this bound you use a blow-up argument so you consider this set capital Lambda n which is sorry you consider Sorry, you consider lambda n to be the maximum of this set. So it's the maximum of the function of the absolute value of h, little h sub n, which is u sub u n sub t. And you multiply by this factor to the power n. The reason you weight it is because you want to make sure that at infinity you get something. Infinity, you get something that has is bounded uniformly in your whole region, five is bounded far away, uniformly on the whole region, far away, uniformly in n. And the basic claim is that the supremum in n of lambda n is bounded. And there is, so in this set is where you use the contradiction argument. So you use blob, so you're assuming that this is. So you're assuming that this is not true. And then you use your scaling arguments. And then it's like very technical, but eventually after assuming that it's like infinity, then you end up with a contradiction using just this blow-up arguments. So this shows somehow that age is... so this shows somehow that h is bounded so in by just these blow up arguments somehow improve by t to the minus k over 3 to just the h bound so somehow the yeah so this is and this is a similar this is we simplify we did it's like the definitely the idea for example is taken here for this one by Stolarki's approach This one by Stolarski's approach, which was a very nice, the original approach, and we kind of didn't have to go to it, we simplified it, but this idea is of Stolars to obtain this by blow-up argument. And now, one question that you may want to discuss. That you may want to address is the uniqueness of these solutions. Now, we believe that the uniqueness holds for the class of the solutions we consider. However, as we know, uniqueness in mean curvature flow is a very difficult question if you don't want to assume any regularity. So, without the regularity, So, without restricting the class of the solutions, we don't believe that the problem has a unique extension. And that's an interesting problem as well. So, I will stop here.
