My talk today is about the matrix values of soga polynomials and the non-commutative integrable systems. Sorry that my talk is not about the Lagrangian form of the multi-time Lagrangian system. Sorry for that, but this talk is based on my interest of the Osogana polynomial and its connection with integrable system. Integrable system. So I start with the introduction part. It is known that the Ostagana polynomial have connection with integrable system. And this fact was founded by Mosser, maybe, in 1975. In his work to solve the Toda equation by inverse scattering, he found that the spectral problem A spectral problem can be solved by the orthogonal polynomials. And he used the continued fraction and Henkel determinants to solve the total equation at will. So after that, Defen and many other scholars follow this way to seek for connections between orthogonal polynomials and integrable systems. And another motivation is from the integral. Is from the integrable structure in quantum field theory or conformal field theory in 1990s. So people used the Ostagana polynomials as a characteristic polynomial of the matrix model and to see how to formulate the integrability in this kind of theory. So here are some references here, maybe the earlier The earlier reference in this talk, in this kind of topic. Okay, so I should give a definition of the Osogana polynomials because maybe some of you do not know exactly what the Osogana polynomials mean. So the Osagana polynomial are a band of polynomials. Polynomials which are orthogonal with respect to the width function omega x here. So, here omega x is a non-negative width function. And here I should remark that this omega x can be properly chosen. It can be choosed as this omega x can be supported in an interval or just some discrete points. So here the omega x can be X can be accurately chosen such that this is a non-negative width function. So, an oscillator polynomial has a very long history. It was studied by Gauss. And it is known that the Orthogonal polynomials can be the eigenvectors of the Schrodinger operator. So, this is a very natural. Is a very natural wave function in some sense, and to connect with the integrable system, I also need the time part. So we should introduce the deformed orthogonal polynomials. In this case, we should introduce some parameters into the width function omega so that this width function can be dependent. can be dependent can be dependent with time key and here the the normalization agent is also depend on the time key here so in this case this wave function can be can can can be performed as well so after the time variable is introduced then there are so many quantities that are Connected with, I mean, the from the Ostagana polynomials, there are so many quantities that can be connected with integrable systems. For example, the deformed Ostagona polynomials can act as a wave function in integrable systems, and the recurrence relation, which is a very good characteristic of the Ganner polynomial, can be acted as the spectrum. Can be acted as the spectral problem, and the native operator can be regarded as a max operator, and the normalization factor, which I mean the H here, can be the ratio of tau functions in this sense. So there are so many quantities from the also Ghana polynomial side can be related to the integrable system side. And in 1995 to 2000 at level, 2000, Mark Adna and Piela Mobique did many work about the connections between orthogonal polynomials and integrable systems from the group factor, from the group decomposition and orthogonal polynomials to connect with the semi-trace Masor constants and make the applications into the random matrices. And so in this picture, we just see the connections between the standard of Sagana polynomials and the Toda equation. So it is a very natural question to ask whether there is any generalization of the Orthogonal polynomials because there are so many integrable systems on the right-hand side. So here are the generalizations of the Orthogonal polynomials. The Otto Ghana polynomials, such as the Bauser Ghana polynomial, scale of the Ghana polynomials, and so on. Some of these polynomials arise from the Padaya approximation and the random matrices. And it is natural to find the corresponding Toda equation or Toda type equation on the right-hand side. So here are some references, and because there are not so many space to Not fill many space to write down the reference. Here, I just need some of them. And in this talk, I mainly focus on the matrix-valued oscillator polynomials, which we just want to consider some non-commutative integrable system in the integral system side. So the matrix value of the Gandhar polynomials adjusted to make the adjusted to make the width function omega x in in in the in the orthogonal polynomial case to a matrix valued width function wx here the wx here is a matrix valued thing and here the h and the normalization delta h n here is also a matrix matrix valued um normalization delta here h and Here, HN I just say here, HN is usually a positive definite matrix, but usually we can also assume that HN is a non-singular matrix that is okay. And the original idea of the matrix value of the Ghana polynomials can be dated back to the people of Cray in 1949. He considered the matrix moment problem as. The matrix moment problem and consider the continued fraction with non-commutative coefficients. And this paper was translated by Professor Walter Van Rashu in 2016 in English. Yes, so we can say that what does Crowen want to express in his paper? So here the infinite train matrices is a non-commutative generalization of the Jacobi matrix here. Of the Jacobi matrix here. And so, if there is a matrix moment problem and there is a continuous fraction, and there is also a Jacobi matrix with non-commutative coefficients, then it is natural to say, okay, there is also matrix valued also Ghana polynomials. And there are so many applications of the matrix valued also Ghana polynomials in recent days. Also gone upon normal in recent days. For example, for the coffee birthday first and the base process in stochastic process, Gramble and his collaborator did some matches valued orthogonal polynomials for this process. And they also derived those orthogonal polynomials from the group theory. And also in some in some property probability problem like the periodic asterisk balance they also use the the matching value of the banner polynomials to formulate the the model the partition function the the the gap problem and so on also in in non-commutative hermit pattern approximation tolera did some Estimation, Dolina did some non-commutative product equation and non-commutative product approximation in 2020 22 and 23, maybe 2021. Okay. So here, I just want to generalize the matrix value also going to point on the scene. Also, gonna point out we're seeing algebraically. Here we can consider more general orthogonal polynomials with non-commutative coefficients. Here let R be a deviation ring or just a skill field, which means that R is the ring and every element in this ring has an inverse, but not necessarily. But not necessarily, I mean, the communication is not necessarily commutative. So you can regard this R as a general inner group, right? So if you consider R as a general inner group, then this is matrix value thing. And this can be under choosing this as a division ring. So after we introduce the deviation ring, we also need to. wing we also need to consider a evolution on this on this algebraic structure i mean this start this start on the pj on the pj pj side so there is an evolution over this evolution mean at will also many we can consider the polynomial over this Over this dimension ring. This Rx is the polynomial with coefficients in this dimension ring. And there is the inner product we can define as in this way. Here the BJ star, I mean the evolution of the BJ. So in the matrix-valued side, this star can be regarded as the transpose of the matrices. And And also, there are some different locations of the inner product. You can say that in the paper of Demonic Pushinsky and Bercelemo, they wrote a paper about the analytic theory of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials. They defined the right-hand side inner product and left-hand side inner product. hands like inner product just the difference is just the um just the place of the evolution yes so we can we can just choose one notation we prefer and all the notations are consistent with the consistent with each other okay so we can see that after introduced the in After introducing the inner product, we can say the orthogonal relation can be written in terms of this inner product. And to make the orthogonal relation simpler, we assume that those polynomials, the matrix valued orthogonal polynomials as moniker polynomials. That is the coefficient of the highest order is equal to one. Is equal to one in the scalar case, but here we just mean that the highest coefficient of the polynomial is the identity in the division ring. Okay, this i M i plus Q just means the inner product of X I and X K because from the Because from the from the definition, you can easily see that you can easily see that if you add to Xi and XJ, this is a matter scale. And here you can see that also Ghana relation can be reduced to the NASA 9 of this line. So this is the linear system in some sense. If you take the inner product of the xi times the identity, then you can say, and you put that PNX as a polynomial, then substitute the PNX into the orthogonal relation. You can say a linear system. This linear system is the linear system with non-convergent. Linear system with non-commutative coefficients. If you consider the matrix values, so those A and J are all matrix are all matrices. So this is a linear system with non-commutative coefficients in this sense. So the existence and the uniqueness of the polynomial is equivalent to the existence and uniqueness. Existence and uniqueness of the linear system. So, here are some basic facts to this linear system. The first one is the existence and the uniqueness of PX is equal to that the moment matrix M i plus K is invertible. So, if M i plus K, because here M i plus K is a coefficient matrix of the middle system. So, if this system is a So if this system is invertible, then the linear system has a unique solution. And then all of this LMJ can be expressed by those MI plus J. And the second effect is found by Gilfound and his collaborators. So this kind of linear system can be System can be resolution of this kind of linear system can be given by quasi-determinants. So I just write explicitly the linear system and you can say that this ALI, the solution of this ALI can be expressed in terms of the inverse of the moment matrix AMI plus. Of the moment matrix A my plus k. So here I didn't use anything of the non-commutative. Here I just assume that the momentum matrix is invertible, then you can express it in this way. And if you express it in this way, I can introduce another notation in the another line. So this is something like Something like ABCD is equal to the B minus C times A inverse B. So if we introduce this kind of short commitment, then this kind of solution can be expressed as in the last line here. So this is the quote determinant, and I just regard it as the origin of the quote determinant just by solving the That's by solving the system here. So when we get the expression of those coefficients of orthogonal polynomials, then we can find the linear combination of the, I mean, if P L X is equal to Xn times the identity plus blah blah blah, then take those coffee. It takes those costly determinants into the into that form, then you can get that PNA exhaust have a costly determinant for in this case. And after get the PN, you can get HN is like the naster as in the naster line. I call it the quasi-henkel determinant, but in some literature they call it the Henkel-Rasky determinant. And in the paper of D. Faster and Keiden, And K then, they use this kind of quasi-Hecker dependent to formulate the combined networks of the path matrices. So this kind of quality handle dependent has many applications in common networks as well. And now I will go to the integral system side. Integrable system side. So, if we want to get an integrable system, there is a very important thing to formulate the spectral problem. So, for the moniker matched value of the Gandhar polynomials Pmx, we have the straight-term recurrence relation. Here, because this is moniker, so the coefficient of Pm plus one is equal to the identity, and I ignore that. And I ignore the identity here, but here it is also the matrix value thing here. So the coefficient of the coefficient of AM and BM are also matrix value things or non-commutative variables. So if you want to prove this kind of proposition, you just take the polynomial places. Polynomial basis, you just express the x times p of x as a polynomial basis. And using something like the fully free transformation, then you can get the expression of B and B here. And you can see that the lower coefficients are all zero. And this kind of recurrence relation is truncated in this sense. And this freight. And this free-time recurrence relation can also be formulated as a matrix 4. So you can recover the Jacobi matrix, which is a block tradiagonal matrix in this case. And this block tradiagonal matrix is coefficients are long-common. Coefficients are non-commutative coefficients in this sense. So I also express the quasi-determinants formula for this AM and BNF in this case. So this is a spectral problem for the matrix valued of the Gamma polynomials. Now, if we want to get into the integrable system, Into the integrable system, we need to introduce the introduce the time evolution. So the time evolution is the same with the commutative one. We just consider that the time evolution is something like the exponential form. And in this case, we can say that the derivative of PMXT is just the lower triangle pattern. The lower triangular part. I mean, this lower triangular is the lower Block triangular part of Block lower triangular part of the of the of the PN of the Jacobi matrix. Here the PN is the same with the PN in the rate and recurrence relation. So the compatibility condition of the spectral problem. Condition of the stat problem and the time evolution gives the integrable system in this sense. So we can get the non-commutative Toda equation in this sense. This is the first member of the Toda hierarchy, or just one-dimensional non-commutative Toda hierarchy. And if we consider the higher order, we can get the nuts representation of the non-commutative. Of the non-commutative total equation. Here, if we consider the derivative of Tk, and this phi is the vector of the matrix value of the Dana polynomial. And here, the A is the Nax matrix or the Jacobi matrix formulated by the straight-time recurrence relation. And then you can get that the compatibility of the Of the stratum recurrence relation and the time evolution gives the total hierarchy, non-commutative total hierarchy as well. So here I just remarked that this is the same with the commutative case, but here the element in A is the elements in AR are non-commutative, just this is just a difference. So this kind of now a billion-tolder equation. Now, a failure total equation or non-commutative total equation, or sometimes they call them as a quantum toda equation, are used in many different fields, such as here I show that in the picture of all canal, I showed that the diffusion interacting on positive different matrices related to this kind of non-convective product equation at will. And also, here are some numerical algorithms. Numerical algorithm are related to this kind of total as well. Yes. So there are also some applications of this kind of non-community equation. So despite of the continuous equation, we can also consider the discrete equation as well from the orthogonal polynomials. So if we consider the discrete evolution like introduction. That introduces the X K. Then we can obtain the Christoph transformation and the drone max transformation from the orthogonal polynomials. So you can say that the Christoph transformation can be regarded as a discrete or just as a double transformation in some sense because the P is a Because the P is a wave function, so this is just one step of the double transformation, and the johnny mass transformation is something like a spectral problem or something. And this is those two transformations are connected with the straight-meter relation, and those three are compatible. Then you can get the discrete total equation, non-commutative one. So if you Uh here I just as a last part I just want to show that there are many other non-connective global systems connected with the matches valued of the Ghana polynomials. Because I am interested in the solutions of integrable system and we can see that there are so many different kinds of solutions that can be introduced. That can be introduced in the expression of Sonitan equations. So the Henkel determinant, which arrives from the orthogonal polynomials, is related to the Toda equation. And we know that there are some Ransky, Grammy, Covenant determinant, and Hancock, Hanker determinant, and so on. So there are so many different kinds of solutions. Kinds of solutions in soliton theory. It is natural to see whether these kinds of different power functions or different solutions can appear in the matched value of the Ganopolynomus, or how to consider the non-commutative solutions of the non-commutative integer systems. So we do some generalizations of those kind of solutions. Of those kinds of solutions and those kinds of orthogonal polynomials. The first one is to consider the Cauchy-based guna polynomials. So this kind of thing, this kind of polynomial is to introduce the coupled, I mean, the coupled function 1 over x plus y. I call it a Cauchy colour in essence. And this is also related to your. And this is also related to your Cauchy matrix in some sense, because if we just take the width function as a delta function, I mean the delta function, which is just supportively one points, then this is the quotient matches in some sense. And here, this trend is a grammar, I mean, is a gramming determinant or grammar grammar determinant because you can see this A MIJ is of the Grammy. this Mij is of the grammar type. If you take the derivative of Mij, then you can, I mean, here I omit the time evolution part. If you add the time evolution part, you can say this is the Grammy determinant in some sense or quasi-gramming quasi-determinant in some sense. So this is the first example where the general Example we generalize the matched variable of the Ganner polynomials. And the second example is to consider the Henkel metrics. So in this paper, collaborated with Claire Gessland and Sheen, we consider the theta-deformed biostagana polynomials, by which way this is still a reski, a quasi-redsky determination. quasi-resky determinant but not an anchor determinant the and the role of the the role of the row and the colon are are different and in this case this is the solution it is a solution it is still the solution of non-commutative KP but for the total for the total type equation this is the naughty scale from the big T hierarchy rather than the total or or just Toda or just a tota. This is a Gilfan Dt. That is Gilfan Dt in this sense. So if this theta is equal to y, then this is a general todd equation. And the combined, the combinatoric aspect is still unknown. The last one is to consider the non-commutative torton equation. Today is a determinant, and this is. Is a determinant, and this is related to the non-commutative cost ratio and the evolution of the non-commutative cost ratio. Yeah, and maybe this is the end of that talk. Okay, thanks.
