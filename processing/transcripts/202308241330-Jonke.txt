You don't mind? No, I don't mind. Okay, I would like to start again to thank the organizers, to Mary, to Elmar, who are here, to Andre and El. She left us. They left us. So thank you very much for organizing this very nice event in this very nice Casmathematica. I'm very happy to be here. Very happy to be here. So, let me start this talk by giving you a bit of context because, as you can see from my title, I'm going to discuss some features of the field theory. I will not discuss gravity. Why is that so? So, the context is in general the field theory and higher algebraic structure related to its symmetries, like algebraid, Lie algebraid, squared algebraid, and L infinity algebra. And L infinity algebras, homotopy algebras in general, and things like this. And the reason I'm doing this in the context of field theory is actually motivated in a way by trying to understand the symmetries which might be relevant in the realm of quantum gravity. And taking a proxy for quantum gravity, taking a proxy for the quantum gravity string theory, some of these general Theory: some of these general symmetries that might be relevant, as Paolo nicely reviewed in his talk, are different dualities that appear in string theory, in particular T duality, U duality, etc., and also appearance on different non-commutative and even non-associative deformation of the symmetry as they know it. However, it turns out, for all of those of you who think they don't know what is, for example, an L. Don't know what is, for example, an L-infinity algebra. You have all seen this and you know it, although maybe not made explicit, because in essence, these things already appear in biviquantization of a field standard gauge theories as we know it. Although it's already present, maybe not explicitly, in the classical work on the biviquantization of gauge theory, starting from Vitaly Milkovitsky and the classical work of Milkowitzki and the classical work of Mark Henot and Teitelbaum, which are basic literature for this topic, it became clear and made explicit recently in the work of Barton Swiebach on the open string field theory and also in a very nice construction, which is actually a very nice motivating example. A very nice motivating example for this kind of research done by Alexander of Schwarz, Zabronsky, and Konzevich from 95, where they constructed solution of classical master equation for a certain class of topological sigma models using actually homotopy algebra and geometry of target space. So the question is. So, the question is for me: if we can generalize this nice construction of AKZ and in particular understand better both algebraic and geometrical structure behind the B V quantization of the field theory and then use these to learn something about quantum symmetry and to apply them in the realm of quantum gravity. Of quantum gravity. So, this is sort of motivation. In this work, I want to argue that, in essence, what I want to do is instead of working in a quantum gravity setting of different kinds, I will just go back to the field theory, identify the relevant notion there, and try to understand them better in algebraic and geometric context. So, to sort of So to sort of extend this construction of AKZ, what I want to do is to explore the relevant geometrical structure that appear in the biviquantization and field theory in general. And the way to do it is to try to find the sort of covariant. Sort of covariant expression for the things we do in the field theory. And sort of the starting point, of course, is to try to define connections and relevant tensors that we build from the connection in this setting. And in particular, I want to define connections both on the algebraic sides and on this QP or differential graded manifold. Differential graded manifold size. So, in short, the mathematical question I want to address in this talk are the connection and tensors on higher algebraic structure. What do I mean by this? So, take, for example, Lie algebraid. So, you have a vector bundle over a manifold with a given Lie bracket and an anchor map from this vector bundle to the tangent. To the tangent of your base manifold, and then you want to define the connection, you want to define the connection, and then, of course, you want to ask: is this connection compatible with the structure of your Lie algebraid, in particular, here with the Lie bracket and anchor map, which is the structure of Lie algebraid. Answer to this question is given in terms of a basic curvature tensor, which will Curvature tensor, which was initially defined by Anthony Blaum in his work. And the second question is: you want to do the sort of same thing of differential graded manifold side. Think of this, so this is Lie algebraic side. So algebraic side is sort of think of your this bundle of your gauge field or something. And then in the context of sigma models, these Digit manifolds are always. These Digi manifolds are always differential graded manifolds, are your target space. So, as Tanasis mentioned in his talk, you have differential there, and then you have a grading of your coordinates, which in BV formalism come natural because you introduced ghost antifields, which have additional grading numbers. So you have the grading coming from there. And again, you want to introduce connection of the grading manifold, and then you ask compatibility with the existing. You ask compatibility with the existing connection, and this compatibility is something given by Atiaco cycle. Why is this relevant in physics? So the compatibility or this algebraic connection with algebraic structure and this basic curvature turns out to be relevant if you look at certain examples and topological field theories. Examples and topological field theories again, and you look at the action. This is a part of the action of AB two-dimensional sigma model defined by Ed Witten. And then there is a classical example of part of the B V action of Poisson sigma model. So this is a sigma model defined as with the target space of a manifold given with the Poisson bivector. Given with the postponed by vector pi, the question is: is there kind of universality in this factor multiplying your four fermion terms? Because here we see it's a nice covariant curvature on a target. However, here we have some second derivative of your Poisson vector, and the answer is yes, this is actually given by this basic curvature tensor in different settings. So, and this the second. So and this the second question is and the relevance sort of this graded picture can also be seen from the understanding of gauge theories in general. So if you have some kind, if you have a transformation, gauge transformation of your field phi given by some given by the differential of a gauge parameter, and then in general, you can describe it here. In general, you can describe it here by a derivative of the component of the Q vector, which is this differential on your differential graded manifold. And the transformation of the field equation is given by second derivative of the component of this structure you have, this homological vector field you have on your Q manifold. And then, of course, the question is, what is the covariant understanding of Understanding of these two things. So, in this way, I sort of gave you already the plan of this talk. So, what is the goal is to understand this geometrical structure of algebraid and its relevance to higher gauge theories in particular. I will start trying to answering this mathematical question I posed, so introducing the connection and tensors in a relevant setting. I want to also relevant setting i want to also describe you this differential graded pictures for the algebraid and then i will try to argue that on a very simple and well-known example that it's relevant for the understanding of gauge theory so let's start with the easy stuff let's try to introduce let's see how we define the connection on the vector bundle so this is the standard definition of the linear connection Definition of the linear connection on the anchor bundle E. So you have an anchor here to Tm acting on another vector bundle V over the same base. It's a linear map of this kind, which satisfies the standard condition. So it's linear in the first argument, and then there is an action on the function in the second argument. You see the need here. Argument, you see the need here. There is a row of the action of the connection on E, on V on a function. That's why you need the anchor bundle. It gives you the vector which will act on function. Not only it gives you the action on the function, it's also this anchor gives you a special connection E on V induced by this anchor. By this anchor. So there is this special connection when there, you say that your connection, it has a dot here, is just given by this anchor map of your section on the tangent bundle acting on V. Any other, you can think of any other connection, general connection E on V as this induced connection plus some endomorphism, so difference of two connections. So difference of two connection is always given by endomorphisms here. In this talk, we will consider instead of this E on V, we will mostly have Tm on Tm, Tm on E, E on Tm, and E on E to make it simple. Okay, so on the Lie algebra, as I said, Lie algebraid, you have a bundle which is anchored to T. Which is anchored to TM and the Libracket. If you have an E on E connection, so you can define standard way the torsion, tensor, and this I gave you just the standard definition, give you explicitly coordinate expression for the when your bundle E is actually just a tangent bundle. This is the lead bracket of the vector fields, and the anchor is just identified. fields and the anchor is just identity, you get the standard definition of your torsion. Coefficients, more interesting example is the one for cotangent bundle over Poisson manifold where you have Poisson bivector and then you use this Poisson bivector as the anchor map. So bivector acting on a section of the cotangent band of which are one form will give you a one vector which is the Give you a one vector, which is the section of Tm. And then you have the as a bracket, Coshul-Schouten bracket for the forms. And in this case, I gave you only the component of this induced connection. You see, induced connection is given by the covariant derivative of your anchor vector field. You can define the curvature using the standard expression and then. And then, where this bracket here is, of course, this is the lead, this is just a commutator of the covariant derivative. This is your algebraic bracket. And for this cotangent bundle over Poisson manifold, this E curvature is given by the curvature on your manifold with the components of the anchor map. Of the anchor map. It's interesting to note and relevant for our talk that there is one more connection we can define of Lie algebraid, and this connection is in due. I think you have to do it twice. Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry. Let me first go back forward and then. Okay, so I have a I have e-connection e-connection along the section of the my bundle acting on the section of Tm. So E-connection on Tm, which is induced by the standard connection on TM using the anchor map here. This is called basic connection, sometimes basic connection. Sometimes basic connection in the case when E, your bundle, your Lie algebra is just a tangent bundle, so the row is identity. This is just the opposite upper end connection. And using this connection, you can define basic curvature given here. So it's as I told you, this is the actually compatibility, as you can see, between the connection. See between the connection on Tm with your structure of Lie algebra with the bracket of the Lie algebraid. The first three terms, if you just write it like this, are not a tensor. And that's why you have this sort of correction, make it a tensorial tensorial tensor in our setting. And this was the And this was defined by Anthony Blaun as a compatibility condition. As I said, in Abaddon-Kreinig, it was used to define the representation of Lie algebraid. And now just to see how it looks like, what are sort of local components in local basis of this basic curvature? So on the Tm, when you take the E is Tm, you just your basic curvature is just standard curvature on your manifold. Standard curvature on your manifold plus some correction coming from the torsion. So you see that when there is no torsion, in this case, your basic curvature is just standard curvature. On the cotangent Lie algebraic over a Poisson manifold, however, the situation is more interesting. So it's given by the covariant derivative of your components of your anchor. components of your anchor map of your Poisson bivector plus some curvature connection what one of the things we want to also argue is that in the definitely in topological field quantum field theories you don't need a curvature all you need is torsion tensor You need is a torsion tensor and basic curvature, and then you can express your standard curvature on your Lie algebraid using this quantity. This is interesting kind of claim because we want to push this claim a bit further because definition of the curvature on the higher structure like Urant algebra is not unique, it's not well understood. So, one way around it, it's a So one way around it is to say it doesn't matter. We have other tensorial quantities which are defined and we don't need actual curvature, standard curvature definition to work out our physical models. And in a Lie algebraic case, this is really nice, can be nicely seen like this. So your curvature is just expressed as a basic curvature acting on the anchored section here, plus some. Here plus some function of phi hat here, where this phi hat is a difference of this endomorphisms, which measure the difference of the induced connection and any other connection you might have, minus the torsion tensor on your Lie algebraid. And obviously, you can immediately see that there are two, that there is a special case when basic curvature is actually. Curvature is actually the standard curvature when this phi hat vanishes. And these special cases are actually two special cases. In one instance, you can say, I will set phi to zero, so we will work with induced connection. I will also set torsion to zero. And in this case, your connection, your reconnection is just given by induced connection. Given by induced connection and curvature is basic curvature on anchor section. However, you can choose a different connection. You can say the phi is not zero nor torsion, but put them equal. And in this case, the curvature for which R is S is this, the connection for which R is equal to S is this basic connection. Okay, what happens in the hierarchy? What happens in the higher case? What happens in current algebraid? So, current algebraid, think of it as a higher structure. It's defined again as a bundle over the manifold. It's an anchor bundle again. There is an anchor map from E to the tangent of your base space M. There is a bracket on the section of E, which is not a lead bracket this time. And sorry. And there is. And there is pairing. There is a fiber metric on the section. There is a metric on the section of the bundle. The connection are defined in the same way formally. The only extra condition is to be compatible with the fiber metric. However, the previous definitions of torsion curvature and basic curvature. Curvature and basic curvature turns out that these expressions are not tensorial. And now there are different ways, and then there are certain ways to make it tensorial. For the torsion, there was a proposal by Marco Goldieri. So this first part here is what you would call naive torsion. This is not a tensor. You contract it with another section of V, and then you correct the non-tensoriality by this. By these particular two pieces. Note that I will take the skew symmetric I'm taking in this talk, the skew symmetric on the bracket on the current algebra, so everything is anti-symmetric for me in first two indices. You can do it for also non-skew-symmetric Dortmund bracket, but I'm not doing it here. Also, one can One can show, and this is the construction we do with tanasis, and that the basic curvature can be again in the same way made sensorial, sort of following the guiding principle being what Merco did for the torsion. You again take a sort of naive expression for the basic curvature, you contract it with an You contract it with another section, this is again non-tensorial, and then you correct it to be a tensor. It's nice to notice that this definition was also obtained in a paper by Madeleine Yotz-Lin, Roysen Mechta, and Valdopotnis, which was actually published later, like this year, I think. Year, I think, where they were studied even the higher LN algebraids, not just current algebra. I want to make two remarks. The first one is that for the induced connection, which is a special connection, as I already said, the one given by the anchoring the section, in this case, naive curvature would become a tensor, however, torsion or basic. However, torsion or basic curvature do not. And of course, as I said, these are proposals for the tensors for the current algebraic. There are no unique. There are other proposals, in particular for torsion and curvature, given by Olaf Holm and Barton's feedback, analyzed also by Branjo Yorcho and Jan Bisocchi. Paolo had a proposal with Proposal with Frederik Kobonecki, Andres Deser, and then there is some proposal by Peter, there is a very nice proposal by Peter Schof and Eugenia Boffo. So there are different proposals how to define tensors in the higher algebraic structure, and it would be interesting to analyze different proposals in a physical setting. So to build a physical model with a given curvature and tensor structure. Yes, Ma, and just back into the last point. Sure. Probably I think we have a few points to follow on version in math. I was wondering, because I included Valtier gave also a notion of approach. Well Translated. That is a tensor in the basement. So I want to know what is the relation between the What is the relation between the one you are showing and you are hearing more? That I recall was also, so to say, adding extra pieces in order to obtain covariance. No, I don't recall Goltieri's definition because the usual definition, I mean the usual, the most often definition of the curvature is the one defined by Home Tree. Defined by Holmes, Weebach, and these people later, when you have some kind of you don't have basis independence, you have extra terms that correct for the tensor reality. However, you use explicit basis element in a definition. So, I don't know if this is Marco's definition. Okay, okay, this does it here. Okay, thank you. Okay, and then I just wanted to. Okay, and then I just wanted to show you how the local coordinate expression looks for a simple example of quarantine algebraids, which is here given by the sum of Tm plus the direct sum of Tm plus tangent quadrature bundle, where the anchor map on the first slot is zero. And on a separate plot, we use Poisson by vector. These are explicit components of the tensors. Okay, as I said, we want to understand the geometry, covariant geometry on the algebraic side. However, we are also interested in understanding the DG manifold side. We are interesting for two reasons. The first reason is that from the The first reason is that from the AKZ construction and basically the sigma model approach, when you think of the field theory as a sigma model, you would have a target manifold. And if you're discussing B V of your field theory, your sigma model, your target manifold will be graded manifold because you will have to introduce ghost antifields and everything. This, you will have to introduce. And everything, this you will have to introduce grading of your coordinates on the target space. However, there is another reason why you want to look at the differential graded manifold. And the reason is that for algebraids and in general, homotopy algebra, you can encode them equivalently by on the DG manifolds. And when I say DG manifolds, so take a manifold with So take a manifold with the set coordinates x alpha, assign degree to your coordinates x alpha. I'm having here only non-negative degrees, so x mu would always be a zero degree coordinates, and then I would have coordinates of degree maybe one, two, depending in which setting, in which model I'm working. And then you have a Q homological vector field on this manifold of degree one that squares to zero. That squares to zero. And this you can construct for any in general homotopy algebra, you can construct corresponding Dig manifold in which the condition that your vector q homological squares to zero will would give you all the relations in your algebraic homotopy algebra in particular. So, as I said, So as I said, for Lie algebraid I have vector bundle over manifold with anchor and Lie bracket. I can encode this on a DG manifold that is spanned by a degree by coordinates of degree 0, x mu, coordinates of degree 1, a. And I have most general for every any linear algebra q vector field of degree one. You can see it's degree one. So my Can see it's degree one. So, my function, this is the row, this is the anchor map, which is a function only of x, so it's degree zero. I have explicit coordinate a of degree one, and then the derivative with respect to x is degree zero. So this is degree one, and here I have two a's, so degree two, but I have derivative with respect to a, which is minus one, so this is the most general degree one few vector, and the functions here in front are given. Functions here in front are given by your structure of Lie algebraid. In particular, these are the components of the anchor map, and these are your Lie bracket structure function. When you impose the condition that Q squares to zero, you will get two conditions, because you will have something proportional with derivative of X, something proportional with derivative of A. One of these will give you Jacobi identity for your Libra. For your Lie bracket, and the other will give you that the map row has to be homomorphisms. So, this Q will encode your Lie algebraic structure, giving you local coordinate expression for the definition of this structure. Here, I just wanted to write this Q vector in explicitly covariant expression. So, I will have instead of partial X, I will have covariant. Instead of partial x, I will have covariant derivative here having a component of the connection on e. And then this structure constant will just go into the torsion component of the torsion tensor on this algebra. What do you do in as an example in a higher structure, which is a current algebraic? So we know from the work of So we know from the work of Dima Reutenberg that current algebraic, so with its non-lib bracket, anchor map and fiber metric, can be encoded in a structure, DG manifold structure, where this is your manifold. So I have base manifold with my coordinate x. I shift the fiber by one. This is one of these a. There are two. Of this a this there are two coordinates of degree one, and then I have the cotangent of this shifted by two. It means I will have a coordinate of degree two and one more of degree one. The most general q here, I wrote it already in the covariant form, is given in this form. So I have degree zero derivative, I have degree one, degree minus one derivative, and degree minus two now derivative because minus two now derivative because I have derivation with respect to coordinate of degree two and one can show that square the the when you square q and impose the condition that it vanishes you will get the three axioms this time three because i will have three components of the square three axiom of current algebraic given in local coordinates so you can So you can, in general, for L infinity or homotopy Lie algebra, you can always construct the Q, homological vector Q, which squaring, imposing that it squares to zero, will give you the axioms or the structure of your higher algebra. Okay, and now that I introduce kind of the idea behind I introduce kind of the idea behind these graded manifolds. Again, we want to define a connection on these graded manifolds, which have additional structure, the vector Q. The connection and the curvature are defined the same way. The only thing you have to be careful about, since we are in a graded setting, every time you pass function of degree, this absolute value means here the degree of the stuff of the. The degree of the stuff or the thing inside, you have to take into account the grading. So it's all the same, you just have to be very careful about the signs. Okay. And then, as I said, what are the conditions for compatibility of this, of the connection on this graded manifold with the homological. With the homological vector field you have on it. And the answer is, which was given to us by the work of Rajan Mekta, Stion and Bing Shu. It's something called a Tiako cycle. It's a map from the tensor product. Here, Curly M is your any graded manifold. So T tangent bundle over this grade manifold to any manifold is given in this form. Is given in this form. So you have lead derivative along your base homological vector field acting on the covariant derivative along the section of Tm or acting on the other section. Then this lead derivative along the vector Q is going along the section here. And then here you pass with Q a lead derivative along the Q over X. Along the Q over X, so you have a sign, and then there is acting here. This Attea Cocycle has degree, inherent degree one, because this one comes from the degree of Q vector. And then, of course, when it acts on your section of the bundle, it can have any degree here. But the degree of at is one coming from the homological vector field. The homological vector field. Its properties are, as I said, it's a cosycle. So lead derivative along the q of a theta is zero, is the Jacobiator of this map or operator, if you want to think about it. So applying it twice is given by this expression. So the lead derivative along the q vector of na blog naught, and it is greater than the n x. It is graded symmetric provided that the torsion of your manifold vanishes. So, the symmetry, the graded symmetry property of the cosycle is controlled by the torsion on your graded manifold. I want to give you just how it looks in the components so you can express the Ati acocycle evaluated on the two sections of. Evaluated on the two sections of your Tm gradient manifold, and you can see it has the second covariant second derivative of your Q vector. It has some dependence of a Q vector and the connection and the curvature on your T M and then covariant derivative on acting on Q time torsion. And if you remember, you can write it for if you have a you can write it locally. You can write it locally, taking this to be locally flat on just the basis vectors, and you can see that basically a theta in that case is given with some sign as a second derivative of your homological vector fields. If you remember, it appeared in my field theory consideration in the beginning. I will make it more explicit later. Okay, and as Okay, and as I said, there is a connection between this algebraic picture and the Digi manifold picture, and we can make it very explicit. For Lie algebraid case, this was studied first by Weintrop and then lots of work by Yvette Cosman Schwarzbach. So, basically, what you want, you want to express. What you want, you want to express this Lie algebraic structure as derived from your DG manifold sides using Lie brackets on the tangent of your differential graded manifold and the homological vector fields. And how you do it for the Lie algebraic case, you can define a map from the sections. Take a section of your E bundle in some basis. So this is the basis of your section. This is this function here. intersection this this function here and map it to a degree minus one vector in the tangent bundle of your graded manifold so remember in the Lie algebraic case I have a differential graded manifold spanned by coordinates of degree zero and one so I'm having here a special map so my section will go to degree minus one vector To degree minus one vector. And when I do this, I can show that the Ankhor map of the Lie algebraic antigen on a function can be expressed as the commutator of the Q vector with this image of the section under the map Piota, then acting on the function, and the bracket on the sections of Lie algebraid can be described again using the Lie bracket on. again using the Lie bracket on the differential graded size and the homological vector field Q. And now the next thing what you might want to do, okay, I have the structures. What does it tell me about the connections and the tensor on this structure? Can I relate them? Yes, you can also relate connection and tensor structure. And tensor structure built from this connection using these maps, but you have to make some choices based on the well, basically you want the both sides to behave like a connection. So it has to be linear in the first term. It has to act with the on the second term. There is a particular choice we used where the we connected, we expressed the We connected, we express the connection coefficients on the algebraic side in terms of induced connection. On the DG manifold, once you make this choice, you can see what happens, how you can express the torsion on your algebraic side using the quantities on the Digi manifold size. So, in principle, the torsion on the algebraic On the algebraic is given by the torsion on the Digi manifold side, provided the theta cocycle on these vectors vanishes. You can express the basic curvature using the DG manifold size equation using the curvature covariant derivative of Covariant derivative of a ta and here I put torsion on the dig manifold side to zero just to make the expression shorter. So this is the connection. As I said, this is the choice of you made the choice of the connection here. However, the basic curvature does not, you can show it does not depend on the choice of this connection. And then you can also express the curvature in the algebraic. In the algebraic side, in terms of the curvature on the DG manifold. On the current algebraic, so on the higher structure, things get more complicated for two reasons. One reason is that DG manifold in this case, as it's given here, it's a cotangent of something. So it has symplectic structure. There is a Poisson bracket as additional structure. And also, it has degree minus two cotangent. It has degree minus two coordinates additionally compared to Lie algebraid. So what you can do is basically take again the same map from the basis, from the section of the algebraid to degree minus one vector fields over m on tm as a section of m. However, since you have degree two coordinates, you can have two two factors. Two factors here. So the derivative with respect to degree one coordinate and then derivative with respect to my two coordinates times the coordinate one to get minus one. This function here, which I wrote explicitly, is a choice we made in the construction because this choice here is sort of fixed by the choice of the connection you make later. So that's why it's explicit here. But in general, So that's why it's explicit here, but in general, it's some function of degree zero here. As I said, you have on the current algebra, you have additional structure. So you will need to introduce additional map, which will map your section this time into functions of degree one on your manifold. When you do this, you can express the structure of current algebraic anchor map. Anchor map, the formal expression is the same like in Lie algebra before, and then you can express the bracket components using this time Poisson structure, Poisson bracket you have here on your Digi manifold, and equivalently, this Poisson structure you use to express the pairing, which again, you have additional this fiber metric that exists. Additionally, this fiber metric that exists additionally in quantalge. This is not the only way to make a mapping. The standard way is basically to use Poisson brackets for everything. But since we want to describe the vectors on the Digi manifold, we will keep this construction with the one degree minus one vector field. And what I will not show you again, you can do. you again you can do you can make a specific choice how to make a connection we were we were here using mimicking sort of the algebraic again this is a not not unique choice the choice we made here is again choosing induced connection because it's easier we didn't analyze the whole space of the whole moduli space of the connections here like we did for the algebraic and then Did for the algebraic. And then, using this choice, you can find the torsion and basic curvature on the current algebraid from the structure on the DG manifold. Again, we didn't analyze the curvature here because we don't know how to write it properly. I mean, there are different proposals. And again, we claim that it's not. Again, we claim that it's not necessarily fundamental object in the constructions construction we are interested in. These expressions are a bit more involved than in Lie algebraid. That's why I don't show you the details because there are more structure on the current algebra, and you have to make compatibility with different structure explicit to construct the tensorial. Objects. So, this is sort of math part of the talk when all you need to remember is, okay, you have a higher structures, algebraic or differential graded anifog. You want to introduce connection because you want to define curvatures and torsions and higher tensors in this setting. You have to be aware. You have to be aware that there are compatibility conditions which in different settings are given either by basic curvature and a T-echo cycle. And what I contribute here, there is this nice relation between derived, this derived philosophy which gives you from the graded manifold, differential graded manifold algebraic structures. Okay, so what I promised you is to show you why this is. You is to show you why it is how it's relevant and why we want to use it in the field theory context. I will do the very simple examples which are very well known and for which this construction completely superflows. But the higher examples, I'm too involved to show them and we are still working on them. So this is example is Poisson sigma model. So this is a sigma model, two-dimensional sigma model. Sigma model, two-dimensional sigma model whose target space is Poisson manifold, so manifold with Poisson bivector structure defined on it. So there is a Poisson bracket on it, or if you want, yeah, there is a Poisson bracket on it. And now I'm thinking here you have sigma model, so you have a map from the sigma 2 to the manifold, which has this structure. has the structure of the Poisson vector field and you have one forms which lives in a pullback of your cotangent bundle this the R m. The classical gauge invariance of this action of the single model is invariant under this gauge transformation. And you want to write the B-V action for this field theory. So for this topological model. field theory so with this topological model so you can do it in one step using a kz construction this is a example of the sigma models that go under that admit this construction basically what you do is you just you just rename this classical field in the superfield which contain all the components of your b because B reconstructions, so which include ghosts and antifields, and you are done. You can really do it in one line. However, I want to do it here step by step because, in general, this is not always possible. So, what you do in general in BV, so what you do, you introduce ghost of degree one, you define the BRST transformation, you check what happens with the square of BRST transformation, and Be a restricted transformation, and if you are lucky, nothing happens, you will get zero here, and you are done. However, in this model and in general, the gauge transformation will basically square in something proportional to equation of motion. So you will have open gauge algebra. In that case, you have to do full BV construction. It means you have to introduce antifield, you have to define the BV. The B V transformation, which will square to zero. So you define antifields to take care of this openness of the gauge algebra. And in Poisson sigma model, we know the answer. It's this expression for A. I just wrote A because X doesn't actually change. So cube B. So gauge B V transformation of your gauge field A is differential on your gauge parameter, goes to degree one. goes to degree one first derivative of your post connect first derivative of your components of your bivector pi and then second derivative of your components of your bivector multiplying altifields and two gauge transformation so do we know how this looks what is the covariant expression for this because i have some because they have some explicit first order derivatives here. Well, for this, you introduce a vector bundle connection on your target and associate it. So this is the connection on the target and this gives you the bundle connection. You see, now I'm using the induced connection given by this anchor map of my Lee. Anchor map of my Lie algebraid over it. And then you can define the relevant using this connection tensor on your Lie algebraic structure. And then you can write the B-Wick transformation in covariant form. Again, this is just an exercise to show you the relevance of this procedure. In this particular example, you don't need to do it. You know the shortcut it's given. So if you look at the covalent. So if you look at the covariant expression for Q B V on A, now redefined, it contains the covariant derivative of the Gauss field, it contains the torsion of your algebraic structure, and it contains the basic curvature multiplying the antifield. Again, what is nice about Poisson sigma model, and this is the result. And this is the result due to Noriaki, Keda, and Thomas Straubel. So, this is the model that goes with under this AKZ construction. However, if you introduce, so I show you two-dimensional sigma model, if you introduce here a Vesumino term in the dimension three, for which this sigma is the boundary, you cannot do a You cannot do a KZ construction because technically, because you will not have Poisson structure on the whole space, you will have Q, but not QP manifold. However, in this case, what is shown by Noriaki and Thomas is that this structure stays the same. The only things that change is basically torsion. Torsion and basic curvature here. The form is the same, but the explicit expression for torsion and the basic curvature are different. So you can absorb this sort of Vesumina term in geometrical setting in this explicit form of your torsion and basic curvature tensors. So this is sort of idea behind all. Sort of idea behind all this. Going beyond AKZ means finding a nice geometrical picture behind it, and then going beyond it by just sort of keeping this geometrical understanding, introducing the additional deformation in this setting by basically recalculating only the geometrical objects you have there, not doing the complete B- B way. Okay, and before I finish, I just also want to tell you just one slide because this is something that has to be worked out in more details. On the Digi Manifold side, you can do the following. So as I told you here, so I'm still with this sigma model. I have a map. X is a map from the. X is a map from the sigma to n, and now I'm just redefining A to be a map from T1 sigma to T star m and with these two maps I can define map phi from T star one from T shifted by one degree one sigma to the graded manifold to T star one m. So this is the graded manifold D G manifold. It has also It has also a differential that squares to zero, such that I can define that my fields on my sigma model are pullbacks of the coordinates on the target. So my target is a graded manifold with the gradient coordinates of degree one and here of degree zero x and degree one a. And then I when I pull them back. them back on the man sorry when when i pull them back they they are the fields in the sigma model that that's the relation i have to do some extra exercises to take care of the epsilon the the the gauge parameter transformation by once i do this i can write the classical gauge transformation of the Of the Poisson sigma model using the structure on the Digi manifold side. So the gauge transformation of x, which was just pi epsilon, is pulled back by this map phi of action of the lead derivative along the vector q on epsilon. The gauge classical gauge transformation of your field A is just the composition of D of the pullback of epsilon. Of the pullback of epsilon plus again action of lead derivative of the vector co-homological vector field which you have on your DG manifold on epsilon. And then variation, this is nice because this includes the higher structure, variation of your field equations, these are your field equations are just given by this Atiaco cycle here. So you pull back, you evaluate the Atiaco cycle on your digital. Cycle on your Digi manifold side, and then you pull it back on your Sigma model. And this is from the introduction. I just want you to see that what was sort of constructed in a work, a lot of work by Thomas Straubel, with collaborators, with Grutzmann, also with Martin here, with Alexei Kotov. So you have that your fields transform. Your field transformation is given here. We had the first derivative of the Q vector. It's actually times epsilon. It actually can be covariantly written as action of the lead derivative along the Q vector on epsilon. And what we had there in the beginning that included the transformation of the equation of motion that had the second derivative of Q, it's actually given by the pullback of a T-ecocycle, if you remember. of idea cycle if you remember the idea of cycle i gave you in the local coordinate expression it was just started with the second derivative of the q vector and in general if you sort of want to write in general field theory this was for explicitly given for Poisson sigma model if you assume so again If you assume, so again, in more generality, you consider a set of fields. Now we had X and A, now you can have higher fields. On T1 sigma, you have a target digit manifold M, and then you have appropriate coordinates, they of degree 0, 1, 2, depends how many fields you have. Hi, you can define this map phi, which you will use to pull back coordinates as a field on your manifold C. On your manifold sigma. This defines your field theory. And then you assume, and this is an assumption I will explain a bit later, that the transformation of the field are just given by the d of epsilon plus some function to be determined of epsilon. And you define also field equations to be d phi, these are the fields in general. These are the fields in general, plus the component of your Q vector. And then you can show that the model you constructed by the sort of pulling back the structure from the target to the sigma model, the transformation of the gauge field will be given by the dip of pullback of the epsilon plus something which I denoted here by B1 of epsilon. Here by B1 of epsilon. Transformation of the field equation will be something here denoted B2 of F epsilon. And your gauge algebra closes in the so two gauge transformation on the field phi is some bracket B2 on field phi plus some term that is given by equation. So you have the closure up to equation. You have the closure up to the equation given by something which is here denoted B3. One can show that, as I show you, that on this example, on the Poisson sigma model there, that this B1 map is lead derivative along the Q vector field. Map B2 is a T-ecocycle. Map V3 starts with covariant derivative of a T-ecocycle plus possibly some kind. Plus, possibly some curvature terms. And these are named V1, B2, B3 because this corresponds to the L infinity one algebra of Kapranov as shown in this paper. So you define the structures using general expression given by your DG manifold, so your Q vector. manifold so your q vector your a tia and the covariant derivative of the for those of you who know something about ellenfinity algebra these or maps are degree one obviously this has the degree of q it's one i said that theta is degree one and then nabla nabla doesn't have degree so again one they're all degree one to form and then the algebra L infinity algebra, they have to satisfy the relation of L infinity algebra, which are encoded in Q square is zero, and they have to be graded symmetric maps. It means that I had to assume that this connection has no torsion. In that case, the TI, as I told you, is graded symmetric. So it's really a proper. So it's really a proper L infinity map. And these, to be gradient symmetric, here you have to introduce some R curvature corrections, which are given in the closed form in this form. So as I told you, the motivation here was to understand the geometry and the geometry behind this B V construction and the algebra. Construction and the algebra in order to understand the higher symmetries given in terms of algebraid and homotopy algebra, because we believe that this will give us a better handle, both on the field theory side itself, but also on possibility how to generalize the symmetries we know from the field theory to maybe. To maybe quantum symmetries relevant for this action. What we want to show next is to finish sort of current algebraic example to show exactly, because again, this current algebraic sigma model is of AKZ construction, is part of the examples of AKZ. However, when you add a four-point twist, which is relevant in certain Which is relevant in certain construction in a string theory, it doesn't go there. So we just want to make it geometrical and add this twist inside of our geometric structure. We want to see what happens with basic curvature for higher structures. So think of Lie algebra as L1, L1 infinity algebraic current algebraic is L2, and then you can go. Is L2, and then you can go higher. And for these, there is this nice work by Madeleine Jotz-Lynn and Mechte Vapornopoulos on this higher structure, define this basic algebra of higher structure. And finally, what I wanted to say is to understand the field theory in more generality, we have to allow for more general definition of the gauge transformation for fields, excluding explicity, maybe the field dependence. The field dependence and understand it in a completely up-to-the BV construction. And that's all I wanted to say. Thank you. Questions? Comments? Any questions from people who are online?
