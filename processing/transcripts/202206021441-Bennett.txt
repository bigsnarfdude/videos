Yeah, just about lung protective ventilation here and trying to break this positive feedback between initial injury, more injury from the ventilator, and that perpetuating that initial injury, making things worse until you die. There's kind of a whole field of topics here, and what I would like to focus on for maybe the next 15 minutes is the idea of predicting optimal ventilation, not identifying what it is, but Identifying what it is, but formulating some system to predict what's best. In my primitive physiologist's mind, it seemed like this would be done with a subject-specific model. After the last week, I'm kind of unsure that that's going to be the way to go, but I already made the slides, so we're going this way. Generally, what we're thinking about here is taking some measurements, identifying a model, using that model to predict. So it seems like most of the work in It seems like most of the work in model development in this field is pretty haphazard. People will like take a few injured animals from one type of injury, try to fit a model to that, not really test it and say, hey, we developed a new model. Look at this. It's great. And mainly from talking to Dave and then kind of getting into the literature based on that, it seemed like I should do something a little more systematic. And because ARDS is this huge range of instigating injury, we started off with four types of injury: well, uninjured. Types of injury, well, uninjured, this lavage surfactant washout, which is really unstable, kind of a collapsible lung, endotoxin, which is hyperinflammatory, tons of cell infiltrates. This like kind of marinates for two days before we do the experiments, and hydrochloric acid two days before, which is like a direct burn to the epithelium of the lung. In the injury cases, we whacked them with 25 minutes of high-pressure ventilation to simulate the clinical case of being injured, going on the ventilator, and then The ventilator, and then did this super comprehensive suite of measurements where we started off with end expiratory pressure zero, ventilated a little bit, took a measurement, step three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen, and back down to zero. Just to be clear, P is the underlying base pressure of the lung. Yeah. So the pressure that it takes to keep the lung tolerance, people to the positive end expiratory pressure. And that was one of the huge breakthroughs in arts management. Throughs in arts management because it keeps the lung open. It was a 1964 invention, I think. It's also one of the key targets for optimization. So the reason we're doing these different peeps, this is a control, all of the controls lumped together at low end expiratory pressure. The lung is a little stiffer, elastance being a measurement of pulmonary system stiffness. Then we come up and peep a little bit. We have less elastinth, less stiffness. And then as we start to overstretch the lungs, And then, as we start to overstretch the lung, it gets much, much stiffer. So, we need kind of two components in a model here: we need stiffness at high pressures and increasing stiffness at low pressures. So, there's a happy spot in the middle where the lung wants to be downloaded. All right, just to give you a little idea about the data we're using for this, I'm going to kind of rush through these. This is the most severe of the injuries, the lavage. The key take-home here, I think, is that we see this progressive increase in stiffness. See this progressive increase in stiffness, and then on the way back down the ladder, when we compare to control, this difference is much less big. So, we're getting a little better after we go up high pressures. And as we come back down to a peak of zero, it comes back up because the lung is collapsing on itself. And if we look at these in pairs, so we've got, say, PEP3 compared to PEEP3, it is much lower after we've gone up here, opened the alveoli with high pressure, and come back down. Pressure and come back down. And we don't see that in the lavage, you know, and sorry, in the endotoxin injury. What we see there is we're just consistent from, say, PEEP6 to PEP6. Those are about the same. So this symmetry or lack of hysteresis, if we like plotted this, is pressure versus volume. And so that degree of recruitability is highly infrared dependent. And just to prove this to ourselves with great, great. Ourselves with great effort in me manually looking at I don't know 25,000 images of mouse lungs. Went through and calculated the amount of collapsed lung tissue, which is vertical axis and increasing air pressure on horizontal axis, pretty stable for LPS, decreasing all abodes. Now you have another thing to have to mine, so just how long you would run high P. Yeah, because if you run high pressure for too long, you damn or spell up. A lot of wonderful, but you also promote surfactants. It's a very simple system. So, you know, that kind of pre-to-post ladder difference is due to recruitability. The other difference here is we're much, much stiffer at high pressure if we look at the lavage versus the endotoxin. And that is because the open lung is stiffer in the lavage injury. So, if we look at the volume of air in the parenchyma, that being the alveoli and the alveolar ducts. Being the alveoli and the alveolar ducts, the lavage has less air and more open alveoli. So these alveoli are less stiff. And we looked at this in a couple other ways. So we have a highly recruitable lung, and the lung that's open is much different in this Lavage degree. So another part that everyone will like, I think. We took these peak ladders, used those as training data for a model. As training data for a model, which I'll show you in a couple of slides. I'm not going to get into this, but we also use different parts of this to see which of the data we needed. And within this training data, depending on the mouse, we used three different ventilation patterns. So we wanted to see if using just a low tidal volume and the fitting, we just use those breadths of red right there towards the end for reasons of computational speed. We also use a tidal volume of six, and this does not show up well on the projector. And this does not show up well on the projector, but before we went into the ladder, we inflated the lung to a pressure of 30, held it there for a little bit, and then came back down, called a recruitment maneuver, and a higher title volume of 10 with a lower respiratory rate. So which of these was better? I thought I was in the new 10, so I was wrong. All right, and using data outside of this, we wanted to test the performance of the model. So we fit the model to what's in yellow, tested it out with these green blocks on the ends. Tested it out with these green blocks on the ends, and these had a recruitment maneuver, a couple of minutes to stabilize, then five different ventilation patterns with different settings: tidal volume, inspiratory pause versus no inspiratory pause, just going to test the flexibility of these predictive models. And we also used peeps there, one and a half and four and a half that weren't inside that training area. And I believe Jake was making fun of my model in his presentation. In his presentation, but here we use what I perceive as the simplest model that covers these parameters. The vertical expansion here is attributed to tissue stretch, so expansion of the open lung. Horizontal expansion of this model is either derecruptment, so getting wider, or derecruptment getting narrower in the model, and has an airflow resistance here coming into the compartment. Into the compartment, and we drove this with a measured volume and fit it to a measured pressure. So we adjusted these seven parameters with a particle swarm optimization in MATLAB. So looking into this in a little more detail, we have on this vertical spring for the stiffness of the tissue, a baseline stiffness when you're at low levels of stretch. Then you hit a threshold and increase at a rate ES. And increase at a rate EF. So we got three parameters governing tissue stiffness, and that gives you this kind of peak on the pressure volume loop, which is absolutely essential in terms of optimizing ventilation because this gives you an upper bound, right, where the properties of the lung are changing on the high end. And the observant physiologist would also notice this bottom loop is a little different here, and that's due to the recruitment dynamics, which are Which are a pair of signalites. So, dashed line here is LPS injury, red is exhalation, green is inhalation. The solid lines are lavage injury, just representative mouse. And so we have a sigmoidal relationship between pressure and recruitment. So, if we started at this point on the black line, we would take an inhale until we got to the recruitment curve in terms of pressure, travel. Curve in terms of pressure, travel up that we're opening lung up. We exhale until we hit the derecruptment curve and then lose recruited alveoli as we come back down. So this gives us another three parameters. So we're up to a total of seven in the model. And this gives us the lower bound of optimal ventilation. We want to stay off that de recruitment curve. So we're maintaining our open lot. All right, so I was curious here if there's I was curious here if this model would work with different kinds of lung injury, right? So we fit it to all these different data. This is all types of ventilation pooled. And a little bit surprisingly, it did really well for control, endotoxin, and hydrochloric acid, but was kind of terrible for Lavage. Not like really terrible, but much, much worse. This could be for a couple of reasons. It's highly recruitable, so the lung is physically unstable, but there was also some recovery in lung function. Was also some recovery and lung function during the experiments. So, I think to like really nail this, you'd need to do something fancy where you were assuming different mechanics at the start of the experiment than the end, or potentially just compare to the evaluation data at the beginning of the end of the experiment. So, diving into this a little bit, if we look at ventilation type, I personally expected that a title volume of 10 was going to be better. It's like a slower breath. It's like a slower breath, a bigger range of pressures within that. But we saw the best performance with a little bit of a recruitment maneuver at the start of each epoch at a different peep. And breaking that down by injury model here, there's really not much of a difference when we look at ventilation type in control, endotoxin, and hydrochloric acid. I think what's driving that ventilation dependence is these highly unstable lodgings. These highly unstable lodging mice. So, here we get actually pretty good performance with that pet volume of six recruitment maneuvers compared to 10 and 6 without those maneuvers. All right, so the whole goal of this in the long term was to predict optimal ventilation settings. So, I could not resist trying to predict a peep that would give us the lowest driving pressure. So, that's the pressure required to push that breath. That's the pressure required to push that breath into the lung while maintaining a minute ventilation or total gas volume per minute and not having auto-peep, so allowing a full exhale at the end of every breath. And first of all, for the wild types, it's about six, which is higher than you would run, but it does appear to be optimal. So this seems about correct. I was a little surprised that these lavages were significantly lower than the other. Were significantly lower than the other groups, but I think that comes from the fact that they're so stiff at high pressures, right? Because the open lung is stiff, that the model is kind of biased against that to keep the driving pressure down. So where do we need to go with this, or where did I plan to go with this before I showed up at this conference? What my idea was here was trying models of varying complexity, trying to find the simplest thing. Trying to find the simplest thing that reproduced the behavior of interest. Really, I think now what I'm going to do is this with the addition of trying some hopefully more interesting techniques than simple deployment models. I would like to also do this same sort of analysis with decreasing fractions of this training data. So, for example, try using keep three and six and see if I can predict nine because that's going to be more. Because that's going to be more representative of what you'd actually be able to do in the clinic. Like, there's nobody's going to let us do this 15-minute minute measurement sequence on their patient. They would say, get out of my intensive career. And then I think, you know, once we've established some sort of modeling technique, then I'm going to go further into this prediction and testing and see if these actually work, if we predict something optimal for an individual. If we predict something optimal for an individual mouse, do we get better outcomes than if we just use some standard ventilation package? And in the long term, we're trying to get the clinical data to do these same sort of analyses where we would monitor ventilation when the clinician makes a change, see if we could predict what happened, knowing the actual answer to that question, but not using it to train the model. And Dave, disappointingly, I got an email today that none of the capsules are sending data. None of the capsules are sending data. They thought they were, but the only data they're getting is from ZubioMed Lab. Okay, and I just want to throw a couple slides in here since we're talking about compartment models about patient respiratory effort. Dave and Peter have done some great stuff using clinical data to like try to classify effort. But I wanted to see if we could do something with incorporating. Could do something with incorporating an active element into these compartment models and see if we could fit that to some data. It's only two slides and all this stuff. So, you know, we take some standard compartment model. This one's got a Kelvin body instead of a single nonlinear spring. And that yellow component, we assign a Gaussian distribution of pressure with a variable magnitude, timing, and width. Timing and width. So that gave us three additional parameters to identify. And if we feed in some data for mice to this, so we're feeding in a volume, calculating pressure. This no effort size side was actually recorded after we chemically paralyzed the mice so that they could not make any efforts. And we see that the model is predicting no respiratory effort. We're getting a good fit between the springs of the model. Springs of the model versus the pressure from the chest wall and the lungs of the mouse. If we turn the respiratory rate down, so we're getting a little air hunger, the mice will try to breathe, and you see this kind of chaotic looking volume signal where you've got the breaths delivered by the ventilator, and stacked on top of that is additional respiratory efforts. And we're actually able to reproduce these. Able to reproduce these by adding pulses of effort that line up with the deviation from the passive model to this combination of passive and active and summed together. And in Dave's class, one of my master's students tried to do this with a little bit of clinical data. It actually seemed to work reasonably well. So, where we're going with this one is we're trying to work up a repeatable ventilator synchrony model in the Repeatable ventilator synchrony model in the mice where we can electrically stimulate their diaphragms, have them take precisely timed efforts with the against the ventilator, and through that stimulation, we can get the same magnitude of effort each time. So we can seal everything off, record the magnitude of that effort, and then sprinkle it in at different points in the ventilator cycle and see if we can recover that information back out. All right, good. And I managed to finish earlier. So now we have questions for everyone else. Questions for everyone else. What I think I would like, this is a good transition into our afternoon activity, to get into, I think, in the future is starting off with an initial estimate and incorporating, kind of continuously incorporating fresh data into this model to update the model parameters, or perhaps some sort of entirely different model that doesn't have like harsh discontinuities in its functions. Continuities in its functions because every time I mention those, maybe it looks a little sad. Some better ways to identify model parameters instead of just running it like half a million times and waiting half an hour per animal, at which point their lung function has already changed and perhaps not the most useful information at that point. And, you know, kind of other ways to model this response to ventilation, kind of based on my physiology training. Of based on my physiology training, I view everything as a compartment model, like the lungs are a compartment. But it's clear that there might be a better way to transform non-linearly with history from pressure to volume or volume to pressure that kind of goes outside of that false constraint I put on it in my mind. And perhaps I just type this one in. There seems like there's a much more elegant way to handle recruitment. To handle recruitment with delay equations because there's a physical delay in this. You put a pressure to a straw full of milkshake, it takes time to push that milkshake through the straw. Same thing is going on in the lungs, and the reverse is true on de recruitment. So I think a really nice model would have a delay equation that's a function of time, pressure, and pressure history that kind of simulates this recruitment and do recruitment. Done two minutes early. Done two minutes early. For the DA people, the problem with one, again, is that he doesn't, you have model equations, but drivers are volume and pressure, which are entirely given by data, not a functional form. You have to do DA with a system where the Where the big part of what's driving it has no functional points, just that. So there's nothing to fit. That's why it's a challenge. One reason. So there's not a forward model. It's not like a proper set of ODEs. You have, say, four ODEs, four ODEs, but two of them have no functional form and two of them like four models of fit against with volume. Model to fit against with normal pressure. Could you like to then say the data that's incoming is considered in form of a VA update? But that's what's being done in. Right now, you're treating the data as if it were the model and you're not estimating. The estimation is all in the model parameters, other two equations. Okay, because you can. Okay, because you can you can do the you can update that's but we should look at it and I think one of the other I think one of the other things is you never get the data that you really want um you know like you can I think nicely identify the model at the peak you're at but in order to like make any sort of prediction you need to perturb the system a little bit and get away from that peak because as you go up you know it's going to stiffen due to that Go up, you know, it's going to stiffen due to that non-linear last instance, and as you go down, who knows how it's going to stiffen based on that kind of like lung collapse, which is going to take place over a long period of time. So, I think like perhaps knowing the uncertainty of parameters would tell you how you needed to adjust the ventilator in order to figure out the properties of the system. An easy problem. I should have it solved by next year. Sure, no problem. Or by the end of our period. No problem. Or running into our career. Yeah. Yeah. But you guys should tell him quick. Yeah. Especially because he's in a department with a long history of being expensive from all of them. Yeah, actually, my postdoc mentor came from Miguel. Excellent. Thank you.
