From New York, who's going to talk about Hequivarian birational types. Thank you. I'm going to share screen. Share. Screen. All right. Can you see it? Hello, hello. Yes. Yeah, we can see it. All right. So I'll be talking about joint work with Konsevich, Bastille, Trash, and Brennan Hassett. Brennan has it. So we work on an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. And the problem that's kind of classical is what are the finite subgroups of PGL3 or PGL4 up to conjugation? And of course, this is well known. There are tables. But the more interesting problem and less classical is how to classify subgroups of the cremona group. The cremona group, and already in dimension two, there is a lot of work in this direction. It goes back to Bertini, Castelnova, more recent results, classification of cyclic subgroups of the plain cremona group, and then Lang and his thesis classified osabelian subgroups. So Andolgachov and Oskovsky. In Dolgachev and Oskovsky, they have a monumental piece of work that classifies all finite subgroups of the plain cremona group up to congregation. It's a culmination of many years of research by them and others. There is also a lot of follow-up work. Some cases were missed, and so on and so on. So, the basic strategy, let me recall, of Tolgachov and Oskovsky goes like this. Goes like this. So, a barrational g action, an action on the function field can be realized as a regular action on some rational surface, a minimal rational surface. By the minimal model program, it's either a Dil Petsu surface or a conic bundle over P1. And if the anti-canonical degree is small, so cubic surface is degree 2 Dil Petzu. Cubic surfaces, degree tutel pretzel surfaces, then the action is rigid, and you can see the action via the induced action of the Picard group. And as is well known, the primitive Picar is a root letters for some bile group, so E6, E78. And so then, you know, knowing this, you can sort of pin down and write formulas, right? Formulas, right? You know, forms for these actions. For cubic surfaces, you would take a diagonal cubic surface, x cubed plus y cubed plus equal to cubic plus zero. It has a pretty large group of automorphisms. Now, but the way the proof is organized is that you sort of reduce, reduce, reduce, whenever you can equivariantly blow down combinations of curves. Combinations of curves will go down, and then you're left with P2. And it turns out that classifying subgroups of PGL3 up to conjugation in the cremona group, up to birational actions, will actually open and remained unresolved, even remains unresolved to this day. It's pretty funny. So, one of the questions raised here, for example, there are two There are two subgroups of PGL3 isomorphic to A5, alternating group. Well, they turn out to be rational to each other these actions. They're not conjugated in PGL3, but they are conjugated in the plain chromonic group. But then there are also, you know, different A6s and so on and so on. So the basic problem I want to address or mention is how to distinguish as so if you How to distinguish also equivariant by rational types of linear actions, actions and subgroups of PGM3. And then, of course, how do we distinguish linear actions from non-linear actions? And linear, again, but rationally linear. So I will review known invariants, define some new invariants, discuss some applications, and finally focus on the structure of the new invariants. So again, So again, k is algebraically closed, g is a finite group, x is a g variety. We're going to look at rational varieties. That's the most interesting case. We look at fixed points for the g-action, and then we're going to try to extract some information just from, let's say, existence of fixed points. So here is a basic fact. If the variety is rational, G is cyclic, then you have to. G is cyclic, then you have to have fixed points. If you have a birational map between smooth projected G varieties and G is abelian, then having or not having a fixed point is preserved under such maps. So we can be more precise. Suppose you have a smooth projected G variety of some dimension n. So then we can look So then we can look at characters of G, weights of G, for the induced action in the tangent space to X at a fixed point P. So we get a collection of characters, A1 up to AN, and then we can form a determinant. Okay, and the result of Freichen and Heussen says that if you have a G-equivalent. That if you have a G-equivariant blow-up of smooth projective varieties, G is abelian again. If X has a fixed point, then Y has a fixed point. And if you look at the weights in the tangent space at that fixed point, Q and Y, and to compute the determinants, then those determinants differ by plus minus one. So in other words, this is an So, in other words, this is an equivariant by rational invariant. And the way this is applied, you look at phaseful representations of an abelian group of some rank. The unique fixed point is the origin. And so you compute the characters of G appearing in the corresponding representations. So then they are equivariantly birational if and only. Are equivariantly birational if and only if the determinants differ by plus minus one. And so the condition is only meaningful if the rank of the BNN group is equal to the dimension. Otherwise, the determinant is zero. All right. So if you look at cyclic actions now on acting on projective space Pn, with n big equal than two, and cyclic actions, of course, of the same order, then they're equivariantly birational. Directivariantly by rational by this criterion. And another thing that's relevant is that any representations of a finite group, G, abelian or non-abelian, are actually stably equivariantly birational. Okay. So an invariant of stable birational Equivariance is group or gallo cohomology, if you like, group cohomology, H1G acting on the Picard group of the variety. And so under stable and under equivariant birational equivalence, H1 doesn't change and it's a stable birational invariant. Okay, so of course you can also restrict the subgroup. So, of course, you can also restrict the subgroups. It can happen that for any given group, H1 is trivial, but for some subgroup, it's non-trivial. And so, here is another result of Ogomolov and Prokhorov, that if you have a cyclic group acting on a smooth rational surface, then you can see the H1 by looking at the fixed locus. So, if the fixed locus contains, of course, for genus at least one, At least one, then that H1, the group homology, is Z mod P to the 2G. So it's a group of cyclic of order P. And of course, once you have such a curve in the fixed locus, any blow up, I mean, on surfaces, you can only blow up points. You know, the exceptional curve is a rational curve. So the curves of genus at least one and the fixed locals, they are present. One and the fixed locals they are present on every birational model, equivariant birational model. So it's Killian invariant. So now I want to discuss sort of new invariance. So let's look at the simplest case when the group that's acting is abelian. Let A be a group of characters. So we look at the fixed locus for the action. It's a disjoint union of strata. Joint union of strata alpha. And what we can do is we can pick a point in a stratum and record eigenvalues of g, so characters of g, in the tangent space at this point. So those characters or the set of characters doesn't depend on the choice of this x alpha in f alpha. And of course, you don't know which character comes first and which comes second. comes first and which comes second. So it's just a collection, a sequence of characters unordered. And so let's just formally put beta of x to be a sum over all those strata of that collection, just symbols. So you have finitely many strata, you have finitely many symbols like this. And so we're keeping no information about the geometry of alpha of the Of F alpha of the locus fixed by G. So then you consider a free abelian group on unordered tuples of characters of G. And there is one condition that comes from geometry, namely that those characters have to generate the group of characters. So we get a map from G varieties to this free abelian group, and what you would want. And what you would want to do is: well, if you want a Barational variant, consider G-equivariant blow-ups and impose relations. That's the difference between these formal sums is zero. And of course, when you think about equivariant blow-ups, you can blow up an orbit, you can blow up some loci, there are many options. But the amazing thing is that all such relations can be encoded. Can be encoded in a compact, straightforward form. Namely, we consider the quotient of the symbols group by the following relation. For all n tuples of characters A1, A2, and then B3R2Bn, the symbol A1, A2, B3, BN is equal to A1 minus A2, A2, and then you just. And then you just list all the other symbols plus a1, a2 minus a1, and then all the other symbols. If a1 is not equal to a2, and otherwise you just put a1,0, and then b3 up to bn. So if you wanted to use a1 equals a2 on the second to last line, then we would see 0, a2, and then a1, 0. 2 and then a1 0, you will see coefficient 2, but the correct formula is not coefficient 2, coefficient 1, and that's it. So a theorem is that if we look at the quotient of the free abelian group generated by such n-tuples by that relation or those two relations, then the corresponding class is a well-defined G-equivariant by rational invariant. So, and how do we prove this? Well, there is a covariant peak factorization that tells you what you have to blow up. So, you just have one basic step to look at, and you look at all options for that basic covariant blow-up, and then you compute. Now, then you ask yourself, well, what are these groups Bn of G? So, let's look at the simplest case. G is a cyclic group of order P. G is a cyclic group of order P. We have a system of linear equations and so on, so many variables. And it turns out that the Q rank of that group is P squared minus 1 over 24 plus 1. And so the moment we saw 24, we saw, wait a minute, where does the 24 come from? For B2. I mean, you're looking at symbols A1, A2, right? So A1, A2 equals to A2, A1. So clearly there is some symmetry, but 24. Geometry, but 24. So for n big requirements three, those systems of linear equations defining b n of g are highly overdetermined. And in particular, you know, the rank of b3 of g is the previous one, p squared minus 1 over 24 plus 1, and then minus p1 over 2. So p minus 5, p minus 7 over 24. And then, well, of course, you can't do it by hand. Well, of course, you can't do it by hand anymore for larger P because it's like P cube equations or something like this. So you run a computer and then suddenly there are jumps. So at 43, at 59. In other words, the Q rank is bigger than that nice close formula. And so this is just to drive home the message that these are interesting groups of invariants. Now you can introduce more relations. Can introduce more relations. You can look at the quotient by an additional relation, namely minus of minus a1 is equal to a1 and everything else, so that you can pull in and out the minus sign. And then you can look at the action on Pn of a cyclic group of order n. And so you find that the corresponding class in Bn of G is torsion and trivial in Bn minus. And torsion. And Bn minus and torsion in Bn. So, which is sort of consistent because, as we said, all these actions are equivariant for cyclic actions on B underscore and B greater than two. So, this was the first step. But, of course, we're also interested in non-abelian groups. So, G is non-abelian. Is non-abelian, so we can look at abelian subgroups of G. So then we also want to keep track of the barational type of the fixed locus or rather the locus fixed by H. So we look at barational equivalence classes, algebraic varieties of some dimension. Then we look at Galois algebras over those cases. Over those k0 for the group N, which is the normalizer of H and G divided by H. And there is some comological condition H1 that we can ignore for now, but it's just to pin down the symbols that we really want. And so we introduce first the Z module generated by symbols H in a Belan subgroup of G and subgroup of G and normalizer in G of H module H acting on some you know K which is which is an algebra and beta is a collection of characters as before here they are required to be non-zero and they're supposed to generate the characters of H so So anyway, these are the conditions: symbols HN and beta, abelian subgroup, some NA, Valo algebra, collection of characters. There is also a version with centralizers. You can run this theory with centralizers. You get a different set of generators, but and more complicated relations. But in any event, it's all the same. And now the relations, of course. Relations, of course, if you are in a non-abelian group, there is sort of a conjugation relation that's very natural. You can act by conjugation on everything inside, on H, on N, and also on the characters. And then the interesting relations are the blow-up relations. The first blow-up relation simply says if you find two characters that add up to zero, then the symbol is zero. In the more interesting And the more interesting relation is: well, the symbol HN and beta is equal to a sum of two things, where theta one is zero if B1 is equal to B2. And otherwise, it's a sum of two such symbols, where the only thing that happens, H and N remain the same, but the characters change as before: B1, B2 minus B1, and B1 minus B2. Is b1 and v1 minus b2 b2. All right, but then there is a state of two term which is zero if one of the bi's happens to be in the subgroup generated by b1 minus b2. But otherwise, it's a different symbol where there's a different appealing group h-bar which is related to h H in this form. And then there is a different beta bar. So there is one less character that shows up. And then there is also an action that's somewhat different. And the k bar is k adjoint and extra variable. And the only way to digest this sort of term theta two into this relation is simply to look at what happens when you belong. What happens when you blow up an isolated fixed point, or let's say, point with an abedened stabilizer on a surface? And that will explain the action of n-bar on k-bar. So let me go back to this. The first term, theta one, simply records two fixed points on the exceptional curve, two fixed points. And theta two expresses the fact that the exceptional curve Fact that the exceptional curve itself can have a non-trivial stabilizer, and then you see an action in the normal bundle to the exceptional curve, and there is also an action on the curve itself. And that's what's recorded in the terms theta two. Okay, so this is sort of a formal definition. Now, how do we compute the class? So, it turns out that to compute the class, you have It turns out that to compute the class, you have to first produce a model where all the stabilizers are abelian, but there is sort of a stronger condition, namely, the model that you want to look at should have a free action of G on some open U, the boundary X minus U D has to be a normal crossing stabilizer. And, and that's sort of a key condition for every G in G and every irreducible component. And every irreducible component of the boundary either G maps that component into itself or the translate of the component by G is disjoint from the component of the boundary. So this can always be achieved after equivariant blow-ups. And that's where the class is computed. And how is it computed? Well, it's going to be a sum over conjugacy classes of abelian subgroups of G. Subgroups of G. And for each such, we look at loci where the generic stabilizer of that corresponding stratum is precisely H. And then what can happen is that you can have an action on that stratum and the stratum itself could be translated. And that's encoded in this action of n on what I write here as. On what I write here as Q, well, you should think of this as the algebra corresponding to several copies of some stratum. And then the beta that corresponds to this, well, those are the generic eigenvalues of H in the normal bundle along F. And so that's how the symbol is, I mean, how the class is computed. The class is computed. And sort of the theorem is that if you do it in this way, imposing the relations that I showed you, you get a rational invariant. Now, the assumptions that I mentioned, you know, homological assumption is automatically satisfied on such a model. And so I need not have mentioned it in the first place. But again, when you define the group, you know, you have to specify what kind of Know you have to specify what kind of symbols you want to consider, and that's where the assumption one is playing a role. So, the theorem is that this is a well-defined G-equivariant by rational invariant. Now, so how to reach a standard model? So, for example, if you look at the representation of G, so there will be a facial representation will be if the origin will have, you know, the whole group G is. Will have you know the whole group G as a stabilizer, G need not be abelian. So you have to block the origin. So it turned out that one can produce explicit algorithms for linear actions on Pm and also for actions on toric varieties. And so the way it works is that one can use the theory of the continuum prochesie models of subscriptions. Continue-Prochesi models of subspace arrangements in the first instance, and there is sort of a similar theory for subgroups, arrangements of subgroups of tori. And the end result is sort of completely combinatorial formula. So you give yourself a subgroup of VGLN plus one, and then huge recursive formulas give you a class. Give you a class of that action in the Burnside group. Now, of course, the formulas are unpleasant already for actions on surfaces. So it makes sense to look at projections onto simpler groups. In other words, imposing additional relations and trying to simplify the situation so that it's actually computable. That is actually computable. So, here is one example: how to do that. You look at a set of pairs of abelian subgroups, of subgroups of a centralizer of H and G module H, so that that set of pairs is stable under conjugation. So, you conjugate and you're still inside the set of pairs. And then you can simply annihilate all. You can simply annihilate all symbols where there is an H and Y, so that H and Y do not belong to that distinguished set of pairs that you're focusing on. So in other words, you can just eliminate all the symbols that you don't like and just focus on the ones that of interest to you. Now, a priori, when you start writing generators relations, Generate as relations, you know, you're not guaranteed that, let's say, symbol with H and Y. Anyway, that once you start writing down relations, there are different groups that are showing up, you know, H bar, Y bar, and so on and so on. But you can look at those filters, we call them capital, you know, bold face H, so that for all G in the centralizer. In the centralizer of H and G with G bar in Y. Remember, Y is a subgroup of Z G of H modulo H. So if H Y is in there, then the group spanned by G and H, and then Y modulo is G bar, then it also belongs to H. Well, under this condition, it turns out that the corresponding projection. That the corresponding projection, you see, it's generated by symbols with HY in this bold face H. But the relations that show up, the only relations that you need are those that apply to these kind of triples. And that's sort of very neat because then immediately you sort of cut down on the set of relations and the set of symbols. And that allows you to compute with groups, with precision. With groups, with projections efficiently. So, well, you can also look at sort of geometric information that's being recorded, and that gives you yet another way to simplify things. So, you can look at symbols H, Z acting on K and so on and so on. For example, beta is a single character. So, that means, if it's a single character, that the stratum is actually a divisor. A divisor. So that means your group H is fixing a divisor. Now, if the induced action on that divisor is interesting, in other words, if that symbol cannot arise from a term theta 2 in relation to 2 that I told you, in other words, cannot arise by blowing up symbols sort of of hierarchical dimension. So then you get a Well, then you get a direct summit in the Burnside group. There are no linear relations between such incompressible divisor symbols. So freely generated, so if you write down such an incompressible symbol, it doesn't go away and it's not coming from anywhere. It's just standing there by itself. So I'll show you examples of these. Of course, in dimension one, every symbol is incompressible, every divider symbol. Every divisor symbol, so there is no issue really. But in dimension two, it turns out a divisor symbol is compressible if and only if y is cyclic and k is a function field of p1. So in particular, let's go back to the result of Bogomolov and Proherov. If your fixed locus contains a curve of higher genus, so for some abelian subgroup of G, Subgroup of G, then the corresponding symbol is incompressible. Because then you have this sort of extra action on the P1, and that's incompressible. All right. So then you would, okay, we have these invariants that are sort of complicated to compute. We want to see how they behave with respect to natural geometric constructions. For example, you could. Geometric constructions. For example, you could look at some G vector bundle over a variety, you can projectivize the G vector bundle, you know, you can look at families twisted by the G action, things like this. So the simplest case is that if X is a supposed projective G variety of some dimension, and then you pick G linearized line bundles over this, so like a toric bundle over X, if you like, then Then, I mean, of course, you want to pick an action that's generically free on the projectivization. So we don't assume that g acts freely on x. And then there's this assumption too that's also in the picture. So then there is a sort of a close formula for the class. Again, somewhat unpleasant. And I'm going to show you on the next slide an example of such a formula. Such a formula. So, again, that is of a class that we computed. So, let's look at the simplest action. So, S3 has a two-dimensional representation. You project the vice visits, you get an action of S3 on P1. And then you can also act trivially on P1 by the cyclic group of order 5. So, you have an action of G, C5 times S3 on P1. All right, now let's pick two line bundles. Now let's pick two line bundles. One is going to be trivial with no action, and the other one is going to be, you know, of one with some non-trivial character of C5. And then you projectivize the sum of two line bundles over P1. So you get a surface, a P1 bundle over P1. And then you would like to compute the class for the action of G, now it's generically free, on this surface. So our vibration formula is this. Our vibration formula is this thing. So, okay, you write it down term by term by term. And then you focus on those where you see an S3 action on P1. As I explained, those divisorial symbols are incompressible. So you have two of those in the picture. So we have two terms, the stabilizer C5 and the non-trivial S3 action on. Non-trivial S3 action on P1, and so we can just project onto these. And so after we project, we get a sum of these two terms. There are no relations. The corresponding class is non-zero. And now you see, we picked the representation of C5. And if we pick a different one, we pick an epsilon, you know, plus. In epsilon, you know, plus minus one, or an epsilon plus minus two, the corresponding classes in this group will be different. So we just produced two non-birational actions of C5 times S3 on a rational surface, on a P1 bundle over P1. Okay, so now let's look at linear actions, the problem we started out with. So the basic term. So, the basic terminology here is that a faithful representation is intransitive if it's reducible, transitive if it's irreducible. Then there are some reducible representations to the properties that G has a normal subgroup, G prime, so that the corresponding representation for G prime is actually reducible. But so the G mod G prime per me. So the G mod G prime permutes the G prime representations. So this is called imprimitive. And then there is a primitive case, neither this nor that. So let's look at the intransitive actions. So the one that are reducible. So in particular, so we could have a like a fixed point on. So we are looking at actions on P2. So we could have a fixed point. So a fixed point would mean that the one-dimensional A fixed point would mean that's a one-dimensional subspace, and that is a two-dimensional representation. Okay, so well, how do we classify those? Of course, the finite subgroups of GL2, you classify them by looking at finite subgroups of PGL2, which are Vs, cyclic dihedrally 4S4E5. And then you have a binary extension, so you can lift some into GL2. And then there is some cyclic group here. So G is sort of a product. So, G is sort of a product. So, the other class of actions, they're all classified. So, transitive and primitive, it's sort of an extension of C3 by Z mod n squared, or an extension of S3 by Z mod n squared, and there are two more cases like this. The thing to remember here is that there is an abelian subgroup of rank two, like Z mod n squared or Z mod n squared, that's in the picture. That's in the picture. And then the most interesting case, the primitive actions, A5 acting on P2 projectivization of a three-dimensional presentation of A5, and then like P still2F7 and then A6. Those are the primitive actions. Now, if you try to distinguish these actions using the classical invariants, I mean, what are the standard approaches? One approach is by rational rigidity. Birational rigidity. So then you would need to classify all the covariant birational maps. And the other one is H1G acting on Picar. Now, in our case, Picar is cyclic Z, and so the group homology is not applicable. So in this case. But Barational rigidity has been studied in detail. 2019, this is a recent result by Sarkovich. It says that if you have a finite subgroup. Says that if you have a finite subgroup of PGL3, then P2 is birationally rigid if and only if G is transitive and not isomorphic to A4 or S4. In fact, the paper is, the result is more precise. There's a notion of super-rigidity and rigidity, and essentially it gets a complete picture. So, in particular, there are two actions of A5 on P2. 5 on P2, they're not conjugated, but are conjugated in the cremona group. But there are also two actions of PSO2F7, and it turned out that they're not conjugated in the two-dimensional cremona group because those actions are super rigid by rationally. And Sarkovich can answer that. So, in other words, this approach settles sort of the primitive actions. But the other actions, transitive and primitive, that are Transitive and primitive, that of more complicated from the perspective of rational rigidity. However, these groups always have a subgroup, a Beland subgroup of rank two. And then we can try to distinguish the actions by using the Reichstein-Hussen approach by computing the determinant for the action. And so once you have like Zn plus Zn, for example, this n equals five or n big equals n. n equals five or n big equals n seven and you compute the determinants for those actions you can produce non-borational actions of such g the worst case from the perspective of borational originity is when you have a fixed point a g fixed point you can blow it up you can continue to blowing up it's sort of complicated and so it's uh here where sort of the new approach for the symbols is most effective all right so our All right, so our group is a cyclic group of order n times G prime. G prime is a subgroup of GL2. And so, well, if G prime itself is cyclic, well, then we have a group of abelian group of rank 2 acting on P2. And so we know exactly when such actions are rational. Now, if G prime is dihedral, A4 is 4 or A5, and the N is such that the Euler function is at least 3. the Euler function is at least three, then the corresponding g Cn times G prime admits non-birational actions. So how do we see that? Well, so let's look at the two-dimensional representation of our G prime and let's twist it by a character of the Cn. So we get a generically free action of G on a projectivization of a trivial representation of plus. Of a trivial representation plus this twisted representation. It has a fixed point. Of course, you see the fixed point. It's this trivial representation. So we have to blow it up because G is not abelian. When you blow it up, you get precisely a predictorization of two line bundles over P1. And we have a closed formula computing the corresponding class. And it tells us that we can extract, sort of, you know, use. You know, using fibrations filtrations, you extract the class of CN stabilizer G prime acting on P1. And so, once you have a G prime on P1 that's not cyclic, dihedral, you know, A4, A5, so then you get incompressible symbols. And as before, when epsilon and minus epsilon, you pick a different epsilon, so that they're not equal up to plus minus one. Plus minus one, then you find non-birational examples. So intransitive actions, you know, admit of non-birational. So as soon as epsilon is not equal to plus minus epsilon prime. Now, you can also do it in dimension three, which is totally inaccessible by rational rigidity so far. Barational rigidity so far. So, again, we can look at the cyclic group of some order, let's say, bigger than seven, group G Cn times G prime, where G prime this time is a subgroup of GL3. And then you get embeddings of G into PGL4, which are not congregated in the three-dimensional cremona group. We do exactly the same thing: three-dimensional representation of G prime plus trivial representation. Representation vibration filtration produces two symbols the stabilizer Cp and G prime acting here. And now the key result is that you have to analyze actions on surfaces. The divisors here are surfaces that are incompressible. And for PSL2F7, you know, the actions on P2 cannot be obtained by blowing up a point or a P1 on a three-fold because these groups simply don't act on P1. act on you know p1s and for a five and plus four action you have to do a little bit of extra work so distinguish you know what you can get by obtaining let's say a p1 in a threefold uh do you get something that's parational to a linear action p2 or not anyway so and then you use the fact that incompressible symbols are linear independent Symbols are linearly independent. So, another important thing is how to distinguish linear actions from non-linear actions. So, let's go back to the case that we looked at C2 times S3 acting on P2. So, we've computed that the corresponding class will contain two. Two incompressible symbols. Remember, we had we played with C5, but we can also play with C2. And then the two symbols plus minus that we got are simply the same symbol with multiplicity two. On the other hand, you can look at the G action on a quadric surface. You can also look at the G action. You also have an action on a Del Pets surface of degree six. A surface of degree six, a toric surface. But let's look at the quadric model. So, okay, presented as a double cover of P2, S3 will permute the coordinates V0, V1, V2, and the central C2 will exchange the sign on W. So there are no G-fixed points, but there is a conic which stabilizes the central C2, and on that conic, we have And on that conic, we have a non-trivial action of S3. So that produces the class C2S3 acting on P1, but only one such class. And so on the P2 model, we have two such classes. On this model, quadric model, we have only one such class. And so those actions are not birational because the corresponding symbols are incompressible. So there are similar situations. Situations: So Banay and Kunaga studied the S4 action on P2 and DP6, A5 actions on P2, projectivization of the three-dimensional presentation, and DP5, degree 5 to Petzo surface. But there are also new situations. I want to mention the result by Brandon Hasset, Andrew Krash, myself, that there is a rational cubic fourfold. This is Emote 6 action that's not linearizable, that's not birational to a That's not birational to a linear action of Z mod 6 on P4. And of course, the covariant birational geometry or just, you know, there's no action, birational geometry in dimension four, especially cubic fourfolds, is sort of inaccessible with current techniques. So now I want to talk about toric actions. So, well, this relates some sort of to the work of Ballard and Lamarche, you know, maybe you've LaMarche, you know, maybe you've heard La Marsh's talk yesterday. So let's look at actions of a group G on, let's say, three-dimensional tor, right? Well, all such actions factor through C2 times S3 times C2 or C2 times S4. Now, we've actually seen this action. So you take a DP6, it has a C2 times S3 action, and then you take DP6 times P6. You tam TP6 times P1. So that's your rational threefold. And on the P1, you have the plus-minus one. And so, well, you get the reaction of this group. And it's, okay, known, understood. It's realized on dp6 times P1. More interesting is the action of, there are actually three different actions of this group, completely different actions, labeled C, S, and P. Labeled C, S, and P in a paper by Kuniewski. So you can act on P1 times P1 times P1. You can act on the blow up of P3 in four points and six lines through this point. So this is M06 bar. And then of course on M06 bar. So S4 permutes the coordinates and P3 and C2 is the cremona involution. Or you can act on this hypersurface in P1 to the 4. So S4 would permute H1. Would permute x1, x2, x3, x4, and then the remote 2, the C2 exchanges x and y's. So let's look at type C. So, and let's look at the subgroup generated by these matrices. Well, it so happens that the corresponding projective equivariant complectification of the torus T. Of the torus T has a property that H1 G prime acting on the Picard group is zero for all G prime and G. In other words, there is no homological obstruction preventing this action from being equivariantly birational to linear action. However, our new invariants show that the G action is not linearizable in this case. In this case. Now, the other two types, the type S and P, again, in Konyaskis labeling. So let's look at the subgroup generated by these two. It's simply Z2 plus Z2 sitting in this C2 times S4. So the same subgroup, Z2 plus Z2, embeds into this type and into that type. All right? So then it turns out that the H1G acting on Picar is actually Z mode. Acting on Picar is actually Zmod2. And so, because there is this homological abstraction, the action is not stably peneurizable. However, if you compute our class in the Burnside group, it's trivial. So what we're seeing is that for surfaces, the class that you compute actually encodes the H1 because, well, having a non-trivial H1, it means you have a curve of genus at least one. At least one in the fixed locus, and those classes are incompressible and will necessarily show up in the computation of the class of the g x1 x. But in dimension bigger equal than three, the classes sort of the invariants completely diverge. In fact, you can show that stably any G variety, you know, the corresponding class x. corresponding class x times p1 to the l x times p to the l is zero in the burnside group n plus l, where l is sufficiently large depending only on the group g and not on the action of the group g. And so we can take l to be the maximum order of an element of g so while the comological invariants prevent you know stable by rationality those symbols groups that are sort of sent Symbols groups they're sort of sensitive but not stably. So stably they just all end, they vanish. So you should think of these symbols invariant maybe as analogues of, I don't know, intermediate Jacobians that distinguishing rational threefolds from non-rational threefolds, but stably don't make a difference. And of course, it would be interesting to. Yuri, can I ask a question real quick? Just thinking Yuri, can I ask a question real quick? Sure. So, is that analogy precise in any way, or is it just moral heuristic? Sort of Jacobian? It's not, it's just moral. There is no, I don't see a direct translation, but the next sentence I wanted to say was that it would be interesting to try to connect these symbols and variants to what you guys see in drive categories. I mean, yeah, you know, those exceptional collections and things like this for G-actions. Now, I guess, again, we can look at sort of rationality over non-closed fields, but we can also look at varieties over closed fields with G actions. And you can look at G equivariant versions of everything inside. Everything inside. And then you can ask yourself: well, how are those linearizability or abstractions to these actions being linearizable? How do they show up in the right categories and how do they show up in this language of single letters? So, thank you. This is something that I think needs to be explored now. Now, after these sort of geometric applications, we can look at simply the combinatorial structure that's staring us in the face. So we can simply forget the field theoretic informations, forget that there is an action of some normalizer on some stratum, and simply keep a subgroup in the picture. So let's look at the combinatorial symbols group. The combinatorial symbols group is going to be generated by symbols H beta. So H is an abelian subgroup of G. Y is a subgroup of centralizer module H. Beta is a sequence of non-zero elements generating the characters of H of lengths at most N, N is the dimension, N is with N, and modular relations. So the first one, of course, you can reorder the characters in beta. The second one is conjugation. The second one is conjugation. You can conjugate everything inside. And then the blow-up relations look like this. If you find two characters, B1, B2, the sum is zero, then it's zero. And otherwise, theta one, theta two, exactly as before, simply no fields anywhere. Just discrete combinatorial data, like pure group theory, finite groups. Okay, so H-bar is simply the kernel. Bar is simply the kernel, y bar is a preimage, and well, you know, the characters beta are simply restrictions to H bar of characters of beta. Okay, so then of course you can look at the thing with the geometric information here, y is acting on k, and forget the geometric information. So you get a map from the full Bernstein group to this combinatorial. Group to this combinatorial Burnside group. It's a homomorphism. And all the constructions that you do geometrically, you know, filters, restrictions, products, vibrations, everything, everything you like, you get automatically in the combinatorial symbols group. Now, when G is abelian, you can sort of forget all stabilizers. Stabilizers, proper subgroups of G, and simply focus on symbols where you have the maximum stabilizer, namely G. Okay, in other words, you look at pairs H, Y, where H is G and Y is trivial. That's the only thing that you can have. And so once you annihilate all the symbols with H proper subgroup of G, you get the group B and G. You get the group B and G that was introduced at my work with Konsevich and Stun. And so you have a diagram you can project onto G and trivial when G is abelian. You can this, you can project onto Bn, you can project this onto B Cn and so on and so on. All right. Now, it turns out that when you look at the minus version of Bn of G, Of bn of g, so g is abelian, then b n minus of g tensor q is actually equal to homology of a certain congruent subgroup of G L and Z. And there is a Steinberg representation here, and then there's a sort of orientation representation. So in other words, the groups that we The groups that we introduce in equivariant by rational geometry suddenly are connected to automorphic forms, in particular for n equals 2 and the action of a cyclic group Z mod P. Remember, I showed you the dimension B2 Z mod P, it was, you know, P squared minus one over 24 plus one. Minus one over 24 plus one. So that's actually the dimension of cusp form for the congruence subgroup gamma one of p. So, and that's established via explicit relation to Manny's symbols. So the conclusion is that there are these new invariants for G-actions. They can provide non-trivial information. Non-trivial information. We can now distinguish actions we were not able to distinguish previously. And there is sort of incredibly intricate internal structure. We're already the first piece, this piece B N of G, you see, being connected to homology of arithmetic groups, these B N of G groups, tensor Q, have hacker operators and so on and so on. And these other groups, B C N of G. B C N of G, well, they're even more complicated. All right. So, and investigating their structure, you know, and all those geometric operations that we've introduced, what they do on these groups, B C N of G in particular, even for G non-abelian, that sort of exciting venue to pursue, exciting direction to pursue. So, that's it. Pursue. So that's it. That's it for me. Thank you. Do we have any questions for Yuri? Maybe, do you have any intuition for the connection between these burnside groups and the structure of drive categories? Structure of drive categories? I don't actually. I really don't. So the only thing that comes to mind is that the Burnside groups you see, they're focused on loci with non-trivial stabilizers. When you do your derived categories and whatever you do equivariantly, they must be visible, you know, Skype, scraper sheaves, this and the other. So at least I see the ingredients, you know, how these things are associated. The ingredients, you know, how these things are assembled. But then what happens? That I think remains to be studied. Thank you. Okay, there are no more questions. Let's thank Yuri again. And we'll meet back at 10:30, so half an hour. Okay, thanks, Yuri again. Thank you.  I think they're like a lot of things. But that's what it was. It was P31 of a 4.1 of the P13. So it was P36 plus P1. Is that what you're talking about? That was one of them, but the other one. But it's probably from the end. Yeah, that's right, I guess. Of the representation of everything, yeah, so we're gonna have to do it.
