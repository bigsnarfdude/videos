So thank you for all for the organizers and for giving me a chance to present my talk. So I'm happy to be here. So let me give my talk. So the title is recent progress of quantum computing at Quito and it includes hardware and architecture and applications. Applications. So, this is the outline of my talk. So, I explain the background first, and then I explain the content complete activity and digital. And so, then I also talk about content inside technology, digital animal. So, first of all, I explained the history of computing technology at At 202. So we still work on a high-point type of performance computer, but the end of large loading, the improvement of computing performance is slowing you down. So there are a lot of activities to improve the performance. So including use of new architecture. So in fact, digital developed digital aneurysm are are digital architecture specialized for combatology of For combinatorial optimization program about hype ERT goal. Moreover, we are working on search and development of quantum computing. As you know, quantum computing now draws a lot of attention. So we recently made a press release on our new video. On our new feature, computing at their service. So this new computing platform forms its duty to use and help customers to resolve social problems in various areas. And our customers can use various computing resources, including a high-performance performance computing, a quantum inspired computing, and in the future, real quantum computing. Quantum computing. So this one explains a classification of quantum computers. As you know, there are two types. So quantum gate-based systems and IGM machine-based systems. Meaning everyone knows the categorized uh categorization. So so I skip uh explaining it in detail. It in detail. So, what could it do with working on it? Superconducting device, diamonds in device, and CMOS-based hygiene as well. And digital animal. Okay, so first let me explain gate-based quantum computing. Here, I explain the problem we are going to solve is quantum computers. So, the Computers. So that problem expected to be solved using quantum computers that requires an enormous number of calculations. Such advancements are related to quantum chemistry and complex financial systems. So especially for quantum chemistry, as you know, so you should know the energy state of bacteria using Of material accuracy using quantum comput quantum mechanics in order to predict property of new materials. So, such predictable size calculations using quantum mechanics are so difficult with classical computers. So, quantum computers are expected to solve such problems. So, this is our unlucky strategy. We cover all area of the We cover all areas of technology from contact devices to application with value reading by research institutions. So we basically put emphasis on software technologies and as for hardware, so we work on few different technologies through we can use. So we have also started to develop a new application with end users by And users by using a newly developed content simulator. So here I explain each of these efforts. First, we started a research collaboration of superconducting cubic technology with Professor Nakagura Kohiken and the University of Tokyo. So in 2021, In 2021, we launched the RQC Q2 Collaboration Center to strengthen the collaboration. So objectives to the collaboration are to develop hardware and software technology to realize the quantum computers automated as a one-size-quit and to develop applications using a prototype quantum computer. Computer. And he also welcomed diamonds in technology with TU Direct. This method will aim at future verticals. So combining light and skin. So pursuing operation at relatively high temperatures in a large scale. So in this technology, impurities such as nitrogen are introduced into an into a diamond The diamond to form a qubit. So, this technology does not require a large grid and needed to scale up. And so, it is susceptible to cross-dogenoids because but because it can perform perform operation between separated qubits and each light. Recently, we have derived a logical qubit using this technology, and the results were published in nature. So we are still working on this research state, but we will work on it over a long time. So, next, let me explain the research on Let me experiment research on software. While we embark on the document or algorithm for application such as quantum chemistry, we also have to deal with errors of quantum meet for meaningful computation. First, we launched collaboration with Quantum Benjamin Inc., so now by ESA Technology Inc., uh uh about error mitigation technologies. About error-mitigated technologies, including a dynamite compilable. So we skip the today, but this kind of LM integration technologies are very important for computing using NISCO devices. So, in addition, we started a joint research with process circuitry of all sabbatical requests for error. Posability first of error correction technology in 2020. And so recently in 2021, we established a 32-content computing joint research division at Osaka University. The objective is to develop a complete set of source tutorials for auto-relevant quantum computing. And recently we have succeeded in simulating efficient quantum error correction. Efficient code error collection using digital animal in a surface code. So, from now on, as I will like to show the database news from our quantum lab. So, first this fall, we will release a 54 qubit quantum computer from a recent LQC Quick Collaboration Center. Uh it will be used for development of applications. For development of application in industry. So, and this could application could such as quantum chemistry and finance and drug discovery. The quantum system we are going to release includes all technology of these layers. So, quantum libraries and quantum platform, energy meter, and quantum computer. Literally and portal computer itself. So, here let me explain a little bit about our chip structure of this superconducting qubit chip. So, this image is a kind of a cross-sectional image, as you can see. So, our interconnect is from a back. So, it's a kind of 3D conduct structure. It's stiff design. This chip design. So we can make it larger by just finding the 64 qubit chips for the example. Last year, we developed the variable largest graph-cutter computer simulator using our set of conducting technology for Hugaku. So so so also uh we we are working on um we are working on contin continuous enhancement. So while the simulator we released last year has 76 qubits, we are going to enhance it to 40 qubits this year. And we are already making collaboration with our customers and having challenges for application discovery with telemetry and carpent around the world. Around. Furthermore, we are also working on new type simulators for larger scale. And also, we are working on developing a hybrid contact product on cloud. This will enable similar access to contaminant device and simulator and focus nation means quantum driver means. Means that content drivers need and web services. At one of the key technologies, we have developed a kind of a computing workload broker. This technology can determine appropriate devices depending on a user requirement, such as cost and accuracy, and competent session time, for example, on behalf of actual users. So next I would like to create our new quantum computing architecture. Here I explain the background of this. So as you know, the quantum computer always suffering quantum errors. So quantum error correction is a key factor to solve this problem to generate reliable quantum computers. However, However, a quantum error correction requires a large amount of physical qubits and gate operations. Currently, each company is developing a NISC and it does not have enough physical qubits to collect quantum errors. So it is useful only limited applications, whereas effect of errors are small. Errors are small. In school devices, if we number of qubits we create it, the practical use does not increase. So because the effect of error becomes even greater. On the other hand, if error FTQC pt quantum computer is more than um one hundred million PDF units, so quantum error correction will enable quantum computers to Front of computers to demonstrate their true performance. However, so after time, when the number of people qubit is not so large, so there may be a change where the number of people qubits is small, and the calculation can be obvious even on our laptop. So, in the early ATQC era, around Error around 10,000 qubits, the performance of quantum computers cannot be demonstrated by both NISC and execution. For this reason, an architecture that matches this error is required. So, in our quantum computing architecture, we introduce new types of He introduced a new type of page rotation gate into a reversal quantum gate set for the first time to reduce a difficult qubit and gate operations. So a quantum computer has a diversal quantum gate set, so C0, N8 and T. And all calculations are performed by uh combining logical states. Combining logical gates that are not affected by errors. In quantum computing, the operation for phase rotation gate that rotates the quantum state at a certain angle is essential. And many T-gate operations are required for this operation. In addition, quantum error correction for T-gate requires Team gate requires an enormous number of optical qubits and gate operation. Which is a major problem. So therefore, instead of the gate of the conventional architecture, a paid rotation gate is introduced to perform all quantum calculations. This deduces the This reduces the number of difficult qubits to 110 and the gate operations to 120 is an equal node. So here, we show a new method for such a page rotation. So there are two technical points. First, by rotating a multiple qubit directly, we generate much less states. For me, I will face our setup. Here, to minimize errors, for me generate initial state, it's one logical qubit, it's four physical qubits. Then, we make redundant logical qubits of self-score. Second, by internet thing at this analytical state into quantum side, and then we can note. We can notice the total content state of sine. So, however, by the measurement outcomes here, this circuit can repeat in total at setup by 50% chance or totation at minus setup and repeat means the opposite direction by 50% chance. And if the rotation is a wide direction, we can end this operation. This operation. But if the rotation is opposite direction, then we have to cancel the direct rotation and then rotate by theta in the wide direction. So we have to apply two set rotation in the next direction. So if the second rotation is in the right direction, we can end this operation at this point. Point. But if the rotation is also opposite direction, so that results in three center rotations in the opposite direction in total. Then, the third trial, we need to cancel this out and donate an additional setup in the next trial with result in the fourth setter in the third trial. In the circuit variable. So, in this way, but the failure rotation may require many rotating operations if the operation failure continues. But as the probability of continuous failure is quite low, so we can succeed this operation with two trials, two aggregates. And with this techniques, These techniques we can achieve a high efficiency, so that is one base of the critical error rate. And we also achieve high efficiency. So we succeed at this population in averages of 2 to 9 hours. And so, further, we estimate the calibration performance assuming the quantum. Performance assuming the quantum computer is 10,000 critical qubits. So this graph shows the correct motion speed on the vertical axis and the number of logical qubits on the horizontal axis. So the correct mission speed means the number of quantum gate operations per unit time and its property as a value. Then our architecture is one. It's one. So, first, conventional QC architecture has a trade-off between kidney transmit and the number of critical qubits, and we can depict at the bottom. On the other hand, our architecture outperforms the conventional architecture in both calculations and number. Calculation speed and number of total qubits. Actually, a shift for logical qubits can be constructed. And this is about 100,000 times performance of the graphical computer, which can simulate up to 47 logical qubits. Initially, 10,000 qubits can surpass the classical computer with our classical computer with our architecture. So so it is waiting for the arrival for vermilion cubits. So this makes it possible to dynamically anti-rate the application of particle quantum computers. So this is a list of recent publications from our among them so I am my So hi, I'm myself, but working on these two papers. So number two is about efficient measurement techniques for quantum chemistry. And number three is about the direct concept of quantum elementification techniques for NISC with application to quantum chemistry. And in the future, Uh we uh we are going to do these uh large scale simulators and actual matching successively, so in order to solve so uh societal problems. So more concretely, we will release a high-speed and large-scale 40-qubit quantum simulator. And in this year, so we will release superconducting quantum computer with 64 qubit that we can cooperation center. And in 2025, we will scale up to 256 qubits and implement the quantum error data collection scheme. So also in 2026, we will further scale up to larger than 1,000 qubits. Okay, so next Okay, so next next uh technique explaining the quantum inspired technology, digital analyzer. So here are techniques when the strengths of the digital annealer. So it expected that it will take some time to apply quantum computing to particular particle problems. So we developed DA as quantum inspire system. As quantum-inspired systems repeated special for combinatorial optimization problems. So, DNA has been used by many users to do a technical specialty since it launched the market in 2018. So, we have several key technologies having advantages. So, this figure on the left side explains the one of the output. The one of the outputization techniques. And because of G technological advantage, EA is now used for customer business in various areas, including manufacturing and delivery planning. So here is another one for digital ALDA. Since Quito Laboratory announced the first time of the digital ALDA in 2016, it has continued to evolve through It must continue to evolve through RNDN service cycles and the commercial service using dedicated hardware released in 2018 as the second generation DN. In the third generation of 2020, a hybrid system in training making a technique to solve Yale Val problem achieved support for 100k bit, significantly exceeding 1k bit. Exceeding the 1kbit in the second generation. And the latest variable for now is the fourth generation. So just with this dust level, which achieves up to 10 times faster speed compared to the serial generation. It distinctive large-scale animal core. So in this case, the DL service by incorporating research incorporating our research and recent research results. So the processing of the higher order term is one of the research topics for the fifth-degree LDA. And we are considering providing value access to the interlock time between this year. Between this here So sorry, so uh I I don't know that I have f much time now. So so I will skip skip this so so look so this is just like to make the concluding remarks. So we work on research and debate of quantum computing in order to solve a societal problem. in order to solve a societal problem in the future. And our 54 qubit superconducting copying system will be deleted so we make some more time for hotel computers to become thinkable of solving real world problems. And we continue to develop technology to realize a particle quantum computer and work together with end users to develop applications. To develop its applications. And Ether Anita, a quantum inspired technology, is already vertical use and has a lot of use cases. And we continue to help customers provide by using DA and HPC technologies. So thank you for your attention. Do I turn off recording or recording?
