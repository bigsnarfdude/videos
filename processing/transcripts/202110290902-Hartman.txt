Yesterday. But other than that, so I'm going to talk about different aspects so there won't really be much overlap. The motivation for this is, of course, to understand all of these mysteries surrounding averaging and quantum gravity that have come up in the last few years. I'm going to basically skip the motivation for this audience, but let me just say it briefly. It briefly. So, Maloney and Witten calculated the partition function of 3D gravity maybe 15 years ago now. And they did that through this sum over, sorry, one sec. They did a sum over BTZ black holes. So, this is a semi-classical attempt to calculate the partition function of pure gravity. And they were able. And they were able to do the sum. However, the answer that they got didn't make sense as a quantum theory. It had a continuous spectrum. And moreover, it was discovered later by others that the sum was producing a, well, it is also non-unitary. Now, you can try to fix it up and get rid of some of the obvious non-unitarities, but there's some difficult non-unitarities. Some difficult non-unitarities remain. So there's some negative contribution to the density of states. And I think the interpretation these days is that the fact that the spectrum is continuous is quite possibly related to some sort of ensemble average interpretation. Of course, we also have now various factorization puzzles that we've been discussing. And this is a distinct problem, but it's A distinct problem, but it's related. And I think a strong possibility is that these two problems need to be solved together by understanding these issues of averaging. Now, I want to say from the outset that I don't think there's any reason to believe that realistic theories have averaging. I don't think it's required by things like replica wormholes that don't have a factorization problem. Nonetheless, we can use. Nonetheless, we can use averaging as a tool, and that's how I want to think about it. We can average stuff by hand because we feel like it. We're free to do that. And what we're trying to do by doing averaging is to try to project out some UV sensitivity. We're trying to project out some microscopic details in order to be able to control calculations and effective field theory. And our And our task as I see it is to understand, is to view averaging as our tool and to understand how we can use that tool to be able to make better, to be able to do better and to do better calculations using effective field theory. Okay, so the toy model that I'm discussing is related to the Norrain duality that Alex discussed yesterday. The simplest version of this duality Version of this duality is a two-dimensional CFT of just n-free bosons averaged over moduli space. Okay, so this is not something we would normally talk about in CFT, but we can do this average over moduli space. And the result has a holographic interpretation as this sort of exotic theory that's a bit like 3D gravity. Like 3D gravity. If you think, if you take 3D gravity and you replace SL2R in 3D gravity by U1 to the N, then this is the theory that you're led to. So it's a U1 cross, it's an abelian turn-Simons theory, but with this extra prescription that you're supposed to take that turn-Simons theory and sum over topology, as we do in gravity. So that story is the background, but I'm going to talk about two things. First of all, the problem of adding interactions. And this is a recent paper that I wrote with two students, Zhengkai Dong and Yikun Zhang. And then in the second part of the talk, I want to go back and discuss, try to answer the question, why? Try to answer the question why this duality works. And that's work in progress. It could still sort of fall apart, but I want to tell you, I think I have something to say about it. So I want to tell you why I think it's work, what it is. What's the mechanism that's making this work? Okay, so this, so to add interactions, what we're going to do is instead of talking about free bosons, we're going to talk about WZW models. So on the CFT side, So, on the CFT side, we now have W's W models averaged over deformations. The gravity side is similar to U1 gravity, but now coupled to matter. Why bother doing this generalization? Well, first of all, this is an interacting CFT. So, we can try to study properties of an interacting theory that seems worthwhile. In particular, Worthwhile. In particular, this theory has central charge greater than the number of currents. That's well, theories with central charge less than the number of currents have very special properties. When you take it bigger than the number of currents, they're slightly less special. So in a sense, you could think of this theory as maybe a little bit more gravity-like, although it's certainly. Although it's certainly still not gravity. By adding matter, in principle, you can study more of the kinds of questions that we're interested in. Questions like what happens with correlation functions? Factorization of subregions. Say you insert some two operators on two sides of some wormhole or something. So there's just more probes that you can throw at this theory, although I'm not really going to be talking. Although I'm not really going to be talking about those generalized probes in this talk. Tom, can you just clarify when you say C, I just don't remember about 2D CFTs. If you say that C is greater than the number of currents, is the theory still rational? Is it still a rational CFT? Let's see. It's still solvable. It's not rational. It's not rational. So, like, even the free boson at irrational radius is not rational, right? Well, okay, yeah. It's a little bit like that. So, it's still solvable. I mean, still solvable in the sense that somehow you have this higher, you have this extended chiral algebra that determines everything you want. This does not have the so. This does not have, so this theory does not have a huge, it does not have a huge Kaura algebra, but it has parafermionic currents, which are not ordinary symmetries, but are still enough to make the theory solvable. Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, thanks. Sorry, Tom, another quick question. Can you make C parametrically larger than the number of currents, or is there some kind of bound or you have to scale both of them in some way? Or you have to scale both of them in some way, or this is the bound. Oh, sorry, okay. Yeah, so it can be n squared. Yeah, so the theory, let me introduce this deformed WZW model in some more detail. So before we do a deformation, the central charge of the WZW model runs from n to n times n plus 2. Now, it has a level k. If you set the level to one, then this is. Then this is a theory of free bosons. Okay, so if you set the level to one, then we're talking about free bosons at a point of enhanced symmetry in the moduli space of the free boson. So if you set k to one, then you're just redoing the average of the free boson from the point of view of this special point in moduli space and viewing the rest of moduli space as a deformation of that. But you have to get back the same answer. You'd have to get back the same answer. So, if we take the, so this theory has exactly marginal deformations. The marginal deformations are current-current deformations. Okay, so these are the exactly marginal operators. You just take a J from the Cartan and a J bar from the Cartan, and that gives you something exactly marginal. So you end up with N squared moduli, n squared exactly marginal fields. They have to be in the cartan. Fields. They have to be in the cartan because you can only add currents that commute, or you're going to end up turning on anomalous dimensions. So the deformed WZW model, the original WZW model has this enormous SUN level K current algebra. The deformed WZDW model has only a U1, has only an abelian current algebra, U1 to the N by U1 to the N. So it's the same symmetry as. The n. So it's the same symmetry as the free boson. And in fact, it's closely related to the free boson. So this is why you can still solve the theory. You can take those unbroken currents and bosonize them. And when you, the way to, the way to explain the resulting theory is as a coset. Okay, so I. Okay, so this is the coset representation. This is a coset representation of the WZW model. This is true before doing the deformation, but it's going to make it easy to do the deformation. So you just take your CFT, you mod out by the currents, and then you put the currents back in as free bosons. When you do that, they don't decouple. Okay, so it's a, this is, I'm not just. Okay, so it's a. This is, I'm not just gonna, I'm not just decoupling the free bosons. That's not what happens. They don't decouple because there's a non-trivial orbifold. Okay, so this, this, you have to mod out by the by a non-trivial orbifold. So it's not that they just, it's not that you just have a free boson sector. They're coupled by the orbifold. This first factor here is known as, so this is a coset model. So, this is a coset model. This is known as the parafermion. So, parafermion sounds exotic, is just referring to this CFT factor here. So, these are the parafermions. Then we have the bosons, and we're doing an orbifold. This coset was, it was mostly described long ago. The coset was mostly described long ago, although. Was mostly described long ago, although it wasn't quite, it was never quite, the coset was never quite written down. So we did that in our recent paper. So now what we're going to do is to calculate the average torus partition function. So what do we average over? Well, we're averaging over the modulized space of deformations. Okay, so the moduli space of the deformed WZW model is this thing here. The numerator is easy. Okay, so the numerator, well, this part of it is easy. Okay, so this part is the lattice of the bosonic sector. Okay, so you have this bosonic sector, which you can deform in the usual way that you deform the free boson. Usual way that you deform the free boson by changing the lattice. This part is complicated. Okay, the dualities of the WZW model are not the dualities are not those of the free boson because there's all sorts of extra stuff that you need to preserve under duality, that is, all the OP coefficients. And in fact, the volume of this moduli space. Moduli space is infinite. Okay, so we can't, in any obvious way, we can't just do the average over the moduli space of the deformer theory. But that's okay, because it's up to us what ensemble we want to think about. And we're just going to define the ensemble by averaging over the moduli space of the actual ordinary Norrain theory. Ordinary Norrain theory. So instead of dividing out by the duality group of W to W, we're going to divide out by the T duality group of the bosons. You should think of this as integrating over some piece of the moduli space of the WZW model. This one has finite volume. You can make sense of the average. But it's just one piece of the moduli space of the full WCW model. Of the full WCW model. But that's fine. No one said that we had to integrate over the whole moduli space. So we're just going to integrate over this piece of it. That's our definition of the alternative. Tom, we average over real-valued variables all the time, right? So why is it bad? I mean, you can have a Gaussian distribution on a non-compact variable, right? I mean, what's so bad if the volume is infinity? The volume of a The volume of the, I mean, if the Gaussian is your measure, then you integrate the measure, you get something finite. Oh, so your definition of volume is the weight of the probability. Yes. I see. Okay. Yeah. A funny aside, which I found really surprising when I learned it, is that this means that there's infinite families of isospectral CFTs. CFTs. I don't know if I should be surprised by that, but I was. So they're an infinite set of CFTs, all but the same exact partition function that are the different points in this bigger space. Tom, but they have different OPE coefficients, which is one of the really different CFDs. That's right. They're only a little bit different. So basically, they're reshuffled. You know, it's the same list of numbers. Because they're related by what. List of numbers because they're related by different orbital fonts, right? Yeah, yeah, it's just reshuffled. So basically, there's some list of OP coefficients and they're sort of being shifted around like this. And so the action of T duality permutes OP coefficients, but not dimensions or something. Yeah. Okay, so I want to write the answer first. The coset representation. The coset representation gives you a nice decomposition of the characters of the WZW model. Okay, so this is a character of the WZW model. And since you have this coset, you have to be able to decompose that under the pieces of the coset. And this is a standard thing in WZW models. So the first factor here is called the string function of the affine. The string function of the affine Lie algebra. That's basically the character of the parafermion. The second factor here is the character of the bosonic part. Okay, so you should think of this equation as defining the string functions. Well, you can, there's another way of defining them, but for our purposes, think of this as defining the string functions by expressing. functions by expanding in this in these boson characters. Mu here is telling you where the boson representation sits in a Norane lattice. So mu is like the charge. You're decomposing it into U1 charge sectors, and mu is the charge of the state. So now I can give you the final answer of this average. You, the final answer of this average. The average of the partition function is a Poincaré sum over SL2z of some seed partition function. This can be compared to the sum over topologies in three dimensions. The seed for this theory is the uncharged sector of the parafermions. Fermions. That's what the zero is doing. Okay, so let me put it, put the whole answer in words. You take the para fermions, you project onto the uncharged states, and then you sum over SL2Z. That's the average theory. So, question, Tom? The seed includes not just what we would Includes not just what we would call light states, dimension less than zero, but also heavy states that grow like the Cardi formula of whatever this parafermion theory is. Oh, um, like e to the roots, you know, and well, it's only the uncharged ones, so I'm not sure what you mean by that. I'm not sure how they grow, uh, but there are definitely heavy states in here. They probably grow cardio like, right? I mean, unless there's a good reason for a Well, it's only the uncharged sector. Yeah. I'm not sure how they grow. It would be interesting to compare it to like HKS. Ah, right. Yeah, there's sort of a U1 version of HKS. Version of HKS, which I don't know whether this theory satisfies it or not, actually. I think it might depend on how you, I think you have to say how you're scaling K. Okay, so when you take a large N limit, you have to scale K and some and we haven't done that. Thanks. There is a Carti formula sort of representation by representation. I guess Rossi and I recently wrote a paper about that. Because the representations will mix under XL2Z. So it just depends on which thing is the modular. Yeah, yeah, that's right. But it's basically the usual Cardi growth, but then there's some order one correction, which is based on which representation you're in. Yeah, good. I hadn't made the connection to your formula, which I know. I hadn't thought about how it's related. Yeah, that's a good thing to check. Thanks. By the way, what is the so I'm supposed to go 30 minutes or 35 minutes? Is that the rule? 30 minutes plus 10 questions. You can go a bit more. Yeah. Okay, so let me just sketch the calculation very quickly because I want to get to part two. So here's the quick version: is that the deformed WZW model, because of this coset, This coset is just a product, it's just a sum of twisted sectors of parafermions times twisted bosons. And then when you do the deformation, you just deform the bosonic part. And we're going to apply the Siegel-Vey formula to do that average over the bosonic part. Siegel-Vay tells you that the average is an Eisenstein series. To state the formula, so let me state the theorem. The idea is pretty simple. First, you look near the cusps of SL2Z, where tau approaches a rational point on the real line, and you look at the singularities. So you just look at the singular piece of this thing you're trying to average, and it has some singularity that's dictated by the modular chance. The modular transformations. So you look at those singularities, and then the Siegel-Vey formula states that the average is just given by the sum over singularities. For the deformed WZW model, it turns out after some pretty horrible intermediate steps, you get a really nice, simple result for these averages. Nice simple result for these averages. The sum just projects onto some certain terms in the sum. So in the free boson, you would get an Eisenstein series, which is a sum over SL2Z that looks like this. In the twisted case, you just only include, you just project onto a certain subset of the terms in the Eisenstein series. Then, summing over the twists, gives the answer that I reported a couple slides back: the string functions, the uncharged string functions summed over SL2Z. And that sum over SL2Z parallels the sum over topologies that we do in three dimensions. Some intuition to some words to attach to this for intuition. Words to attach to this for intuition. I think of Siegel-Vay as like a souped-up Cardi formula that combines information from all the cusps. The ordinary Cardi formula just has information from one cusp, and now we're putting together all of the cusps. I like to think of this as sort of the bulk is a bootstrap, the bulk effective theory is a bootstrap approximation. And these theories are so simple that just Theories are so simple that just being able to bootstrap the various limits reconstructs the whole function. For a holomorphic partition function, like a supersymmetric index, this sum over cups would reproduce the exact partition function. This is the story of Rademacher's series of the fairy tale expansion. But we're talking about non-holomorphic theories. And in that case, it doesn't give you back the exact, it doesn't give you back. It doesn't give you back the answer you started with. Instead, it reconstructs the average over a genus of CFTs. Genus is what the mathematicians call the class of objects that all contribute to these sums. Tom, do you know how to define a quote unquote genus of conformal field theories independently of the definition that you've given here implicitly? Given here implicitly, I wish. I wish I did. No, I don't. I mean, I think, um, well, the definition, one definition is that it's the set of theories with all the same singularities. For lattices or Siegel V or something, that definition works. More generally, for other Finally, for other mathematical examples of this, the genus is defined by a set of invariants. And exactly what set of invariants depends on what object you're talking about. There's really elaborate ways of defining these invariants. You said it's the set of CFTs with the same light spectrum. I don't know if that's the right set of invariants for CFT. I don't know. I don't know. In math, it's basically equivalence over the p-adics. I have no idea what that would mean in CFT. Okay, so let me say a few words about part two, and I'll keep it to five minutes or so. Okay, so why does this duality work? And now I'm going back to the And now I'm going back to the free case. I'm not talking about W's to W models anymore. So the free CFT is, here's its path integral. X is the free boson. And the moduli are the metric and B field of the target space. When you do these averages, you're integrating over the moduli. You're integrating over the moduli. And this integral is terrible. It's terrible. The measure is a little bit complicated, but that's not the hard part. The hard part is the domain of integration. The hard part is that when you do this integral, you have to integrate over the fundamental domain of the T-duality group. And that's just a horrendous, it has a terrible shape. Uh, it has a terrible shape, like you, I've, I don't, as far as I know, I have not seen anyone just do the integral. Um, that's not how you do this integral, because the shape of the domain is too terrible to work with. How it's done in practice is using tricks, like demanding that the answer has the right structure and showing that it's unique. So, this integral is really terrible, and that makes this duality a little bit harder. Makes this duality a little bit hard to study. In particular, we can't pull a lot of the tricks that people have pulled in the study of the SYK model, like introducing collective fields and finding bulk saddles that way, some of the neat things that people have done. So here's the claim, though, that actually you don't have to work so hard. The claim I want to make is that the average over the B field. Make is that the average over the B field is doing almost all the work here. In fact, you don't have to integrate over all of moduli space to get a bulk to come out. All you have to do is integrate the B field from zero to one. There's no funny measure. There's no funny moduli space. You don't have to do all that work. And you already get, by doing that, an answer that looks like a Answer that looks like a three-dimensional theory. It's not quite the same as the, there's a, it's not quite the same theory, but it's similar. And there's a limit where it can get very close to the theory that you get in the general case. So as far as doing this integral, like we started with this terrible integral over a terrible moduli space with a crazy shape. I have no idea what it really looks like, so I just drew a crazy shape. It really looks like so I just drew a crazy shape. And the claim is that actually you only have to do this integral where you just integrate a little bit over the B field in some corner of moduli space. So the mechanism for this, and the nice thing about doing it this way, is that there's a very easy to understand mechanism where you just write down the integral and you can see what's going on. So here's how it works. See what's going on. So here's how it works: the free boson has winding sectors that are labeled by the windings around the two directions of the torus. Those are two vectors, M and N, that are the windings of the N bosons. But the N bosons don't, those vectors can be anything. In particular, the N different bosons don't have the same one. Different bosons don't have the same windings. They all each have their own windings. And that means that there is no sense of bulk topology here. The n bosons don't agree on any kind of bulk topology, like with a contractible cycle. But when you do the integral over B fields, you can maybe ignore the top part of this slide. And just believe me that the integral over B fields. The integral over B fields forces the windings to be parallel. It forces the windings to be parallel. And now, after averaging over flux, the n bosons now agree on a bulk topology. The n bosons now agree that there's a contractible cycle. So the winding sectors just Just very completely directly, the widening sectors become the bulk topologies. And any contribution to the path integral where the bosons disagree on the bulk topology, that gets projected out by summing over fluxes. So the sum over windings is very directly the sum over bulk topologies. I think this is similar in spirit to Eberhardt's work on. That work on the appearance of topology in the tensionless string. The same thing works at higher genus. So this is pretty non-trivial that this all goes through. And it really just seems to be the integral of reflexes that's doing the magic here. And the rest is sort of a distraction. What is the lesson of this? Well, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. What we've seen is that these random fluxes are giving you some kind of singlet constraint that sews together the bulk topologies and gives you a holographic interpretation. Tom, can I ask a question? Yeah. So what about wormholes? Like, what if I have a disconnected boundary? Does this, if anyone. As long as we do the B field integral last, then it does exactly, it gives back. It gives back exactly what you'd expect. Yeah. And also, I guess this makes it clear why only handle bodies appear in the sum and not non-handle bodies, because those are the ones that distinguish, you know, that are labeled by a choice of contractible cycles. Exactly. Exactly. The solution. So actually, when you do this at higher genus, I don't even know how to prove that the thing you're getting is the sum over handle bodies. The thing you're getting is the sum over handlebodies, but it seems to be true. Like there's some rather non-trivial things that have to happen to solve the B field constraint, to solve the delta function that you get by integrating over B fields. But it seems to work. There's some, yeah, it seems to work. And you get back exactly the handlebodies. And in the case of disconnected boundaries, you get back exactly the things that you get in the. The things that you get in the Norrain duality. Okay, so I'm done. Let me just post a couple questions here for discussion, future work. More generally, we'd like to understand what is the mechanism for averaging to produce topology. This is not just a problem for wormholes and these toy models. It really is the statement of the information paradox restated. Uh, you know, how is it that the black hole microstates close up to the tip of the Euclidean black hole? That's that's microstates uh summing up to give topology. So they're all related. And what are the aspects of the microscopic theory that can be extracted by averaging? In other words, what's universal? And I'll stop there. Thanks. Thank you, Tom. Questions for Tom? Alex, you have a question? Yeah, so I'm going to try to make an analogy with random matrix theory, which is a bit dangerous because your theories are not quite chaotic. But let me try anyway and tell me how you think about it. So you can ask, how much averaging do you need to do in random matrix theory to see, you know, nice smooth curves and that kind of stuff? And SYK, you know, has taught us that you don't need to do a full like DUE. You don't need to do a full like DUE average, right? You can average over less and still get a lot of nice, similar features with smooth curves, but at some point you run into troubles, and there's like a minimum amount of averaging that you still need to do. How do you think about that in terms of this B field? Like that's enough. How much of it is it? I don't have like a good like set of words that I can give you, but I can tell you an equation or a fact. Equation or a fact, which is that, okay, so the integral over fluxes is giving you a delta function. This is the integral over fluxes. Okay, and if you integrate over the full range of fluxes, you get a perfect delta function. And if you just integrate a little bit, like we don't say we say we just add a little bit of noise to the B field, well, it would still work really well. Well, it would still work really well at high energies because this is going to give you something very close to a delta function in the high winding sectors. So there's a sense in which any amount of noise in the B field will project onto bulk topologies at high energies, but then there's like some junk left over from the low winding sectors. And the more you, the more And the more averaging you do over fluxes, the better you project that stuff out. I see. Thanks. Any more questions? Any questions from the room? No? Okay. So, Alex, no, yes. Alex Maloney, you have a question. Thanks. Thanks. So, if you thought of the integral over G and B as a kind of toy model for string theory, because we're integrating over target space metrics and B fields, you could ask whether if instead of doing the dumb integrating over G and B, I turned on world sheet gravity, does some version of this appear? Like, that's a much fancier problem. Maybe Lorenz can solve it. That's not the fancy problem. I don't have anything to say about it. I don't have anything to say about it. Okay. Thanks. You might wonder if, like, in ordinary versions of holographic duality, that maybe the like in full-blown ADS CFT, maybe the reason you don't have to do this is because it's already a gauge theory. Maybe the gauge constraints are somehow doing this for you. And so that's why we don't need to also average. I mean, there's a sense in which the I mean, there's the sense in which the Norayan ensemble, you're averaging over possible gaugings of non-compact bosons. Because one way to get a compact boson is to gauge a non-compact boson by a discrete gauge group. So this is kind of average over gaugings. But I don't know if that statement gives any useful insight. I don't know. Thanks. Very interesting. Any more questions? Any more questions? Okay, I don't see any hands. So, if not, let's thank Tom again. Thank you, Tom. And our next speaker is Hong Liu.
