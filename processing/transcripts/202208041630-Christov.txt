Last session of day four of CMO Burroughs workshop on mathematics of multi-scale, multi-phase, and multi-physics models. It's a great pleasure to have Professor Ivan Christov from Purdue, and he's going to talk about continuum-scale simulation tools for transport phenomena in dense suspensions. So, the floor is all yours, Ivan. Great, thank you. Great, thank you. It's a pleasure to join in even if virtually. I hope the hybrid format is working well, I hope. So what I'd like to tell you about today is some joint work with my former post-doc, Dr. Federico Monicki. He's now taken up another position at the Colorado School of Mines. And a lot of the work that I'll talk about today was also done by my former master's student, now PhD student. Former master's student, now PhD student, Prane Nagrani in Purdue Mechanical Engineering. That's where we're at. And so I've enjoyed listening to the talks and the discussion over the last few days. And I think one theme that has come up a few times is, you know, sometimes we have to do idealized and very detailed simulations and analyses to be able to understand some fundamental physics, but other times we actually have to simulate some industrial. Industrial level or scale process, and those are not exactly the same thing, right? So, if you wanted to do a particle resolve simulations in some kind of flow, but you know, the flows taking place in the scale of kilometers and the particles are in the orders of billions, it's not going to work, right? And so eventually, we somehow would like to use our small-scale, highly resolved DL simulations to inform us about some continual models that we can use. Some continuum models that we can use to solve problems at larger scales. And that's kind of what I'd like to talk about today, specifically in the context of dense suspensions. So I'll tell you exactly which flow regime this is. It's a little bit different than some of the ones you've seen so far. I'll give you a little bit of motivation, although I think there's been plenty of motivation of why suspensions are interesting and useful to study here at this workshop. But one of our initial motivations, at least when we started thinking about this about six years ago, About six years ago now, was hydraulic fracturing. That was a kind of a buzzword and popular thing in the news from about 2012 to about 2017 or so until the gas prices fell. But the idea there is you'd like to recover hydrocarbons from unconventional reservoirs, tideshell, other places. The best way to, or one way to do that that was efficient for a bit was to try to fracture the reservoir. To fracture the reservoir, and you can do that by just injecting high-pressure fluid. However, it turns out to be helpful to also inject particles, typically sand. That's what you see here on the left. You see some sand particles that are typically used in hydraulic fracturing. And the reason is you'd like to kind of use the high-pressure fluid to fracture the reservoir, and you'd like the particles to kind of fill in the gap so it doesn't close up, right? So you can maintain the fracture open and kind of extract more gas or oil, whatever the application. Or gas or oil, whatever the application might be. And so these particles are typically called propens. They're large, they're on the order of up to 100 microns, as the case for the sand here is even larger. But what happens when you sort of have this dense suspension in non-uniform geometries and under complicated hydrodynamic forcings, it's not quite well understood. Also, the processes happen many kilometers on the ground. There also are other effects that occur. Are other effects that occur? In fact, my colleagues at Los Alamos like to call hydraulic fracturing a multi-physics thermal hydromechanical process. So that's kind of a fun word there, right? So there's also to be heat transfer, there's high pressure situations, you might turn the liquid into the supercritical form. We heard a talk about that earlier, and so on. Here's a cartoon on the bottom left from Schlumberger. The idea is: right, you try to create this fracture, which is in blue. Which is in blue, and you try to push in some proppants, the solids. They're quite dense, as you can see in the picture, and you'd like them to kind of fill up the gap as best as possible to prevent it from closing. And so, this was kind of our motivation for try to study some flows of dense suspensions in complicated geometries. And so, our first step, of course, was to think about what happens in the flows of dense suspensions, what are the physics and the fluid mechanics involved. And so, traditionally, And so, traditionally, what I'll call the equilibrium point of view is as follows. It was nicely summarized in the annual reviews about a little under 10 years ago by Stecko and Powell. So we think of a suspension as a dispersion of solid particles in a fluid medium. Typically, it's a Newtonian fluid. We call it dense if the volume of particles is more than 30% of the total volume. And then we define two key-dimensionless groups, which are the particle Reynolds number. Are the particle Reynolds number based on the applied shear? That's what you see on the vertical axis here. And on the horizontal axis, we define a shear Peclet number, which compares the strength of the shear to the particle's thermal diffusivity. All right. And so most of the time, what we were thinking about in terms of dense suspensions is low Reynolds number, so towards the bottom of the graph, and high Peclet number, which is towards the right. And so if you're over here, Towards the right, and so if you're over here in this very far right regime, most suspensions, most dense suspensions can be thought of as a single mixture. Their suspension viscosity, mu s is the fluid viscosity multiplied by some dimensionless function that depends on the volume fraction. And that's kind of what is kind of well understood. And most of us probably know from some courses we've taken. On the top right, I've had number and low shear Peclet number. So these are like Brownian. Number. So these are like Brownian suspensions at very high speeds or something like that is much more challenging. And I think we heard some talks about that. But I will not be in that regime. The talk today would be, well, before we get to the regime we'll talk about, let me tell you about this eta R function. So this is a well-known function that you will find a lot of literature discussing it. So it goes back to Einstein, right? So the idea is, can you derive the Is can you can you derive the enhancement of the viscosity of the mixture due to the presence of particles? So, Einstein was able to do this, right? So, you take the viscosity of the suspension divided by the fluid viscosity. If it was a clear fluid, you would get one. If you have particles, you get a contribution that's five halves of the volume fraction. And if you want to get even more clever, you can, that's what Bachelor and Green did, you can get the correction to order five squared. But despite all of that, you still see. But despite all of that, you still see that those two relations. So there's Einstein and there's Bachelor and Green, only do very well at very low volume fractions. And this is the fraction phi divided by the maximum volume fraction, which is typically the one you would encounter for random close packing, for example. And so in reality, what happens is as you approach the maximum volume fraction, such as random close packing or something like that, the measured, the experiment, Measured, the experimentally measured viscosity of the suspension diverges. And so the reality of that regime is more complicated than just the phi or phi squared correction to the suspension viscosity. And so what we'd like to talk about today is a regime that's right in the middle of this diagram. We would like to consider small particle Reynolds number, but not vanishingly small. So 10 to the minus 3, or so it's still small, but it's not zero. And shear Peclet numbers that are Shear Peclet numbers that are larger than one. So, we're not going to go into this unknown regime up here, but we'd like to diverge a little bit from the bottom, get a little bit farther away from this equilibrium suspensions in which all you see is an enhancement of viscosity. And so to this end, there's a, whoa, and something happened to, unfortunately, my pictures here, but we'll live through it. So, one interesting effect that occurs for suspensions that are living here in the middle. Living here in the middle, not in the corner, is that there's actually non-equilibrium effects. So the situation is not as simple as just enhancing the viscosity. And this was noticed by Akravos and his students a long time ago. He writes very eloquently about it in his Bingham Award Lecture, which was published in the Journal of Rheology in 1995. And so let me move the Zoom window for a second. And so you can see, so they did an experiment, and you can see the quad cell, I guess, on the And you can see the quad cell, I guess, on the you can see it okay up here. So, here's their quad cell. Uh, they rotate the inner cylinder and they measure the torque required to rotate it. There's a suspension in this very thin gap between the two things. And so, what they observed is, what he calls a curious phenomenon with his student in 1980, one of the most dramatic and at the time vexing observations was the slow but persistent decrease of the relative effective viscosity with the length of shearing. So, because that's this middle. Length of shearing. So, because that's this middle plot that I'm just showing you. So, they had this wet device and they're looking at very, very, very dense slurries, high viscosity, lots of particles, some kind of coal suspension or something like that. And so they did the experiment over the time, over the course of days, right? So you see the horizontal axis is hours, goes up to 70. And they observe the suspension viscosity, which is what you will say is what you would do, right? This is kind of an undergraft problem. You rotate in a cylinder, you measure the torque, and you infer an effective viscosity. An effective viscosity. That effective viscosity, as they were measuring it through the torque, was decreasing in time. And so that was puzzling, right? And so it took them about eight years of effort before they could make any progress. And in fact, in Actorville's lecture, he discusses how a trip to Cambridge where he talked to George Bachelor kind of set him on the right track of thinking about this problem. It's really, very interesting. But so this is definitely a non-equilibrium effect, right? This is definitely a non-equilibrium effect, right? The more you share a suspension, the more its viscosity changes. Why is that, right? If we're living in an equilibrium world, the suspension should have some fixed viscosity that should not be evolving in time. At least the flow is steady, right? In principle, you're rotating the inner wall of the device at a constant speed. And so, what was happening actually is that even though you're rotating at a constant speed, you're actually creating stress inhomogeneities within the suspension as you're shearing it. The suspension. As you're shearing it, the particles are rearranging and certain things happen. Specifically, the particles like to migrate towards the low shear center line. If it were a pipe flow or the low shear outer wall in the QUET device. Okay, so the basic thing that Akrivols and collaborators kind of realize is that there is a flux, a flux of particles away from the high shear, which is near the walls in the channel or near the inner rotating wall in the. Or near the inner rotating wall in the Quet device and towards the low shear regions. And in fact, this was maybe perhaps should not have been surprising, but at least the way Akira describes it, he was not entirely aware of some of the connections to earlier work by Extend, Shapiro, and others, in which they looked at the enhancement of the diffusivity of sheared particulate Brownian suspensions. Generally, what have been observed in some earlier works, for example, this work by Extend and Shapiro and others, By Extend and Shapiro and others, was that the flux of particles towards the low shear regions can be written as the particle diameter squared and then the gradient of the shear. So it looks diffusive. And various successful models were proposed in which you kind of write down a transport equation, a diffusion equation for the particle migration. And this is most prominent, again, as I said, in the highly viscous regime, so low particle Reynolds number and not. Low particle Reynolds number and non-Brownier. So these are large particles, large particles, large Beckley number. Okay, so how have we understood this since the days of Actrivos? What has been some refinements? So this idea, going back to John Brady, Prabhu Nott, and others, it's called the suspension balance. And this is the usual way to understand shearing just migration in a more rigorous way, in which you don't try to define a flux. Which you don't try to define a flux and try to fit the diffusion coefficient of the flux. Because, notice, I wrote down a proportionality here. I did not say equals because there's some constants of proportionality that are not known a priori. So, you have some more rigorous ways to try to think of this from the microscopic point of view and average it up towards the continuum scale. And that's what the suspension balance model is. In its more traditional form, what you do is you homogenize this and you obtain, of course, constant. Homogenize this, and you obtain, of course, conservation of mass for the average velocity of the suspension and conservation of linear momentum in which you have some stress that's not just the typical stress of the Newtonian fluid, but there will be some contributions there due to the particle migration. A transport equation tells you how particles migrate. And not only do you have transport with the flow, but you also have this shear-induced migration term down the gradient of the shear. Of this year. There are a few limitations about suspension balance models. In some sense, they've homogenized the mixture and you cannot longer tell apart the particles and the fluid and everything is now a property of the homogenized mixture. And it turns out it's a little bit tricky when you try to extend it to more complicated situations. In particular, if you want to add other kinds of transport phenomena, such as heat transfer, which I'll tell you about later. And so while this suspension balance model is quite successful, This suspension balance model is quite successful. You can solve for this. You can define the proper stress of the suspension. You can solve for it, and you can get very good agreement with the experiments on particle migration. It turns out, you know, it's not useful. It's not the most general model you can use. And so we decided to do a small change to this and implement a two-fluid model, what we call Euler formulation, towards the same effect. So we're not claiming to be rediscovering America here. We just wanted to have a more general and Just wanted to have a more general and extensible set of equations that we can put into our continuum scale model and put it into our big solver and sort of not be restricted to some of the assumptions of the suspension balance model. And so I think we've seen lots of two fluid models so far in this workshop. So I don't have to tell you about everything. Essentially, you just have conservation of mass and momentum equations for each phase independently. You write down a separate velocity for each phase. Uh, velocity for each phase, F for particles. I'm sorry, P for particles, F for fluid. Each phase has its own stress tensor, and then there are some forces that couple the two phases together. And of course, you can have gravity as well, if you will. And, you know, we can close these equations in a fairly standard way. So we can couple the two momentum equations by the interface drag force using the Cliff drag law, 46 versions of that. We can, and then we have to do. And then we have to define the appropriate particle and fluid phase stress tensors. That'll be the final step in defining a two-fluid model. So, what's nice about this is a lot of these pieces that fit into the two-fluid model have been well studied before. And we can kind of pull out the right experimentally validated tensors or forms or correlations to put into this Euler-Euler two-fluid model. In particular, there's some really nice work that's been done. Uh, there's some really nice work that's been done over the last 20 years on determining the form of the particle stress that should go into here, and so let me just give you some highlights of that. A lot of this work was done by Jeff Morris and his students and collaborators, or also going also Zoraga and others. The basic idea is: you know, you define the particle phase to have some Newtonian-like term based on the viscosity, and then there's an extra stress that comes about from the Stress that comes about from the inhomogeneity of the suspension, right? So, shear-induced migration causes the particles to migrate. The non-uniform distribution of particles induces some extra stress in the particulate phase. So, what Morris and colleagues succeeded in sort of modeling is the following. They define the particle stress as the fluid viscosity times this dimensionless function, the normal scale of viscosity, which depends on the volume fraction. Volume fraction and then an anisotropy tensor, right? Because, as I keep saying, the stress is anisotropic in the suspension, the particles are not uniformly distributed. And so, what they've done is done a very nice job of trying to fit those two unknown quantities, the scaled normal viscosity and the anisotropy tensor, to experiments. So, develop correlations that are successful in describing particle-induced migration stresses, and we can put those into our two-fluid model. Those into our two-fluid model. So, here's some of the details. I mean, there's a lot of different ways you can come up with correlations for viscosities and other things in suspensions. We like this version here at the top left that we can implement. So it gives you the particle phase viscosity as a function of fluid phase viscosity and the volume fraction. And depending on which coefficients you pick here, you can obtain different known correlations. They all work pretty well in the dense particle regime. In the dense particle regime, this describes the fact that the viscosity of the suspension blows up as you approach the maximum volume fraction, right? It can no longer flow if there's the whole volume of the available volume is packed by particles. The normal scope of scusting has an interesting form. It also diverges in some particular way, but it's different. And this was fitted to experiments by Morris and Boulet, and they obtained an interesting form. And the final thing that we In an interesting form, and the final thing that we have to implement that was not entirely obvious. So, so far, lots of things we found in the literature we can plug in. The thing that was not entirely obvious is how do we implement the anisotropic stress into our model, right? Because somehow these things are defined based on local coordinate systems going with the flow. So, typically, you take some kind of a quad device and you have like one shear direction across the gap, and you kind of measure some of the components of the stress tensor. Of the components of the stress tensor, and so we thought was an interesting idea. Let's try to implement this using a local decomposition because we can do this in our solver. We can define one direction to be that of the velocity, one of the vorticity, and then one is the perpendicular one to both of those. And then if we do that, the tensor is diagonalized, and we can use the functions that Morris and Boulet kind of determined by fitting to the experiments. So this reduces nicely in the This reduces nicely in the geometry of the quad gap to their case, and it's also general, what's for general curvilinear flows. Okay, so I won't belabor some of the details. We implemented this entire two-fluid model into open foam. We were lucky that there was already a nice solver called two-phase Euler Foam by Pasolaqua and Fox. This one, this is more for the traditional case of a fluidized bed or gas air flows, but some of the solver ideas are similar. So we kind of extended. Solver ideas are similar, so we kind of extended that and used it as the basis to write down to develop an open form solver for the dense suspension using the model I described. This is all available for free on GitHub as you know, it's an open form solver, so it's open source. You can download it, you can try it yourself, you can extend it if you want, and it works pretty well. So, first we decided to, we had to validate against the classical experiments on shear-induced migration, right? So, this is the back to actribose, you have two concentric syllabus. You have two concentric cylinders, the inner one rotates. What happens when the inner cylinder rotates is the particles go towards the outer cylinder. So, for different volume fractions, you have this nice cartoon in the middle from Guazzili and Morris's textbook. For different volume fractions, you have slightly different curves, but they're qualitatively similar. So there's less particles, lower volume fraction near the rotating wall, and more particles near the outer wall. So they do migrate, you get a non-uniform distribution. So we did that, and luckily, there's We did that, and luckily, there's data available from experiments by Philips et al. at MIT. So, after 200 turns in a cylinder, or after 12,000 turns, the profile is slightly different. And in both cases, our red curve, the TFM simulation, goes nicely to the experimental data and agrees pretty well with some of the previous works based on suspension balance models. But notice some of the previous work, depending on how you implement the suspension balance model, there's even some difference between the SBM curves themselves. Curves themselves. But anyway, so we're pretty happy with this. We do the TFM can be benchmarked in this case. This, as well as previous continuum models, matches the experiments. Now, here's an interesting case that I don't think could have been done if you just thought about particle migration as a sort of diffusive transport phenomenon down the shear gradient, or even as a suspension balance in which some of the assumptions are made. This is a three-dimensional flow in curvilinear coordinates. We were motivated to study this because of this very nice. Study this because of this very nice paper by well, not just us. Many people have studied this geometry, which was motivated by this nice paper of Strzok et al. in science 2002. They designed this micro-mixer in which you have this rectangular channel with this herring bones at the top. And you repeat this element many, many, many times. And this notch at the top generates convective flow in the cross-section. So you can have a three-dimensional flow, which can induce mixing, even at very low Reynolds number. Low-developed number. So, Gao and Gilchrist did a nice experiment where they pushed a suspension through this stagger herring bomb mixer. And what they observed is that the particles, of course, have to migrate. And with their experimental equipment, they could get a cross-section of the concentration. And they observed this sort of kind of vortex-like structures with high concentration of particles towards the middle, it's in the cross-section, say, for example, at the outlet of this element. Our simulation also captures those. Of course, the experiment is a little bit more asymmetric. Of course, the experiment is a little more isometric than the simulation. But notice, you know, we get to about 11% particle volume fraction in the center, and they get to about 12, 13 or so, 14 maybe. Okay, so qualitatively, this looks pretty good. And indeed, we can get the complicated particle phase streamlines, which you see on the top left. So we're pretty happy with our silver. It can reproduce experiments and it works in complicated geometries. Going back to my motivation earlier on that we need a To my motivation earlier on, that we need a continuum-scale simulation tools that we can use in complicated geometries with thousands and millions of particles. Okay, so now in the final bit of time that I have, I'd like to show you sort of an interesting puzzle that we discovered because we were motivated to consider also thermal transport in the suspension. Okay, we're not the first ones to do this. There was a nice paper by Metzger et al. in 2013. So they observed this again, the quite geometry, two concentric cylinders, you rotate the inner one, but now You rotate the inner one, but now you also heat it. So, what happens is if you heat the inner cylinder up to a certain temperature, as you see up here, and then you let that temperature decay. So, you turn off the heater and you let the temperature decay. If you're not rotating it, you get the curve with the circles. If you're also spinning the cylinder as it cools down, you get the curve with the squares. So, it cools down faster. There's a strong, or well, I guess you can quantify how strong it is, but there's a measure. Is but there's a measurable and noticeable enhancement of the heat transfer as you're shearing this, and so what gives? Well, again, it has something to do with the stress inhomogeneities and the way that the particle and fluid phase are coupled. So what they proposed was to, again, just use the diffusive transport model, right? So particle migration can be described just by a diffusive flux down the shear gradient. And then they also said, okay, add a transport equation for the temperature and enhance the diffusivity, the thermal diffusivity of the system. The thermal diffusivity of the suspension with the shear rate. And they proposed this form, which is similar to some of those ideas of shear-induced shear-enhanced diffusivity, went back to Eckstein, Shapiro, Sidney, Colton, and others. The basic idea is it goes linearly with the volume fraction and to some power of the shear rate. And they can fit these parameters beta and m, and they can kind of get the enhancement curve. Okay, so it seems to kind of make sense. It seems to kind of make sense. The suspension has an enhanced conductivity, and that can be quantified in terms of the shear rate. But there's some gaps here, right? So we kind of have to assume again an equilibrium description that there is a single temperature in the suspension and that that's all there is to it. And you can't really distinguish between thermal gradients in the particulate phase or the particle phase. But with a two-fluid model, you can do that. And so, right, once you have our two. You can do that, and so right once you have our two-fluid model, this basic governing equations for other models are known as long as we know what to put into the right places. And so, we just also turned on the energy equations in our open foam model. Here's the generic version that we're using open foam using enthalpies. And the basic idea is the only thing we really have to model, right? So, the particles have certain thermal diffusivity, that's known. The fluid has as well, that's known. Those are thermophysical material properties that are known. Physical material properties that are known. The only thing we really have to think about is the interphase heat transfer. All right, so for the momentum equations, the interface momentum transfer, we could use a cliff drag model. Here we have to do something more clever. And so we were inspired to kind of just follow what Metzger et al. did. But instead of trying to enhance the diffusivity of the suspension, which to me is a little bit weird because the suspension should be a single fluid, it should have well-defined thermophysical properties. We're going to enhance instead this interface. Enhance instead this interface heat transfer coefficient, right? This is a quantity that typically has to be measured and correlations have to be created for it. So it makes a lot of sense that it should be fit to something, whereas the particle and fluid phase diffusivities should be some known quantities ahead of time. And so we took the same form that they did, a zero shear rate. We just used the standard Rands-Marshall kind of stuff for the correlation. And then we enhanced it with the shear rate, where now I'm not just taking a constant shear rate, I'm taking the entire norm of the. Entire norm of the rate of strain tensor of the particulate phase. And so we did a simulation that matches the experiments of Metzger et al. This is based on, I guess, again, the Quetzel. And what we observed is that we could calibrate those two parameters, right, beta and m in the interface heat transfer coefficients to nicely match the data of Metzger et al. Okay, so the, right, remember the top curve with the triangles is normal. The triangles is no rotation of the inner cylinder, and the squares irrotate the inner cylinder at 10 per second that are effective or you rotate it to affect a shear rate of 10 per second in the in the gap. Okay, so we do pretty well. We can capture those. All right, so beta is about 0.2 and m is about one. So it goes about linearly with the shear rate as well. Now, here's a really interesting situation. So now we said, okay, well, Really interesting situation. So now we said, okay, well, you can introduce a shear gradient across the gap, right, by rotating the keeping one wall stationary and moving the other, or vice versa. So you can control the shear gradients in the quad cell very nicely. And there's tons of experiments and discussion of that. What if you also control the thermal gradient across the quad cell, right? I can hit the inner wall or the outer wall or vice versa. And so that's what we decided to do. So here is our situation. We did two different sets of simulations. One involves sets of simulations. One involves having the inner wall, case one, hotter. In this case, the migration is in the same direction as the thermal gradient. And the second case, we hit the outer wall, rotate the inner one. Now the migration is kind of against the thermal gradient because thermometer is trying to diffuse, transport it towards the inner wall, particles trying to go towards the outer wall. The thermophysical properties we picked were kind of interesting maybe to some of you. They're a little bit unusual maybe. We didn't pick like water and glass spheres. The glass spheres. We picked a fluorocarbon fluid, which is typically used in electronic schooling applications. That was some of our motivation for doing this. And we picked this boron nitrate particles, which are high conductivity particles, often again used in electronics coolings applications. So you can see we have some kind of a complicated flow scenario industrial application in mind that we're trying to calibrate this sober for. And so here is sort of like the one thing I want to get away from this whole talk. One thing I want to get away from this whole talk, take away from this whole talk, right? So we rotate the inner cylinder and we either have the inner one or the other one to be hotter, right? That's what delta T positive and delta T negative means. And as you increase this delta T, make it larger and larger, if it is opposing the direction of the expected shear migration towards the outer wall, you actually end up suppressing the particle migration. So this profile Particle migration. So, this profile in red here, the most red one, is much more uniform than the dashed one, which is the isothermal case. Vice versa, if you if you put the if you change the direction of delta t, you end up hitting, you end up enhancing the shearing's migration, and suddenly the particles migrate even more. You have a much more non-electron distribution. So, somehow, particle migration is affected both by shear gradients and by thermal gradients. Gradients and by thermal gradients. That to us was very surprising. We had not seen any reports on this. We had seen Metzger's report in the thermal conductivity enhancement, but we hadn't seen actual interaction between thermal and shear gradients that affect the particle migration. And so I think I'm a little bit low on time. So just like to give you the final piece of information here, which is a slight simple model that kind of maybe gives you insight into why this might happen. So we can take a look at our two-fluid model and take a look at the force in the momentum equation, the particle phase. In the momentum equation, the particle phase. That is the divergence of the particle stress tensor. The particle stress tensor has this kind of Newtonian-like contribution and also the stress anisotropy coming from particle migration. If we assume like 1D flow, so u is only a function of x in the horizontal direction, we kind of break up those terms, take the gradient. We see there's essentially three terms that are hiding in here somewhere in this divergence. One involves the gradient of the shear rate. That's the normal shear-induced migration with a plus sign. There's also a gradient. Plus sign. There's also a gradient of particle concentration at the end. This one's typically negligible because phi dx is not very large. And another term pops out, which involves the gradient of the fluid temperature. It now has a negative sign. So it opposes the shear industry migration. So very clearly, when you write this as a two-fluid model in the particle momentum equation, you see two opposing forces. One is trying to move the particles with the shear gradient, and one is trying to perhaps move them in the other direction, depending on the sign. Move them in the other direction depending on the sign of the temperature gradient. So, this will be discovered by doing some interesting modeling of the continuum scale of shear-induced migration. And so, there's more cases we can do, we can vary all the parameters, but I think I'm going to end it here and just tell you that we're very interested in understanding this better. We're currently trying to perform experiments in collaboration with the MTEC Lab of Purdue, directed by my colleague, Professor Amy Marconet. Amy Marconet. And so I think that's what I have to say. So, just one thing to take away from this talk is that particle shear-induced migration can be controlled by thermal gradients. And this appears to be a new phenomenon that we're trying to fully understand now. So thank you for your attention. Thank you. Thank you, Ivan. Let's thank Professor Christoph for a very interesting new phenomena that we are taking a look at. At least it was brought to my attention first time. So, the floor is open. First time. So, the floor is open for a few questions because we are a little over time. Questions? Well, you just made the drilling fluids lab for our students much harder. I can tell you that. They try to mix these things and carry out the fluid rheology tests in the Cuette cell. And I'm not sure if they are maintaining the temperatures of both the cylinders correctly. Correct. So if we introduce their paper over there, I think everybody has to have their drilling, but the rheology corrections because of I am Christopher, right? So any insights into these non-returning fluids, that final rheology that comes out of it, if they were not maintaining the temperatures throughout the preparation of these suspensions, are you suggesting some sort of like a temperature dependence? Of, like, a temperature dependence, uh, because you expect these particles to be migrating differently if there was no temperature control in the uh covet cell, right? Yeah. Okay. So it all depends, right? So we need to, we're trying to do some experiments to see sort of how strong the effect is, right? Because in the simulations, we picked the cases that most clearly demonstrated the physics. Now, in the lab, maybe you're under conditions where the migration is very weak. So maybe you're, okay, you can still infer the bulk property. Still infer the bulk properties of the suspension just fine. But at the same time, we have, you know, we're not really sort of sure how much we're going to see in the actual web experiments. We're trying to kind of design those right now and do them with two things in mind, right? One is how the total temperature delta t wasn't really that big, right? How much was the delta t to really change, let's say, the viscosity by a factor of two? No. Two, no, a factor of two. Well, I'll do some math here then. Okay, the temperature gradients we have here were in the order of, yeah, it's very small. Yeah, yeah, it's very small, right? That's that's what, like, if you're observing, okay, well, okay. I'll read your paper, but this is very, very interesting. I can see, you know, how it is going to affect the interpretation of all the experiments that we are doing, right? Yeah. But notice that the variation of volume fraction with the small thermal gradient is not that high, right? You change it by about, you know, 0.2% or something like that, the total variation of 0.5%. That the total variation of 0.5 percent, sorry, point, yeah, okay, okay. Okay, so ultimately, it could end up being within the error bars if you measure viscosity. So, that's why I think I like your question. I think I need to go home and do some back of the envelope math to kind of see. Thank you. Thank you, Ivan. And thank you for accepting our invitation to share your latest research. This was fantastic. In the next workshop, we hope everybody can. Next workshop, we hope everybody can meet in person. So, looking forward to that. Okay, so let's move to the okay, Professor Gay. Hello, we can hear you. Can you share your screen?
