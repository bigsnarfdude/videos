All right, thank you. Does it work? Yeah. All right. I'd like to start by thanking the organizers for having me here. It's very nice. It's really beautiful. And it's nice to present this work. So I'll be mainly talking about the results in a recent paper with Antoine Bourget and Dr. Chef Nameki. Naminki So being exalted so when you said stream of consciousness, I'm really going to go stream of consciousness. So I will issue all possible disclaimers. I had zero time. I had my kids. I almost missed my flights, etc. So there's absolutely no Etc. So there's absolutely no preparation. All right. But I'll try to paint a picture and we'll see. I'll try to do the usual thing of trying to satisfy everyone and satisfying no one in the end, but secretly hoping that because I just said this, I will actually satisfy everyone. So what's the idea? We have something called M-theory. You may have heard of it. You may have heard of it, the mathematicians. And we like to take non-compact Calabia threefolds that have singularities. They could be compound Duval. They could be conic. It could be like the conifold or more general things. And we claim that this is a good gadget to engineer what we call super-conformal field theories. Field theories, SCFTs. So these are objects that contain some gauge group, for instance, at least in a certain limit, they have gauge group, they have fields, so they could look like quiver theories. It could be something like this, where you have one, two, three, four. This could be a representation of a quiver gauge theory. Here there's an Here there's an U1, U2, U3. These arrows, they're actually double arrows. It's just a double quiver, so they're bifundamentals. And this would be an example of a framed quiver. And we have some machinery that's been around for 20 years or so. The how to build this by placing, defining M-theory on specific singularities. And we actually believe we can go beyond. And we actually believe we can go beyond things that are describable by a quiver, things that are intrinsically strongly coupled, that don't even admit such a description, but that we can learn a lot about by first having an approximate description like that at what we call low energies. Now, what's interesting is that there's a different, completely different picture that I will not fully develop or we'll see. There's a dual theory. Do we need this one? Oh, this is for you guys. Okay. All right. Well, I don't know. It's up to you. I mean, I'll try not to walk into it. There's a different version of string theory called type 2b, where the data that is encoded here takes the shape of a graph. So let me be specific. Who here has seen, knows about Tauric diagrams? Tauric diagrams. Okay, who does not? Let's phrase it this way. Oh, I see. So, okay, so you've never seen things like an object like this, for instance, you know, that and been told that such a graph represents C3 quotiented by Z3 mod Z3. Has anyone seen this amongst? Has anyone seen this amongst the mathematicians? This type of notation? No? I didn't realize it has a name. Sorry? I didn't realize it has a name. We call it the Tauric diagram. It's a section of the fan in Tauric language. It's a fan. So usually a fan for a Tauric threefold is something like that. It's some sort of cone, and it can be refined. But for the case that's Calabiao, you can just take a slice and actually. You can just take a slice and actually represent it with a two-dimensional graph. And it turns out that the dual graph, so this is encoding pure geometry, okay? But of course, you can draw a dual graph in the usual sense of dual graphs like we learned in high school. Well, high school, if you're from a Soviet school, I suppose, but not for me. But if you draw a dual graph like that, this actually has a string theory interpretation. String theory interpretation in terms of objects that are these are all sorts of objects that we call brains, d-brains, or even more general than d-brains. Let's just stick to the idea that these are d-brains, and I may or may not specify which kind, it may not matter. Matter. And the idea is that there's some structure to these singularities. They carry, for instance, represent, they carry some groups that act on it and representations. For instance, here, there's an SU3 in this business. So you don't even know why, but you can sense there's an SU3 here. There's another SU3 here. There's another SU3 here. And there's another one here. Never mind why and how, but just appreciate graphically that you can understand why it's SU3. And I could have had something with four lines and it would have been an SU4. In physics parlance, we would say that there's an SU3 cubed flavor group. So that's a group acting on the fields and the so if you want the particle content of this model. Now it actually enhances. Now, it actually enhances in this case to E6 at the superconformal point. That's jargon for the physicists. But one can already learn a lot by seeing what happens in the SU3 language. Now, this picture, this correspondence between pure geometry and some configuration of brains from which you can read off quiver data. So in this case, the quiver in this situation would be this. The quiver in this situation would be this one, and the one I drew would be this one, a slightly shorter one. The one I had before would have been if I'd had four, you know, four of these vertices stacked together. Now, this has been around for 20 years, but some 10 years ago, some people, Benini, Benvenuti, and Tachikawa, started asking the question: what if I just What if I generalized? So let me draw this again. Let me introduce a little bit more jargon. These things like that are called D5 brains, the horizontal segments. They're a certain kind of object in string theory. And the crosses are what we call D7 brains. The D5 brains, so you can really imagine the D7 brains. The D7 brain as being some object lying in space, and it has a D5 brain that ends on it. Okay? And in string theory, these things exist. They're defined as low-key, where there are Dirichlet boundary conditions for strings. If you've seen some of this stuff, if you haven't, it doesn't matter. What's interesting to us, one way to define it, is that these are sheaves. Is that these are sheaves that carry bundles that are localized at various core dimensions of your space-time, of your full space? Now, if you notice, here I have one D5 ending on each D7. But you could also ask the question: what if I had two of these ending on the same D7? So, in other words, So, in other words, what I had before, we could have drawn as a partition, the one-cubed, you know, one-one-one partition. But in this case, you could see this as this partition. And more generally, you know, the more, the bigger the diagram, the more such situations become possible. Become possible. You know, you'll have more partitions. You know, you can have anything. Yes? This is two, and this is, oh, sorry, two, one. Yeah, no. Now, physically, in terms of string theory, this makes sense and this has consequences. And the consequence in this case is that the SU3 that I had before gets partially broken down to the centralizer of a nil-potent element. So if you know about the So, if you know about the classification of nilpotent orbits of SLN, they're classified by partition. So, in this case, this corresponds to having an object like so in SL3. And this has a centralizer, which is S of U1 cross U1. Now, the question is: what is the geometric way of encoding what just happened here? Just happened here. Okay. And that's what this project is about. And in a bigger picture, it's something I've been interested in for about a decade is in general. This gadget that I spoke of that translates gauge theory data into geometry and vice versa always relies on some sort of spectral curve or some sort of spectral data. Data. So, for instance, one way you could construct a threefold, let's take, let's take the beloved conifold, or I guess you would, how would you call the conical, the conic, I don't know how you'd call the conifold threefold. Threefold. In string theory, we have a way of understanding this thing as taking it as a C-star vibration over well, over a spectral hush. Over a spectral, no, how should I say it over a complex plane that degenerates over a spectral curve? So it's like a hitch and math. Yes. Maybe I'll just ask something, which might be valuable. Sure. So I think people are used to thinking about the right side of what you're really as the spectrum. That's the spectrum of the other part. This is the characteristic polynomial associated to a Higgs field M, which I guess we're interpreting as being P1. That's right. So actually, maybe I'll switch immediately to instead of calling it M, let me call it phi. And then you know the thing that people might not usually do in this site, which is to introduce the variables u and v. They're not usually. Right. But I'm defining. defining it yeah yeah so uh could you think of this as the hitch and map though so defining the c star vibration over it ah it just sends phi to this okay so right so i specifically want to define a c star vibration uh that degenerates precisely over the spectral curve that's the idea and the claim is that this this gadget translates type 2a string theory Tied to a string theory into what we call M-theory. So now I'll get a little bit more specific what this means. In type 2A string theory, which has, let's say, a related cousin or it's a sister theory to type 2B, unlike here where I have these. Unlike here, where I have these graphs that are real graphs, I can translate this problem into something where I really have coherent sheaves, where I'm really dealing with algebraic geometry. So in the case I'm looking at, the space in question will always be C2 modulo Zn. So just the A-type Duval surfaces. And I will have And I will have coherent sheaves here. Now, in physics language, I will specifically only want the six brains, which means coherent sheaves that have support in codimension one, complex codimension one. So these D6 brains are on, they have. They have excuse my handwriting. So it means it looked like gauge bundles with support on holomorphic curves inside these Duval surfaces. And maybe I'll start drawing. Let me draw this a bit more specifically. So let's draw C2 mod Zn in a resolved fashion. So we know we're going to have a bunch of exceptional P1s that are intersecting pairwise as the dinking graph of AN. Sorry. And there's also going to be some non-compact holomorphic curves. Some non-compact holomorphic curves that can pierce. Sorry, this one is dying. You know, there's, so I mean, these are the vague devices that are dual to the compact P1s. And the idea is that the theory will be specified by not only. By not only defining this geometry, but by coloring these nodes, so by defining coherent she's with support on the various curves. So for instance, here I could have one such D6 brain. Here I could have two. Here I could have three. So what do I mean by that? And I could even have a bunch on the non-compact curves. Like here I could have five. So what do I mean by these numbers? So, what do I mean by these numbers one, two, three, and four? I mean the ranks of the coherent sheaves seen as bundles over these various curves. Okay? This specific thing I drew at low energies translates into a quiver gauge theory that looks like this. So, here I have a one, two, three, four, and it's in this case, it's a framed quiver. The square node is like the frame. Quiver. The square node is like the framing. So, in other words, I have the full action here will be GL1 cross GL2 or GL3 cross GL4, and there's no GL5 modding out, just to be clear about the terminology. The edges, they're what we call bifundamental fields. They emanate from the fact that these brains intersect. Okay, now, how does this translate? Now, what's interesting is that What's interesting is that the duality between type 2A and what we call M-theory. So, type 2A in the way that I presented it to you is a dual theory where all this data, so the geometry C2 mod Zn plus the coherent sheaves all gets pure. All gets purely geometrized, meaning that I have M-theory on some threefold, and I don't need extra data, no sheaves, no brains, no flux, nothing like that. And I heard something or was it in my head? Okay. How does it get translated? It gets translated as follows. So let's see, let me introduce. Let's see, let me introduce some notation. Okay, so this space here can be described as xv equals z to the n, right? That's just the algebraic presentation of this Dubai surface. And let's say that all these sheaves have support over some locus that I want to describe like so. That I want to describe like so. Give me a second here. How do I want to? Antoine, do you think I should make it a function of this one or the? Because I don't want to introduce to coordinates at this stage. My collaborator's gone silent. Okay. I'm going to introduce a variable here. And some Higgs field. This thing is what defines for me the coherent sheaves. So, in other words, the various brains can all be defined through a two-term complex, okay, which will look like where the map will be something like this. Something like this. Okay, so for us, the Higgs data goes into the map that will define a skyscraper-like sheaf. Sorry about that terminology. It means a sheaf with support in core dimension one. And the uplift of that will be some geometry that is a C-star vibration times this characteristic polynomial defined. Characteristic polynomial defined. So, in other words, the spectral curve defined by this characteristic polynomial literally tells you the support of the sheaf in question, which is a curve. In this case, it's reducible. Reducible, and it's not even reduced because I have higher ranks. All of that gets purely geometrized in this picture, okay, which is a very special situation in string theory. Is string theory. And the whole point of the project is what happens when phi contains nilpotent information. Now, we know that nilpotent matrices by definition, they have no eigenvalues. So adding a nilpotent piece to something will not change the characteristic polynomial unless you do it in a very special way. And so the geometry up here will not see that something happened. Happened. So, in other words, what I'm saying is that this 20-something-year-old dictionary is incomplete, and it was our quest to try to understand how to encode such extra data. Okay, so I think now I've stated the mission, so it's a good point to pause for questions or requests for definition, clarification, intuition. And that way, it also helps me know how to keep presenting this. Up to you, Good. Yeah. Before we're talking about local things, I guess you could have since you're talking about really a heat spun rather than just its characteristic polynomial. You could have asked, what was the role of changing the H bundle while leaving the characteristic function? What was the role of one? You know, you could have tons of different phase bundles with the same characteristic polynomial, right? So does changing the Hundle while leaving its characteristic polynomial fix? Does that have some meaningful? Does that have something like a gem to resign? Well, that's kind of the question because we know that here changing this can change the flavor group, for instance, right? And yet the singularity does not see that. So what we're saying is that the usual story and in theory is that give me a singularity, I'll resolve it, and by seeing what dinking graph emerges from the resolution graph, I'll tell you everything about it. And what we're saying is that that cannot be true because That cannot be true because we know, like you just said, that different Higgs bundles can lead to the same characteristic polynomial. So that's yeah. Sorry. I guess it's connected to Andy's question. You're looking at, so phi's depend on Z here. Yeah. These fields. Yeah, I need to sort the right coordinates. I mean, it depends on the base. It depends on the base of this vibration, yeah. Yeah, I think one thing was useful here that on in that expression, you have the identity times z tilde. So tilde is just a coordinate. So you want to maybe interpret it as a section of O1. Z tilde, yeah. So you could say what I call Z tilde here will be transfers to where the brains are. Probably, I'm just thinking before we work with these bundles, at least bundle the east. X bundles bundle here. Each field is a section of E. Tensor some line bundles. The line bundle here, all one. Should I view this as a section of E1 and E or some E? Probably the true building. Sorry, you mean the Z tilde? I mean, it's a section of the normal bundle to these curves. Now, of course, the curve being reducible, I don't know if you have a notion of one normal bundle to this whole thing. Because usually you think of one. Usually, you think of one smooth Riemann surface for which you have a normal bundle. Here it's slightly more general. Just get to know where phi lives. Like, phi should be able to say that phi lives over something like a key. Okay. There's a section of n key tensor, like some alignment. And that alignment looks like it could be O1, but it's not. So you mean the tensors are usually when you tensor with the anti-canonical map from a bundle E, but a bundle. bundle either bundle to itself okay which is usually a canonical but i'm not sure that's the case i think it should be the case here because it's still within a collabial twofold so the canonical is the the the dual is a normal the only reason i'm reluctant to call it the normal bundle is that it's a reducible curve so this is a this is a h bundle yeah so i mean the the fine limit Yeah, so I mean the fine lives on the curves, yes. But this is just thinking of this as over P1, and it's a Higgs field that's twisted by the canonical line when the list some publishers probably. Sure, but still I wouldn't call it a P1. In this case, it's a union of P1s. So that's the spectral curve. That's a singular model for the spectral curve. But in order to say where I live. Okay. So I. Okay, so I'm just making a connection. Sure. Okay, so I think I made. All right, I see what's going on. It's my phone, actually. So you're amazing. We have to keep going. There's a double vibration. Okay, so the point is that this is what's maybe tricking things. So C2 mod Zenin is itself a C star vibration. So let's take a plane, let's call it, oh God, I'm running out of names for coordinates. I'm running out of names for coordinates. I got to be careful. So, there's a complex plane. There's A C star vibration that will collapse in various ways over it such that this whole thing is Z2 mod Zn. So, this spectral curve corresponds to, for instance, the locus where I want to have my brain living. Living. The base will be just a complex plane in this case, not a CP1. Over this thing, I define a collabial threefold, which is itself C star fiber. This here is the type IIA picture. This is where sheaves exist. I'm comfortable with sheaves, nil potent data, all this data. Once I lift it, I'm in M-theory territory where the very notion of sheaves makes no sense. Very notion of she's makes no sense physics-wise. But the claim is that a further spectral further piece of spectral data, in other words, let's see. I don't know if there's an obstruction to doing it. I mean, Doing it. I mean, then it would change this, right? This would become something else. I'm not sure you're able to do this and preserve the Calabiao twofold condition. I think you might get obstructions to that. If I resolve this spectral curve here, the point is that above here, there's a further C-star vibration that itself collapses in various ways, that itself can. Various ways that itself carries a Dinking graph, and that is a second piece of spectral data, and that is the one that will forget all the nilpotent information. That's the stuff I'm after in this project. Okay, I hope that helped and didn't add. Okay, so maybe I can give the super primitive example of all this. The most primitive example I can come up with is to just have C2 as my base space. C2 with coordinate ring C of Z and W. And I want to have the following coherent sheaf. So let's call this R. Hmm. Well, I want to do it like this. So, just a pair of intersecting copies of the complex plane inside C2. I can think of this as identity minus a certain phi, the phi being just W times the Carton matrix of SL2. And now what I told you is that the uplift of this situation, so these in physics language are 2d6 brains that intersect at a point, the uplift of this data. uplift of this data is going to be the spectral curve over that uh sorry over this thing which will be uh the conifold or the the double point okay that's the easiest example so you have a a double c star you have a c star vibration so it's like you have a family of a ones Of A1 curves up here, and they collide here. And the fact that they collide renders these things extra singular, and you have a small resolution that becomes possible. Now, the question is, what happens if I decide to put some junk up here, which alters this like that? And now this curve is blind to this information. But in terms of physics, it makes a huge difference. The fact that this is there, you will see that. There, you will see that the centralizer to this in SL2 was still a U1, but the centralizer when you have this is nothing. So, physics-wise, something drastic has happened. And the point of this project was to try to understand how to encode this type of data once you've gone into the spectral world. All right. Okay, well, that's the question. Thank you, Riff. Okay, so now let's try to get more specific. Right. So, more generally, if I might have a situation like this, where I have a rank one chief here, two, three, and here. Two, three, and here on the non-compact curve touching the last one, in this example, have a rank four. The phi here will be some four by four matrix. If I switch nothing on, the spectral curve, so here I can actually go ahead and write the information explicitly. So in type 2A, I have this. The uplift to an n-theory threefold is going to be simply this ideal which which is of course equivalent to this equation and this is C3 mod C4. Mod Z4 cross Z4. Okay, so let's have this as a running example. This is a correspondence, at least physics-wise, can be justified. And now the question is, what happens when I decorate this with the various partitions? Now, what I claim is that the right type of information for these situations is to actually switch on a new To actually switch on a nilpotent piece to this with a pole. So actually, the appropriate physical, the appropriate mathematical gadget is to define a Hitchen system over this divisor of C2, in this case, C2 mod Z4. This is a copy of a complex plane. Plane. The compact curves touch it at a point. What I claim is that the right translation of the physical problem I'm interested in is to look at Hitchin systems with poles on the complex plane. So if this is a local coordinate on this divisor, then I should have things like, I mean, I can show, we showed in the paper that we'll have. That will have things like that, one over z of various kinds. The spectral data of this is again lost. It's like we're applying a forgetful functor every time we take this hitching map that lifts us up here. But there is one thing we can do to remember this information. What we can do is try to deform, once we've switched on this Hitchin pole data, we can look at the We can look at the slotovy transfer slice to that. So we can start switching on information here, for instance. That is very specifically the transfer slice of this nilpotent orbit. Physically, what this corresponds to is to move some of these brains in this direction, like so. And in this way, we recover the true physical system that sees. That sees the true centralizer of the group that we had before. So, in other words, the problem with this uplift is that this still looks like a Duval singularity, and there's still implicitly an SL4 lurking in this information that doesn't know that the centralizer to a nilpotent orbit is not the full SL4 in this case, but the poles have broken it to something. Have broken it to something, and that is not geometrized. Now, we have a physical way of justifying why these systems are naturally deformed to something where the geometry deforms. So let me be a bit more specific about that. So for instance, if we look at this example, here the natural object for Higgs field is an SL2 matrix. Field is an SL2 matrix. Sorry, right. And I had this. If I switch on something in this direction, the spectral curve doesn't see anything. But if I ask what's the slot of the slice of this nil potent direction, it's something that I switch on over here. Once I switch this on. Here. Once I switch this on, the characteristic polynomial deforms. Now, that might look a little bit like a lame example, so I can go into a slightly more developed one where this might actually make more sense. Are there questions so far before I try to do that? Because now I'll actually try to introduce some coordinates, some Tauric coordinates. So this is where I don't know where people are familiar with this. So this is a good time to ask about what I just said here. About what I just said here. No, yes. The basic evolution of the mathematics field. I'm sorry? Yeah. I think of a copy of C, I think of what you have C inside of C2. That's still the Z4. It's actually like a copy of C mod C4. And is that relevant? No, no, no. This is really a C. This is really a C inside this orbiform. This orbifold, yeah. All right, you might as well keep forgetting it. C2 mod Z3 is enough or T2 is enough, the T2 case, maybe to show the. All right. Z3? Maybe I'll do Z2, otherwise I'll have to. Sorry. Sorry about that. All right. Let's do a slightly less basic example, but still not too involved that I have to introduce. Still, not too involved that I have to introduce a lot of machinery. Let's describe type 2A on the A1-Duval singularity, but let's resolve it. I will resolve it. No, you know what? You're right. Otherwise, it'll be too simple. I'm going to use Tauric. So, I'm going to treat this as I will define coordinates as follows. These are projective coordinates. I have two C-star actions by which I quotient. They act as follows. Okay, so what I mean by this is I take this C4 defined by these four coordinates, I remove a bunch of unstable points, and I quotient by these two C star actions. The weight of The way to graphically think of it, so these are these are projective coordinates is that the locus E1 equals zero is one of the exceptional P1s, E2 equals zero is the second one, and these two coordinates correspond to the vague divisors that are not Cartier, one of which goes through this piece. One of which goes through this P1, the other one goes through the other one. Okay. And now I'd like to put a rank one sheaf here, rank two here, and rank three here. So in other words, I want the ideal that contains all the D6 data to be given by E1 times E2 squared times Z2 cubed. Cubed, right? So reducible and non-reduced. How do I do this in this spectral language? Well, I define a two-term complex where there's a matrix, the map. Where there's a matrix, the map is going to be this block diagonal thing. So it's a reducible map for now. These are direct sums of various line bundles that have to have the appropriate degrees with respect to the C-star actions. I don't want to bother trying to get them right. They're both direct sums of line bundles. Sums of line panels. Okay. If I define invariant coordinates with respect to all these things, I can define a big X as Z1 cubed, E2 squared, E1. Big Y is E1. Sorry? One squared E2.  So, I can define these three things. This is a bit like defining a blowdown map. And you will, of course, easily believe me that this satisfies this equation. So this is the singularized version of what I just described. And as you'll notice, my claim is that the ideal on which the full sheaf has support is this one, which corresponds. This one, which corresponds to my y-coordinates. So the m-theory uplift of all this information is given by the codimension two ideal in C5. Yes, y, which is this inside a C5. But this can, of course, be simplified to u v y minus c. The y minus c cubed inside a c4. Okay, so that's the uplift of this information. Okay, do you have questions about this example before I start doing things to it, before I start abusing it? So again, I have one D6 brain here, two here, and three on the non-compact curve. And the whole idea will be that I'll start doing things to the non-compact. Doing things to the non-compact set of three, so that there's an SL3 system living here, and I will do things to that. That's the idea. Okay, so what do I want to do? I want to focus. So this block of this map, let's call this map T. T stands for Tachyon, for those who know for the string theorists. The string theorists. This block defines the rank one sheaf here. This two by two block defines the sheaf here. And this three by three block defines a sheaf up here. You can compute the self x1 of this full sheaf. Let's call this s. You can compute the self x1. In a physics language, that corresponds to counting the number of bifundamental strings that live here, or in other words, in field theory language, the matter multiplets, the hypermultiplets more specifically. The interesting chunks of the self-xons live here, they connect the various blocks and. And if you switch them on in a certain way, you can perform a base of change, a change of base on this matrix. So you can perform automorphisms in the domain and codomain of this map in physics language of gauge transformation, such that all this data of the X that you see here is all relegated to this 3x3 block. This three by three block, but at the cost of introducing poles. In other words, in this case, X1 was a rank one sheaf plus a rank two sheaf plus a rank three sheaf. And I write it with a capital S because it corresponds to this non-compact divisor. And what I'm claiming is that all And what I'm claiming is that all the pieces of X1 can be relegated to just the data of the self X1 of the S3 at the cost of introducing hitching poles. In this case, the Hitchin poles, for instance, in the simplest case, if I want to switch on the minimal nilpotent orbit, sorry, Z2. It will look like one over, let's see, okay. So I need no E2 sorry, one over sorry, what do we eat? Was it E2, E1? Can you see? Can you see it? Yeah, E2, E1, Z1 squared, right? Do I have it right? Yes. So this will be switching on something along the direction of the minimal. This pole, this can be seen to be a local coordinate, even though it looks composite. It's chosen so that it has the appropriate projection. Has the appropriate projective degree, it has to have the same weights as the coordinate z2. If I uplift this data to n theory, sorry, as the spectral data of this tachyon matrix, I will not see this information. However, This information. However, I can now, once I have switched this data on, I can compute the new self x1 with respect to this. And this will land me in this transfer slice to the nilpotent orbit, which, or otherwise known as the Slotovy slice. In this case, it will correspond to switching on something here that is proportional to that. Now, if I recompute the character. Now, if I recompute the characteristic polynomial of this, I will get a deformation. And the deformation will correspond to having, to taking two brains that are here, fusing them with one here, and moving it over one slot. So in other words, The quiver that represented the various ranks of the she's will change like this. And this deformation is now visible in M-Serie. So that's the result of this paper that we encode, we find that for each piece of nilpotent datum, there's a very specific deformation along the slotovy slice that recaptures the information that was lost. Captures the information that was lost by uplifting this to purely spectral geometrical information. We have only covered a subset of what can be done for these threefolds, which means we can only do this patch-wise for now. It has to do with projecting threefolds down to type 2A to local K3s that requires choosing a C-star vibration along which. Choosing a C-star vibration along which to project. But we believe that this can be generalized to more complicated cases. I just gave you the primitive case that we worked on in the paper. Okay, so I think it's a good time to stop introducing material and let you ask questions. Yeah, yeah, sure. I think it was the bottom line, the right tool. I'm sorry. Can you multiply the numbers a bit more? One to three goes to one, one, one, yes. Okay, so so for instance, two brains on C2 equals zero times one brain on E2, if you add up these columns, that gives one zero. The one zero vector. The one zero vector is in the same class as this. So, homologically, it means that a rank two sheaf here fused with a rank one sheaf here is the same as a rank one sheaf in this class of curves. I'm sure this can be made into a statement about homology, although I don't know much about homology when you have mixed compact and non-compact support. Maybe there's a way to make that precise. This probably has to do with the With the class, I'm sorry, what's it called? The group class ring, or right? You can also see it by just developing the lambda with the power of the k. And you can see it's one of them. Right. So, for instance, in this matrix, I'll have the full matrix is that. So, if you compute the determinant of this thing, let's see if I did it correctly. If we're lucky, I did things well. Right. So this deformation, right. It's almost okay. So I probably have some, I might have some mistakes somewhere in what I did, but. In what I did, but there's a Z2 missing where? I'm sorry. There is a third Z2. Ah, there's a third Z2. Okay. And the Z1 should not be squared. The Z1 here is not squared? Okay. Okay. Right. And this, you can see, this is in the class, this precisely. Class, this precisely describes this quiver. There's one brain on each one of the classes. Yeah. I have many, many questions, and you're only a human being, so I can't. I really am. I really am. But thinking about the C versus the E1, actually, I think I understand sort of because again, thinking on the mathematical side. Mathematical science work I've been involved with also others like Plasma thinking about star-shaped rivers. I know those come up in this context in a related way. But you know, one interpretation, we have a star-shaped river with n marks. You can associate this with a modular space of these bundles, with a hitching system on P1 with n marks, with n function. So by that, it kind of a limit of that interpretation. And it kind of limit a limit of that interpretation. So if I have a single A type footer, I would correspond to one physically fungus on P1 with one point removed. So you're saying. I think that that's so. So you're saying we could take this and consider that there's a puncture here where nothing's going on, but there could have been something going on. Yeah, sure. We hesitated initially in the collaboration whether we should be looking at the hitch and system on the non-compact thing or on one of these curves and whether the same data. Of these curves, and whether the same datum can be recast back and forth. So then, as an extension, so does all the work in 8 byte? Yes, because it has to do with the fact that all the three folds we're considering are toric initially. And they, yeah. Okay, now this is very interesting. Okay, now this is very interesting. Yeah, so and then you know we spend actually quite a bit of time thinking about you know finite quotient singularities in that context. So it's a generalization of this picture. Yeah, yeah, well one that's very very interesting is this C4 mod that comes from the five the five pointed star C4 mod an order 32 subgroup with SU4. Okay, I wonder if you can play the same uh okay, so if it's a forceful Okay, so if it's a fourfold, then the physical context will be different. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, I'd be interested to see the answer already for the rest of the Duval series. They should all admit C-star vibrations over them. I mean, to be placed on them, and this should give rise to Calabial threefolds. It's just that I don't have a convenient Tauric description of them. That was the only, it's only a technical obstacle. It's not a fundamental obstacle. But everything. Obstacle. But everything I said should have a translation for those cases. So C would be interesting because then you can cover the E and D types. Yeah, the four point of the athlete four case. Yeah, four points. Right. And there's there it's C2 mod Tyrion subgroup QA for this. Right. Yeah. So you could extend that from this to that. Send that this to that. That would be interesting. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
