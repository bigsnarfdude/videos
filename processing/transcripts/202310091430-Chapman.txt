Okay, so the recording already started. So our first speaker of the last time, and then chat, and also on intermediate. Thank you. So hi, everybody. Thanks for you for inviting me and to participate. So it's going to be a short talk. I'm going to skip a lot of background. I'm assuming that everybody here knows probatic form theory. Everybody here knows quadratic form theory. And there are some specifics about cache and C theory, so I'll mention them needed. I managed to say what I want. So for the entire talk, phi is going to be anisotropic and non-degenerate non-degravicles rather full. non-degenerate called rattle form. Being non-degenerate is important only when you work with catches two fields, otherwise it's such an average problem over the field F, so we have this field in the background and when I need to assume something about F on O and so what is the concept? So, where is the conix coming from? If you take Q to be a Poetonian algebra of ref, then this Potent algebra has a nonform, an underlying non-form, that I'm assuming everybody knows, right? You just multiply every element by its context. Multiply every element by its contributor. And this mod form has a pure part. And the basic idea of the pure part is that you add a one-dimensional bit with coefficient one, and then you pull out a hyperbolic plane, and what's left is the pure part. So it's defined this way, and then it captures both opposite to an optimum. And you can look at the function field. And you can look at the function field for this thing, and that is going to be denoted by FQ for this fork. And that's the comic. That's the comic of the story. So at the moment you have a field extension. It's a field extension of F, right? It's a mixture of translation extension and algebraic extension. And in this sense, it's one of the smallest extensions that you could consider. And it's interesting to know when a certain form that was anatomic becomes. Certain form that was allisotropic became isotropic under this exception. So, one approach is to say, okay, so if this form became an isotropic passage because it contains a smaller form that becomes isotropic, if it doesn't happen, then this form is an Fq minimal form. And if you classify all Fq minimal forms, then you know exactly when a form becomes isotropic under this extension. Isentropic under this extension. So the general goal is to understand minimal FQ forms. So we say that phi is FQ minimal if so one thing is that phi FQ is isotropic but for any proper subject is the same. For any proper subform psi of phi psi sq s last definition and we want to so how do you define subform in that context because of characteristic tool well you just uh choose that you have a quadratic space you choose a subspace So you have a quadratic space, you choose a subspace, and you choose a smaller number. Exactly. So we want to understand how these minimal forms look like, and we have several questions. So first thing to notice is that the pure part is FQ minimal. That's not very surprising. In fact, the In fact, the dimension cannot be less than that, it cannot be less than 3. So, if this is FQ minimal, then its dimension is at least 3. And what else can you say about those minimal forms? So, one observation that was made by Aberdeen. Think only characteristic different from two. And then by his PhD student, FEV, more than a decade later, in characteristic two, they proved that if phi is if Q minimal, then it's Then its dimension is odd. So you have possible numbers 3, 5, 7, and so on. Now, it's not a full characterization, it's a beginning. Throughout this talk, this Throughout this talk, this phi is going to be non-determined. Psi can be determined. The diagonal. Yeah, I'm not changing the definition. I'm just focusing on minimal forms which are non-generic because only then we have this result. For instance, it's definitely not proven for us. Okay, so one question you could ask is whether forms of arbitrary odd dimension exist before you start classifying them, right? And the answer is yes, in characteristics we can control. So Hoffman, again Netlev. I think Netlev is the main protagonist of this. Back in the theory, and Van Geel, in 1995, showed that for any number odd number is equal to 3, there exists FQ minimal form of dimension N. They mention n when in the construction they assume that the characteristic of f is different from the two. And the argument involved quite a lot of valuation theory and valuation for a suitable f. For suitable f, yeah, yeah, not for every f, of course. For suitable f's the U invariant does not allow. But for suitable f. suitable for some F of be more precise. And it involves valuation theory and you have some issues with valuation theory in characteristic too because you're considering quadratic extensions and then you have the wide ramifications and they cause issues, but you don't have the characteristic mount. So it was not clear to me when I saw this example. To me, when I saw this example, how to generalize into characteristic 2. And I visited Anne three years ago and I asked her, are there any examples in characteristic 2 of any minimal form of dimension greater than 3? And the answer was no. There were no such examples in the literature. So what I did was was produced examples in characteristic two of dimension five and seven. There's some difficulty here. We matched it only for five and seven if somebody sees a way um to generalize it for arbitrary dimensions. It for arbitrary dimensions that we denies. And I want to explain how it works. We have more questions before I proceed. Does that mean that if dimension is phi is even, then it contains a set formation n minus 1. Yes. This n minus 1 form might not be minimal in its alright, but it's isotropic. Okay, so in the argument, I'm going to bring up certain ideas and if something is not clear, you can start me and come. So what do we need for at least let's talk about dimension five. So in this case there's a classification of non-dimensional The classification of non-degenerate minimum forms by Feb from his PhD thesis and was recovered again by Dauphin and Kevin Matthier and again later they were doing it from the point of view of progress because then it was some conclusion. So what they proved is So what they proved is that under the same assumption that it's non-degenerate, if you have a phi of dimension 5, 5 is FQ minimal if and only if. So one thing is that, okay, you can look at the Clifford algebra, but its center is not F, so you look at the even Clifford algebra. Now, it is a. Now, it is a bicotonial algebra to begin with, right? But its index might be smaller than 4, so we want its index to be actually 2. It's not equal, but it's a Brauer prevalent. So I'll call an algebra Q prime. You want Q times Q prime to be a division algebra and And we want phi to be a sub form of some scalar times one-fold bilinear fisto form times the null form of Q. It's also similar to a fistal neighbor in that sense, right? Because this thing is a three-fold fisto form, and that's five. Fista form, and that's five-dimensional, so it's also similar to FISA form. So these are the requirements, and you need to find some form that matches these requirements. And it's a little bit strange, right, how you do this. So let's see if we can play this game properly. So, what kind of fields are we going to play with? Let's take some small f0 and then you can show. And then you can chart either three transonetic variables, or if you prefer, I always like working with 3D R series, so you can look at this one. Whichever you prefer. For people who do know essential dimension, quite often you prefer to look at this thing. But for valuation theory, this one is even though you can always extend from here to there to wherever you want. And now let's have some guesses. So I'm going to take Q to be gamma, alpha. And for those who are not so proficient with the characteristic 2K, that means the alpha director over Q by some i and J such that I squared plus I is gamma, j squared is alpha, and j i j inverse is i plus 1. Is i plus 1, so conjugation by j induces the wild remote side. So that's our q. Now, what is our phi? Our phi has to be five-dimensional, so we'll take... We have to, we must have some diagonal bit, and this thing does not, it doesn't matter if you multiply spacecraft, so it might just be one. And then What do you do? You add beta times one comma gamma and you add alpha times one comma gamma plus beta. So that's the form that we're going to look at for the moment. Let's see if it satisfies all the requirements. So, number one, we need to compute the innumerable algebra of this thing, which in this case is just the Twifford algebra of this subform. And the Twifford algebra of this subform is gamma comma beta. comma beta times uh gamma plus beta comma uh okay now this is bra equivalent to the common number beta like this and this one breaks into two components two algebra so you have uh gamma alpha and you have And you have beta alpha. So that's it. Now, those two share a common slot, so you can merge them into one algebra. So it's gamma, alpha, beta. Right? Proposed. And this one you can modify by multiplying alpha by beta. So we have beta, alpha beta. Oh, but here again you have a common slot. How surprising is that? So this one is equivalent to gamma plus beta comma alpha. So that's going to be Q prime. So number one is okay. Okay. Now number two is going to be a little bit more interesting, I hope. So let's see. So let's see, I'll remind you. Perhaps I can continue. So for number two, we need the tensor product of Q and Q prime to be a division alpha. So let's see if this is actually what's happening here. So what is Q times Q prime? It's gamma comma alpha times gamma plus beta. Uh gamma plus beta comma alpha beta. Now, you can again break things, but I'll do something slightly different. One thing you can do is to multiply this one by this slot and then add gamma to this slot. That's the The payment that you have to pay. But what do we do? If we multiply alpha by alpha beta, then you have alpha first point that you can erase, and then you have just beta in the second slot. And now, if you add gamma to gamma plus beta, then you just erase the gamma and you have beta, alpha beta, but then you can just multiply by beta and you get alpha gamma. It will get it right. Did we get it right or not? Is it a division algorithm or not? Who thinks it is? Who thinks it isn't? Well, in characteristic different photo, it would not be a division of, right? Because you would have a common slot. But in characteristic 2, it is a division of. It's nice, right? We are working over, it's over our reminder. It's over, I'll remind you, it's over f naught, alpha inverse, beta inverse, or inverse or doesn't matter. In both cases, it's a division algebra. Now, I have enough time. I do have enough time, I won't mention. I'll give a... If you want the original proof, then you can just check out a paper of mine from 2009. From 2019, and it's after I'm using the Morandi's condition for the division from 1999. But there's a nicer argument than this one. In fact, this algebra over this field is the generic bipoten algebra. It's the generic bipoten algebra. And it's very easy to see why. I'll get back to the condition number three. Get back to the condition I'll read. So just it's nice enough to spend two minutes to show it. So take AB tensor CD. You can modify AB to A times B plus X squared over B comma B plus X squared. And you can modify C by adding X squared. By adding x squared plus x to it, and you don't even change d. But now, if you look at the equation b plus x squared equals c plus x squared plus x, you can find an x, which is just b plus c. And when you plug it back in, you get a form like this, right? With gamma, beta, which is the same beta as silica, and alpha. And you can extend it to any tensor product of any number of cyclic algebras of degree p over a field of factoristic p. And that's a much simpler argument for why the essential dimension is so low than any existing argument in the literature. So that might be even more interesting than the rest of the talk. Okay, let's put it aside, especially for people who do essential language. But now we're talking about minimal force, that is not Minimal force that is not infested. I'm just that's just a nice argument that you should keep. But that's a division. Okay, so number two is satisfied. And number three, what about number three? Let's see if I remember. So we need it to be a fister neighbor of a fister multiple of the norm form of Q. So let's take the norm form of Q is just this L. This alpha gamma, and you need this horrible rotation, you have this, which pops the border of the slots, and you take beta times this guy. So that's just alpha, beta, gamma. I want to find phi inside. Let's find phi inside. So this thing is basically just. Just beta gamma plus alpha times beta gamma, so find the same in superintendent. And now this one has as a sub form 1 plus beta times 1 comma gamma. And here, what can you do? You can add beta to gamma. Then it's beta comma gamma plus beta. equals beta. So this one, this bit is the same as beta colour gamma equals beta. And this form has two blocks. One is one comma graph plus beta and the other one is beta times that. So just take the first one and multiply it by alpha. So you have as a sub form here alpha times one comma ram plus beta and one comma plus data and that's our phi that's it so this is the example so that's our phi and we're good so we have an example of a five dimensional FQ minimum form in Capacity I'll just write down the example in dimension seven without proving it Without proving it. The problem is that for dimension 7, our argument was already pretty ad hoc, really counting a combinatorial argument that counts valuations. And it's not, it works, but it's all very illuminating. So if you take for dimension seven, again you take f to be, so with alpha data of the delta. delta and your phi take q to be delta alpha and phi if I remember correctly something like 1 plus alpha delta gamma 1 delta plus alpha lambda delta plus theta plus theta times one gamma delta plus theta. So you manage to show by brute force By brute force, that this thing is FQ minimal, but it's not clear how to extend this to any dimension. That's the situation. When it comes to what is left to do, of course, examples for any old dimension, that would be nice. But even in dimension 5, there's still something to do because why should we consider only not the journey? If we consider only non-degenerate minimal faults, but could also consider other minimal faults. Like you can have one symplectic block and three diagonal things, and that's still five-dimensional. And it might produce also examples, or you can even have a full classification of such minimal forms. That's another open problem to consider. Thank you, guys. Thank you very much for this nice talk. Are there any questions about this question about possibly degenerated subforms? Is it possible that all non-degenerated subforms stay anisotropic, but some and do you really need this condition that the subforms to allow them to be degenerated, that they change the definition? That it changes the definition. Ah, like minimal in the sense that you consider only non-determined cell phones. Yeah, that it does produce different accounts, but it changes the definition. It might change the definition. One should check. You are left with much fewer sub forms. But you could think that the non-degenerated ones are already enough to detect. No, but the question is, what does it tell you about? Our final goal is really to understand why does a certain form become isotropic. And that won't help you. It's another interesting definition, perhaps it won't help you understand. Because you might be missing something because you are ignoring the degenerate subcommons. Yeah, that's my expectation that you if you want what's the formula, it's like 2n minus 1, right? And you take n variables and with them you produce an example of damage 2n minus 1, that is fq. That's my expectation. But I don't see a clear formula, and even if you do produce. Clear formula, and even if you do produce a formula, I don't see a clear argument because, again, what we did was really have brute force. Any other questions? Five. Yes. In this case, the isotopes. Okay, so that might just be known already. Because so, for dimension five, what? Because so for dimension five, what Fev did was to first prove that it has to be a fistal neighbor. So that it's only like type 1, 3 and type 2, 1, right? And then 1, 3, if it's already known, it might not be another question. But still, classification of at least seven-dimensional neural forms is an interesting question. Nothing by the neural forms. What do you mean? Because once you know the right. Might see the problem but if you want to use the excellence for example, if you start with keyword Other questions
