Okay. Um all right. So uh this talk is going to be an introduction to uh real noder theory. I hope that I can convey some of the different perspectives that people working in this area have, some of the very different perspectives, and where those different perspectives have strengths, you know, to illuminate certain aspects. So the basic guiding principle of Bronoder theory. Oh, sorry. Before I start, please ask questions. I'm very receptive to questions. Just shout them out at any time. You don't have to raise your hand. Shout them out at any time. You don't have to raise your hand. And that also applies to Zoom, where you have to shout them out. All right, so the basic idea of pro-nother theory, the guiding principle, is that to study the geometry of a curve, we should study it via its explicit realizations in projective space. So this is not a new idea. So let me just highlight a couple of big things. So Klutsch's calculations that the moduli space of curves of genus G is connected. Of curves of genus G is connected using her with your yes? You can say no, but maybe for me it would be easier to follow if you remove your mouse. I'm sorry, I'm not going to remove it, but thank you for asking. But please, if you can't understand me, tell me to speak more slowly or more clearly or more loudly. Okay, so Klepsch's calculation that the moduli space of curves of genus G is connected is one big example using covers of P1. So that's some explicit. Of P1, so that's some explicit realization as a map to projective space. And I think tomorrow we're going to hear about the birational geometry of Mg using explicit realizations. So this all goes under the guiding principle of Ronodo theory. So what is the main question? I'll run another theory. So I have C as a curved genus G. G is a curved genus G. And I want to know what is the geometry of the space of maps from C to project a space of some dimension that have degree D. So that's the D. So that's the basic question. So, what you want to know about the geometry of the space of maps? Well, first of all, you might want to know when there exists such a map, so when it's not empty. And maybe if it's not empty, you might want to know what's its dimension. Can you tell me something about how many maps there are? Those are called local questions about this moduli space. You could further probe the local geometry of the moduli space. You could ask about Of the moduli space. You could ask about smoothness or where the singularities occur. Or you could ask global questions about the moduli space. You could ask questions about connectedness or irreducibility. That's roughly saying what are the discrete invariants of maps of a curve of genus G to projective space of dimension R of degree D. So I've singled out some invariants, the genus of the curve, the dimension of the projective space, and the degree of the map, but there might be more. Math, but there might be more invariants that you need to keep track of. Okay, is the question clear? Great, so let's remind ourselves, how do we think about a map from a curve to projective space? So degree D non-degenerate max from C to P R. C to PR. So non-degenerate, I mean that the image of this curve doesn't lie inside some smaller projective space embedded linearly inside of PR. So if I had a curve living inside a hyperplane in PR, I would really want to consider that as a map to PR minus 1. I wouldn't really want to think about it in PR. So these objects, as we all know and love, it's the same as tuples where I give you a line button. Tuples where I give you a line bundle of degree D on the curve, and I give you a basis, sigma naught, or sigma r. This is a basis of a base point free subspace of the global sections of my line bundle. So I need to have some subspace of the global sections, which because I have r plus one, that gives me a big. I have r plus 1 that gives me a basis. This is going to be an r plus 1 dimensional subspace. And base point free means that these don't all vanish at some common point. And then, of course, I can go back and forth between these. If I have a map F here, well, I have to produce for you a line bundle of degree D. This degree D of the map, so this line bundle L, I just pull back the topological bundle. The topological bundle O of 1 on PR, I mean sigma naught through sigma r are the pullbacks of x naught through xr, the coordinate sections of my line bundle O of 1. And to go in the other direction, if I have this tuple L and the sigma r's, I send this to the map that sends my curve to projective space where I send To project a space where I send a point on my curve to the tuple, which is sigma naught of x or sigma r of x. And of course, this only makes sense at the common scaling, but that's good because I'm going to project a space. And this wouldn't make sense if x was a zero of all of these sections, but that's okay because it's a base point-free subspace. It must have been. All right. Questions about that? I hope that's familiar. Questions about that? I hope that's familiar for everyone. So, okay. Actually, can I just make sure I get the numerology right? So, if I was looking at the non-degenerate, sorry, at the set of degenerate maps, that's higher in dimension, but like a bigger space? Well, I would allow potentially more maps because I would allow maps. More maps because I would allow maps that go into smaller projective spaces that include it into larger. Thank you for asking. But I mean, it's a theory that I don't need to include because I get everything I need by just looking really be the wrong R you're looking at. Okay, so I said one of the things in this main question is you should ask yourself when does such a map? Does such a map even exist? So that's the first thing I want to address. When should a non-degenerate map from a curve of genus G to P R of degree D even exist and And I think there are two sort of ranges where this question is easy. So the answer is always if I let the degree be super large. And this is just a corollary of the Riemann-Rock theorem. So by Riemann-Rock, So if I want to be able to find a base point-free subspace of the space of global sections of my line bundle that has dimension r plus 1, I must have that the space of sections of my line bundle has dimension at least r plus 1. So there's little h naught. I'm using that to denote the dimension of the space of sections. So by Riemann Rock, this is at least the degree plus 1 minus. degree plus 1 minus the genus. And so this is greater than or equal to r plus 1. I could hope to find such a subspace if d is at least g plus r. And of course I'll have equality here if this line bundle has no h1. And so this range where the degree is at least g plus r, also called the non-special range, because I don't need any h1 in order to bump h not large enough. H not large enough, this is sort of the easy range from the perspective of real noticeable. All right, so that's one range. The other range is never if D is too small. And this is a corollary of another big result. So this is Clifford's theorem. So, Clifford's theorem says if I put myself into the special range, so I'm not in this range, so if d is strictly less than g plus r, then I can't have too many sections based on what the degree is. So then, well, the degree has to be at least twice r. So d can't be too small if I want r to be big enough. To be big enough. So I mention these two results because it sort of narrows down where we want to focus on this question. We really want to be looking at the special range, and we're constrained by what's possible by Clifford's theorem. So Brill Nother theory is going to give us a much better answer to this question than what you would get from Clifford's theorem, at least if you take a curve which is an average curve. Curve, which is an average curve, which is a general curve. So I want to focus now for a little while on this question for C being a general curve of genus G, which means that it's a generic point or a general point in a point in an open locus inside of Mg. So I don't want curves that only, I don't want maps that only I don't want maps that only exist for curves contained in some proper closed sub-varieties of ng. Okay, so now I want to explain two perspectives on Brill Noder theory that are both very useful, two classical perspectives. So I'm in the camp of the second word in the title of the conference. So I'm going to be using classical algebraic geometry techniques to understand this problem, but we'll hear in the next lecture some very interesting. Lecture: Some very interesting combinatorial tropical techniques. But my two perspectives on this are: first, we could look at conditions on pick D of a curve for H naught to be at least r plus one. So I think this is the classical perspective on drone-leder theory. You look inside Pic D of the curve. We look inside PICD of the curve and we try to write down what are the conditions for H not to be large enough to support such a base point-free linear system. But there's also another very useful perspective that illuminates other things, which is to look at when a map from some possibly non-general curve. from some possibly non-general curve to projected space of dimension R that has degree D can be deformed to have general source. So I want to tie these two perspectives together because sometimes it's easy to write down very nasty maps from curves to projective space. Maybe the curve has Space, maybe the curve is broken, it's a reducible nodal curve, and maybe I can write down such a map, but that's not a general source curve. And then I want to understand when I can deform that to make the source general. Okay, so are these two perspectives clear and what I'm hoping to convey? Great. So unfortunately, that thing has to stay on the board over there, so I'm going to move over here. To stay on the board over there, so I'm going to move over here. So, first, I want to address the expectation of this main question in both of these two settings. And they are very different settings, so very different perspectives. So, hopefully, it'll be somewhat miraculous that they agree. Question? Okay. So, the first thing: so, we want to look at the conditions on PICD for. On pick D for H naught of the line bundle to be at least R plus 1. So, okay, here's my little picture of 5 D of a curve. And I can look at the curve cross hit D of the curve mapping to this. So this is C cross pick D, so the fibers of this are C. And on C cross Pic D of C, I can take a universal line bundle on this. So I'm going to call that L. That's a universal bundle. So what does that mean? It means that if I have a point in pick D of C, that corresponds to an isomorphism class of line bundle, L. Line bundle, L. And if I look at the fiber of C cross picti of C to this, that's a copy of the curve, C. And my curly L restricted to this copy of the curve over this point is isomorphic to the Roman L, which was that point. So it's some way of piecing these together. And now what I want is I want to look at the conditions down here. At the conditions down here for H0 of the fibers of this curly bundle to have a certain amount of global sections. So I think it would be very natural from that perspective, call this map pi, to look at conditions on the push forward of this line bundle. But this is now not such a nice object because this is not a vector bundle. Because the H-naughts vary, Because the H naughts vary, this is some coherent sheaf. There are higher direct images I might need to worry about. So the sort of trick to make this work, to get the expectation out of this, is to put ourselves in the range where Riemann rock kicks in and we have non-speciality so that this becomes a vector bundle. So you haven't seen this trick before, it's sort of how you It's sort of how you get the whole theory going. So take some very high-degree relative divisor. I'll just draw a piece of this. This is some divisor D. Say fix a finite set of points on the curve. I can make those finite set of points spread out to just some flat divisor, which is totally constant over pick D. That's my D. So let's say this is. That's my D, so let's say this is relative degree, some large number, N. Then instead of pushing forward L, if I push forward L, twist it up by D, if I made N large enough, then this is a line bundle of large enough degree where it has no H one on the fibers, which means the theorem on homology and base change is going to tell me that this push forward is a vector bundle. Me that this push forward is a vector bundle. So this will now be a vector bundle on Kick D. And what is the rank of this vector bundle? The rank of this vector bundle is the dimension of H naught. So this is a vector bundle of rank. Well, the degree of L on the fibers is D plus the degree of D n plus 1 minus G. Minus G. Everyone so far so good? Okay, but this is not exactly the thing I wanted. I mean, this has constant H naught. This is not going to tell me about where H naught of L on the fibers jumps. So I need to somehow think about the sections of this curly L twisted up by D as sections of this row and L on the fiber that are allowed to have poles along D. Poles along D. So I need to force that those residues are zero, that they don't in fact have poles along D. So I can build that. Now my picture doesn't have enough space. I can build that in. I can build that in. So I can also take L restricted to my relative divisor D, and I can push this forward. Push this forward. This is now, this just keeps track of, and it's just a copy of this line bundle on each of these fibers. So now this is a vector bundle on KPC of rank 10. It's just a copy of L on, it's just a direct sum of copies of L for each one of these. D is alright, but trivial, yeah, doesn't matter. So now my sections that I were allowed to have a pole along D, I have an evaluation map which keeps track of that residue, and the sections I actually want are in the kernel of this one. Okay, that was a long explanation to set up where this expectation is. So my conditions, this A, looking at conditions on pick D for H not to be large enough. Not to be large enough is the conditions of saying that this map of vector bundles has a kernel which is of sufficient dimension. Because that will say there are sections on that fiber that have zero residual long t. So what I want is the locus in pick D of C where this evaluation map. We have this evaluation map for E, where E has kernel of dimension at least R plus R plus 2. By the way, let me give this locus a name. Let me give this locus a name. So, this locus is called WRD of the curve. So, this is the locus of line bundles in pick T, where H naught is at least R plus R. It's exactly this perspective A on this problem. Okay, so this is what I want, and this is exactly how I give a scheme structure on WRD. So, when I was saying all this stuff about what are the significant This stuff about what do the singularities look like that implicitly references that I have a scheme structure on this, which I give the scheme structure via this map of vector bundles having a certain terminology. And it turns out it's independent of the divisor D that you choose. So what's the expectation? So I have a map of vector bundles. This is the dimension of the source. This is the dimension of the target. If I thought about this locally, it's like given by a matrix. It's like given by a matrix with these certain dimensions. And if I want the kernel to be large enough, well, what conditions is it on the matrix for the kernel to have a particular size? You could put your matrix into row echelon form, and you'd have to have a little chunk of zeros in your matrix. And so the number of zeros, so the expected co-dimension, Your little zeros, that would be a little square piece of your matrix, of size the dimension of the kernel times the dimension of the co-kernel, which in this case, based on these numbers that I chose here, the dimension of the kernel is r plus 1, and the dimension of the co-kernel, well, that's going to be n, the dimension of the n, the dimension of the vector space, which is the target, minus the dimension of the source minus r plus 1. So minus d plus n plus 1 minus g minus r plus 1. And now if you do that arithmetic, you will get r plus 1 times g minus d plus l. So that was the expected codimension. That's like the number of conditions. And I'm taking all of this in And I'm taking all of this inside of pick D, so the expected dimension is g minus this quantity r plus 1 times g minus g plus 1. And this magical number is the Bronoder number, which we call rho of GR. So basically, So basically, this number should tell us if everything is as transverse as possible, if this map of vector bundles just behaves as expected, it drops rank where we expect, it should be this many conditions, and this is what the dimension should be. All right, is that perspective on Bronther theory somewhat clear? Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just curious. The construction of choosing D and then it doesn't depend on the scheme structure, it doesn't depend on that D, I mean, then is there some modern way to just assert the existence of a law-defined scheme structure, WRD directly from some kind of X thing? Yes, you can just work. I think you can work directly with the higher push forwards. You don't have to make something, make it a vector bundle. This is the sort of classical way to get the effort. Yeah, thank you. Good question. So the the way that you sort of generous uh as a as a sort of fine cl intersection theoretical class, right, by this Tom Paul's bottom line. Yeah. Um is that of interest to or is it something you know? I mean that is I mean that is a very classical way of studying the enumerative geometry of these bronoger locies by that. Something. Yeah, yeah. Stick around for the rest of the week. Stick around for the rest of the week. Yes, so exactly. The Tom Cornius. Exactly. The Tom Fournius formula comes in to understand this as a degeneracy locus. Okay, so now I want to switch gears and talk about the expectation from perspective B. It's going to be very different. So from perspective B, we're going to say Say, let's assert the existence of a moduli space of mass from a curve of genus G to projective space of dimension R of degree D. I'm not doing stable maps or anything at the moment, but you could consider the stable maps compactification of this. And there's a map from this space to the moduli space of curves. To the moduli space of curves of G by taking the moduli of the source curve. I have some map from a curve to projective space. I just forget the map, but I consider the curve. And from this perspective, what I want is I want this map. I want this to be dominant. I want you to be able to take a general curve of genus G. A general curve of genus G and find it as the source curve of a degree D map to PR. Okay, so in characteristic zero, dominant is equivalent to asking that this map is generically smooth. That's not true in positive characteristic, but let's replace dominant by asking that this map is generically smooth. And if we do that, we'll get something strange. And if we do that, we'll get something stronger out of this. As I said, dimension is one local property that you could ask about this moduli space, but you could also ask about its singularities or is it generically smooth? And so we're going to get something stronger out of this. So is there an aspect? Yeah. So now you have lost your condition that is non-degenerate, because then I put I have lost my condition a little bit that is non-degenerate, but I will show, in fact, that there is a non-degenerate point. In fact, that there is a non-degenerate point at which it's genericism? Good question. Other questions? I'm going to construct non-degenerate points here where it's generic. Yes, very good question. Other questions? Is it going to be too much for us to ask for this map to be surjective? No, in fact, it is surjective if every curve where rho is greater than or equal to zero. Every curve where rho is greater than or equal to zero emits a map. So, good question. Yeah? Sorry. I just forgot my question. Okay, well, if it comes back in a moment of inspiration, please feel free to shout it out. With the generic smoothness, is it clear why LGPRD is generically used? Well, the answer, of course, is no, because there are ranges in which this is, there are components that are generically non-reduced, whose general member is a smooth curve. So I'm going to answer your question the way I answered this question is I'm going to construct points that are actually smooth points of this and where this map is smooth. Okay. So it's. Okay. So the claim is not with one is equivalent to generically smooth, but that well, when the source, yeah. Well, when the source, yeah, you're right. You're completely right, yes. Yeah, my question was whether it's a counterpart of that, whether you're restricting to where you single juice or not. I'm not at the moment restricting to that. And as you all know, this can have many different components. Those components can be generically non-reduced. What I'm going to do is I'm going to produce for you some case where I have a smooth point of this. A smooth point of this component at which this map is also smooth. That smooth point will be an embedding and it will be non-rejective. But there is only one component that dominates. We're getting there. We're getting there. You're jumping my punchline. Yes, indeed. Those really bad components cannot dominate MG. I could not construct points for you that were really to be done from those components. But yes. Components, but yes. Okay, so this is my very different perspective on this problem. So let's, so why did I do this? I turned dominant into generically smooth because I want to apply deformation theory. So using the infinitesimal lifting property, you can turn this generic smoothness of this map or smoothness of this map at a point into something about being able to lift a deformation. To lift a deformation of the curve to a deformation of the map. And obstructions to that live in a certain coherent homology group. So, by deformation theory, so you'll have to take this as a black box, obstructions live in H1 of the full map of the tension bundle, assuming that I'm at a point where this map F is unrampled. I'm at a point where this map F is unramified. So I have a map, I have a point here, which is F from C to E R. And if this map is an unramified map, in particular and embedding, obstructions live in this cohology. And so if I want to show that this map is generically smooth, I could prove that by proving that this obstruction is zero, this obstruction space. Why do we need a pun ramify? Well, this is not the right object. If this is not the right object, if the map is not unramified, H1 of the pullback of the tangent bundle is not the right deformation theoretic object. You should really need to be working with the cotangent complex and the derived category in general. So first of all, even writing this in terms of h1 of the pullback of the tangent bundle is not really the right way to think about it. You should think about it as x1 from o. From O to the pullback of the cotangent bundle, but even that is not the right thing if the map F is not unramified. Even vertically, even over the modulus is curved. Yeah, it's not the right object. In general, you have to work with... Yeah. Even for cuspidal curves, it's not the right thing. We can talk about this later. But anyhow, if the math isn't embedding, this is the right group. This is the right group. Okay, so now, so what, so our expectation, so we're just in the game of expectations. We just want to understand when can we expect this group to be zero. So based on that, how do we understand the pullback of the tangent bundle of projective space? Maybe one audience participation. How do you understand the tangent bundle of projective space? The other sequence, yes, of course. So, of course, that's. Yes, of course. So of course that presents the tangent bundle as P R, of P R is a quotient of R plus 1 copies of O of 1, and there's one relation for the relation. So I have this exact sequence for the tangent bundle, so now I'm going to pull everything back under my map. So this just becomes a copy of O of the curve. O of the curve. This becomes r plus one copies of, remember, if I pull back O of one under the map, I get the degree D line bundle that mapped my curve to projective space, and the tangent bundle, or pull back at the tangent bundle. So you notice from this, so there's several things that you should observe from this sequence. So first of all, this tells me that the pullback of the tangent bundle Tension bundle is a vector bundle of rank, well, it's rank R because this is rank R plus 1 and this is rank 1, and degree. Well, this whole back of O of 1 had degree D, and I have R plus 1 copies of it. This is trivial, so D times R plus 1. All right, so far so good. That's the degree and rank of this bundle. Bundle. And so you might say, well, I'm hoping that this vector bundle has no H1, and this is its degree and rank. So I can use Riemann-Rock and say that the Euler characteristic of this bundle, which is H0 minus H1, can be calculated from the degree in the rank. And, well, maybe if that is always greater than or equal to 0, I would expect H1 to be 0. There's nothing forcing it from rerun rock to not be 0. Forcing it from rerun rock to not be zero. But you would have to examine this Euler sequence a little bit harder. You would not get the right answer there. If you examine this a little bit harder, you get another observation, which is that H naught of the pullback of the tangent bundle is always at least H naught of the pullback of O of one. of O of 1, R plus 1 copies, minus H naught of O. It could be that there's some H1 here and that H naught of this is not just H naught of this minus H naught of this. However, it's always at least that. And so this is always at least r plus 1 squared minus 1 because the pullback of O of 1, that's The pullback of O of one, that's our line node that we embedded in projective space, that had to have at least r plus one sections. I have r plus one copies of it minus four. Everyone on board so far? So that's another restriction from the Euler sequence. So now if you combine those two restrictions with Riemann Rock. You will see that so H naught of the pullback of the tangent bundle minus H1 of the pullback of the tangent bundle, this by Riemann Rock is equal to the degree, so that's r plus 1d. Plus 1d plus the rank times 1 minus g. That's just the statement of Riemann Rock. And now we know, right, oh, I just want to massage this a little bit so that I'm going for mashing up this number over here. So this is what you get from Euro and Rock. So I'm just going to massage this. I'm going to write this as g minus 1 minus r plus 1 times g. times g minus d plus 1, g minus d minus 1. That's just this Riemann Rock situation. And so from this, I might expect that h1 of the pullback of the tangent bundle is 0 if and only if this thing is at least r plus 1. So if and only if g minus 1 minus r plus 1 times g minus t. r plus one times g minus t minus one is at least, oops, r plus one squared minus one. And if you rearrange this, you put this r plus one into here, you take this one and you cancel it with this one, you will exactly see that g minus r plus one times g minus d plus r is greater than or equal to zero. So from a totally different perspective, Perspective, I have got the same condition for when I should be able to find a general curve of genus G, mapping to projective space of dimension R where the image has degree D. Okay. Questions on that expectation? All right. So now, given that, I'd like to stay. Now, given that, I'd like to state the Brønweather theorem, which is going to tell us a lot more than just this expectation, and then say how you might prove it using each of these two perspectives. So, again, we're working with general curves. With general curves. So let's C be a general curve of genus G. So the first part is basically what I've been focusing on, this case of existence and dimension. So this is due to Griffiths and Harris. So the dimension of WR. Of WRD of C is, well, I want to write that it's rho, but it could be that rho has this quantity which is G minus this thing, and this thing could be negative, but a sub-variety of pick D can't have dimension larger than G. So this is the minimum of G and rho. Basically, if you're in the non-special range, and this is. You're in the non-special range, and this is bigger, the dimension is g. So you should read into this that it's non-empty exactly what our two expectations gave us, if and only if rho of grd is greater than or equal to 0. The second is the smoothness part, which recall came along for the ride when I did the When I did the dimension part via this second perspective. So that's one case where this second perspective is much more naturally led to considering the smoothness. So WRD of C is smooth away from WR plus 1, D of C, which lives inside of W. Which lives inside of WRD, because if I have at least, if I have a line bundle with at least r plus 2 global sections, it of course has at least r plus 1 global sections as well. So these are sort of the prototypical vocal questions you could ask about this moduli space. And then there are, of course, global questions you could ask. So here's one that I think we're going to hear a lot more about. Lot more about in the next talk. So, this is carrying out the Tom Portius formula. If you do that, or there are other ways to see this, so if rho is zero, and there's a finite number of points, we have an interesting enumerative problem on our hand. So, this number of points is the number of standard Young Tableau. Low on a rectangular grid of size h naught, which is r plus 1, by h1, which is g minus d plus r. So you notice in the case that rho is 0, rho is 0 says g is equal to this product r plus 1 times g minus g plus r. And so that means if I want to fill this grid that has that number of boxes, I can fill it exactly. Of boxes, I can fill it exactly with the numbers between 1 and g. And I wanted to be a standard young template, so I wanted to be increasing along rows and increasing along columns. And the number of ways of doing that exactly counts the number of points here. And finally, you can ask questions about the global geometry if rho is greater than zero. So if rho So if rho is positive, then WRD of C is irreducible. And there's a way to, oh sorry, I didn't write this attribution. This is Fulton and Lazarsfeld and then Eisenbudden Harris. Even if rho is zero, there's a way of making sense of this being irreducible, which is that the universal WRD, there's a unique component of this over Mg that is dominant. That is dominant. So there is a unique component of this that is dominant. So it's some monodrome statement. You have a finite set of points, but as you move around the moduli of your source curve, there's no way of distinguishing those points. They're as irreducible as they can be over energy. Okay, so I think, yeah, as expected, I'm not doing great on time. I'm not doing great on time. Let me write down the consequence. So, questions about the Berlinetha theorem? Let me write down the consequence that Tabby already mentioned, because I think it's going to come up later. So it's a consequence for perspective B. I've sort of phrased this in perspective A. I'm looking at fixing a curve, and I'm asking for the conditions that cut out WRD. That cut out WRD, what do I know about those conditions? But the consequence, which I think is really nice if you think about spaces of maps of curved projective space. So if rho of GRD is greater than or equal to 0, then there exists a unique component. I'm going to write it MGPRDN for the The end for the Brill Nother component inside of this possible zoo of other components such that the map from this component to Mg is dominant. And furthermore, this component is very well behaved. It's generically smooth. Very well behaved. It's generically smooth. In fact, this map is even generically smooth. We know its dimension. Its dimension is r plus 1d minus r minus 3g minus 1. So the Bronother theorem in this Bronother range picks out one very nice component in this space. Okay. Um. Questions about that? We know if this moduli space is of the extractive dimension when grow is greater than or equal to zero. The whole thing? No, that's not true. There are components of the wrong dimension, even when rho is greater than or equal to zero in the row method range. Yes, good question. Other questions? Questions? Okay, so I was going to explain how you might prove this result from the two perspectives. I think I'm going to focus only on perspective B because I think that's probably the less familiar perspective because I drew the picture already. But I think my classical algebraic geometry perspective on perspective A is analogous to Nathan's perspective, I think, in tropical geometry. So I think you'll get that. So, I think you'll get that perspective in the next talk. Okay, so how do you prove this from perspective? And so I've helpfully drawn this picture. So, what am I going to think? I'm going to think this. So, remember, what are we trying to do? Trying to show, just write the goal. For all tuples D, G, and R, where row of GRD is greater than or equal to zero, we want to exhibit an embedding, a non-degenerate embedding, F from C to PR such that the pullback of the tangent bundle under the Of the tangent bundle under this map has no h1. And now I'm going to allow myself to pass to the boundary and to work with stable maps for reducible nodal curves, mapping to projective space. So how do I want to think about this? So I need to prove something for each tuple D, G, and R. So one way I can think about this is I could fix each R and look at the possible D's and G's that I need to deal with. So that's what my picture over here is. Deal with. So that's what my picture over here is. So I want to fit R. So this picture will be for R equals 3. And then I want to look at in the DG plane. So this is G and this is D. So first of all, what do I even need to consider? I need to consider things where rho is greater than or equal to 0. So what's that condition in my example where r is 3? That says that 4d minus 3g D minus 3G minus 12 is greater than or equal to 0. So let me just draw some of that for you. So let's see. So this is 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 1, 2, 3, 4. So let's start, let's just plump up the genus, starting from genus 0. So if I plug in g equals 0, I'm going to ask myself, what is the 0, I'm going to ask myself, what is the largest, what is the smallest d where this is satisfied? Well, you can see from this 12 over here, the smallest thing is d equals 3. So d equals 3, this is the first case of something that's in the Broadler range. And then I get all possible larger values of d, because if I increase d, it just becomes easier to satisfy this inequality. So now if I move up, so these are, of course, rational normal curves in general. I'm just drawing the example, but what I'm saying is going to hold you. Drawing the example, but what I'm saying is going to hold in general. So now if I bump up to g equals 1, you can check from this, I also have to increase the minimal b. So now the minimal is degree 4. Okay, if I bump up to g equals 2, I also have to increase by 1. Notice that this inequality, this line of slope 1 that you're seeing here, this is the non-special range. This is d is at least g plus r. That's exactly what. Plus r. That's exactly what we saw as the easy range from before. g equals 3, I also have to bump up. But then something interesting happens when g is 4. When g is 4, you see I can also take d to be 6. So that's the first non-special, first special curve. And of course, it's so special it has a name. These are canonical curves in projective space, in P3. In P3. And then this pattern continues. I keep going up by one, do four up by ones, and then for eight, I again get to just laterally go over by one. And this continues forever. I mean, I don't have this next dot up here, but it just continues like this. So you see that all of these yellow circle dots in this lattice, they can be obtained starting from the Starting from rational normal curves by three relatively simple moves. I can take, I can start at rational normal curves, so I need three moves starting from here. I can increase the degree by one and keep the genus the same. So move one is DG. Is this visible enough? One is DG. Is this visible enough? Not actually. Is pink visible? DG maps to D plus 1G. That's one little move in my lattice. The next one is moving along. Moving along this lines of slope 1, so dg maps to d plus 1, g plus 1. And then the final move I need is this weird move that goes a slope less than one, which gets me from a rational normal curve to a canonical curve. And so that is the move. And so that is the move that goes dg to d plus r, g plus r plus 1. So I can start at rational normal curves, and applying one of these three moves, I can hit every other circled yellow plot. I mean, I'll need to successively apply them, but I can do that. So. So, I'd like a way, so this is just combinatoric suggested to us by the Bro-Neter numbers. That's it. That's all I've drawn. But there is very naturally algebraic geometry behind this. When you see this, you want to take a curve of degree D and genus G and attach to it some other curve so that I have a new nodal stable curve of degree D plus 1 and genus G. And genus G. Any suggestions for how I should do that? Attach a line, right? So I take some curve I have by induction and I attach a line. I'm going to call that line R. I'm going to call this curve C. This D and G, if I want to go to D plus 1 and G plus 1, any suggestions? Looking me into the two lines. A two secant line, yeah, exactly. Two secant line. Yeah, exactly. So here's C and this is R. Attach a line that's secant at two points. Okay, this one's a little bit harder to, I'm not going to draw it, but what should I do for this one? Any ideas? A rational normal curve that meets it at R plus two points. So attach an R plus two secant rational normal curve. And again, this is just suggested to us from the cognitorics. That's it. That's it. So, how does this play with approach B? I really shouldn't have erased it from other virus, but this equation approach be? Well, we want to prove non-speciality. So now, because I've implicitly drawn all of these symbetics, well, I do this processing itself, but it's just a perspective thing. I'm just, instead of writing the pullback of the tangent bundle, I'm just going to write the tangent bundle restricted to these two components. I want to prove that this vector bundle has no HY. So I could take this vector bundle and I could restrict it to just the component C. And if I'm doing this inductive procedure, And if I'm doing this inductive procedure, perhaps I know by induction that H1 is 0. And what's the kernel of this? The kernel of this is the tangent bundle of projective space restricted to the other component, but it has to go to 0 when I restrict it to C. So it's twisted down by the point. So it's twisted down by the points of intersection. And so now, if I look at the log exact sequence in cohomology, I'm squishing this piece I want to know between something that's zero and something. Now this is independent of C. I mean all it depends on is these points where R meets C. And so I would be very happy to I would be very happy to tell you how you continue this proof, but I'm not going to tell you right now. So, you use some positivity and balanced properties of the tangent bundle of projective space restricted to a general line or a general rational normal curve, twisted down by some general points to prove that this has no h. So, this doesn't quite prove the whole Bronther theorem, but it proves all the sort of existence pieces. All the sort of existence pieces of the Bronether theorem. It proves that there exists a component with all of these nice properties. So it doesn't prove the uniqueness, but this proves the existence part. Yes? How does this relate to comprehensive comparisons? It's not, it's totally different. And notice that we got something even better because we got that a general point in this moduli scale. Point in this moduli space, in this realm of other component, where we produced it, in fact, this component is unique, where a general point was an embedding, at least as long as r is at least 3. This picture was implicitly for r at least 3. And that's called the embedding theorem. It was later proved by Eisenbudden and Harris using the approach A technique, like look at the near series. So I guess if I'm going to mention one theorem, I should maybe mention that now. That now. So, yeah. Yeah. Ask a simple-minded question. So, the curves in previous though right now are not smooth. They're not smooth. Also saying that you can smooth them out? Yes, so you need to. Basically, non-speciality of this says you can smooth them out. But that's what deformation theory says. It says you can smooth this to be of general moduli and take the map along for the ride. Of course, it's. Of course, it also proves that h1 of the tangent bundle, given that you can smooth that out, h1 of the tangent bundle restricted to a general curve also has to be zero just by semi-contributing. But yes, it's sort of baked into what I'm asking. So this proves the Gieser-Perpetri theorem also. So, okay, I said I was going to mention one theorem. So let me mention one theorem. So where does Brill Nother theory go today? It would be this entire story was about This entire story was about curves of general moduli. But I think it's very interesting to ask about families of curves, general curves that don't lie in an open inside of MG, but are general inside some proper closed sub-variety of MG. And the first sort of testing round that got a lot of work was curves of fixed funality. So if I look at general points F. General points F from C to P1, now not inside of MG, but inside of the Hurwitz space of degree K covers, genus G degree K covers of P1. So now this pair, R and D, are no longer the correct invariants. They're not a fine enough invariant. So I shouldn't be studying WRD. I should be studying something else, which is I look at Else, which is, if I look at the push forward of a line bundle under this map, this is a vector bundle on P1, so it splits as a direct sum of line bundles. And this tuple, E1 through EK, is an invariant which refines the pair R and D. And I think through a lot of work of many people, including people in the audience, suggest that this is the right invariant. Suggest that this is the right invariant. And you can write down a whole analog of the Bronoder theorem from perspective A that takes this invariant into account, but I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to write down something that is proved by mining perspective B. I mean, it's not actually this exact perspective, but it's the idea of producing curves and then proving that they smooth to something of general moduli. So this is. So, this is joint work with Kaylin Hook Howell and Dave Jensen and Hannah Larson and Eric Larson. Okay, just gonna write the theorem. So, remember we have this splitting type over here. Splitting type over here, and I'm going to order these pieces so that E1 is less than or equal to up to Ek. And the classical theorem in Bronoder theory tells you that, well, I'm fixing the splitting type of the push forward, this vector E. If you know this notation, you know it. If you don't, feel free to ask me after the talk. Feel free to ask me after the talk. So, a general point of this is base point three: if, well, the classical embedding theorem of Eisenbunn and Harris would say if r is at least one. And so in this case, you have to change this into something involving the splitting type. So if ek minus 1 is greater than or equal to 0, and it's very ample, so I get an embedding. Give an embedding. If, well, I also need the r at least three condition of Eisenbudden Harris, but there's some further stuff that comes from the geometry of k-gonal curves. So if ek minus 2 is greater than or equal to 0. And the way that we prove this theorem is we write down examples in these cases and then prove they seem to generalize. So it is, it's exactly what's suggested by perspective would be. Exactly what's suggested by perspective. Okay, I'll stop. Question is from your perspective to be it seems like a coincidence that the target is P R, right? I mean, you could study the same question for other targets, but do you know any way that that has been done anyway? Any work that has been done in the very good question. So there's some work that's been done just considering rational curves and mapping to Grassmannians. That's a very natural thing. I mean, it's sort of, it's also a Berliner theory question, but it's a Berliner theory of higher rank vector tuples as opposed to P1. But the story is very far from complete. So far from complete that it's not even clear. Oh. Clear, oh, sorry, just for the, yeah, just for the restricted tangent bundle, we know something more about it. Very natural question is also to consider like hypersurfaces. These are like questions about moduli spaces of curves on hypersurfaces. I think there are some also results down there. But yeah, very good question. So I was wondering when you find that component in The component in MG PRD that dominates MG? Yep. Is there a compactification of that component that then dominates MG bar? Yes, I'm sort of implicitly using the stable maps compactification, although if you wanted to work with Hilbert schemes, that would also be okay. But yes, I'm implicitly using the stable map. But yes, I'm implicitly using the stable mass convectification, then I would then it would be natural to map to MG bar. So do you have an explicit description of what is in the boundary of the convectification of that component? Do you mean in MG? Or do you mean in MGPRD? The stable maps compact components. Yeah, which stable maps occur in the compactification of the component. Oh, oh, in the Bronoder component. Yes. Oh, in the Bronoder component? Oh, that's a super hard question. We don't even know what smooth curves appear. I mean, like, it's, yeah, like to describe the maps. Yeah, so that's the dirty secret behind all of this is like, you know, we have this open, we know that there's this open in MG, but how do you describe those words? But very good question. See in Genus 1, there's an answer. Yeah, genus zero, there are no other components. Run other component is the only component. Actually, genus 1, actually, for some small genera, if you require that the generic source is smooth, that also pins down the broad leather component, which has a worse than genus 1. But that obviously does not work forever. So, what I find kind of surprising about the technique is that you're Surprising about the technique is that your curves are glued together from so many genus zero components, and you're just, and in all cases, you're getting this vanishing result. I was just wondering, like, what kind of curves, or what kind of maps rather, would have each one of the pullback not equal to zero? Like, is it possible that nearly everything has... So this is related to like failure of he security. Failure of Hesiker Petri. So I'm not the right person to ask exactly where this fails. Maybe Gabby is the right person to ask. But yeah, no, it's definitely not going to be true for everything. For instance, I could write down, so as I said something about general curves here, if I take special rational normal curves here, I'm not going to get the vanishing one. If your curve lies on any hypersurface that you wouldn't expect, that will produce a non-latching gauge one, but just write it exact sequence. Oh, I see. Yeah. So since the positivity of the tangent bundle comes from the positivity of one, it kind of seems like your argument would give results relative to the universal pick rather than relative to the p. Rather than relative to it. Does that make sense? I'm not sure I understand the question. It is true that it comes from the positivity of O of 1. Yeah, so if you replaced the tangent metal with O of 1 in that sequence, that would still be exact, right? Yes. Yeah, you could replace this with any vector bundle that you want, and this sequence would be exact. I'm not sure. That would be like obstruction. And so that would be like obstructions of deformations at the section of the fixed line bundle. So that seems to govern deformation theory relative to pick with fixed line bundles. Yeah, with fixed line bundle. I haven't thought about that. But yes, indeed, if that was a question that you cared about the answer to, that this in the prone other range, then this technique would likely be a helpful technique to care about. Questions for Elizabeth? Questions for this fairy. Thank you very much. I think I have to
