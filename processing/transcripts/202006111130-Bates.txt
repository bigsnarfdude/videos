All right, can everybody see that? Great. Okay. And so Eric will be telling us about some joint work with Shirfindu and Alan. So take it away. All right. So thank you very much. Thanks for having me, inviting me to give this talk. And it's a pleasure to be part of this terrific series of talks we've had so far. So I want to kind of jump So I want to kind of jump back to the setting that Duncan had discussed earlier with the Aerie Sheet. And we're actually going to be going a bit beyond that and talking about the richer object that he had just alluded to at the end in the question session, which was the directed landscape. So what is the directed landscape? Just to try to bring us back to the speed. So we have this X, Y, and R, and before. And R, and before Duncan was always scaling these, and so the xy coordinates were always multiplied by this n to the minus one-third factor. Now, here we're actually going to be eliminating that factor altogether. We're just going to imagine we're already in the scaling limit. So before we had some picture like this that we imagined maybe We imagined maybe we were going between two fixed times zero and one. And it's important to remember that the Airy sheet, just given as its own object, doesn't actually encode here geodesics for this process. So although Duncan was drawing geodesics, those were for the prelimiting object. And in order to get geodesics for this directed landscape, which now allows this zero and one to vary, so let's say now I can call So let's say now I can call these times s and t, where now s is strictly less than t. And then we have this directed landscape, which is this four-parameter object, which is saying I go from space-time point xs to space-time point yt, and this is now some real number. And we call this function that maps this quartet of numbers x, s, y, t. set of numbers x s y t to r we call that the directed landscape and it had this nice anti-metric structure or in fact i i this was maybe just alluded to a bit um but let me make it a bit more precise so for any r that is strictly between s and t so we have some intermediate time then the direct landscape obeys the following composition rule so instead of looking at just fixed points Looking at just fixed points between S and T, I look at this intermediate point R, or E mediate time R. And then at time R, I imagine, well, let's look at all of the possible space coordinates. And then imagine instead of going directly from X to Y, I go X first to Zr and then I continue on my journey from Zr up to Yt. Okay, and if I take And if I take a supremum over all possible intermediate point z, so let's say this is the z that maximizes this sum, then now this isn't telling me somehow how the path, if there is such a thing between x and y, should act when it hits time r. So you can imagine instead of just restricting ourselves to a single time, let's further divide up this time interval between s and t. So I have all these intervals. So I have all these intermediate times, and for each one of these intermediate times, I can consider this variational problem of where does the z that maximizes this functional belong. And maybe it's not unique, but most of the time it will be. And so kind of ignoring some technical details that must be addressed, you can imagine that I maximize it each individual time, and then I compose all those times together in the limit, and I get some pass. And because I've chosen always the maximum, And because I've chosen always the maximizer, this path, this gamma, I'm going to call it, is now some geodesic. So to call this geodesic, it means that I'm comparing it to other paths. And so you could imagine that if I gave you some other candidate path, so let's say here's some other candidate path between the two space-time points, I could do this process backwards. Do this process backwards. I could restrict myself to all these finite times and take a shorter and shorter separation between the times, and I could construct a limiting weight for said path. So this other candidate path that I've colored here in red, this now may not be a geodetic. And for a generic path, in fact, the limiting value of this procedure would give me minus infinity. But if I just go through, just construct. If I just go through just constructing the geodesic path, I can't imagine just maximizing this composition rule right here. Okay. So we have some way of, for any given path, determining a weight according to the directed landscape. And here I've especially used the fact that I have the weight at any intermediate time. And so this is kind of what distinguishes the directed landscape from the two-parameter Airy Sheet object that Duncan was talking about earlier. And he kind of alludes. Earlier, and he kind of alluded to how you could take the Airy Sheet and from it actually get this richer object. So, I'm using this as a starting basis, and just to kind of give us a sense of what other starting facts we can use. So, from the paper that Duncan had with Janushen and Ballant, we know that geodesics do exist. So, there is a probability one event such that between any two space-time points, Such that between any two space-time points, there do exist geodesics. And you can imagine them just as being constructed by this variational property. And for any given pair, X, Y, and say I'm fixing my time horizon S T, for any given pair, it's almost surely unique. So there's almost surely one geodesic. But we have this limiting scaling object, this L, this directed landscape, and it's Directed landscape, and it's supposed to be universal. And so, you can imagine that in the same way that we'd like to study fractal properties of, say, Brownian motion, which is another universal object, as Balin pointed out in the chat earlier, the universal object here for this KPZ universality class, this directed landscape L, this also we want to understand fractal properties of. And so the question, just to get us started, that you might ask to study certain fractal properties of this directed landscape. Properties of this directed landscape, when does this fail? And maybe how does it fail? And here I'm saying it fails for random points. So for deterministic points, I know that almost surely I have a unique geodesic, and so I have to take a realization of this directed landscape, which you can imagine as it's giving me some random noise environment. Noise environment that I can then construct paths in geodesics from. Okay, so here's the question. And let me just pause for a moment to ask if anybody has questions that want to direct me. Okay, so let me recopy this picture here. And let's just consider how this question of geodesic uniqueness might fail. So, for instance, I have some geodesic between X and Y. And maybe if the geodesic uniqueness fails, maybe at some intermediate times, there's some alternative path that I could take that's equivalent. So, from the segment between where they separate and where they join back up, those two have the same path, the same weight, rather. And so, I have two. Rather. And so I have two possible geodesics and say they're the leftmost and the rightmost geodesics. Well, this kind of picture actually shouldn't really exist. And let me kind of explain why. So if I zoom in, let me take a deterministic point very, very close to y. And then let's go back to a deterministic point very, very close to x. Well, if they're very, very close, then you can imagine that the geodesic between the deterministic point close to y and the one close to x, it should like to first hook up. It should like to first hook up with the geodesic that goes from x to y, because we already know that's a good route to take. And so, in fact, for this deterministic pair of points between something close to x and something close to y, once it gets to this key fork, it could take either route. And so, in fact, if I had such a picture that I draw with the blue and the red, then you could realize deterministic points that violate this uniqueness condition. This uniqueness condition. And so, this is actually not the kind of picture we want to study. So, instead, what we want to consider is a picture like the following. So, again, I have some geodesic between X and Y. And instead of going away at a random time, I'm jumping off, leaping away from the blue geodesic immediately and not returning until I get back to the end. Until I get back to the end. This is the type of picture we want to ask: how frequently does this happen for random points in a typical realization of the directed landscape? And so the theorem that we have, that maybe I won't have too much time to explain how we get there, but the theorem is that if I look at the set of x, y, so I'm looking at a subset of R2, such that this picture happens. This picture happens. So let me copy it here. Let me do that. Paste again. So if I look at this set, then the Hausdorff dimension of this set is equal to one half. And so this gives us a fractal quantification of A fractal quantification of how frequently we observe these disjoint geodesics. And in a way that I won't exactly make precise right now, these exceptional points of geodesics do somehow encode the critical information of the directed landscape, where the action happens, so to speak. Okay. So it's just a simple statement about the size of the set, and this holds almost surely on the realization of the directed landscape. Of the directed landscape, this random object. Okay. And let me also give you another way of seeing this result. So there's also a, what we might call a unit variant version of this. So let me draw again this picture. But now instead of taking just a single point x at the bottom, let's take a second point. Bottom, let's take a second point. So we'll call them x1 and x2. And the typical way that I observe geodesics, say from x1 to y, and then another geodesic between x2 and y, is the following. But eventually the geodesics will hook up before reaching Y, strictly before reaching Y. And so the exceptional picture here Is instead having this, I have again the same geodesic between x1 and y, but now I'm going to have a geodesic between x2 and y that only reaches the geodesic, the first one, exactly at the point y. So this would be an exceptional behavior. So here again, it's important to realize what I'm fixing. So before I was fixing So before I was fixing the time horizon s and t and allowing x and y to vary. Now I'm still fixing the time horizon x, s and t, but now I'm allowing y to vary, only y. I have fixed my x1 and x2. And so if you fix x1 and x2 for a typical y, the geodesics between the two points and below and the single point above will coalesce prior to reaching y. But there will be exceptional y for which I have the picture on the right, that I have some exceptional. That I have some exceptional circumstances under the geodesics that they coalesce only exactly when meeting y. And so for this type of setting, we again have a Hausdorff dimension result. So again, let's say we have now this is a univariate version. So I look at the set of y and r such that I have this type of picture. This over. Then the Hausdorff dimension of this set is again one half almost surely on the realization of the directed landscape. Okay, and these two are very much related. So, in fact, there is some way of deducing part of the first result from the second result. And I won't necessarily go into that. I want to just spend maybe the last few minutes here explaining where this one half comes from, at least in an upper bound sense. And this will kind of get into just the very beginnings of what methods we're using here. So the directed landscape, as Duncan mentioned, was coming from this preliminary object of Brownian last passage percolation. And for this preliminary model, we have a lot of useful estimates. Useful estimates. And one such estimate is the following. So here I'm imagining the analogous picture in the directed landscape. So let's again draw some time horizon S and T. And then the event that I want to consider, so now I'm imagining something in the preliminary setting, but still on a scaled picture. The event that I want to consider is that on some deterministic windows above and below in the top and the bottom. Below and the top and the bottom of width epsilon, the probability that there exists disjoint geodesics between some two pairs of points beginning and ending in those intervals. This is asymptotically upper bounded as epsilon tends to zero by epsilon to three halves. Okay, and there's actually a generalization of this, and this is in work of Alan. So So, this is in the paper of the proceedings of the London Math Society. So, there's actually a generalization of this to k disjoint paths, where the three exponent there is replaced by k squared minus one over two. So the three halves in the case k equals two. And what this gives you is now imagine that I'm looking back at this type of picture right here. Well, in the pre-limiting setting, you should imagine that I'm taking this. And then I'm taking this sort of picture. But now I'm allowed to vary the top and the bottom. So you have some entropy factor. So you have, on a unit order interval, you have epsilon to the minus one windows you could take upstairs, epsilon to the minus one windows you could take downstairs. And then you multiply that by the probability that's tending to zero of epsilon to three halves, and you're left with epsilon to the minus one half. And this one half is exactly where you should imagine this. You should imagine this Hausdorff dimension of one half coming from, at least for this result. And this is actually obtained in a similar way, but you have an intermediate step because you're only very the point upstairs. So this just gives you some of the sense of how the preliminary objects and the limiting object are interacting. And there's a back and forth. And the importance of studying these sorts of questions relates exactly to that back and forth because we think the direct landscape should be. We think the direct landscape should be a limiting object. So, with that, I'll stop here and ask for questions. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much, Eric.
