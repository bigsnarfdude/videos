First, the share and then connecting. Let's try that. We also use shift on the shape. You just shift going down the share and just project that computer zoom. Oh, why don't we do this? Like if you're on the Zoom, you project sharing your screen, it's just going to be like if I do share your screen and then we reclaim it back. Oh, I see.  Great, thank you, thank you for the invite and also with unexpected guests in the room. Like I'm not pointing it but me, but you know people there like well look some people here, right? So better protection. So, now actually, I can use one of my favorite phrases, and now for something completely different. Because most of you haven't seen stuff that I will present, you haven't seen the data, probably you, and I know, Chad, that I'm not sure if anybody else, maybe some of the weak kind of group participants might have seen a portion of it. But what I'll be talking about is how It's how that impact exposure in American football, specifically in American college football. How does that affect the risk of concussion? And actually, if it was more kind of a general audience, I would say, should you advise your kids to play football? I won't make comments on that, but I guess it's recorded. So the thing is, let me go over kind of a big picture first and then I'll go to the data. So basically what this study is trying to do is the study is trying to look at kind of multimodal, in a multimodal way, at concussions. So of course we have to look at the brain, but we also collect kind of clinical functional data. What I'll be talking about today is more Be talking about today is mostly this biomechanics of injury and exposure to heading budgets. But we also have data, we collected blood samples, so we can do all the omics stuff that you want because we have aliquots, we store them, you can go to kind of biobank and request them. So, why do we do that? The snake is right in the middle here. That's better. So prevention, rehabilitation, return to activity. How does it affect your academic performance as a student? And also, you know, it's, I mean, these are the big goals, the therapies that we can target to CONCAS players. So I'll talk about this big study, the CARE Consortium. So it's concussion. Consortium, so it's concussion assessment research education study, but I will concentrate on head impact measurements. What is the study? We, and I promised some of you at breakfast that I'll talk a tiny bit about the history of the study. Actually, my personal history with the study is I was actually on a sabbatical at Hopkins. Yes, everything goes back to Hopkins. And I get an email from. An email from my colleague from my whole department. Oh, there's this study, you know, I know you are interested in brain imaging, in kind of accelerometer. Would you be interested in kind of participating in this study? This was on May 2nd, 2014. You'll understand why I'm saying the exact dates. So on May 14th, the grant application gets submitted. On May 29th, it's all 2014, the funding of $25 million is. Funding of $25 million is announced on the loan of the White House by then President Obama. Can get better. This was like my thing. My career is done. Don't have to do anything else and just can work on the study. Now, if you can imagine, we were enrolling students at 30 schools, 30 colleges. The study was funded by the end of May. We had to start enrolling them before the football season started. It's not only football, all sports. Football, all sports. College, that's August. So June, July, hell. But we enrolled like the first group of athletes in 2014. The rest is history, as they say. Over 50,000 student athletes enrolled, over 5,000 concussions. And we are going through the third renewal, so we're on the third round of funding, over $100 million in funding. Over $100 million in funding plus. And this is something that I got asked also about how do you do secondary data analysis. And I want to put something out there that I'm not doing secondary data analysis. This is, I'm part of the consortium, but then I apply for like R01 grants to actually do more with the data that have been collected. So I don't know if you would put it as secondary data. You would put it as secondary data, it's more kind of a spin-off of something that has been collected. So, just to you know, 30 schools and you know, the whole kind of administrative thing, but what I'm concentrating on is the data that have been collected in kind of smaller group of schools, six schools, where, and I'll be concentrating on the head impact measurement. Now, you might be wondering. Now, you might be wondering, can I access data? And the answer is yes, because for all the concussion studies, all the traumatic brain injury studies, we have to upload the data to this feedbeer at NIH. A short story, and I know I go off on the stories here. Hopefully, it won't take too much time, but the first time we tried to upload the data, we broke the system because we're uploading tens of thousands of athlete data. Of ETH's data, but you can get demographics, outcomes, imaging, biomarkers, and so on from that thing. So I won't go too much into that. So these were the original aims. And I just want to point out, no, I really concentrate on the last aim, the original study, how impact sensors can help us both in kind of diagnosis of concussions and actually in Concussions and actually we mean post-concussion recovery. What is a concussion? You get hit in the head and then nobody knows. It's like the this is not like you know that somebody has a thing that oh you are concussed versus you are not concussed. It's still a medical evaluation and this is based on signs and symptoms. So it's not exact science. Exact science. That's why what you will see in my presentation, I don't even call the things that cause the concussion, that probably caused the concussion, and event that caused it. It's like a suspected event, because we just don't know. So, in terms of data that I'm actually using in my work, I have data on over 700 American college football players. Some of those players participate. Players, some of those players participate in multiple seasons, over 1100 seasons. Now, what we actually collect, and I'll show you the data. So, I won't give you any answers today. I will just, you know, plug in, and I know Julia is already bored. So, even though we had over 700,000 impacts, we have all Impacts, we have only 84 concussions. I put in quotation marks because, you know, it's, of course, we don't want to have more for the optics. For science, a few more would be useful. Just say. Just say it. Now, the thing is, it's kind of what we see if you watch NFL and CAA, we see what's happening during the games. Here, I'm showing in our data, I'm showing in our data. This is just the fall season. Actually, in the fall season, we had 68 concussions. So, this is pre-season, end-season. So, the concussions that were sustained during the games or during the competition are in red. What do you see here? A lot of blue. It's the ones you don't see. Not the flashy things, you know, that they take somebody from the field to the sidelines and so on. Sidelines and so on. Majority of the concussions actually happen in practice. So they enter a season already concussed? No, so it's yes, some of them, yeah. So this is pre-season. Sorry, I should have explained that. So the minus, it's, and this is highly regulated. It's not that one school can start their pre-season, you know, two months before the season starts. This is super highly regulated. You can only have 25 days of contact. 35 days of contact before the season starts. So, here, this will not go to 30 or 40 before this. So, actually, approximately, I think a third of concussions already happened before the season started. And then, even during the season, many of the concussions happened in practice. So, most of them happened at the initial training? Not most of them, but you know, it's like many of them happened, right? You know, in this. Well, you want to get on. Well, you want to get on a team. There's 100 players that could be participating, and you are playing for one of the top teams. You really want to be on the team. And they allow them to enter a season Concast. Concussion is not something permanent. You get concussed, you recover. Maybe too much personal information. I've had at least two concussions in my life, and I function. And I function, somewhat disagree, but kind of normal. It's a, you know, it's a the fortunate thing, it's it's actually we're not talking here about like car accidents or about, you know, falling from like five floors or something like that, where you really might be in a coma. Or, you know, this is mild traumatic brain issue. You get hit, you recover for a week, two weeks, you are good to go. Go. How often do you see people getting repeatedly uncrafted? Very good question. Not super often, because what happens, you have truncation. If you get, we had players who get, like, who got two or three concussions. It seems the magical number is three. Three plus. It seems that there is something happening that actually that. Happening that actually that really affects your health. 1-2, representative of 2, okay. 3-plus, you know, it seems to. So in our study, there were a few players who sustained two concussions. There were even some who sustained two concussions in the same season. That's not great. But not super common either. It's not super common, no. But again, it's a certain bias, yes? Because you sustain a concussion, you might. Concussion, you might, well, this is actually one of the things we're studying. What happens with those players after they sustain concussion? Do they change the style of play? And this is something it's actually not as easy to see because this is the data we have. But we won't have time to talk about the video imaging data. We have videos from a few games where we can kind of connect what we record from the sensors and actually something recorded. And actually, something recorded. We had actually, this is nice to have money because you can have research assistants who go for the same movie like 50 times because then they concentrate on each player trying to match the kit to something on the okay, so this after this reports. Okay, thank you. So this is actually, so we have a website, it's canceled. Is actually, so we have a website, this CareCon Social website, and I just copied it directly from there. So I just wanted to show you what, you know, official kind of message that we're giving from this time and from prior side. So this is what we found. You know, this was published a few years ago. And so there are three points. Concussion risk is associated either with the magnitude of a single impact, some of them, it's the cumulative impacts. It's the cumulative impacts that players sustain, or, and this might be all combined, that somebody's susceptibility for concussion increases after their cumulative impact single or during kind of season or something, or they might have predisposition, genetics, other kind of demographic things that predispose them to concussions. To concussions. So I know it's not very satisfactory, but this is the state of the science. We don't know yet. So, data. I said we have about 700,000 of those impacts. We collect them from six sensors that were placed in the helmet. These are actually uniaxial sensors. So the data that we actually get, what was the term medium-rare, we don't get the raw data from those sensors, we get some. Those sensors, we get something called resultant linear acceleration. This is calculated actually what Jasek was saying about the magnitude of the energy of walking. So, this is basically the length of a vector that you get from those six sensors. You can get, you know, here we're talking with walking two, three, four G. Here I'll show you the data, you can get a hundred G. And get 100 G. Let me repeat that. 100 G. This is instantaneous, but this is 100 times the curve accelerator. So this is the software. Actually, unfortunately, this system doesn't exist anymore. So it was expensive. The helmets, you see, it has to be fitted into a helmet. You change a helmet, it's more difficult to do it. These days, well, the measurement moved. Well, the measurement moved to moucards. This is the most common thing that's used, but we still work with this data, we still want to extract things from this data. I want to go through all of that. This is one thing that's when kind of non-statisticians get into such a field, or when engineers get into such a field, sorry, I'm offending many engineers in the room, but basically you can recognize this. Basically, you can recognize this logistic kind of regression here that they feel. Said, okay, let's put all the impacts and see this was not on our study, this was on the prior study. And these authors actually, they are participating in this pair consortium, Steve Rauson and Stefan Buma. And they derive this, you know, based on this result of linear acceleration and rotational acceleration. What are the, you know, this equi-risk curves? So if you are below here, Here, you won't be able to see it in the zone. So, if you are below here, you have less than 1% risk of sustaining a concussion if your heat is, let's say, linear acceleration of 60 and maybe rotational acceleration of 2000. Great. Okay, so this was derived. Now we We plotted suspected events in our study on those derived kind of curves. What do you see here? Many of the hits that were below 1%, so all of those things, this is below 1% risk, they're suspected events for concussions. So something doesn't compute. So, something doesn't compute. Either the curves are not, you know, good, or there are different back accesses. So, this is how we got a few million dollars from NIH, got funded to slide the cumulative head impact exposure. Because this is just single impact, suspected event, and we just, I mean, I'm not saying this clause was the reason we wrote the beautiful grant, but you know. You know, okay, so this is this NINDS grant. I collaborate with one of the former care consortium investigators, Dr. Stenter, at Medical College of Wisconsin. So I won't deep go into this, but one thing I want to show you is we did this video verification on ICV, the research assistants. What happened here, this is just the time, these are players on the y-axis. On the x-axis, Axis on the x-axis, y-axis are the players, just random order, x-axis is the time, the red things is the time of the game. So what happened here? How many impacts before the game? I demonstrate on somebody. Okay, I will demonstrate myself. Have a good game! Have a good game! You have a good game! You get. This gets recorded, okay? So, one of the things. It's a little bit more intense than that, usually. You want to volunteer? I can show my feedback. So, I have to say there is a setting on this, not only devices, on the I mean, the beautiful thing about the system was that the data were recorded continuously. However, it was only saved if a certain Saved if a certain threshold was crossed, and this threshold is set at 10g. What we're finding, and this is, you know, I'm working actually on that with Luo Sierrao and his student, we're finding that actually what matters is mainly something above like 30G. So, you know, this is one of the things that again, that's why I'm saying I'll give you more questions than answers today. But we have this verification, and this is great because we could see. because we could see the like during this one game over 1200 impacts were verified to happen within the game within the game time and actually see this is ncaa we don't have 27 cameras as in nfl that you can you know see everybody pretty much at every time some impact might have Some impact might have happened, but it was not on camera. So we still were able to verify, video verify that were on the video over 900 impacts in this one particular game. One of the things, and this is just something, again, this is one of the small results, but one of the things is not everybody in the game sustains the same head impacts and the same number of them and so on. So, but are there positions where actually the Where actually the number of impacts varies as a function of a snap count. Snap is a play in football, yes? So you have a snap, you play, and then you know. So we're trying to see, yes. I don't know anything about it, but where are these OLs and LBs? Everybody knows that where? Quarterback, wide receiver, running back, tight end. What's the OL though? Oh, that's a sign. Big dude. Thank you. Sorry, I was just trying to interpret something. So DL and OL, if you can imagine, if you imagine me multiplied by 1.5, the weight, the height, and everything, these are the guys. I thought the QB was giving you guys. No, so here we it's a smaller number of impacts, but you know, here what we're interested in per snap, how many impacts you get. So that the slope is the lowest for the actually for the quarterbacks. So they're most protected. They should be. Okay. But you know, so that makes sense. If you watch the Super Bowl, you would see that one of the quarterbacks was not as protected. Anyway. Anyway, so okay. So what were actually how many minutes do you have? It's too interesting to stop, yeah? We have the room till eight, so are you gonna need to like padimote? So let me ask you the question and I won't give you an answer. So we were interested in this humanitarian. We were interested in distributed exporters. So the thing is, if you just plot the data, let's say, you know, some of the measures, let's say, control, non-concast controls, and the concast, good luck. Can't see anything. 700,000 things, you know, accumulation, you know, it's hurtless. So fortunately, I had a very good research assistant who developed a few shiny arts where we can display all the impacts. You know, you can choose a player, you can. You can choose a player, you can choose the location of the heat.
