To make a bit of a mess, which I am well known for, but that has nothing to do with Professor Pulani. That's all my own. So, let's see. I may not be able to do all of this, but I want to generally explain in broad terms how something that was done about 70 odd years ago by Mackey, known as the Mackey Imprimitivity Theory. As the Mackey imprimativity theorem is related to the notions of holomorphic induction, ordinary induction, and homomorphisms, contractive homomorphisms, and so on and so forth. Like Mike was explaining yesterday, it's a question of going away from star representations to ordinary representations of function algebras. Many of what I am going to say: Many of what I am going to say can be done in the context of a bounded symmetric domain with a commuting tuple of operators with the joint spectrum of the commuting tuple equal to the closed boundary symmetric domain. But for today, depending on how far I go, I'll try to stick to just the disk, the biholomorphic automorphism group of the disk, and then try and see what happens there. And see what happens there. So, in the beginning, I want to explain these general ideas and specifically talk as an application what happens when one talks about the MOGAS flu. But let me begin with a question about invariant subspaces that we have been asking around both to the harmonic analysis community as well as people working on invariant subspaces. So far, we have had more luck, and I must tell you that. More work, and I must tell you that the answer to this question is fairly trivial if you are looking at just the L2 of the circle because of the lax Berlin Halmost curve. So, here is the question. One looks at what are called the weighted Bergman spaces and the weight. Oh, sorry. How far did I get the So, the weighted Berman spaces are just square integrable measurable functions on the disk where the weight is this, 1 minus absolute z square to the power lambda minus 2. This is looked at from different points of view by different people. This is just the very first step in what are called discrete series representations, and when lambda is Lambda is exactly equal to 1, the corresponding, I mean, the subspace of holomorphic functions which is sitting there. Inside this, there is a subspace of holomorphic functions. And when lambda is exactly equal to 1, that subspace becomes 0. And that somehow is related to notions of what might be called limits of discrete series representations. And you know, this is. Deasons and you know, this is as I will explain in a minute related to questions of subnormality of the multiplication operator in the range lambda greater or equal to 1. So, the question that I want to state is the following. You have that L2 space and you have the derivative of an element from SU11. As I said, for all practical purposes, this G is nothing. Is this G is nothing but a mobius map acting on the disk? Okay, so think of G as just a mobius map. Look at its derivative and this derivative is acting on the disk as just a function. The group G acts on L lambda, this Hilbert space by a unitary representation via the multiplier G prime Z to the power minus lambda over 2. I hope I have written that down. Yeah. So, um down yeah so um so the representation actually is u g inverse of f given by g prime z to the power lambda over 2 multiply that compose with g and I have put very smartly the g inverse on the left side I always get this messed up I still might I mean if we are lucky but but the g inverse is on the left as a result this is actually a genuine representation and the unitarity actually the way And the unitarity, actually, the weight is chosen so that the unitarity follows from just the change of variable formula. So, UG is a representation in the sense of, it's an induced representation in the sense of Mackey. I'll have more to say about that. Let's not get bogged down by that. The subspace H lambda, this is the problem that I want to state. If nothing else happens, I'll be happy to walk away after just stating this problem and if I see that. This problem, and if I see that you know we have some idea about how to answer this question because it's really somehow fundamental, and you know, okay, so we have the subspace of holomorphic functions inside that space. H lambda, and this is something that I have been talking about for last so many years. People have studied representations of these functional algebras that we call contract. Functional algebras that we call contractive homomorphisms, and in representation theory, one talks about representation of a group. What the imprimativity does is to say that on a Hilbert space, if you have two actions, one is in the language of Ron Douglas is a Hilbert module, it's a module over the polynomial ring, but at the same time, it also admits an action of a group via these unit engines. The question is: what happens? The question is: What happens if we try to understand properties of this simultaneous action? That is exactly what incrementivity is all about. And that's the same as induction in terms of that, you know, what sort of representations can have that implementivity property. But here is the question: this subspace of holomorphic functions, clearly, because the representation is composition. Because the representation is composition by a holomorphic map and multiplication by a holomorphic map. The subspace of holomorphic functions is invariant by the representation, all of them. And the subspace of holomorphic functions is also invariant under the multiplication. Now the question is, is this the only invariant subspace simultaneously invariant under the representation as well as the multiplication? Now as I said, this is This is something surprisingly we have been asking around, and this actually occurs way back in Rudin's book on function theory on the ball. And I can go on to topological linear spaces and try to ask a more general question of this sort. I'll briefly hint on such matters later, but you can ask a similar question if you think of the UG. After all, UG doesn't help. After all, Ug doesn't have to be unitary. That multiplication times composition is of homomorphism. So you have UG not necessarily defined on a Hilbert space but on C infinity D. And then you can ask the same question. The C infinity D is and as I said, well, that's one of the main things I wanted to talk about. The other general idea. Other general idea, and I must repeat: I mean, this is just the question in the case of the disk. I mean, there are vector-valued analogs, there are multivariable analogs, and so on and so forth. None of that seems to have been touched. And the reason I am interested in it is that it is connected with subnormality. And since the movement problems were mentioned a couple of times, it's related to questions about. It's related to questions about for what range of lambda do you do have moment sequences. These inner products come from moments. Okay, so now let's talk a little bit in abstract terms about Machine predictivity, which is that although I am talking about a Lie group here because these biolomorphic automorphism groups always end up being a Lie group, generally speaking, what is called the machine machinery. What is called the Machi machinery applies to locally compact second count double groups on acting on a topological space, which is again assumed to be locally compact. But I'll be more restrictive, not that it really matters. So G is a connected Lie group, H is a closed subgroup and G mod H I will think of as cosets, the coset space and I will take some 0, just a level as a base point. As a base point, then the group G clearly acts transitively on this possessed space. And now comes what I was talking about, having two different kind of actions on a Hilbert space. So suppose that you have a unitary acting on a Hilbert space K and this unitary is assumed to be a homomorphism, in other words, it's a representation. In other words, it's a representation, and you talk about having a row which is a star homomorphism of the C-star algebra of continuous functions vanishing at infinity, if you like, C0D on the algebra of all bounded operators. Now, given these two actions, here is the imprimativity relation. ug star rho f ug is rho of g dot f. is rho of g dot f. g dot f of course is just the usual f composite g inverse. Okay. So I just want you to look at it for a second. This is what I have been talking about I think in 1995, Sierra perhaps is when I wrote this relationship down the first time and I didn't know how to say incrementivity and I think I have improved and now I can say Have improved and now I can sell improved without thinking about it too much. So, that relationship, if you I mean, this will come up later, but what I have been calling homogeneous operators, if you take, I mean for a sister algebra, just take F to be the coordinate functions ug star ug, and then what you will find here is f applied to that n topper. Okay, so what you are talking about is that you are. So what you are talking about is that you have n-tuple of operators, you make a group act on it, and the orbit, modulo-unitary equivalence, you want to be a single one. That's what imprimitivity is. That's why perhaps it is called imprimitivity. Okay, now I want to spend a couple of minutes sort of saying it's a role or relationship in general representation. So the why should one care and this. Why should one care? And this is, I mean, I don't know how one comes up with ideas like this, but this is somehow related to what are called multiplier representations and induced representations, which of course you don't see in this relationship at all. This relationship, except for the fact that this D is a cosette space and therefore there is a subgroup. There is a subgroup somewhere. There is a subgroup somewhere, but this relationship restricts the nature of the representation that you can have. I mean, the moment you is supposed to, I mean, the moment U satisfies this, of course, this is a stupid type over. Yeah, the moment this satisfies this equality, the representation U is highly restricted and indeed it turns out to be a representation induced from some. Representation induced from some appropriate representation of that subgroup H. Okay, so to explain that just a little bit and briefly, a multiplier is a C infinite map. So this unit representation is going to be a multiplier representation as long as it satisfies the inclusivity relationship. And therefore, let's just say what is a multiplier. A multiplier is a map like this. It doesn't have map like this. It doesn't have to be C infinity. In fact, I'll take it to be holomorphic sometimes, but in the most general case, it is actually a boreal map and you know where the groups are as I said locally compact second countable. This relationship itself tells you that M of E, Z is identity and this M because of this relationship gets completely determined as soon as you know the values. As soon as you know the values of mg, 0. Moreover, sigma m H, if you define it to be M of H, 0, is a representation of the subgroup H. And of course, you have these algebraic relationships. The moment you have a multiplier like this, satisfying this relationship, you can define a representation of the big group by this relationship. But now, notice that representation of the group of the group of But now notice that representations of this kind somehow have a representation of the subgroup built into them. Saying that you have a multiplier means that it is somehow coming from a representation of a subgroup. Conversely, the map pi called a multiplier representation, if it is defined this way, this is a homomorphism. So if it is multiple, I mean if you have a unitary representation, not representation, if you have a unitary map. If you have a unitary map which is of this form and you demand that it's a homomorphism, then this guy that you are multiplying with must be actually a multiplier, must be actually a multiplier, yes. Must satisfy this relationship. That's a direct algebraic verification. Okay, so a homomorphism of this form is called a multiplier representation, comes from a representation sigma of the subgroup H. A multiplier representation. Group H, a multiplier representation of G with multiplier M sigma is said to be induced by sigma. Okay, so you have multiplied representations, and that's the same as saying you have induced representation. If the representation sigma is unitary, see up to that point I didn't have to have unitality, okay. All of that was algebraic, if you like. But if I assume that, I mean. See, this thing that is defined, it can be defined. Yeah, here I have said C infinity D, V. In fact, you can be even more general. This can be space of continuous functions, other topological linear spaces and so on and so forth. But if you want unitarity, this is achieved by Mackey. That was the main point about Mackey's induction. How did he do it? How did he do it? For that, there are two things that one has to know. There is a measurable cross-section. Oh, before that, okay, measurable cross-section. What else do I need? Oh, I need a yeah, I need a quasi-ingene measure. Okay, first of all, whenever you have a G mod H, there is a measurable cross section that you can pick. In fact, because I am assuming I have a Lie group and I have a subgroup, I can actually pick this cross section. Pick this cross-section to be holomorphic, doesn't have to be. And cross-section, of course, simply means that P composite S is identity, just like on piverses. Landing in the pivots is what one is saying. The second thing to note is that on any such G mod H, there is a quasi-invariant measure. Of course, that means mu composite Lg and mu are absolutely continuous for all G. Continuous for all G in G. Well, I don't know if I wrote, I think I wrote what L G was, right? No, I didn't perhaps. Doesn't matter. Yeah, so L G this is the post express, this is simply defined as G G prime X. Well, I don't need the bracket here. Again, there might be something about the inverses that I have not going to worry about. These measures are absolutely continuous with respect to each measure. So there is a measure so that if you look at the pullback of the measure under this map Lg going from D to D, then that measure and the measure mu are absolutely continuous with respect to each other for every G. So, now to produce what Mackey did, you just consider the Hilbert space L2 G mod H and take this absolute, I mean take this quasi invariant measure. One of the things that one proves, and this one could look up several places, in fact I was very surprised when I first saw it, the major class of this quasi-invariant major is uniquely determined. Determined. So, you have this God-given measure or measure class rather. You look at L2G mod H mu comma D. Then the representation induced from a united representation sigma acting on B, this is some finite dimensional subspace, finite dimensional inner product space. Actually, saying that finite dimensional perhaps does not make much of a difference, but I will assume finite dimensionality. Finite dimensionality. Then the induced representation, remember G prime H is like a point in my space. This is an element in the coset space. You multiply with this Radon-Nicodem derivative, compose with Lg inverse, F composite with, I have written this twice, this F composite Lg inverse is a mistake. This is a type of, so this is multiplied with this radon-nicotium. So this is multiplied with this Radam-Nicotem derivative. F composite Lg inverse, remember is taking values in the finite dimensional vector space capital B and this representation you apply to that F composite Lg inverse. Now H is determined from the relationship if you do a little calculation again, slight bracket here is missing. G times S L G inverse G prime H has to be of the form S G prime. has to be of the form S G prime H H and that is the H that I am using V H. V H is acting so couple of typos here this this shouldn't have been there and there is a bracket okay Mackie's imprimativity theorem then says that any pair u comma rho of imprimitivity that is the group representation u and the star representation rho that satisfy the imprimativity relation The imprimativity relationship necessarily appears as an induced representation. That's the same as saying it is actually a multiplier representation. Now, not surprisingly, even though it was late 1950s or so and spectral theory was sort of in its intensive, but Mackey essentially classified all such intimidatives. All such imprimativities of two equivalents. That's one of these. And this whole thing came to be known as Machy messing because what it tells you is that you take a representation of a smaller subgroup and those are much easier to understand and then you can induce to the representation of the whole group. So now this is all that I want to convey. Now the question is all of this is about All of this is about star homomorphisms and unitary representations. I am not going to change anything about the unitary representation. But what I am going to ask is, in that imprimativity relationship, if you instead of taking a star homomorphism, if you take an ordinary homomorphism of a function algebra, what sort of questions arise you, what sort of answers can you expect? Now, since as I said, I tend to get everything messed up, let me just say. Get everything messed up. Let me just say that as opposed to ordinary induced representations, there are what are called holomorphically induced representations. And when you stop taking a star representation, instead you go to an ordinary algebra representation, it in some very large sense corresponds to. sense corresponds to holomorphically induced representations and that in turn corresponds to what we call subnormal operators or subnormal operator topics. That in turn corresponds to deciding whether certain things are moving sequences, which in turn corresponds to via the common Douglas theory whether certain holomorphic permission vector bundles actually come Vector bundles actually come from inner products and so on and so forth. So, there are a number of different things that get connected. So, these slides I am going to go over very quickly and just flush through because these are just definitions of what is SU11, what is the Mogius group, how do you, you know, there is a Mogius group, then SU11 sits on top of the Mogius group as a two-fold cover, and then you have the universal cover. We have to worry. The universal cover. We have to worry about the universal cover because we want to take t times z to the power lambda, where lambda is a real number, and that you cannot do without going to the universal cover and still hope to have even a Borel map. So we will go to the universal cover. And things are very concrete here. You can write everything down. But this is where I will scroll down again. A bounded linear operator T on a complex separable Hilbert space H with spectrum. Operable Hilbert space H with spectrum contained in the closed unit disk is said to be homogeneous. If you plug in this operator into the Mogesh map, well, the Mogesh map is a rational function with the appropriate spectral mapping property that Raul was talking about yesterday. Here, of course, it's just a trivial thing because it's just polynomial mapping. You get that your definition says. Your definition says that if you do this, this should be immutably equivalent to the original operator t for every Mogius map. That's homogeneity. Now let's sort of try to connect that notion of homogeneity and imprimativity and so on. So as I tried to explain in the beginning, the star homomorphism The star homomorphism ρ n induced by n, as long as you are a normal operator, the homomorphism that we talked about in the imprimativity theorem is actually induced by just a single operator n. You can just say rho n of f or t rho n of f is f of n. This is what I meant by saying that I will mess things up. This rho n f is f of n. This rho n f is f of n. There is no t there. Satisfying the imprimativity condition is easily checked to be the condition of homogeneity for the operator n. So the homogeneity condition is that this phi of t is unitarily equivalent to the original operator t, and that's exactly what the implementivity is because if you look at is because if you if you look at this f of t or f of n rather that by implementivity is supposed to be unitarily equivalent to the group g acting on f and then u g star ug okay applied from left and right write that down so u g star rho rho of rho of m u g supposed to be rho of n except this is f dot g or where this g is the modest name e to the power i theta i z minus i 1 minus i power theta. say 1 minus 4 okay that's the that is generally the incrementivity condition okay so so for normal operators you know we should be able to answer this question rather easily that what are what are all the normal operators that satisfy this condition because you have spectral theorem at hand and I will sort of say something about it. About 30 odd years ago what we had tried Ago, what we have tried and proved, and this takes some kind of selection theorems, this, that, because everything is supposed to be happening in the category of boreal maps, which is something that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I hardly understand what's the nature of a boreal map, but one of my colleagues, Ed Ejef from Athens, Georgia, that was in, I don't know, 85 or so, explained to me very carefully and wrote down. Explained to me very carefully and wrote down notes saying why all of that works. There is a Kenugi-Nobikav selection for whatever it is worth which tells you that whenever you have such a you know at the operator level you have just that. Here of course when you say imprimitivity you are saying you already have a representation but our homogeneous definition did not have a representation. What this is saying What this is saying is that even if you start with something that does not have a representation built into it, a representation appears. So you are always having a representation somehow. So if T is a contractive, irreducible, homogeneous operator, then the homomorphism rho t induced by T, just like the normal case, namely this one, this time I did not make a mistake, rho t P is P of T is the component. P is P of T is the compression of unimplemented T. That's exactly the Nash pierce theory. In other words, what you are saying is if you are looking at a contraction, that induces what is called a contractive homomorphism. All contractive homomorphisms are compressions of star homomorphisms. That's the Naspreas theorem. They are compressions of star homomorphisms. What we proved some years ago is that. Some years ago, is that actually the converse is true. In other words, if you had a contractive homogeneous operator or contractive homomorphism, contractive module, whatever you like, then it actually lifts to a star homomorphism with the unitary that also lifts along with it, and you have a larger. A larger relationship. And this just want to make a comment here. I think the definition here looks somewhat familiar with self-similarity of the group. Uh-huh. Self-similarity. Yes. Okay. I heard that next study not the first time, so I'll have to go back and do something. Yeah, right. Good. Yeah. All right. Now. Alright, now that part is more or less done in collaboration with one of my colleagues, Pastor Bhaki and others. I have a fairly large sort of list of these contraction operators which are homogeneous via the NajPierge theory. That's kind of the Najpiage theory tells you what is the characteristic function and then if you And then, if your contraction is homogeneous, then the characteristic function must transfer in a particularly pleasing way, and that tells you a lot about the underlying contraction. So, the characteristic function actually factors. Alright, now we come to what I hope to talk about today, namely the subnormality. Now, comes the question: an operator T on a Hilbert space, of course, we know is said to be subnormal provided. Is said to be subnormal provided it's just the restriction of a normal operator to an invariant subspace. Okay, so again, this is why I said I'll keep making a mess no matter how much I try. So this H is supposed to be, I don't know, on a Hilbert space. No, everything is okay. Right. This is okay. So yeah, I just tend to get very nervous about such things. Two such normal extensions. One of the main things is that. One of the main things is that two normal extensions are uniquely equivalent if they are assumed to be minimal and not bother to define minimality, but somehow there is a unique normal extension. So a minimal normal extension always exists and is uniquely determined modulo unitary equivalence. T is a subnormal irreducible homogeneous operator, then the homomorphism ρ T is the restriction to some simultaneous invariants. To some simultaneous invariant subspace of an implementivity. So now we have these three stages. I started with the implementivity. I talked about how normal operators which are homogeneous are the same as implementivity. We talked about contractions which I sort of said is the compression of an implementivity. Now we come to subnormal operators and what I am saying is that a subnormal homogeneous operator is nothing but the restriction of an imprimative The restriction of an imprimativity to a common invariant subspace. Now, remember, the thing about the imprimativity was that it has a group representation and it has a multiplication. And you know, you can have invariant subspaces under the representation, you can have invariant subspaces under the multiplication. But what we ask is that identify all those invariant subspaces under the representation as well as the notes, okay. An agile. So that's the characterization of subnormality, if you like. We don't know the answer to that, even in the case of L2D, as I said, or L lambda D. Now, one thing again before I get completely messed up, one thing I want to say is the following. While we don't know the answer to that, what we can say is: if you assume that you have this multiple. Assume that you have this multiplication, you have the representation, that is, you have an imprintivity, and you are looking for common invariant subspaces. Assume that the restriction of the multiplication operator to this invariant subspace is in Cowan-Douglas class, whatever that might mean. Then, the answer to that question: whether all the invariant subspaces are going to be subspaces of holomorphic functions, the answer to that is a The answer to that is affirmative. Those are the only subspaces. But we believe that that should be true without making this assumption that the restriction to the hypothetical invariant subspace is Calvin Douglas. Of course, Calvin Douglas is very closely related to holomorphy and therefore that's not a surprise that we could do it. But our guess is that it should be true without that. Okay, in other words, T is a subnormal and homogeneous, then maybe. Subnormal and homogeneous, then minimal normal extension of T is also homogeneous, and moreover, subnormal homogeneous operator has an associated representation, say U. Like I explained before, then together with T, the representation U also extends to an associated representation of M and E. That is what I mean by saying a list of all normal operators that are homogeneous is not hard to produce. That's exactly the Mackey classification. For these, Classification. For these, we also determine all the associated representations. The result suggests a possible approach to finding all the homogeneous subnormal operators. And that's what I explained. Every homogeneous subnormal operator is the restriction to a common invariant subspace of a homogeneous normal operator and one of its associated representations. Now, remember when I am talking about normal operators. Normal operator which is homogeneous, the unitary that intertwines the n with g dot n need not be uniquely determined. So there are several different representations that intertwine the same normal operator to g dot n. So what the list of if you want to make a list of all the subnormal operators what you have to do is to look at a homogeneous normal operator which is easy to Continuous normal operator, which is easy to write down, then look at every representation that intertwines that normal operator to G dot L. So you have these representations and this fixed normal operator. Look at all the common invariant subspaces respect and that completes your list of subnormal homogeneous operators. That also completes, in a way, if you like, a certain kind of holomorphic induced retrogenes. Induced protegendas. Okay, so the homogeneous normal operators, as I said, are easy to write down. Particularly in this case, the Mackey theorem is perhaps much, much more general. But if you have a normal operator and n is unitedly equivalent to g dot n, then basically the spectral theorem tells you that this n must be so many copies of multiplication by By Z on L2, and so many other copies of multiplication on L2 because the quasi-invariant measure is uniquely determined. The quasi-invariant measure, there are only two of those. One is d theta, the other is I need. So, the question of determining which homogeneous operators are subnormal then is equivalent to asking what are the subspaces of this direct sum with that simultaneously. Some of that simultaneously invariant under the index representation u and the multiplication operator n. So now we come to the reason why the Coven Douglas class comes in. A homogeneous operator in BMD modulo inventory all homogeneous operators in the Coven Douglas class. Now in the Coven Douglas class simply means Class simply means we have a multiplication operator on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, where the reproducing kernel is actually taking values in a finite dimensional inner product space. Which actually amounts to saying that you have these vibrations, that's like a holomorphic ordination model, and the multiplication is acting as just multiplication by a scalar on each of those eigens without each of those. Of those eigens, each of those eigens. So these have been classified, and this is again a repeat of the definition that I had already said. You have a Hilbert space, d-valued functions, then it's a multiplier representation if this happens. So as I said, Mackey's theorem gives you what are all the imprimativities, but it doesn't tell you what are all the unit it is. You, what are all the unitaries that are allowed, and that's that's one thing we try to do. Going to determine all the associated representations of the homogeneous normal operator because that's what we mean. All representations, multiplications, simultaneous invariance of space. So the theorem is that if you have for the circle case, again it is kind of not so difficult. These are what are called principal series representations. Representations they are all irreducible except for one case, and that's the more interesting case, but doesn't matter. So, we look at multiplication on L2B d theta, and we have a multiplier of this kind, multiplier of this kind. So, it's the derivative. Now, remember, you are on L2, so I don't have to insist on holomorphicity. Absolute values are allowed, these are multipliers, these satisfy multiplier identities, and it is no. Multiplier identities, and it is known for perhaps about 100 years now that these are multipliers, the corresponding multiplication operators are actually direct sums. So, that's what I have written here. These are characters. Let me not actually get into that. So, modulo equivalence: all the d-dimensional representations of this circle group are obtained in this way with these. With these multipliers. Okay, so I will not bother to say too much more about that. So for M acting on L2B DA, now this is different because we are on the disk. This is sort of more complicated. Again, because all the representations of SU11 or more importantly, its universal covering group have been completely classified. The universal covering group case was done by. Group case was done by Paul Sully. You can actually write down all the representations. And if you like, you can also use Mackey's theorem to say that every representation that occurs there must be an induced representation. And that simply means that if you are in this case, you have a multiplier representation where m lambda is given by this. By this. These are the multiplicities that occur. So, the proof involves the implementability theorem due to Mackey, and the most interesting thing from our point of view, remember that when you say you have a homogeneous normal operator, it is actually a direct sum of two things. So many copies on the circle, so many copies on the disk. And you are looking for invariant subspaces in that direct sum, a whole bunch of direct sums. Direct sum, a whole bunch of direct sums and the invariant subspaces can behave rather badly. Fortunately for us, it turns out if you are looking for an invariant subspace under m direct sum m acting on that space, then the invariant subspace is split. They are either inside that or they are inside the other one. And they are direct sum of an invariant subspace from here and an invariant subspace from there. Okay. I think that's all that I have. Um, I think that's all that I have explained here. So, I'll not. Then it turns out that you can actually write down your L2 space with a weight like we had talked about 1 minus absolute z square to the power lambda minus 2 right in the beginning, scalar case corresponding to certain weights. So, since I am kind of running out of time, there was an interesting thing here that I wanted to talk about. Here, that I wanted to talk about, but I guess I'm completely out of time. So, I will not be able to do that. Yeah, so just the scalar case I want to explain. Remember, I go back to the scalar case where the multiplication is by g prime z to the power minus lambda. The major is given by this way: 1 minus absolute z square to the power 2 lambda. You could put a 2 lambda minus 2, it is just a change of scale, and then. And then the subspace of holomorphic functions is zero if and only if lambda is greater than half. Is not zero if and only if lambda is greater than half. As I said, that has to do with subnormality and the restriction of the operator m to the subspace A lambda is then a subnormal homogeneous operator that we have been looking for. I'll just stop with this. I'll just stop with this one minute, namely that you can pull all of these representations from A lambda to one universal space, namely the L2. Pull them by using the Radon equation derivative and your multiplication operator intertwines with the multiplication operator again. But this representation which was on A lambda, your multiplier was holomorphic. But when you pull it back using When you pull it back using the Radon Nicodem derivative, the multiplier is no longer going to be going to be holomorphic. What you instead get when you are looking at all the representations, you look at inside L2. If you want to just fix L2 and look at what are the subspaces, you would be looking at subspaces of this form. And this is a complex structure. If you like, this is an invariant complex structure. And the answer is. Structure and the answer is that as long as the restriction of the Carmen Douglas operator, as long as the restriction of the multiplication operator is in the Carmen Douglas class, the only invariant subspaces are subspaces of holomorphic functions inside L2 except with respect to this invariant holomorphic structure. I think I'll stop there again. Are there any questions? I wonder if this is a subject that worth studying. So have we looked at group actions on inverse space of homomorphic functions factions? Like uh you have talked about uh just just the group action. Just the group action. The group action is on a Huber space. Every Huber space is identical to a Huber space of a holomorphic space. There are natural actions. These are the kind of results that are known from the work of Araji and Pitre and such, which says that take a Hilbert space in fact with a semi-inner product or semi-knowledge. Look at F going to F composite or G dot F. or g dot f f going to g dot f if you require that these operators be isometries then then the only Hilbert space semi-normed Hilbert space that admits such an action is the Wirkley space for example and you know there have been several variable analogs and so on and so forth there is a lot of interesting work about that from the 80s That from the 80s. So then there'll be a second natural question would be that you try to classify those R figures that you use with this contraction. Right, right. That I haven't looked at. What I have started doing few years ago, all of this involves the group acting transitively on your spectrum. Now, that you know that somehow is related again to MACI theory. But what we have been doing last Doing last three, four, five years is to look at smaller groups. For example, the unitary group acting on the closed bound. Then obviously the orbit under the group action is pretty large. It's hardly a singleton. So similarly, you can even look at the permutation group acting on a Catesian product of this. You can look at the Mobius group acting on similar. Mobius group acting on symmetrized by disk and so on and so forth. So, all of those are non-transitive kind of group actions, and there you know the questions look like they are questions about extensions, okay, extensions of something to something that is. Yeah, yeah, so about the same lines, is there anything known if you take discrete subgroups? Known if you take discrete subgroups, let's say of the vertex group. There is exactly one paper by David Wilkins which characterizes you know when you take a discrete subgroup. I did not talk about this at all here because what is going on behind is the story involving projective representations, which is the second poem or the loop and so on and so forth. That one single paper that David Wilkins has is where he characterizes: if you have discrete subroots and you have a projective representation, under what circumstances that projective representation having this kind of property is actually a genuine that he characterizes in terms of the vital this that and so there have been no progress since no after that I have been meaning to go back to that but Meaning to go back to that, but I haven't. Yeah, but it's a beautiful. I mean, I finally expect there will be interesting connections with number theory, this, that, and the other. And I mean, there is an Isenstein series that keeps coming up while thinking about these things and so on. But you know, hopefully one will die soon, and then there will be much time left to worry about such things. But it's rich. Very, very difficult to think about. Very, very good uh development. I don't know if someone's having a site.
