Yes, of course. So we will we have now the talk by Laia Bruet, who will speak about the metric measure boundary of spaces with Richie Bounded below. Thank you. Well, thank you very much for introducing me. And I would like to thank all the organizers for inviting me and giving this opportunity. This opportunity. Today I'm going to talk about a recent result about metric measure boundary in smooth and non-smooth spaces with reaching curvature bounded below obtained in collaboration with Andrea Mondin and Daniela Semoa. This is the plan of my talk. I want to start by introducing this notion of meta- Introducing this notion of metric measure boundary, and even though it is for application, it is mainly relevant in the non-smoot setting. I'll start with sticking to the setting of smooth Riemannian manifolds, and I'll explain in this simple setting connection with the metric measure boundary and the boundary measure of a given smooth manifold with boundary. And I'll also present one new result we got in this smooth setting, which is new. The in this smooth setting, which is new even in the smooth setting, and I would like also to make some connection with the known conjectures such as Yaus conjecture. And after I switched to the set to non-setting, I'll mainly consider Ricci limits, both with and without boundary and Alexandrov and Darcy spaces. And finally, I'll explain the main motivation for the study of this metric measure boundary, which comes from the study of. The study of a conjecture, a long-standing conjecture by Perelman and Petrunin about long geodesics in Alexandro species, and I'll explain how the understanding of this metric measure boundary gives a solution to this long-standing conjecture. Okay, let's get started. As I said, I want to start with a smooth manifold in the smooth setting. Let us speak a smooth Riemannian manifold here, G denotes the metric. The metric. And the first quality I want to consider is the so-called volume deviation. Here I'm using standard notation for the volume measure associated to the metric G and for balls centered at the point X with the radius R. And this volume deviation defined here is essentially keeping track, try to measure the deviation between balls on our manifolds and balls. Manifolds and balls in the standard flat Euclidean space. Omega n here denotes the volume of the ball of radius one in the Euclidean space of dimension one. And the deviation measure is obtained by scaling the volume deviation of a factor one over r and multiplying it against the standard volume measure of our manifold. And the resulting object is a family of measures absolutely continuous with respect to the volume measure. With respect to the volume measure of our manifold, depending on this scale parameter R. Now, let's see what we can say about this object in the setting of moot manifolds. It is actually very simple to understand the limit for R going to zero. Indeed, if we consider inner points, points far away from the boundary, Far away from the boundary. It's a well-known result that the first order VR is equal to zero when r goes to zero, and the first order is also equal to zero. And what we get here is a coefficient in front of the second order. And the coefficient is nothing but the scalar curvature and denoting by R, the scalar curvature of our manifold, multiplied by a constant depending only on the dimension. The situation is different if we. The situation is different if we pick boundary points. Indeed, when r goes to zero and x is a boundary point, the volume, the vr of x is equal to one over two. And this is simply because the volume of small balls at the boundary point are very close to balls in the Euclidean half space, and the volume is the half of the volume of the standard Euclidean ball. So we get So we get as a limit to whatever. So, in particular, if we go back to the definition of deviation measure, we observe that very far away from the boundary at inner points, this density here is converging to zero with when r goes to zero with a linear rate. This goes to zero, like r times the scalar curvature. While on boundary points, this quantity is blowing up because VR is approaching to one. R is approaching to one half and one over R is blowing up like one over R. And this essentially suggests that this family of deviation measures is sensible of the structure of the boundary. And indeed, it's like an exercise to show that the limit is a measure, the weak limit in the sense of measures is nothing but the Hausdorff measure of dimension n minus one. Of measure of dimension n minus one restricted to the boundary of m. So essentially, this is the volume of the boundary times some constant depending only on n. So given this observation, one can try to define a notion of metric measure boundary in a more general setting. Consider a metric measure space endowed with the Hausdorff measure of some. The Hausdorff measure of some of the density n. Here n is some positive integer. And let us also assume for simplicity that hn is a locally finite measure in our metric measure structure. So we can define the deviation measure exactly as we did for our Riemannian manifold, and we just replace the volume measure with the Hausdorff measure of dimension n. And the definition is the same. So at this point, we can try to control. We can try to control this deviation measure mu r. And in case we find the limit as r goes to zero, we call metric measure boundary the limit measure mu. So in particular, as we have seen in the previous slide, in the setting of multi-manion manifolds, the limit exactly coincides with the volume of the boundary measure. This definition can be given in this generality. Even in this generality, and it appeared for the first time, as far as I know, in the paper by Kapovich Liccia-Petrunin in the setting of Alexandro spaces. And this is the setting which we are going to see applications of the theory of the metric measure boundary. Okay, so this is a definition. Let's continue considering smooth Riemannian manifolds. One observation is that in the setting of manifolds with In the setting of manifolds with lower bound on the Ricci curvature, we get essentially for free an effective lower bound on the metric measure boundary. And this is this is due to the Bishop-Gromov inequality. So if we assume that the rich curvature is bounded below by minus n minus one, a simple application of Bishop-Gromov inequality says that the volume of any ball with the radius r is smaller than the volume. is smaller than the volume of the ball of radius r in the model in the model ball in the ball in the model space hn which is the space with constant curvature minus one and moreover one can one can check that the function vn minus one r agrees with the euclidean volume up to the second order so in particular we can fix any point x in our manifold x Point X in our manifold M, any radius R, smaller than one, but it doesn't play a huge role. The volume distortion VR, which is equal again to one minus the ratio between the volume of a ball centered attacks with R and the Euclidean ball, can be bounded below, thanks to the Bishop-Gromov inequality, by means of minus a constant depending on n times r squared. And r squared comes from the And R squared comes from the fact that Vn minus one R coincides up to agrees up to a second order with the volume of the Euclidean ball of radius R. So in particular, if we plug this inequality into the definition of the deviation measure, we get this effective lower bound, which depends only on the dimension and holds for any r say smaller than one. So in particular, in the Particular, in the setting of spaces with lower bound on the Ricci curvature, we just have to find an upper bound on the metric measure boundary in order to control it. And in case we get some limit, which is a measure, this measure has to be non-negative. So, in the smooth setting, we already know that this is the case, but maybe in the setting of Richelieu spaces or in the secting of Alexandro spaces, it's not even clear. Is not even clear whether the limit is a signed measure or a non-negative measure. This strongly suggests that a natural setting to bound and understand the family of volume distortion and the metric measure boundary is the setting of spaces with a lower bound on the Ricci curvature. And if it is not enough, maybe spaces with a lower bound on the sectional curvature. So actually, it turns out that for a certain extent, it is. For a certain extent, it is enough to assume lower bound under each curvature, and this is precisely the statement in the smooth setting of a theorem we proved with Andre and Daniele. And it says that on any smooth manifold with non-negative reach curvature and up to scaling, I'm assuming that the reach is bounded below by minus n minus one, and volume non-collapsing. By volume non-collapsing, I mean. Volume on collapsing, I mean the volume of the ball of radius one centered at a given point P is bigger than a given positive constant V. Under this assumption, we can bound the total variation of the family of deviation measure mu r on the ball of radius one in terms of a constant depending only on the dimension and the volume non-collapsing. So, in other words, so we already know that in the smooth set. So, we already know that in the smooth setting, muir is a well-behaving measure. We already know that in the limit, we find the boundary measure. But here, there's an effective information which is non-trivial at all. And the information is that we can bound the total variation for any R only in terms of lower bound on the rich curvature dimension, upper bound on the dimension. Upper bound on the dimension and volume non-collapsing. Now, third question is why these kinds of bounds are relevant. So, first, as I stressed here, the key point is that the bound is effective. And it means it tells you that the Ricci curve, the lower bound on the Ricci curvature and the volume on collapsing alone are able to control the metric measure boundary. So, the injectivity radius or whatever other smooth. Or, whatever other smooth quantities do not play any role when it comes to controlling the magic measure boundary. So, in particular, there's some hope to extend this kind of results to non-smoot spaces satisfying a lower bound on the Richie curvature, an upper bound on the dimension, and the volume on collapsing. And this is indeed the case. I will show what kind of theorems we can prove in the non-smoot setting in the second part of this talk. I want also to make a comparison with other. Comparison with other beautiful theorems. Let us start with this result by Junger Neighbor, the recent result by Junger Neighbor. It says that under the assumption that our smooth manifold, so again, the ambient space here is smooth, we assume a bound on the Ricci curvature, upper and lower bound on the Ricci curvature in some ball of radius five and some low and some non-collapsing assumption. And some non-collapsing assumption, lower bound on the volume of the ball of lattice one, then we can control the L2 norm of the Riemann tensor only in terms of n and the constant v. So as in the previous case, so here of course the Riemannian tensor is bounded because the manifold is moved, but the key point is that the L2 norm only depends on the L2 norm only depends on the dimension and on the volume non-collapsing. Another example of theorems of this kind is this result by Petrunin, which has been presented yesterday by Daniele. And it says that under a lower bound on the section curvature, local lower bound, say in some ball of radius five, one can control the L1 norm of this colour curvature. And the constant just depends on the dimension of. Just depend on the dimension of the space. A conjecture mentioned also yesterday by Daniele by Yao says that a similar result should be true in the setting of manifolds with a negative rich curvature and volume non-collapsing. There's also a collapsing version, but let us stick to the non-collapsing setting. And interestingly enough, there's a connection between the understanding of the metric measure boundary and Boundary and the Yao conjecture. The conjecture I wrote here is actually stronger than Yao conjecture. And it says that let us consider a smooth manifold without boundary, this is important, and non-negative reaching curvature and volume non-collapsing. Then it is reasonable to conjecture that one can refine the bound on the deviation measure. Deviation measure in our theorem by adding this factor one over R. And the huge difference now is that when you send R goes to zero, instead of finding the volume measure, at the next order, we find the scalar curvature. This is what we have seen a couple of slides ago. So in particular, if we can prove an effective bound like the one in this Like the one in this conjecture, by passing it to the limit, we get a bound on the L-war norm of the scalar curvature, which is essentially a Yao conjecture. But this limit has a name. It is called the metric measure curvature and has been defined again in the paper by Kapovich, Litschak, and Petrunin. And again, it can be defined in great generality: just pick a metric measure space and now do with Hausdorff measure of the With Hausdorff measure of dimension n. And here I'm just recalling the definition of deviation measure. We say that a metric measure space admits a metric measure curvature nu if one over r mu r admits a limit in the weak topology and this limit is the measure nu. Sorry, here is a typo should be hn, not h2. And observe that in the case in which we have a metric measure curvature, A metric measure curvature, a well-defined metric measure curvature, the metric measure boundary has to go to zero. So, in particular, this is an option for spaces without boundary. And an interesting result due to Kapovich and Lichak is that the conjecture I wrote in the previous slide actually holds true in the setting of two-dimensional Alexandrov spaces. It is actually true in the setting of Alexandrov surfaces with integer curvature. So, in this case, one can find a bound on the Bound on the volume distortion divided by R, which is effective and just depends on R. And as far as I know, there are no results about effective bounds on the metric measure curvature, even in the setting of smooth manifolds with a lower bound on the sectional curvature. Okay, this is a general introduction in the smooth setting. Now, let us move. Smooth setting, now let us move to the non-smooth setting where the most important application where we have the most important applications. I want to recall very briefly the compactness theorem due to Gromov, saying that given a sequence of manifolds with upper bound on the dimension, lower bound on the rich curvature, and upper bound on the diameter, we can always extract a subset. We can always extract a sub-sequence converging in the Gromofazov topology. The limit is a metric space in general, and it's an example of a non-smooth space with some lower boundary curvature. And there are some variants of this notion of convergence. So we can extend it to a sequence of manifolds that are non-compact, and we can drop the assumption on the diameter. In this case, we have. And in this case, we have to add a reference point. This is the so-called pointed Grammar-Wasdorf convergence. And in the limit, we get pointed metric spaces. And when it comes to studying the Ricci curvature, it is also useful to keep track of the volume measure. And therefore, we can pass to the limit together with the distance function the volume. function, the volume measure, and if needed, we have to scale it in order to avoid collapsing. And the object we get in the limit is a metric measure space with a fixed reference point. This is the notion of point in the metric romo-fascular convergence. Now, what can we find in the limit? So first I'm gonna call a limits of a pointed Pointed metric measure spaces obtained as limits of manifolds with upper bound on the dimension and lower bound on the Richie curvature, rich limit spaces. And it turns out that one can find several non-smooth structures. And the simplest singularity you can think of is the conical singularity. This is a well-known example, the ice cream cone. High screen cone, it is possible to show that the cone over a small circle here I'm denoting by S1 of R, the circle of radius R with R small, smaller than occupi. This ice cream cone, which is a smooth space with only one singularity at the tip of the cone, and the singularity is a conical singularity of codimension two, can be obtained as a limit as a limit of smooth manifolds with lower bound on the Ricci curvature. So, actually, it can be obtained. The Ricci curvature, so actually, it can be obtained by as a limit of manifolds with a lower bound on the section curvature and volume non-collapsing. Another, maybe more subtle example of why limits are in general not smooth is due to holding a neighbor. The example is the following: one can consider, one can find a sequence of manifolds, smooth manifolds with a uniform overbound on the rich curvature, volume non-collapsing again. Volume on collapsing again, converging to a space which has no conical singularity. So we are not converging to something like the X-Crem cone. Any point is asymptotical Euclidean. So at the zeroth order, our space look pretty regular. But it can be proven that the distance we got in the limit is not induced by any metric which is more regular than C beta for beta positive. So even though at the zeroth order, So, even though at the zeroth order our space looks pretty regular, there are no conical singularities, but the distance is not induced by any metric enjoying holder regularity. And another example I would like to mention is due to Anderson, and it says that the topological structure is not preserved in the limit. You can pass to the limit a sequence of manifolds homeomorphic to a certain model. Homeomorphic to a certain model and in the limit to finding something else, even if you assume the volume are collapsing. So, the standard example is a sequence of metrics on a fixed manifold M4, which if I remember correctly, is homeomorphic to the direct sum of two copies of CP2. And in the limit, you find a rich limit space which is singular with two point singularities and which is homomorphic to a sphere. Is homomorphic to a sphere. So the limit has a different topology with respect to the sequence. This is something which cannot happen in the Alexander setting. Okay, this is a very short overview about what can go wrong in the limit. Let me present a positive result, regularity result, if you want, which has been already mentioned yesterday by Daniele. And this is due to colding and chigran cold. Due to colding and Chiger and Colding, and is an epsilon regularity theorem for balls that are close in the group of Ausdorff topology to the ball of the Euclidean space, to the model ball of the Euclidean space. And this theorem is stated in the smooth setting of manifolds, but the very same result holds for rich limit spaces because any estimate here, any statement here is effective and just depends on the And just depends on the Richie curvature, bound on the dimension, and the distance with the Euclidean ball in the Grovofaus of sense. And the statement is the following. For an epsilon, you can find delta depending only on the dimension and epsilon with the property that if the ball of radius 2 centered at some point P of your manifold is close enough in the Gromov Aussodorf topology. In the Gramo-Fasdorf topology to the ball of the same radius in the Euclidean space, then you can control the volume. So the volume is epsilon close to the Euclidean volume. And this is a fundamental first step to try to understand the metric measure boundary. Second point, this is kind of propagation of the Of the of this property. So it says that at any scale smaller than one over two and at any point in the ball of radius one, you get essentially the same property. So the ball of radius R centered at any point is close to the ball of the same radius in the European space of dimension n in the scaling invariant form. And the distance between the two is measured in terms of. Distance between the two is measured in terms of epsilon. And now, once you know that at any scale and location, your space looks like the Euclidean space, even in this very weak form in the chromophosov sense, you can infer that the ball is by holder to the ball of the Euclidean space. So, the key point is that in general, if you start from a manifold with no negative curvature and you pick two spaces, You pick two limit spaces or two manifolds with non-electricity curvature. If they are closed, there are, it's not true that they are homeomorphic, but it is the case when you are close to a very simple model. And in this case, the model is the Euclidean space of dimension n. Okay. Now I want to add the boundary in this non-smooth theory, which is quite fundamental in order to study the metric measure boundary. And I want to consider limit spaces with boundary. And the definition is essentially the same: pick a sequence of Riemannian manifolds with boundary and assume lower bound on the Ricci curvature exactly as we did in the previous slides. Volume non-collapsing, I always assume in this talk volume non-collapsing. And I want also to assume a lower bound. And I want also to assume a lower bound on the second fundamental form at the boundary. So I'm essentially assuming convexity of the boundary. A version of Gromov compactness theorem says that we can find limits in the Gromov-Ausso topology exactly as we did for species without boundary. And now it's natural to try to understand the structure of the boundary in the limit. What can happen to the boundary in the limit? Can the boundary disappear? limit can the boundary disappear if not what can what can what can we understand about the structure of the boundary in the limit and so first as we have seen in the previous examples uh the limit spaces are not in general smooth manifolds so we do not have a definition topological definition of boundary and the natural one in the in the setting of actual RCD spaces have been introduced by the Philippines and Gigi and also Daniele yesterday said something about Said something about. One can define the boundary of a non-smooth space, of a rich limit space, or an RCD space by considering the closure of those points X with the property that asymptotically at X the space looks like the Euclidean half space. And the closure is quite important. The simplest example you can think of is a triangle in the Euclidean space of dimension two, points with the property that asymptotically the space The property that asymptotically the space looks like the half space are the edges. When you take the closure, you add the vertices, and you end up with the natural definition of boundary in the case of a triangle. And I want to mention real quick a theorem I proved in collaboration with our neighbor and Daniel Essemola about the structure of the boundary of rich limit spaces and actually of RCV. But let's stick to the setting. But let's stick to the setting of rich limits with boundary. And our theorem says that if you pick a sequence of manifolds with boundary, as with the three properties I listed here, then in the limit you can prove that the boundary is not empty, is always not empty, the boundary in the sense of the Philippe Pis and Gigi. And it enjoys certain regularity properties. For instance, it is n minus one rectifiable. n minus one rectifiable and the h n minus one measure which is the natural measure of co-dimension one in the limit space is locally finite when restricted to the boundary and we have also a volume convergence so the the volume measure of the boundary so this hn minus one restricted to the boundary of n k is exactly the volume measure because n k is a smooth manifold is a volume measure of the boundary Cases manifold is a volume measure of the boundary. This perfectly smooth measure converges weakly in the limit to the Hn minus one measure respective to the boundary. So this is really a volume convergence statement in the case of boundary. And finally, we have also a topological conclusion, which is actually not very relevant for this talk. And it says that we can parameterize both. So it says that limits with boundary are manifold. With boundary are manifolds far away are by holder manifolds far away from a set of conical singularity of co-dimension two. But the key ingredient to prove this result is that when you can parametrize by mean of very good maps that are harmonic and bioder, balls of limit spaces that are GiaccaMothaus of close to the Euclidean half space. So in a certain sense, what we have is a version. Is a version of this theorem due to Kolding and Schiger and Kolding in the case in which we change model and instead of Julian space we consider Jupyter half space. Okay, so this is something about limits with boundary. Let me recall very quickly the notion of Alexander of spaces. I'm sure that everybody in the audience knows about them. I just want to recall that. I just want to recall that they are defined starting from the topology theorem, which gives a characterization of the notion of having non-negative sectional curvature, but more in general, a notion of having a lower bound on the sectional curvature in terms of a completely non-smooth property. And this non-smooth property is the so-called triangle comparison, which depends only on points and geodesics. So, in particular, And geodesics. So, in particular, one can take as a definition in the framework of geodesic metric spaces, the second point of topon-gonal theorem, and define in this way a class of spaces with lower bound on the second curvature. This is more or less the definition of Alexandro spaces. And arguing in a similar way, we can introduce a notion of lower bound on the Ricci curvature. This has been explained nicely by Has been explained nicely by Fabio Cavalletti and Daniel Esemola in the last two days. So, here essentially, we are using a different theorem. Instead of Toponogov, we characterize the lower bound in the smooth setting, we characterize the lower bound on the Ricci curvature by means of this theorem due to student Forens after the work of Otto Villaniko-Dera-scan mechanism Gueslager. This theorem essentially says that on smooth manifolds, lower bound enerichi curvature. Lower bound under the curvature is equivalent to a nozzle property, which is not which is different from the triangle comparison, of course. And this property involves the tools coming from the optimal transport. And the fundamental point is that this property only involves the ambient measure and the distance. The triangle comparison involves only the distance. When it comes to rich curvature, we have to take into account also the volume measure. That's the reason why we consider metric measure structure, but still we have a characterization, a non-smooth characterization. Have a characterization, a non-smooth characterization depending only on the distance and the volume. So, in particular, we can take it as a definition. And for us, a space, a metric measure space with no negativity curvature, is a space satisfying this condition. And here we have to add another condition, which is the so-called infinitesimal Bertian condition introduced by Gigi, which essentially has the aim to rule out a possible Fisherian structure. And okay, this is the notion of RCD spaces, and now. The notion of RCD spaces, and now let's go to the main motivation for the study of the metric measure boundary. And here the setting is the one of Alexandro Spaces. And the metric measures boundary has been introduced in order to try to solve this long-standing open question by Pereman-Petrunin. It talks about the existence of many infinite geodesic. Of many infinite geodesics on Alexandro spaces. And the nice connection between infinite geodesics on Alexandro spaces and the metric measures boundary has been built by Kapovich, Litschak and Betrunin, who were able to prove the following theorem. Consider an Alexander space of dimension n. Of dimension n. So it turns out that if the metric measure boundary is equal to zero, or equivalently, the sequence of distortion, of measure distortion converges weakly to zero, and here I'm just recalling the definition we have seen in the first part of this talk. Then it is possible to show that at almost any direction of the tangent bundle. The tangent bundle, there is an infinite direction, so at almost any direction of the tangent bundle is the starting point of an infinite geodesic. And almost everywhere here is understood in terms of the Louville measure, which coincides with the standard Louville measure on Riemannian manifolds. And it is also possible to show a version of a classical result in Riemannian geometry saying that the geodesic flow. The geodesic flow preserved the Libyan measure. So, there's the key point here is that there's a very nice connection between the quantitative properties of the geodesic flow and the Louville measure and the metric measure boundary. And in order to make a little more clear disconnection, let me explain it in the setting of multi-Riemannian manifolds real quick. Manifolds real quick. So let's consider again a smooth Riemann manifold and its tangent bundle. The Lubille measure is nothing but the Lebesgue measure on fiber averaged with the volume measure of the manifold. And the geodesic flow is simply defined by means of the exponential map. So in this smooth setting, we already know that assume that our many. Assume that our manifold has no boundary. We already know that any geodesic can be extended forever and the resulting geodesic flow preserves the Leubid measure. That's a classical result and it can be proven in a lot of different ways. There's a way to re-understand this theorem in terms of the metric measure boundary, and this is what has been done by Kavovich Liczak and Petrunin. And this understanding in terms of the metric measure boundary gives a very robust proof that holds even in the non-smooth setting of Alexander species. The connection is the following. Consider this map from the tangent bundle endowed with the Leeuville measure and M cross M endowed with the volume squared. And the map is defined here. We just take the projection of the direction, if the projection of the direction after applying Of the projection of the direction after applying the geodesic flow all the way to time one. Now, the idea is that, so this map E, of course, this map E, of course, distorts the measure, is not measure preserving, it's not sending the Louville measure into the volume measure. The interesting point is that the distortion, the measure distortion due to the application of this map in The application of this map E around the zero section can be controlled in quantitative terms by means of the metric measure boundary. And this is all you need controlling the measure distortion around the zero section is all you need to prove the Lyubille theorem, the fact that the Lyubille measure preserved the geodesic flow. And a little more precisely, given a set, given a compact subset, a compact subset. Compact subset, a compact subset K of our manifold M, we can define an egg root of K in the tangent bundle Tm simply by considering those directions with the property that the projection belongs to K and the length of these directions is smaller than R. This is a natural notion of tubular neckboof of k thought as a subset of the zero section in the tangent boundary. zero section in the dungeon budget. The other object you can consider is a tubular neck burrow of k button in the second space m cross m. And this is nothing but the union of balls of radius r centered at k. The key identity is the following. The difference between the Louville measure of the negro root of k in the tangent bundle and the volume measure, the square The volume measure, the square of the volume measure, of the tubular negro is exactly equal, this is just an application of Fubini, to the volume distortion of K up to scaling with the correct factor. So, and it turns out that all you need in order to prove Louisville's theorem is that this right-hand side here goes to zero, which is exactly. Goes to zero, which is exactly equivalent to proving that the volume distortion goes to zero in any compact set. And this is exactly the statement, the statement in the Alexandrov setting by Kapovich-Licha Kemperchoni. If you can prove that the volume distortion converges to zero, then you get a Liouville theorem. So, in particular, you can what you are able to prove so far is that the That there is a positive answer to the question by Peredman and Petrunin on Alexander of spaces with vanishing metric measure boundary, with zero metric measure boundary. So the natural question now is, can we prove that on any Alexandrov space without boundary, the metric measure boundary is equal to zero? Which is a supernatural conjecture, since on the smooth manifold we know that the metric measure boundary is essentially. That the metric measure boundary is essentially equivalent to the boundary measure. And a partial result in this direction has been given by Kawoj, Klitschak, and Vetrunin, and they are able to prove that this is true for Alexandrov spaces of dimension two. And this is essentially a consequence of the estimate on the curvature, on the metric measure curvature, which is even stronger. And the second setting in which they can prove this result is boundaries of convex. Result is boundaries of convex body. And a natural conjecture, as I said, which has been written in their paper, is that in the setting of Alexander spaces, if you have no boundary, then the volume distortion converges to zero, and therefore the magic measure boundary is equal to zero. If you have boundary, you converge exactly up to a constant, depending only on the dimension, to the boundary measure. And this is exactly what we have been able to prove. What we have been able to prove. So, actually, we have more general results on RCD and rich limit spaces. And our theorem says that, assuming the Alexandrov property, we have an effective bound on the sides of the absolute value of the volume distortion. Actually, this first bound is not new. It was already proven in the paper by our couple of. Already proven in the paper by Kapovich, Lichak, and Petrunin. What is new is the characterization of the limit. We can prove that the conjecture by Kapovich, Lichak, and Petrunin holds true and the limit of the measure of the sequence in UR is exactly HN minus one restricted to the boundary. So, in particular, when Galessandro space has no boundary, the metric measure boundary vanishes, and therefore the Foreign by And therefore, the theorem by the previous theorem by Kapovich Ličak and Petrunin says that there are many infinite geodesics. And this gives finally the positive answers to the question raised by Perelman and Petruni. As I said, we are actually able to control the metric measure boundary only in terms of the Ricci curvature. So the sectional curvature is even too much. And this is a result we got for Ricci limit. We got for Ricci limits with boundary, which again they are just limits of smooth manifolds with boundary, positive, second, non-negative second fundamental form at the boundary and uniform lower bound on the rich curvature and upper bound of the dimension and non-collapsing. And in this setting, we get the very same conclusion. We have a uniform control for any positive R, an effective control depending on. An effective control depending only on the dimension and the volume non-collapsing and the characterization of the limit. So μR converges to be essentially the boundary measure. Last result I want to present is a version of the theorem in the most general setting of RCB spaces. So here we are able to treat only spaces without boundary. We can prove that We can prove that when the boundary is empty, then the very same conclusion of the previous two theorems holds. In particular, we have the effective bound on the sides of the deviation measure, and we can conclude that the magic measure boundary converges to zero, and even we have a strong convergence to zero, not even a weak convergence. The weak convergence. The problem with RCD spaces with boundary is due to the lack of two important tools. The first one is a theorem about rich lower bound on the doubling of R C D spaces. So, what I mean here is the following: pick your favorite manifold with boundary or your favorite R C D space with boundary, pick a second copy and glue them around the boundary. Glue them around the boundary. The question is whether the resulting metric measure space satisfies the RCD condition. One can prove that gluing along the boundary smooth manifolds with lower bound on the Richie curvature gives an RCD space, actually a rich limit space. Gluing a rich limit space gives a rich limit space. The question is open for RCD spaces. And this is an important tool to understand the metric measure boundary near the boundary of the space. Measure boundary near the boundary of the space since essentially reduces boundary bolts to inner bolts by gluing them together. And the second result, the second tool we don't have in the setting of RCD spaces is the Laplacian comparison for the distance function from the boundary. The inequality I wrote here holds in the case of non-negative Ricci curvature. There's a version for more general A version for more general lower bound on rich curvature. And again, we can prove this inequality in the setting of smooth manifolds with convex boundary, limit of smooth manifold with non-erdity curvature and convex boundary, essentially because this inequality passes to the limit. A stronger version of this inequality holds in the setting of Alexandro spaces. You can prove a concavity of the distance from the boundary. The distance from the boundary, and to date, we do not have any proof of this result in the setting of RCD spaces. And this is the second tool need to be using our proof in order to control the metric measure boundary close to the real boundary of the space. And that's the reason why we can just treat the spaces, RCD spaces without boundary. Okay, this being said, let me conclude this talk by giving a very quick A quick overview of the proof. I want just to mention a couple of key ingredients and differences with previous approaches. So the key object we consider is the so-called harmonic delta splitting map. And harmonic delta splitting map U defined on some ball of NRCD space, a rich limit space, Alexander. Space, Rich Limit space, Alexandrov manifold, whatever, is a map made up of harmonic functions with the property that the adhesion of these harmonic functions is small in the scaling invariant sense in our ball of radius five, in our main scale. And we have also this orthogonality condition, integral orthogonality condition. So the family UI is Family UI is almost orthogonal in this L1 sense. The idea is that delta splitting maps are essentially a replacement of harmonic coordinates. And it's much simpler to prove the existence of harmonic delta spitting map since essentially you just need to be very close to the Euclidean ball in the Gromo-Faus2. Euclidean ball in the gromophosphorus topology. So if the ball of if the ball of radius 10 is close in the gromophosphorus topology to the Euclidean ball of the of the Euclidean ball of the ball of the Euclidean space of the same dimension, then you can build essentially by compactness delta splitting maps satisfying this property. The problem in working with delta splitting map is that they are defined by means of integral properties and a priori they are well behaving on. And a priori, they are well-behaving only at the top scale you are considering. They can degenerate when you go down in scale, and actually, they do degenerate in many examples. So, for instance, on the tip of a cone. But on the other hand, you have an effective bound on the Shan, an effective bound on the L2 norm of the Shan, and this gives a lot of regularity. So, we use delta splitting map to prove a quantitative volume convergence theorem connecting the volume. Connecting the volume of the ball of radius one centered at some point P and the volume of the Euclidean ball in terms of this integral involving delta splitting maps. And observe that the quantity here in the right hand side is a multi-scale quantity. So we need to control delta splitting map at any scale in order to have a good control of this term. The point is that, as I said, The point is that, as I said, we cannot expect such a strong control, but we can play with the L2 integrability of the HM and bootstrap the regularity. So, what essentially what happens here is that we can try to control delta splitting maps and stop when the property of delta splitting map does not hold anymore. We control the sites of the set in. Control the sides of the set in which the property does not hold, and we zoom in again, rebuild delta splitting function and restart. And here is fundamental to use the epsilon regularity result for regular bolts due to colding and the trigger encoding that I showed a couple of slides ago. And after this bootstrap argument, we get a uniform control. And in order to And in order to sum all the contribution, because now we have several different scales to sum, we appeal on a quantitative covering argument proven in the previous paper in collaboration with our neighbor and Daniele Semola, which is in turn based on a result in a paper by Chigarjangen neighbor. And actually, there are other steps in order to prove that the limit is zero far away from the boundary. Is zero far away from the boundary, we have to build delta splitting functions with H equals zero at a given point, but I mean, I don't have time to enter into details on this. Let me just conclude by making a comparison for experts of Alexandro spaces between standard that DC coordinates and this delta. Can I interrupt? Yeah, sure. Can I ask? Could you go back one slide? Yeah. Here. So if your point has a So, if your point has a half space as a boundary, do you get kind of estimate like this? Well, if you subtract so actually here, I'm just controlling an inner ball. A ball where I can build a delta spitting map is essentially by definition far away from the boundary. This is the recipe to control inner balls. So, here there are no boundary points. Right, so you cannot do it for the boundary points. For the boundary points, I don't have an epsilon regularity argument on the boundary bolts. What we do is control the inner points. I understand, yeah. I was just not we use the, I mean, we use the doubling construction in order to control boundary bolts. But yeah, the hard part is controlling inner bolts, I mean of data sitting. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Okay, final comment. I want to make a very uh quick comparison with the previous approaches. With the previous approaches based on DC coordinates. So, DC coordinates are special coordinates over Alexandro spaces that are able to build a BV metric on the regular part of the Alexandro space. And the difficulty in using this DC coordinates to understand the metric measure boundary is that the B V property of the metric allows for concentration of the metric in a set which is negligible. Set in a set which is negligible with respect to the volume measure. And as observed by Kapovich, Liczak, and Petruni in their paper, new coordinates with a metric belonging to W11 will be enough to control the metric measure boundary. So in order to prove that the metric measure boundary is vanishing far away from the boundary, From the boundary, the needed improvement is just from BV to W11. Delta splitting maps a priori are even worse than DC coordinates. Indeed, the best you can prove is that they are C alpha coordinates with alpha smaller than one. And even proving that they are C alpha coordinates is quite hard and uses a deeper result, which is the transformation here and by Chiger Jungen neighbor. Mentioned here and Jung and neighbor. But the key point is that globally they are C-alpha coordinates, but on big sets they are able to produce a metric which is W12. And the reason for that is the effective bound on the Sian of delta splitting meta, which is an effective L2 bound on the S. And this is why we need a bootstrap argument to conclude, because we have to get rid of a small part of the space where the W1 to The space where the W12 control, we do not have any W1P control on the metric. And once we get rid of this part, we have to keep track of the sites of this part and zoom in and restart. Zoom in and restart. And this is more or less the general idea. I think, yeah, my time is almost over. I'll stop here. Thank you for your attention. Your attention. Okay, thank you so much for your nice talk. Are there any questions, comments? Yes, they are there. Can I ask another one? Yeah, first of all, thank you for a wonderful talk. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. You're welcome. So, for proving the Appalaplacian boundary of the distance for the boundary, do I understand correctly that the main thing is to basically understand the mean curvature at the boundary points, right? Right, right. Yeah, if you understand. I mean, everything will follow, right? I mean, right. Yeah, you can just follow geodesics, and I mean, once you have, once you have. And I mean, once you have the right bound at the boundary, you can conclude. Right. And so, in smooth case, you just know the relation between second order form and mean curvature. And in RCD case, you kind of don't, right? Yeah, exactly. That's the missing connection. Right. So, do you have some ideas how to prove this? Actually, at the moment, no. Don't have any really concrete idea how to prove it, so it seems hard to this is one degree, and why you're using the risk limits, right? I mean, because there you can do this, yeah, yeah, it's hard. So, I mean, one expects that the inner part of the space is convex. Essentially, this is, if you want, is hidden even in the Bochner formula. The point is how to use this information, which is Is how to use this information, which is somehow hidden in the Bochner formula, into a bound on the Shan or the Laplacian of the distance function, and this is something that I don't know how to do. Yes, yeah, that's exactly the problem. And maybe this is also related to the first question about the doubling. Maybe the two questions have some connection. And yeah, in our work, we use both properties. And yeah, maybe one implies the other. Don't know precisely. Other, don't know precisely. Okay, thank you. Welcome more questions here, there. So, for the definition of geodesic flow on an R C D space, do these Do these theorems for R C D's and bridge limits imply the Liou-Will theorem? I just wanted to understand exactly how you could show. Well, it does. Okay, thank you for asking. It does for Alexander species. And that's essentially the connection built in this theorem by Kapovich, Lichak, and Petrunin. I've never thought seriously about the Seriously about defining a geodesic flow and the LUVIL measure on RCD spaces. It might be possible, and also given that we can control the metric measure boundary, so that's a huge clue that it might be possible. But I never tried seriously. So I expect that it can be done, but I've never tried. The definition, you can have the same definition as they have, but I guess for the Liouville measure, it's kind of that's the one that's. It's kind of that's the one that's probably not quite clear. I mean, the same definition, not really, the same definition of Alexandro, you mean for the just the geodesic flow. I mean, there's one by Gromov as well, and you could use that one for the geodesic flow. Okay, but I mean, it's not clear at all, for instance, that you're so when you define the geodesic flow, you usually start from a subset of directions, the good ones, and you flow only this direction. You flow only this direction. In the Alexandrov setting, you can prove that flowing only this direction, you get essentially your exponential map is surjective. Don't know any result of this sort on RCD. Yeah, no, in RCDs you don't have the exponential map, but you just, I mean, it's a different space, but there's one definition for the geodesic flow. But I'm wondering if, I mean, I guess you already answered that you don't, there's no kind of, well, There's no kind of well-established notion of a Liouville measure, so that the Liouville theorem could be the same. But I don't know since Kapovich is there, like, do you know if that's what would the extension to say Ritchie limits or RCDs be of a Liouville measure? Well, I mean, on the regular part of the space, you can sort of define it, right? I mean, in a way, if you just I mean, in a way, if you just look at the union of those tangent spaces where tangent columns are unique and Euclidean, and that's in some sense is all that you really care about. And somehow that's all that should matter for the proof. So it might be possible to generalize this, our result Our result to OCD setting also, yeah. Using what they proved, yes. I suspect. So I don't want to swear at the moment. So, and maybe another question, because you kind of had a comparison with DC coordinates at the end, but by now. The end. Yes. But by now, I think there's also the Ericsson-Bikersotani's coordinates that kind of explain a relationship between Chiger measurable tangent space and Gigli's tangent structure, say. So have you thought about how that relates to this idea, or to your work rather, for RCD? No, I haven't. So I think here my point is simply that. My point is simply that I'm not claiming any connection between delta splitting maps and DC coordinates. Just saying that they enjoy different bounds. On the one hand, they are worse because they are not even W one one, but on the other hand they are better because on big sets you have effective estimates. But I mean, never thought about connections with Connections with more deep connections between the two. All right, thanks. Thanks for the talk. Really enjoyed it. Is this paper available already, actually? The one that? Okay, cool. Thanks. I'll take a look. Should I stop sharing? More questions? More questions? No? Okay, let's speak. Let's thank the speaker again. Thank you.
