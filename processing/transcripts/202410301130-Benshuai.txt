Okay, so today I'm going to talk about the application with the one-half in two error acoustic problems because that's where I'm doing my research in. The first one is called the turbulent band relayed turning edge noise and the other one is called a supersonic jet screech. The first one was done by me, but the second one was done mostly by my student, Bing Hong Li, Mr. Bing Hong Li, who has done some great work. And who has done some great work during his PhD? Okay, right. So I think I know many of you here. For those that I don't, here is a brief description about myself. So I got my first degree in physics in 2012 and then moved to Cambridge for a master and a PhD with Anne Dowling on jet noise and jet installations. And then after my PhD, I went to California. After my PhD, I went to Caltech for a few months to visit Tim Colonius to do some jet instability stuff. And then I went back to Dem to join WAFES group. That's where I met Anastasia and David. And then I joined Peking University in 2020 and working as an assistant professor right now. We have our own group specializing in aeroacoustic modeling and some experiments. Okay, as you can see from my CV, probably I'm such a traitor. I'm such a traitor, am I not? I betrayed physics and engineering and ended up in a platyman mathematics. Right, so that's enough about myself. So I will talk about the first problem, which is the turning edge modeling. Now, I have been too optimistic about my talking speed. So I probably won't have enough time to talk the two problems. So I think I'll spend most of my time to explain the first problem and then a little bit of time to talk about. And then a little bit of time to talk about the problem that my student has done. Right, the first problem: how can we use the WinoHof to model the so-called turbulent boundary layer training edge noise problem? Before we start, we need to talk about why we should do that. So, here is the motivation. We know that we have a lot of machines that are involving rotating plates, right? Given the first example, like counter-rotating open rotors, this kind of like engine is a Like an engine is very efficient in terms of fuel economy. However, its noise is unbearable, as you can see, because there is nothing to block the sound to propagate. The second is the wind turbines, right? For the past 15 years, I think in Europe, a large amount of research was funded by the wind turbine or wind industry companies because they are interested in the noise produced by the wind turbines. The wind turbines are growing bigger as you Winter lines are growing bigger as you have a bigger blade, it's rotating faster at the tip so that you get a larger noise emission. And apparently, this air acoustic is very relevant in this area. Of course, you also have this kind of pulling fans, pretty much finding everywhere. In all this problem, the noise is an issue, especially in the second one, like one of the problems that we will see is the error acoustic, so-called training-edge noise problem. And for the first one, Noise problem. And for the first one, the leading edge noise problem is an issue. So, what are the leading edge noise or training edge noise? Sounds a bit foreign if you're working in solar mechanics. So, the leading edge noise problem is illustrated from the graph on the top. So, imagine that you have some turbulence in the free atmosphere. And when a blade rotates, the leading When a blade rotates, the leading edge will chop this turbulence and making the sound generation. I think John will be talking about. Yes, I think, yeah, I can see that from the title. So as the free turbulence convex downstream and it hits the leading edge of the aerophole, it causes scattering, hence the sound emission. And that's one scenario of sound generation. The second is called a turbulent button-related shredding edge noise. So instead of having the three turbulence, Instead of having the free turbulence, so you say we have like a very quiet flow without any turbulence, but when a blade rotating in such flow, there will be a very thin like layer formed both above and below the surface thereafter. And this layer is called a turbulent boundary layer because essentially the small eddies will appear inside of the boundary layer and a convex downstream. Now you've got the turbulence inside of the thin boundary layer, convex downstream. Inside of the thin boundary layer convected downstream and got scattered at the training edge again. This is called turbulent boundary layer training edge noise. So we call it it like training edge noise from now on, just for simplicity. So because this leading edge and training edge are very important in many applications involving rotating blades, so there are many ways to reduce it. And one of the widely used and studied method in our acoustic community is to use serrations. I think like anesthesia should have seen a lot of Should have seen a lot of that work, right? In the wave curve. So essentially, you put some kind of wavy or jaggy edges on the leading edge or training edge. So on the left is the serration is placed on the leading edge of the aerofoil. In this sense, it's actually very effective. In experiment, you can see very easily up to 15 decibel noise reduction in this, like a single scenario. Whereas in the second scenario, which you put it like serration on the on the You put a like serration on the trading edge of a wind turbine is not as effective as the leading edge, but also quite useful because it gives you like two to five decibel noise reduction simply by using this like kind of solo tool serrations. So as we can see, these are very kind of useful from an engineering perspective. Unfortunately, that pose a great challenge for error acousticians to try to model it. That's turned out to be surprisingly difficult for the past like. Difficult for the past, like two or three decades. So, if we try to model it, this is a kind of a simplification with that or in a mathematical way. So, we treat the RFO as a kind of a semi-infinite plate where it's semi-infinitely large. There are only one edge, but it's a jagged or wavy edge. So, as you can see, this irregular boundary condition is the reason why it is so difficult. And the typical way to model it is Emmett's approach. Model it is MIS approach. And if we try to model the EMIS approach, one of the essential steps is to find the scattered surface pressure, especially near these training edges, near this kind of wavy serrations. And if you look at that, this is the near field, right? So it's not in the far field. So the common like strategy of a method of a steep descent cannot be used because we need to find out the near field problem. And turn out that this is actually equivalent to. Is actually equivalent to the Green's function problem because the acoustic reciprocity, we can swap the observe and the source, right? So it's equivalent to find out the Green's function, which the source, which is Y, is placed in the near field, very close to the turning edge. And you want to find the sound gets scattered in the far field at the position X. Now, because we are looking at the aero acoustic problems, it is important to actually include a mean flow. Now, we use a non-dimensional parameter M, which Use a non-dimensional parameter m, which is the velocity, which basically here is the Mahanemba to denote the kind of the mean flow. And suppose that we place a monopole or any simple source here, we want to find out the scatter design in the far field, subject to this very complicated diet boundary condition. That's what we want to solve. And then I move on to the analytical formulation of that. And I probably want to emphasize that the To emphasize that the source position y must be in the difficulty here. Right, so to solve such kind of scattering problem, a very standard way is to use the acoustic reciprocity, right? Instead of solving a source that places a Y and find the scatter sound in the far field, we do the opposite. We swap the sound and put the sound source in the far field and try to find the scatter sound in the near field. Because once we do that, Because once we do that, there is a great simplification because the sound source is so far away when the sound approaches to the edges, it becomes essentially a plane wave. So that's why we have this kind of plane wave P-Ing written here essentially as a plane wave form, but it's a little bit different because we have the mean flow here. The mean flow here is kind of described by this Doppler effect, which is kind of represented by this beta called the Prandtl-Gallett. Call it the Prandtl-Gallett transformation coefficient. And it has a value of 1 minus m square. For subsonic, of course, beta is always positive. And as you can see, the Cartesian coordinate is defined in this way. There is X direction, which is where the flow goes. This is called streamwise direction in aerodynamics. You also have the Y direction in the plane of the surface. Plane of the surface, and in aerodynamics, so we call it a spanwise direction. So, just keep that in mind. We'll keep referring to that. And there is also a war normal direction there. That's the our Cartesian coordinate. And we want to find out that subject to this incident wave, what is a scattered wave GS? Because essentially, that means we decompose the total scattered field, total field, as the incident field plus a scatter field Gs. And the GS is satisfying the so-called convention. You satisfy the so-called convective wave equation. I think we should, if you are working in fluid mechanics, this shouldn't be very strange to you. It's very close to a wave equation or Hamel's equation, apart from that. We have got a coefficient representing this Doppler effect, and also like a first-order term, a partial over partial x, also because of this mean flow. So, we want to solve this equation, and the next thing is we. This equation, and the next thing is we do a further decomposition. I think Andrew actually, I don't know where he's sitting, actually talk about a similar decomposition. We decompose further the scattered sounding into reflected plus some reflection removed to purely scattered field. We call it RS, which is essentially removed, is a reflection. And the scattered field is actually standard. It's a hypothetical reflected wave of infinitely large plate. Large plate. So mathematically, you just reverse the sign in front of the normal direction. That's it. So you've got a reflected wave and also this kind of a purely reflection-removed scattered wave. Now, because both PR and P-ing satisfy the convectable wave equation, you got the kind of a residual or the scattered field RS also satisfy the same equation. Now we will talk about the boundary condition. The boundary condition is fairly standard because if you look at this equation, Because if you look at this equation, y1 is streamwise coordinate, as I say, and HF2 represents the function of the serration. It's a function of the serration. So y1 less than HF means on the left of the serration, which is on the plate. So on the plate, you have the zero normal velocity, which is standard, right? Or zero vanishing velocity. On the right, that is on the right of the serration without a plate, you have this scatter. Plate, you have this scattered sound that exactly cancels out the incident sound, that's because of the anti-symmetry of the problem, right? And also, you also have this kind of periodicity condition because we assume that the seration, although irregular, take a periodic term form. So, and we non-dimensional everything by the period of the serration. So, that means one boundary condition is at a zero and the other is at a one. They are directly. At one, they are directly equal to each other, subject to a phase difference in the kind of a span-wise k2 direction. And both the sound field and its first derivative are kind of a periodic. This is the boundary condition that we have. So, we want to solve this kind of equation subject to the boundary condition. And the first thing we need is we want to kill the first order term, right? If you look at that, that's the term that are causing. That's the term that are causing a bit of trouble. But that is standard. We're using the La Prando-Gala transformation to get rid of it very quickly. Using this transformation, written the variable as R bar, you see that this equation almost is a Hamill's equation. The only difference is the term in front of the first derivative beta square. Now, a lot of literature in acoustic actually using a non-focal like Foconal, like coordinate transformation, so that the kind of irregular boundary becomes a regular one. But that's all focal, that causes a lot of difficulty. So instead of doing that, actually, we actually don't do that and find out that if we do the Fourier transformer directly, it will essentially give you the same equation. So we will not do any kind of non-orthogonal transformation, but only stretch the coordinate. Because the only term that is problematic is here, but it's very, you can easily. Is here, but it's very, you can easily get rid of it by using a stretched coordinate in the casi1, right? It's just like equal to y1, like accept a scaling coefficient beta. And casi2, cosi3 are exactly the same as y2, y3. Now you have the Hammond's equation. We're happy, right? Because this equation we're really familiar with. And the way to solve that actually is also quite standard. We do this Fourier transform. Of course, this is. This Fourier transform. Of course, this is the boundary condition, which is essentially the same as the previous one, so I'll not repeat it. So, to solve it, we do the like a Fourier transform in the streamwise direction, because that's where how we can get this Winnerhof later on. And the way to do that, remember that Kasai 1 is a streamwise where the flow goes. Kasai 2 is the transformed like spine-wise direction, Kasai 3 is the war normal. So, we do the streamwise for your transform so that the Kasai 1 becomes the. So that the psi one becomes the complex variable s. And once we do that, we can split this integral into like two parts because that gives us r plus or r minus as the open way. But the problem now is the edge is not at like y1 oxide one equals zero. It's a kind of sunny sodo or saltus one, spanny shape. As we mentioned, it is denoted by this function hf. By this function hf, so we split right at the edge, although it's kind of a function of psi two, no problem. We said we just split at this place, and then we do a like a change of variable so that there is there is additional exponent term coming out, which is EISHF, which is the function of the serration, and the rest of it is just the upper and the lower analytical functions in the lower and a lower and upper plane. That is standard, and there is nothing kind of. That is standard, and there is nothing kind of tricky here. And then, what we do is we do after the Fourier transformation, the Hammond's equation reduces to a two-dimensional problem, right? This is the wave equation reduce or Hamilton's equation reduces to the two-dimensional because the Kasai one is gone, is represented by the S. And this thing has some kind of can be solved by using the method of a separation variable. Because if you try to remember, we've talked. If you try to remember, we've talked about the boundary conditions, is periodic in the spine-wide direction with a periodicity of one. So you get an eigenfunction that is called EI, I think. This is the eigenfunction in the spanwise direction, E cosi n, like cosi2. Cosi n is 2n pi minus k2. K2 is a spanwise wave number. So this is the standard kind of almost a Fourier series, basically. Fourier series, basically. It's the same equivalent if you do the Fourier expansion in the span wise. And this is orthogonal at the same time, a complete set. So we can expand each and every term in our boundary condition using this orthogonal basis. So we can work out each mode individually. And if we do this summation, we see this is a kind of a summation of a different nwise mode from n infinity to minus infinity to infinity. So next thing that is standard. So, next thing that is standard Winohof. So, we match the boundary recognition on at the boundary, right? But the only difference is now before the match of the boundary recognition, we do kind of expansion in the span wise using this like orthogonal series so that we can work out each Winohov equation for each mode. And the resulting equation is given by that. So, gamma has the same kind of familiar. same kind of familiar definition is equal to square root of s square minus a constant square so this is the standard kind of gamma n now if we look at this equation r minus and r plus they are at the mode n they are unknown the one calculated through the wenahov technique but there is a problem so there is a forcing term that we've been talking about like over and over again there is a simple pole here but apart from that we would we also have an e m function as a function Have an EN function as a function of s. Now, that is the real difficulty here because EN, if you try to look at it, it has an exponential term in it that causes a lot of difficulty due to the kernel decomposition. I think like a lot of us must be very familiar with that. Now, in the earlier works, like people try to assume that maybe we can assume this R minus and R plus have the same coefficient of E n so that we can get rid of this E n. So that we can get rid of this EM. Oh, in that way, it's really simple. For example, in 2018, 18, they assumed this way and tried to get some results. But what we found is this is actually not strictly correct. So there is no reason why you can assume the R minus and R plus have the same term. But it can be used as an approximate solution in the high frequency regime. We found it is actually approximately valid. Uh, and approximately valid in the high frequency, but not in the low frequency, and the way we would talk about it later on. But this actually tells us that it may be a perfectly separable solution that is uniformly valid everywhere, perhaps doesn't really exist until a straight or including a swept edge is used. Because whenever you have a straight or swept edge, this EM reduces to a constant. And you can basically find out a perfectly separable solution. A perfectly separable solution. But now, the way that you can't find that in this way, maybe suggest that a fully separable solution doesn't really exist. Now, if you feel really bold and confident, you may try this, but it turned out it's surprisingly difficult for the past like two or three decades. Nevertheless, we found that the assumption that holds pretty reasonably well in the high-frequency regime. So we see maybe we can examine this. Like examine this Green's function in this high-frequency regime and develop a full closed form equation, even validating in the near field. That's what we do. So if we're using this kind of assumption and do the like a standard kernel decomposition, we find an approximate solution in the high frequency regime is written at this. Now, often a normal way, if we get this, we're almost like 95% done because we can use the 95% done because we can use the steep descent to get the far field form. But the problem now is we want the Y to be in the near field. So we can't use the steep descent or method of stationary phase. So what we do is we see whether we can form this contour, actually find or evaluate this integration analytically. Now, it may seem hopeful because this isn't the very Because this isn't very long. But if I tell you that for a simple seration, EN, that is simple like sort of the serration, it looks like this. It seems rather hopeless to do that. Because you've got a sign, which is extremely kind of difficult to deal with when S approaches infinity. You've got so much blow-up things and singularities. And also, but actually, although it looks hopeless, but it actually is possible. But it actually is possible. It takes me a lot of time, actually, a whole year actually, to do that. But in fact, it is possible. So, what we found is you can't find a closed analytical form for the aggregate function in that high-frequency regime. That is given by the equation at the bottom. I apologize that this seems a bit long, but that's the best that I can do. In order to understand this, we need to actually define two auxiliary geometrical parameters. One is the One is the observer and the distance between the observer and the tip point of the serration. We call it RT, the distance between the two. Of course, we can also define a distance between the observer and the root point. We call it RR. And also two angles, theta R and theta T. Of course, this is in the cylindrical coordinate. So this is the inner plane perpendicular to the surface. This is the cylindrical coordinates like R and theta. R and theta. My cylindrical coordinate of this observer is theta. So what you can see is the final equation can be written in terms of theta t and theta r, plus some kind of a phase modulation in front of these two. Now h n is can be written as a slightly compact form here. The kappa is just a constant. There is no need to worry about that. And the theta i can be theta r or theta t. So this is the argument. So, this is the argument. And a capital theta is the angle for the far field source. So, this is capital theta is always representing the far field. So, you have this, and the I function is exactly the same form as the scatter response by a straight edge. So, this is written as a first integral. This is standard. And we may want to see, oh, this is a fairly complicated equation. Is it actually correct? Is it actually correct? So, the way we would do that to validate that is try to perform some, let's say, volume integral and the numerical integration of this and compare with the solution first. And that's what we get. So, we choose a lot of different positions, but this is only one of the representative examples. We see that the two are perfectly matches. So, at least they tell us the derivation is correct. But that doesn't really tell us whether, or to what extent. Or, to what extent the assumption that high-frequency approximation is valid. So, we want to do some kind of numerical test and we perform some kind of finite element like calculation in COMSO. And as you can see, we use like two serations and then periodic boundary recognitions like in the upper and below surface. Of course, we can use in one, but we choose two in this case. And then, some kind of absorbing boundary recognition comes on is called a perfect. In Comso is called a perfectly matched layer or PML for information. And this is the assuming that there is a plane wave coming from the top right to the bottom left. And then this is the scatter wave. Of course, this also includes the reflection. It's a reflection plus the scatter wave. It looks very kind of a complex near the sternation, but it looks more regular as you move away. And this is essentially the same kind of behavior as if you plot the. if you look plot the if you plot the the the formula that we got and but we don't really only want a quality we want a quantitative comparison so that's what we do we do uh we draw two semicircles like in the near field because we are interested in the near field uh we actually in in fact we we we drew like four different uh semicircles but i because of the time i only like show two of them so we want to show subjected to a like a plane wave coming from the top top right Coming from the top right to bottom left, what is the scattered wave comparison on these two semicircles? And this is the comparison. First of all, we know that in the low frequency, it wouldn't be good. And that's what we found as well. You try to see that all these open circles are from numerical and the sorted line are from the formula. A low frequency, the blue line is for strap edge. It always agree with the kind of formula. The with the kind of formula, that's not a problem, but for the serration or jagged ones, the blue and the red ones like uh differentiate for differ from each other pretty significantly. So the low frequency. But no problem, because we know that at a low frequency, we don't expect them to compare well. This is only on one circle, on the other circle is similar. But as long as we move it to the middle frequency and we see that the difference actually changes the The difference actually changes pretty quickly, and especially at the middle frequency, one circle, you compare this open red marks and open solder line. They start to likely move in closer. And so is on the other circle. See, they actually give you a reasonable result. And in the high frequency, actually, the two almost collapse. See, this high frequency, the open red circle and the red line, they almost collapse. And on the other circle, it's the same. Circle is the same. So, actually, they tell us the Green function is actually uniformly valid in the sense that it is not only valid in the near field but also far field, but only perhaps in the mid and high frequency. We actually give you a range where how high is high, but I don't think it's actually useful to tell that in the report. Okay, so that's already kind of almost 20 minutes, right? So, I've got to like. So, so we've got like a few minutes left. So, the conclusion is just that we found a uniformly valid, like a closed form Grains function valid at a high frequency, but only not only at like far field, but also near field. And it works on both leading and training edge problem because the symmetry. So, we use training edge as an example. And this is kind of stuff that is not important. Okay, right. So, I'll spend a few minutes to talk about the second kind of example. About the second kind of example or problem that my student has been working on. I think it's a good example. So he has been working on the receptivity of a two-dimensional supersonic jet flow due to acoustic excitations near the nozzle lip. This long title, I apologize for that. And my student has been working on that for two years. And so, what is the motivation of this problem? That is because in a kind of aero industry, we've got the supersonic. Aero industry: We've got the supersonic jet everywhere, you know, starting from the rocket engine to some fighter jet. You've got a supersonic jet coming from the jet nozzle, right? But supersonic jet, there is an interesting phenomenon that is there is a design of Mahanber for this for a given nozzle shape. And then therefore, if the flow is at a speed that is different from the design of Mahanamba, you get shock waves inside of the jet flow. As you can see from these diamond shapes of this Of this jet. When this happens, if you put a microphone or if you just stand nearby, you will hear a very strong tonal sound, which spectrum looks like this. The horizontal is the frequency. This is the power, vertical is the power spectral density. So there is a very strong tonal frequency. This is called jet scritch. Why this happens, we will talk about the mechanism later on, but this scritch is really important. This switch is really important in the aero industry because it then causes sonic fatigue. I think, if my memory is correct, in the early days of development of F-15 fighter jet, the Americans actually came across this problem. They found that an extremely strong kind of a scridge can cause some kind of a sonic fatigue to the structures, making this sonic fatigue, making this structure fail. So they are really interested in this. So the reason is because the perturbation is so. Because the perturbation is so strong. Okay, sure. And the mechanism of this is quite well understood. You've got a jet coming up at the nozzle. The jet is unstable due to Kelvin-Harmon's instability. So it picks up amplitude energy as it moves downstream. And as it is strong enough, it will interact with this shock, produce sound. And the sound will propagate upstream. And the upstream sound will get. Upstream sound we will get scattered at this naughty lip, and once it gets scattered, it creates a new instability so that the new instability like performs the same cycle. And in a sense, that you've got a resonance loop. And this resonant loop causing that creation of that very strong tonal noise. And one of the central problem is we want to find, oh, one of the central problem is the acoustic pinging to the nozzle creates like a trigger new instability. But what is the transfer function? Stability, but what is the transfer function with that? We believe this is largely non-linear. So we want to solve the equation that is, if, let's say, there is a sound like, let's say, placed downstream and propagated upstream get scattered here, it will trigger new instability wave. This is directly from a 2024 paper from Ico Santa Leon. I think Christopher Bergey. They calculated and observed that, I think, in numerical data, this is an incident of wave electricity. Incident of a wave like trigger new instability. So, we want to find out the transfer function, how much energy, like from the acoustic wave, get into the instability wave, and what is the kind of phase delay of it. That's what we do. Of course, to model that, I probably don't have time to do that, but I just want to show you the Winnerhoff equation. That's it, that we want to solve. Right, go back to that's the Winerhov equation that we want to solve. It's ended up with this. To solve, he's ended up with this. So, we want to solve phi plus and I think with a simple pole, but here the kernel is really complicated. If you look at that, the kernel is actually given in this dispersion relation of the instability wave. So, the student actually spent a lot of time to find an approximate like a form of that. And I think David gave a very good introduction using approximate of a kernel. Using approximate kernel. And I did that actually, it worked pretty well. I think this is the comparison of the approximated kernel with the numerically like decomposed of K plus and K minus. They actually agree with each other pretty well. And the final transfer function is given by this. We found that the energy efficient is around 5%. 5% of energy goes from acoustic energy to treat instability, whereas the phase delays is like... Phase delays is around 07.5 and 0.5. Of course, we also compare with experiment, getting some better results. I probably don't have time to show that. Okay, this is just like two applications that we do. And I don't want to spend any time to actually conclude. Just stop at the right at the very important page where we are hurrying. That if you have like a postdoc that is interested to come to Peking or China, welcome because we pay you. China, welcome because we pay you a lot better. And then also, there are some fellowships that give you a bit of independence. This is our campus. It's very, very beautiful. This is actually right at the time, the autumn day, that we took the picture. Right, I think I'll just stop here, and I'm happy to take any question you have.
