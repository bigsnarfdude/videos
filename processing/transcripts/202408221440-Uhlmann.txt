So I chose as a topic the Calderon inverse problem because this is a typical prototypical, I would say, inverse problems for elliptic equations. I think you have heard from Iran Wang about hyperbolic equations. But elliptic equations are very different. So, So the case I want to consider is the following. You have the conductivity of a medium here denoted by gamma. It's always a positive function. It will be a matrix later on. And this conductivity measures how much current goes from one place to the other. From one place to the other. It's the inverse of the resistivity. And the problem is: can you recover this parameter, the conductivity, by making electrical measurements at the boundary, which are voltage? You input the voltage and you measure the induced current, or you can do the other way, take a current and measure the voltage. And it's called the Calderon's problem in the The Calderon's problem in the mathematical literature because he was the first one who proposed a mathematical formulation and obtained the first result. But this has been considered in the geophysics literature earlier than this. So one application and the motivation of Calderon, as I'm going to mention, was oil prospection. And it has been proposed also for Proposed also for early breast cancer detection because the normal breast tissue has much lower conductivity than the cancerous breast tumor. The reason for this is that blood is very highly conducting and tumors need blood to grow, and that's the reason for the dramatic change in conductivity here. So, this method is. Here. So, this method is very good for contrast, not for having a very good resolution. You can see it here, because the currents go all over the place immediately. Since this is a probability also, it's like a random walk going from one place to the other. It's an infinite speed of propagation, and therefore it's very difficult. and therefore it's very difficult to pick up where the measurements came from. For the case of wave equations you have definite propagation, the waves have a propagation, but not in polylliptic equations. So this is Calderon, he's a famous analyst of the 20th century. There are many things in his name, Calderon's sigmund singular integrals, the uniqueness in the Cauchy problem, Calderon by Lancourt, many results. And he says something interesting when he accepted the doctor's causal of the Universidad Aut贸noma de Madrid. He said, He said my he worked as a he was an engineer. There was no mathematics degree in Argentina. He comes from Argentina. At that time, he worked for the oil company of Argentina called Jacimiento Petroliferos Fiscales. He said his YPF still exists in the late 40s. It was very interesting, but it was not well treated. I was not well treated, otherwise, I would have stayed there. So I was very fortunate for mathematics. Calder贸n was not well treated. I don't know who was the boss of Calder贸n and that company. We had to thank him or her. So this is a cartoon of what Calder贸n has been considering. And the rock has been considering this is oil also has a very different conductivity than the surrounding rock. And so you put a loss called a well lock with electrodes around and you input voltage or current and you measure the current or the induced current at the same electrodes or the voltage. And from that you try to infer whether is You try to infer whether there is oil. The Schlambinger company in the United States was started in the earlier part of the 20th century using electrical method. So, the cartoon for the case of breast cancer is this one. You put electrodes on one side of the breast. Again, you put Again, you input voltage and you measure the induced current flux at the electrodes. And from that, you try to infer whether it's a tumor. As this is a compressed breast. And this is a good method combined with mammography. Mammography is the standard way for breast cancer screening to see whether there is any. To see whether there is any possibility of a cancer, of course CTS cancer or MRI and so on, they give much higher resolution. But unfortunately, mammography, which is X-rays, is not so good to detect breast cancer. The idea will be to combine it with this electronic. Will be to combine it with these electrical measurements, which are very safe. There is no radiation in this case, and they are very rather cheap equipment. You have to just need a machine that produces currents. It's proposed for breast cancer screening. Actually, that was my interest in starting the calderon problem because of Because of detection of cancer, because in the case of a family member, the mammography did not detect the cancer. And when it was found, it was too late. Cancer issue detected very early, the chances of cure is, for breast cancer, is almost 100%. So, more recently, this has also been proposed as a method for imagining a stroke. This is a difficult problem because the skull, you have the skull here, and then there is another inclusion or discontinuity in the here. One case is you have low conductivity. Have low conductivity means there is a clot, so blood doesn't go through. And as I said before, EIT is very good to detect blood changes. And on the right, you have a description of an hemorrhage when one of the blood vessels or arteries bursts. So there is a lot of blood, so the conductivity is quite a bit. The conductivity is quite different. So, this is an inclusion without an inclusion, and in general, it's a difficult method, a difficult thing to detect. But this is a suggestion to use this method. And we have tried simulations, not in real data, using the methods that I will describe in a moment. So, this is high conductivity. High conductivity, and this is low conductivity, and we have been able to detect whether there is this exchange. The idea for this case, again, is not high-resolution, you don't want to see a full description of just to decide quickly, for instance in an emergency ambulance, which one do you have? Because the symptoms are very similar. Are very similar in both. Because the treatment is completely different in the case of hemorrhage or the case of a clot. Blood doesn't go through. We have developed a method that looks very similar to X-rays. How do I get the movie? So you can see here there is no, in this case there is no change in conductivity. This is low conductivity. This is high conductivity. Similar to what you do, so we found a connection between EIT and X-ray in that case. Okay, so there are other applications. Again, it's always to detect high contrast. For instance, when there is corrosion or cracks in a plane, see patch or sorry. I jump one page. C page of groundwater pollutants, for instance, you have the case when there is you have a nuclear plant and there is a leak of radioactive material. This is a good method. this is a good method because again there is a difference, a contrast between the if you have that and the surrounding rock. And in medical imaging the reason why it might be useful is because of the different conductivities of the different medium. As I said earlier, blood has a very high conductivity and let me mention the muscle tissue. And let me mention the muscle tissue, cardiac muscle, the heart, for instance, is called an an anisotropic media. And we're going to talk about the mathematics of that, where the conductivity is different in different directions. So this is much higher in the longitudinal direction than the transversal direction. And the brain is also anisotropic when gray matter is has higher conductivity than white matter. Than white matter. And one of the practical applications of EIT has been monitoring lung functioning. Again, because expiration and inspiration has very different conductivities because blood is coming in and out of the lungs. And this is a machine that has been developed by David Aksaxon. This is him. It's very safe. This is him, it's very safe. He's trying it himself. So you have electrodes here, and then again you're going to input voltage and measure the current, low voltage, so you don't burn the patient. And then this is you get a picture when the blood leaves the heart and feels the rung. Why this can be useful? Because especially Especially if you have an operation in a hospital, sometimes the lung collapses. So there is no blood in part of the lung or the whole lung. And usually in that case, they have to take the patient to CTSCAN or MRI. But this is a method that you can monitor continuously 24 hours a day, every every day and it's a very portable and it's is much cheaper than a CTS can or MRI and this is a movie of the again the functioning of the lungs as you see it's not high the resolution but you can see when the lungs the blood is going in and out of the lungs and the heart Of the lungs and the heart. And these, there are machines used in hospitals, and this is particularly has been used in this hospital here in Brazil. They could use this machine, this is a COVID patient and not showing here, to monitor the functioning of the banks. Of the banks. Okay, so the advantages is that it's non-invasive, of course, like many inverse methods. Safe, there is no radiation, X-ray rays. You have a very high radiation sometimes. Portable, you can you can change it from bed side to bed side, can be used uh as I said before. Can be used, as I said before, all the time. And so far, there has been no serious issues. So this is showing already. So let me go into the mathematics. So by Ohm's law, this is the static case. So by Ohm's law, the Courier and the North. The current denoted by I here is the the resistivity times the current is the change in the potential and the conductivity can be isotropic, scalar or anisotropic. Anisotropic will be modeled as a matrix, positive definite symmetric matrix. As we are going to discuss later, if the current has no sources of sinks, we have the divergence gamma gradient u equal to zero. Gradient u equals zero. It's a very simple linear elliptic equation. In the case that conductivity is one, it's just a Laplacian. It's a harmonic function. And now we define the measurements. So you put the voltage potential on the boundary. Again, this is the voltage potential. And you measure the Is the voltage potential, and you measure the induced current flux. So, this is the normal component, 渭 is the unit outer normal of the current. And the information is encoded in this map. To a voltage potential F, you measure the induced current flux at the boundary. So, they are measuring S just at the boundary. So, this is a prototypical boundary inverse problem. The inverse problem. So the inverse problem is easy to stay. The knowledge of this map recovers the conductivity. And this is of course an idealized problem. In practice, you have only finite number of electrodes. But the idea is to try to invert this map and then discretize it for the case that you have finite number here. Finite number here. But first, we would like to know whether it's possible at all and what are the properties of this map. This map is also called the Dirty Lead to Neumann map. You're mapping Dirichlet to Neumann data. And this appears in many subjects in mathematics. Please stop me with questions if you have any. And this is uh the difficulty This is the difficulty is that this, although the equation is linear, we're going to talk about non-linear equations later, this map is non-linear because U depends on F. And so U will depend on the conductivity here. How it depends is that's the the crux of the inverse problem because you know we don't just want existence and uniqueness And uniqueness and estimates and so on, which typically is study for PDEs. But we want to know the properties of the solution and construct solutions as explicitly as possible and how that the solution depends on the coefficient. So the basic question is uniqueness. question is uniqueness so that means whether you have two dirigutonoma maps which give you the same measurement whether they are the same so the weakness was proved many years ago before most of you were born for C2 conductivities I'm going to discuss the regularity issue so gamma is a positive function and this was extended to more singular things but let me mention the Singular things, but let me mention the important results of Haverman and Tataru, where they reduce it from C2 to C1. With a method that resembles the same method used for this, but they use some ideas coming from dispersive equations. So I have seen in this conference there are many people working on. People working on dispersive equations, I will mention where it comes from. And Haberman actually used similar method to extend it to W1n, that means one derivative in Ln for dimensions 3 and 4. Of course, the physical dimension is 3. We'll talk about dimension 2 a little bit later. And Carol and Rogers show it for Lipschitz conductivities. But still, in dimension 3 or half Still, in dimension three or higher, there are some issues about the regularity of the conductivity. And probability might be a way to deal with these regularity issues. It's much less sensible to singular coefficients. And the conjecture is that this is optimal for uniqueness. W1n, what Haberman proved. What Haberman proved in dimensions three and four, but there is no counterexample if you don't have any conductivity that has not one derivative in some sense. The reason why it's believed that you need one derivative is you need continuation from the boundary is not true in dimension three or higher. Or higher. You have an elliptic equation like the equation I mentioned before, and u and the normal derivative vanish on a part of the boundary, then it's zero for L infinity conductivities, for C for including Holder. It's not valid, but that's just unique continuation. The question is whether there are counterexamples for conductivity is low. For conductivities lower than this. They don't have one derivative. Using similar methods, which I will describe, it's called complex geometrical optic solutions. A reconstruction method, which is important for again C2 conductivity, so means you want to reconstruct the conductivity from the Dirichetonoima map. The Dirichetonoima map, stability issues where these two are close, not just equal. This is close to this. Are the conductivities close in some sense? And of course, very important, as I said before, when you discretize the problem, using again CGO solutions, Isaacson, the person I mentioned before, and several other authors have developed numerical methods for this process. Methods for this problem. And this is a very quick summary. So, what is the method using those uniqueness result, reconstruction, stability, and numerical method? It's the following. You reduce it to the Schrodinger equation. So, this equation by making this transformation is called the Louville transformation. Then you reduce it to the Schrodinger equation. then you reduce it to the Schrodinger equation at zero energy. And the potential is the Laplacian of square root of gamma or the square root of gamma. That's the reason why we need two derivatives because otherwise it becomes very, the potential becomes very singular. So by making this transformation you already lose two derivatives and so And so, but you can set up the problem even for the potential, general potential. The potential doesn't have to be of this form. In a scattering theory, like you saw in the previous talk, the potential does not need to, this does not need to be positive definite or for instance can be complex, which is not the case here. So one can consider a more general problem. Consider a more general problem, and this has applications in inverse scattering, and I'll mention several optical tomography and several others. And you can measure the Dirty Great Tonem map. And here, what you need for this general is that this has a unique solution that zero is not a Dirtically eigenvalue. And you may have the situation here, which is the case for this problem. Problem. So we are going to consider a more general problem: whether you can recover the potential from the Diricutonum map. And you solve that problem, you solve the original question or recovering the conductivity from the Diricuton map. And there is an identity which is just integration by parts. Q1, U1. Q1, U1 is the Laplacian of U1. Q2, U2 is Laplacian of U2. Ui satisfies the Schrodinger equation for two different equations. And this gives you boundary contributions. So this part is linear in Q and this part is linear in the Dirty Goton Emma map. The nonlinearity is because the Ui's depend on Q1 and Q1. Depend on q1 and q2. But this part is linear. For instance, if lambda q1 equals lambda q2, which is what I'm going to show, then q1 minus q2 is orthogonal to this product of solutions. And this is the question now that you have to answer whether the products of solutions Of solutions of this different Schrodinger equations. So, this one is for Q1 and the other is for Q2, is dense. So, you can conclude that Q1 equal to Q2. For instance, in the case that Q1, this is what Calderon considered in the case Q equal to 0. Calderon considered the case that the conductivity is one. He looked at the linear. One, he look at the linearized problem and he look at the question whether the products of solutions is dense or not, or harmonic functions. Harmonic functions are not dense, but the products are going to be dense. And that's the question that we are going to answer. So this is reducing the problem to a problem of constructing. To a problem of constructing solutions of these equations so that the product is dense. It's different from trying to decide which boundary data you take here to show that Q1 equal to Q2. So, what currents you have to put, or what voltages you need to put, and the boundary to detect the potential. Instead, we Instead, we find solutions of the equation, and then the boundary values of these solutions are going to be the voltages that you put at the boundary. So, thus, this is reduction of cauldron, reduce the problem to the PDE problem, whether the products or solutions is dense. Okay, and this is the method that one uses comes is motivated by what you saw for hyperbolic equations, but these are elliptic equations. There is no wave propagation here. But we're going to find an analog of waves for elliptic equations. So you take an L infinity potential and what several authors did, like Habermas Several authors did, like Haverman is reduced, have more singular potentials here than L infinity, with unbounded potentials. You take a complex frequency, so it has a real and imaginary part, so that rho dot rho is equal to zero. We'll explain where this comes from. So this means that the length This is not working. This means that the length of the imaginary part is equal to the lengths of the real part and they are orthogonal to each other. Then for sufficiently large complex frequencies you can find solutions you can find solutions of the Schrodinger equation of the form these exponentials e to the x rho times one plus something that decays and the decay here is in L2 sense in the domain depending on the singularity of the potential the decay will be different and with that going to zero for large complex frequency for large complex frequencies. So these solutions behave like these exponentials, e to the x dot rho, for large rho. So it has an amplitude that may grow exponentially or may decay exponentially depending on the sine of eta, the real part. So these are it has e to the x dot eta may grow. May grow, may decay, may oscillate, and has an imaginary part as well. That part is oscillating. For the geometrical optics, for hyperbolic equations, here you have e to the i, they are oscillating functions. And again, this behaves like this, because this is a lower-order term. That's the reason to reduce it to the potential. Reduce it to the potential because this acts as a perturbation for the Laplacian. The reason why you have rho dot rho equal to zero is because these are harmonic functions. So these are perturbations of solutions for the Laplacian. So rho dot rho is equal to zero. That's where this condition comes from. It's equidimension two. It's a codimension two condition. Again, the real part, the length is the same and they are perpendicular to each other, to the real part and binary part. Okay, so these are the waves that we are going to consider, and the voltages that you are going to put at the boundary are going to be restrictions of this to the boundary. Very quickly, I'm not going to explain how to prove that, that's the key here is more technical. But let me explain how you use in dimension 3 or larger. I want to show that these are dense. So you take two of them with complex frequency row 1 and row 2 that satisfy this condition. And now in three dimensions, And now in three dimensions for a given k fix, I have, I take an orthonormal set. So k is perpendicular to eta and L is perpendicular to k. They are perpendicular to each other. That's how I use dimensions 3. And the length of the real part is equal to the length of the minority part. The reason for this is that when you multiply the exponential, When you multiply the exponentials, you add up the frequencies, this cancel, the real part, the growing or decaying part cancels out, and this part also will cancel out. And k is fixed. So I can take this to go to infinity to get rid of the lower order terms. So multiply, you get e to the 2i x of k 1 plus this. But the L2 norm, so this goes to 0 as goes to zero as L, the length of L goes to infinity. The lengths of L going to infinity means the length of eta is going to infinity, but that's okay. K is fixed. And then you get that the Fourier transform of Q1 minus Q2 in omega is 0, therefore Q1 equal to Q2 in omega. So that's the proof. That's the way you prove that the product of solutions. That the product of solutions is dense. Any questions? So it's crucial to consider products. So it's crucial to consider products. It's usual to consider products. And harmonic functions themselves are not dense. That's not true. This is not true. You put U here, solution of one equation is not true. That is actually an infinite-dimensional component. Actually, an infinite-dimensional complement. Okay, so this is the there are other applications that there is a reason to consider a general potential. Doesn't go to the disappear in the sorry. I don't see it. Oh, there it is. So this is what we prove. And this shows that you can show from that that this determines the conductivity. I mean, remember the Q is Laplacian square root of gamma over square root of gamma. square root of gamma over square root of gamma, so you know that, you know gamma at the boundary and you solve that PDE and you can recover gamma. In optical tomography, instead of using voltages and currents, you use laser like this. So it's propagation of light and it's also very diffuse. In the it's in this called a diffusion approximation. The diffusion approximation. This is the equation. It's a different equation. I mean, it's a very similar equation. It's a little bit different. But you can solve it in exactly the same way. So D, instead of being conductivity, is the diffusion coefficient, how much light diffuses. Sigma A is called the optical absorption, and this is the frequency. So you're sending photons, like Sending photons, light. And then, because now you have a complex potential, this is what I mentioned before: sigma A is real plus I dot omega, and you have D also, which is real value. If the frequency is non-zero, you can recover, because you can recover the potential and the diffusion coefficient here. And if omega is equal to zero, you don't have to do it. And if omega is equal to 0, you don't have that information. You can recover. You have only a potential that will depend. You reduce it to the potential. It will be a combination of D and sigma A. You can recover one of them. An optical tomography is used in hospitals to monitor, it's especially good for small babies because light if you Because light diffuses very quickly inside, so this is very small. To monitor the functioning of the brain, you know, again, the blood is of special importance in premature babies. The mathematics of optical tomography is the same as electrical impedance tomography. So for other applications, So for other applications, mention quickly, in optics for recovering the indiscret refraction by Becking boundary measurements. In acoustics and waves, you have the density and the compressibility. And in this case, we need two frequencies, omega, deserve, real, to detect both. In quantum scattering, that was mentioned in the previous talk. This is The previous talk, this is for just the two-body problem. There are results from the n-body problem, anyway. Then you can recover the potential at fixed energy. I mentioned the scattering at infinity, the magnetic Schrodinger equation, Maxwell equation, this is a very important system. This Olan Somersalo actually reduced it to a Schrodinger equation by metrics value. Matrix value, and there is something called photoacoustic tomography that I don't have time to explain here. Okay. So the next problem I want to consider, which is very important also, is partial data. In general, it's very hard to make the measurements everywhere on the boundary, and sometimes part of the boundary is not a you cannot make measurements. You cannot make measurements there. So, the partial data problem, the general problem, so Ting asked me to pose problems, especially to the young people here. So, suppose you take arbitrary open sets, gamma 1 and gamma 2 in the boundary, non-empty, of course, I should have said that. And you measure the same thing, the same equation, but you measure the current only on gamma. The current only on gamma 2 for voltages supported on gamma 1. So you ground the rest. It's zero here. The voltage is F is zero. Can you recover the conductivity from that inside? This is a reasonable question because, as I said before, the currents go all over the place. So you should get some information in gamma 1. Get some information in gamma 1 and gamma 2. And this is actually open in general for an arbitrary open set. So I will mention some of the results known. In dimension 2, one knows more, but for instance, even in the case, the important case, when gamma 1 equal to gamma 2 is not known for general domains. Sorry, I went the other way. Sorry, I'll go the other way. So s so so I guess. Thank you. So some of the results of partial data is the following. I prove with Habiba Mari, if the two sets are the same, I think this is an important physical case, the current and the voltage are in the same place, and you know the conductivity near the boundary, then you can record. Then you can recover conductivity instead. With Schenick and Shostra, we show that gamma 1 can be arbitrarily open set, can be very small. And you take this is gamma 1 is small, and then gamma 2 is gamma 2 is this part here which is called the shadow. Part here, which is called the shadow. There is a point x0 outside that illuminates. This part is the front face, and this is the back face. You illuminate this part, and you know F here and measure the norm, the current in a small neighborhood gamma two, then you can recover the conductivity inside. Isako showed that. Isako showed that again in the case gamma 1 equal to gamma 2 and the complement of this, let's call it gamma, is flat or is a sphere. And I will explain why you need something, some special geometry like this. But in general, it's an open question even for gamma 1 equal to gamma 2. These are all the results I know. And the the And the idea is to again to use CGO solutions, but these ones are not so good in localizing. They are non-zero everywhere on the boundary, for instance. So we constructed a new class of CGO solutions, more general, more general phases. These are real value. Value, there is a large parameter here. You can see if the people are familiar with semi-classical analysis, this is 1 over tau is the small parameter. So tau is going to infinity. Again, we take an amplitude here that we can control in order to localize. And this is going to zero as tau goes to infinity in some sense. So that depends on the Sense. So that depends on the regularity you are assuming on the conductivity. So phi and psi are a real value. This goes to zero, tau goes to infinity, and phi is called a limiting caldeman weight. I will explain these words in a moment. So the gradient, also the gradient of phi in order to have a solution to get rid of the higher order terms in tau. Higher-order terms in tau. This is like geometrical optics again. You want to get rid of the term tau squared and say you have to have this equal to zero and the modular gradient of five equal to the modular gradient of size, similar to what we had here. The length of the real part is the same as the length of the minority part and the upperpendicular to each other. And this is uh what is complicated to solve. To solve because this is a system, a non-linear system, and in general doesn't have solutions. So some solutions can be found, and this is one. The log, that's where the x0 comes from. I will explain how to use this. This is going to be one limiting calibrated weight, and this is another one. The real part here, e to the x dot eta is. Here, e to the x dot eta is called a limiting Kaldiman weight. So these are the solutions, and phi, the one we took is this one. X0 is a point outside. Again, because we're going to be measuring, we're sending light here from the point outside. So you can move this point around and that gives you different open scenes. And that gives you different open sets. So that's why this is going to be arbitrary. And these are called complex spherical waves because the level sets of these are spheres. The logos equal to constant means this is a constant. So in sphere center at x0. So instead of sending plane waves like the Send in plane waves like what we had before. These are plane waves. The real part is e to the x dot eta. You're sending spherical waves. So they're called complex spherical waves. Of course, they have a real and imaginary part. And this is one of the results. The result is actually more general, and I mentioned the more. I mentioned the more general result, but one of the results is that you measure the DDCliton Eumma map in arbitrary non-empty set, then the potentials are the same. And there has been stability estimates and reconstructions suggestions. Okay. So this is called the Connell equation, similar to uh real geometrical optics, but these are again system a system of nonlinear P V's. In the case of exponentials, we're very lucky to be able to solve this system easily, but it's very hard to find solutions and this is one. The log of x minus x 0, the real part. And you can find the size just to be the distance from this point to the point. Point to the sphere because you need that the gradients are perpendicular and the length is the same. And the transport equation that you saw in real geometrical optics is a complex equation, it's not a real equation, so it's this equation. This is the amp, how we find the amplitude of these waves. This is a Cauchy-Riemann equation for an equation for because the gradient of phi is perpendicular to gradient of psi this is like dx1 plus i dx2. It's a Cauchy-Riemann equation in the plane generated by gradient phi gradient psi. So this is analytic in the plane generated by gradient phi gradient psi. Okay. So I I mean this is more more technical. Uh this is more more technical. The reason why they're called Kaliman, limiting Kaleman weights is because there is a Kaliman estimate. So you have information on this part, you don't know anything about the rest. And so you can prove the following. If u and the normal derivative in the part that you don't have information are zero and the other part is And the other part is this is where the gradient phi dot mu is positive or negative. So that's the front face and the back face. You can prove that you have a Kaliman estimate. I'm not going to be very technical, but the point is that you can control the normal derivative in the part that you don't know by the solution itself with some weight. You have to put us called Kaliman weight. element weight. So in this way you can control the formation that you don't have. This is similar to what's used in control theory. You try to control the part of the information that you don't know. Okay, so this is the most technical part and this can be interpreted as a semi-classical Semi-classical wave. Again, tau is 1 over h. H is the Planck constant. It's not a constant. It's going to zero. What Caldeman weight is, I'm not going to explain this. You can see it in the slide. There is a precise definition of what is a limiting Caldeman weight. But the point is that there are very few. For the people who know, this is the People who know this is the Poisson bracket between the real part and the imaginary part of the operator has to be zero when this vanishes. And the gradient is non-zero. And these are all the limiting Kaleman weights can be proven. So this is the one we use in the first proof. This is what we use in the partial data, B0. Be zero. And there are these other ones we haven't used at all. But I haven't found any use for this. But there are very few as you can see. In dimension 2, though, and this we're going to exploit, you have many. Any harmonic function. So psi, in that case, you can solve the Conal equation. This Connor equation This Connor equation, this system, in two dimensions, psi, this is harmonic, psi is a conjugate harmonic function. So there are many solutions. Okay, so I need to finish. I'm going very slowly, but I hope any questions? So this is Yeah, so let me finish here. I will continue tomorrow with the rest. So I hope you remember up to here. All right, thank you.
