Okay, welcome back. The final speaker this morning is Christopher Fry, who's going to tell us about linear equations in Artine and Chebotarov primes. Okay, yeah, many thanks to the organizers for inviting me and letting me speak. It's my first time in India and so far it has been a great experience. Also, I'm a bit chat-lacked and have slept almost nothing this night, so I hope that I'm still a little bit energetic. That I'm still a little bit energetic, at least. Okay, so okay. Uh, is the microphone not working? Yeah, okay. Um, yeah, then I don't know what to do. Okay, good. Um so. So let me start by saying a little bit about primitive roots. So, if A is an integer, then P of A should be the set of all primes such that A is a primitive root mod P. So FP star is generated by the class of A. The class of A. Then there is Atin's conjecture on primitive roots. So this looks at a's, which are not perfect squares and also not equal to minus one. Equal to minus one. And it comes in two flavors. So the first one is qualitative. And it just says that in this case, there are infinitely many primes with A as a primitive root. So cardinality of P of A is infinity. And the second flavor. And the second flavor It's not a square okay and the second flavor is quantitative, so um it gives It gives information about the size of this set. So the set of all primes for which A is a primitive root and P goes up to X is a constant which I call A of A times X over log X as As x goes to infinity. And of course, this A of A should be positive. Yeah, so this says that primes with a prescribed primitive root A even have positive density in all the primes. Okay, yeah, both statements are widely open. But let's. But let's look at sort of simple heuristic reasons why one would believe such a statement, and which can also give you a first guess about how this A of A should look like. Okay, so what is A of A, and this is heuristics. Okay. Okay. So let's start with the simplest one. I will only look at primes that do not divide A. Then, okay. A is a primitive root for P if and only if its order is maximal and by some simple index calculation. And by some simple index calculus, this means that for all q dividing p minus one, q prime a to the p minus one over q should not be one, not p, because then p minus one is really the smallest part that makes it one. And then one can look at this condition, but for a fixed q and But for a fixed Q and vary the P. Okay? So for fixed Q prime, so there are two statements here. The one is that P is congruent to one mod Q, so that's this here. And this has, of course, a probability one over Q minus one. Just by the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions. And the second statement: a to the p minus one over q. Let's do congruent to one, not p. And here there are two things that can happen. There are two things that can happen. Let's take h the maximal power that A is. So H in N should be maximal such that A is some B to the H. Okay. So if So, if Q divides this maximal exponent, then of course this is always true. And if q does not divide this maximal exponent, then Then, well, um, then this A to the P minus one over Q is one of the Q roots modulo p of x to the q minus one, and one of them is one, and so in the And so, in the absence of any further information, so the probability that it is one is one over q. Yeah, maybe this fits in here. So now Q obstructs. Q obstructs A being a primitive root for P, if and only if both of these conditions are satisfied. So the first guess is that maybe this A of A should be something like Be something like, well, okay. And I now take this for all primes and assume that these conditions are independent. So if Q does divide H, then we take one minus this probability times this probability, which is one. And if q let's not divide h, I take one minus one over q times q minus one. Okay. Minus one. Okay. So, I mean, as I said, we don't really know anything about Arten's conjecture. So, this might be true, but it definitely does not match up with numerical calculations in some situations. So, it's probably not true. So, let's try to do something a little bit better. And there are some famous names associated with this. With this, this was done by Artin Cunningham, Heilbronn Boole. The idea is to introduce some mild algebraic number theory to this and to express these two conditions in terms of splitting. In terms of splitting. So let's say K A M should be the number field generated over Q by an nth root of unity and an nth root of A. So these two conditions be congruent one. Congruent one. Now I write mod Q again because it should be prime. And the other one is a to the b minus one over q congruent one mod p. So these two together just mean that p splits in this number field. P splits completely in K A Q. Okay. And then, of course, by Chibatar, we know the density of primes, the splitting in these number fields. So density of Of P in splitting in K A Q is one over the degree. Okay, yeah, this doesn't only hold for primes, this is for arbitrary M's again, and now the Again. And now the idea is that we now want the density of primes for which none of these conditions hold, so which do not split in any of these fields. Not splitting in any. Splitting in any K AQ for Q prime. And well, at least heuristically, one can try to do this by inclusion-exclusion. Okay, so what does this give us? So, this constant is then hopefully something like the density of all primes minus those splitting in Ka2 minus those splitting in KA3. But now, those two split in both extensions, we have now subtracted twice. Both extensions, we have now subtracted twice, so we need to add them in again. And those that split in both extensions are exactly those that split in KA6 because that's the compositum of these two fields. So plus one over Ka6 over Q. And then this goes on. So in the end, what one gets is the sum overall square free Mobius of M. Mobius of M divided by the degree of Ka M over Q. Okay, so that's a guess. And this is probably the correct one. So, whole in what was it, sixty-seven? Proved this here to the asymptotic version with this value of the constant under some version of G or H. More precisely, we used the Riemann hypothesis for. He used the Riemann hypotheses for the Dedekinsator functions of all these fields. Okay. And also, yeah, I mean, we showed that this is absolutely convergent. And he found a product decomposition of this, which is almost the one that we already had. So this constant decomposes as q dividing h. Q dividing H one minus one over Q minus one times Q not dividing H one minus one over Q times Q minus one and then there is a correction factor we need another one minus mu of the absolute value of some. Value of some delta A product overall p dividing delta A and P dividing H one over P minus two and another product overall P dividing delta A P not dividing H some other correction factor which Some other correction factor which doesn't fit in here now. P squared minus p minus one. Okay, it fit in there. Okay. So what's the reason for this? The reason for this is that these splitting conditions with respect to various primes are not independent, as one can easily see, because, for example, where do I put this? Put this here. If you take the field K52, then this is contained in the field K55. So the splitting conditions for 2 and 5 cannot be independent of each other. And this correction factor makes up for these dependencies. Okay. Yeah, so that was a very brief. Yeah, so that was a very brief um summary of some uh results. So sorry? Oh, yeah, should define delta A. So this is the discriminant of Q at joint square root of A. Okay. Good. So, a few years back, I had a result with two colleagues who are here, sitting next to each other, Peter Collins and the Timier Sophos. Where we looked at a certain Where we looked at a certain Diophantine problem in splitting primes. So it appeared in 2019, and I call this a conditional. Asymptotic ternary gold buck with prescribed primitive roots. Okay, so let me state the result. I use a modified vongel function, lambda a of n. So this is just the usual von Mangled function, except that the primes that appear should have a as a primitive root. So this is log p. So this is log p if n is p to the e where p has a as a primitive root and zero otherwise. Okay, um then for A one, A two A. One, a two, a three in z all ai not squares and not minus one under some version of GRH. The sum over n one plus n two plus n three equal to capital N lambda a one of n one lambda a two of n two lambda a three of n three has an asymptotic one. One half times some thing which I call sigma a of n times n squared plus little o of n squared. So yeah, this could be zero. I mean then there are just no solutions of this equation in primes with these prescribed primitive roots. But if it is non-zero, then it is bounded. It is non-zero, then it is bounded absolutely from below. And then this gives a proper asymptotic formula. In particular, this means every sufficiently large n is then a sum of three primes, where we prescribe for each prime a primitive root. Okay. So this work is mainly combining the Combining the circle method by which one proves the classical result, classical Ternary Goldbach, with Hooley's method to do his conditional version of Arten's conjecture. So that was one part of this. And then another very painful part of the paper was to actually analyze this constant because what comes out of the circuit method is very messy and complicated and doesn't really tell you anything. And then we had many, many pages in order to bring this. In order to bring this constant in a nice form. So it's a product decomposition, not a full one, but at least the partial one, from which we also get this uniform boundedness and conditions when it's zero or when it isn't zero. So yeah. Good. So what I want to the main thing that I want to talk about today. Want to talk about today is some vast generalization of this. So in the previous talk, we've seen the Green Toe-Silier theorem. So I also got interested in the Green Toe-Silier theorem a few years back for reasons of. For reasons of rational points, but then once I sort of understood what's going on there and seen the methods that they apply and got a grasp of this vast machinery, it sort of became really an obvious thing to try this with other configurations. And that's what we did. So that's a joint work with Magdalena Tinkova. With Magdalena Tinkova and it's still in progress. Yeah. So essentially, we have to write it up. Okay. So here we replace this. This linear equation n1 plus n2 plus n3 equal to n by other linear configurations as in green C D Cedia. So maybe I'll now review the setup of Green Tot CTR and also state their result and then I do and then I show you what we can do. So I think we've seen this more or less in the previous talk. So C one up to C T this is a system Of affine linear forms in the language of Green Tau and Seeker, which just means linear polynomials in, say, S variables. So, IE each CI is polynomial with integer coefficients in Coefficients in variables x1 up to xs, not constant. And it should be of finite complexity. So, instead of defining what the complexity of such a system is, I just give you a characterization of finite complexity, which is also the same that. Complexity, which is also the same that we've seen in the previous talk. So I E know two linear parts are proportional over Q. Okay, so no two linear parts are linearly. Okay, so no two linear parts are linearly dependent, and then there is some other technical condition: a notion of size for this system. And it should be bounded. And this is size relative to an asymptotic parameter n. So let me briefly say what this means. So this notion of size that they use is the maximum of the graphic. Is the maximum of the coefficients of the forms of the linear coefficients? And then for the constant coefficient, they allow it to be of order of magnitude up to n. So plus psi i of zero divided by n. Divided by n. So this should also be bounded. That's important because in this system here there is an n appearing. And okay. So, what's the green toe zero result in their language? So, if you take an arbitrary convex body in R to the S, and assume that it is actually actually bounded so in minus n of 2n to the s then sum overall n in k with integer coordinates product i from one up to t curtical product of this form c i of n of n is some beta infinity times product of world primes p beta p plus a little of n to the s so this counts um how often all of these uh forms simultaneously take prime values um weighted by thumbmonger as usual okay Okay. So this beta infinity, this is very simple. This is just the volume of this convex body intersected with everything that does not obstruct, that gives not a real obstruction. So a real obstruction would be negative numbers because primes are positive. So here we have C. So here we have C inverse of R plus to the T. The volume of this gives the speed infinity. And usually, if you choose your convex body nicely and in right relation to this N, then this is usually of order of magnitude n to the S. And then I will also show you what their beta p is because we Beta p is because we will then have something similar. So their beta p is p to the minus s times sum overall n in z mod p set for the s. So it's an average over z mod p set for the s product i from one up to t. I from one up to t. And here they take the local from Mangled function of Ci n. So what's this local from Mangal function of some B. So lambda set P of B. This is The G C D of B and P is, well, not one, and otherwise, it's P over P minus one. Okay. This is exactly the Density of primes in the arithmetic progression B mod P. So let's also write this down because it's I'm going to use an analog of this later. So we take some n from one up to n lambda of Of Pn plus B. So, how often is this regression take prime values? This is lambda set P of B times M plus a little O of M. Okay, so this is one way to state the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions. Okay, and this product of. This product over P that appears here converges absolutely. Okay. So that's the green tower result. So maybe just if you have never seen this, some examples of interesting special cases. So SST equals s is t equals one. So we have one form in one variable c1 of n, then takes the form q n plus b and what you get is just the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions. If you take s equals two p equals three and as a system As our system of forms, we take n1, n2, and n minus n1 minus n2. So there is now important that we allow the constant coefficients to go up to n. Then this gives us back the ternary Goldbach. The asymptotic ternary goldbach. Yeah, okay. Um if s is two and we take the forms n1, n1 plus n2 and one plus two and two up to n1 plus t minus one and two. Then this gives us t term arithmetic progressions in the primes. Arithmetic progressions in the primes. So, of course, these two were known long before the Greenthol theorem. This wasn't, and this was probably the main motivation that we were interested in to get an asymptotic for this. And a non-example. And a non-example, s is one, t is two, and c of n is n and n plus two. This would be twin primes. But the green tau theorem does not tell us anything about twin primes because this system does not have finite complexity, because the two linear parts are the same. Okay. Yeah, okay. So that's a that's a non-example. Good. Um and what we have is essentially the the same result, but with with rin primes and of course conditionally on on GRH. Okay, so we have same result with prescribed primitive roots. Okay, um and of course under GRH so let a1 up to a t again be integers that can be primitive roots. So all ai are not squares and all ai are different from I different from minus one. Then, no, let's do the same. So, sum overall n in our convex body with integer coordinates, product i from one up to t, lambda ai. So now I do this restricted from Mongol function. Do this restricted from Mangled function to describe primitive roots of ci of n. And now, what do we have on the right-hand side? It's looking a bit different, but not too much. The beta infinity is exactly the same. Then we have product i from one up to t. Up to t A A I. So this was the Atin constant that we discussed at the beginning. So this is the probability that a random prime has Ai as a primitive root. Okay. Then we have some sigma A C of some Of some dA. And then we have a product over all primes not dividing this dA sigma a c of p and plus a little o of n to the s. So now I need to explain this and this. So let's start with DA. So this is just the least common multiple of all the quadratic discriminants that appear for these AIs. Delta AI. Oh, and I also need this H AI. So this was the maximal exponent of H as a power of something. As a power of something. For from one up to t. So I cannot separate primes. So I cannot separate the bad primes here into a product. They need to stick together, but I can separate all the others into another product. Okay. Then I need a quantity that's called delta. Delta of A, B, and Q. And that should be the density of primes that have A as a primitive root and that are congruent to B mod Q. So I'll define it by a result of Landstra. He showed under GRH, and using essentially the method of Hooly, that the number of primes up to X such that P is congruent to B mod Q. And And as a as a primitive root that this is about this delta of A B Q times X over log X. Yeah. Plus a little O of the same thing. Of the same thing. Okay. So Lenster showed that this density exists. He gave a formula for this density in terms of, again, such an alternating infinite sum. And Moray later on gave a complicated closed formula for this. So we have a formula for this data. Formula for this delta. So these appear, and with these deltas, I can use them essentially to replace this local formula functions in order to define my local factors. Okay, so what is this sigma A C of some Q, which is now not necessarily prime. So it's essentially what's up here. So Q to the So Q to the minus S times sum overall N in Z mod Q Z S and average over Z mod Q Z to the S. Product I from one up to P Q times delta of A I CI of N and Q divided by A of A I. Okay. So what's this? Why is this there? So if you formulate the prime number theorem in arithmetic progressions in this way. Progressions in this way, then you get this additional factor p here. And in the same way, if you formulate a Landstroft result in a way analogous to this, you get this additional vector Q here. So this here, the numerator is a very simple. Numerator is the weighted probability that a number that is congruent to this CI of n. Modulo Q is a prime with a primitive root AI And in the numerator, we have the weighted probability that an arbitrary number is a prime with primitive root Ai. Arbitrary number is prime with a primitive root. Ai. And then this is summed over all the values that this Ci of n can take. And this is our analog of these beta factors in the green tau result, Green Tau Siegel result. Okay. Yeah. How much time do we have? Five minutes? Okay. So let me maybe. Okay, so let me maybe start by saying in the ternary-Goldbach result from earlier, this gives exactly the constant that we had there. But as I said, in this other paper, we had to work very hard to get this constant. And it was not obvious that it looks this way. Here, using this green tau machinery, the green tau Ziegler machinery, it is really what the method naturally gives you. So we didn't have to. We didn't have to do any manipulations beyond what the method does in order to directly obtain this constant. Then also we, in this ternary Goldbook paper, we had to work a little in order to find this interpretation of what this constant means. And also, here, if you compare it to the original green towel result, it's really just the same that happens there, yeah. So, except for this. Except for this fact that a prescribed primitive root is sort of seen as a global condition and put in front and not in each of the local vectors. Okay. Maybe I just say it in words now. We have an analogous result where having a prescribed primitive root is replaced. Prescribed primitive root is replaced by lying in a prescribed Chabotarov class in a given Gauda extension. So this is unconditional. So additionally we have an unconditional Result with these von Mangled functions that prescribe a primitive root replaced by some vonmangled function kc, where the prime has to lie in the conjugacy class, the c of the Gauda extension k. Of the Gaudi extension k. I mean, the Arten symbol of the primer. So the Chebotarev condition. This also generalizes an earlier result by Daniel Kane, who again had the case of one linear equation by an application of the circuit method. Good. So in the remaining, I don't know, one minute. One minute. Let me briefly say what we had to do for the proof. So, in order to apply the green total sigil machinery, one needs to do two things. One needs to construct a pseudo-random major end for the arithmetic function under investigation, which we get for free, because we just take the pseudo-random major end for the classical Femongle function, which also majorizes ours. And the second thing is you need to study correlations between. Study correlations between your functions, so this lambda a and this lambda kc, and nil sequences. And for this, for the lambda kc, we sort of took Keynes' circle method approach. So he studied correlations with exponential phases, and we upgraded this to higher order. To higher order middle sequences using, well, I mean, using arguments from the Green Tau papers that are essentially lots of applications of the pigeonhole principle and Cauchy Schwartz and a nice result of Matthiasen. So that's a very useful result that she has, which says essentially if you take Essentially, if you take a polynomial subsequence of an equidistributed nil sequence, then it stays equidistributed under some quantitative restrictions. And that goes into taking Pain's methods and upgrading them to nil sequences. And then, when we have this lambda KC, then we need to combine this with Hooley's method. With Hooley's method in order to go from the lambda KC's for various number fields to the lambda A's. And this is also a bit subtle because there are some issues with the W trick in the green tower method. So in order to make this work, we had to choose the W to grow extremely slowly with the asymptotic parameter. Asymptotic parameter. In fact, we cannot even say how slowly because it's sort of implicit in the proof. But yeah, I mean, I've never seen this in any application of the green tau method that one has to choose W is so small, but it works. That's no problem. Okay, so let me stop here. Thank you very much. Can you make your choice of W with an explicit formula? Yes, I mean it's it's the essentially the product of all primes up to some very small number. And this very small number grows with the asymptotic parameter. Grows with the asymptotic parameter, but we cannot say how quickly. Very, very slowly. And this is sort of implicit in the proof how slowly. But the only thing that where this matters is in sort of in the in the quality of this little O-term, which we don't care about anyway. More questions? More questions? Can you say anything about non-zeroness of that leading constant in this generality? We haven't thought about this yet. But I suppose, I mean, the analysis of this in full generality, I guess, is too complicated. But in any given special case, probably one can do similar stuff as we've done in our paper and end up with a complicated table. End up with a complicated table of conditions. Regarding the factor with the bad primes, did you prove that it's never going to split or is there a chance that by adding another 20 pages to the paper, it might split? We proved in the other paper, in the Henry Goldbach paper, that it's never going to split in this case. Okay, thank you. In this case. Okay, okay. Lillian has a number of papers where she, I guess, has some general process for getting these linear relations when you're weighted by arithmetic functions. But do those not apply to your setting? Can you remind me? Does she always look at arithmetic functions which are multiplicative or something? Or something? She has a lot of papers on multiplicative arithmetic functions. And she has these other papers about representation functions for norms. And I mean, techniques out of this, we have to use some of Lilian's techniques. The current direct do not apply it for us. Thank you.
