Is the screen sharing okay? Yeah, it works perfectly. Great. So thanks to all organizers of this workshop for making it happening and inviting me to speak and give an introduction on this topic. I will try to talk about extra. I will try to talk about extreme events and climate change and give a statistical perspective of this. And I will start with some key motivation. So why we need, and I think we really need, to investigate how extreme events are affected by climate change. Well, one key reason I think is because many impacts of climate change, maybe even most or all of them, are expected to occur through extreme events. Through extreme events. And there are many examples of that. But if I had to give just one to start this talk, I would think about sea level rise. Because this sea level rise is a very slow and continuous process. So you know the sea is rising by a few millimeters a year. But in fact, when this will occur and have impact on society, this is always through extreme events because locally there is an extreme high There is an extreme high sea level associated with tropical cyclones or a storm, which will induce very quick damage to lots of activities and infrastructure. And so in fact, most of times extreme events really play a key role in the impacts. And so there are basically two questions asked about extreme events. The first is how extreme events are affected by climate change. Are affected by climate change or will be affected by climate change. And another one, which is, of course, very related, what events to expect in the future, given the climate is changing and warming for the coming decades at the least. And in all these questions, statistics play a central role. And so I will try in this talk to illustrate which statistical questions are involved in this topic. So this is an attempt to give So, this is an attempt to give a review of recent research and statistical challenges in investigating extreme events and climate change. And I will assume, following the advice of the organizers, that everyone in the audience is familiar with statistics and typically the statistics involved in investigating extreme events like GEV or GPD distributions, but not necessarily familiar with climate data. So, I will try to introduce this. So I will try to introduce this. So in brief this talk, I will start by introducing which events are considered in the weather and climate application, I would say. What are the typical data available to investigate how these events are changing? What are the key questions related to this? I have already mentioned a few ones, but there are others more specific maybe and in particular. More specific, maybe, and in particular, those related to the attribution of climate change. And then I will highlight some statistical challenges and also some personal work on these questions. And I will finish with some quick conclusions. So let's go. In fact, when you want to make a review of available knowledge on climate change and extreme events, there are Climate change and extreme events, there are pretty much material already available. And if you look just at the last 10 years, there have been three IPCC reports. I will not introduce IPCC again. I assume everyone is familiar with IPCC. There are three IPCC reports dealing with extreme events and climate change. So there was a SRECS report in 2012, which was a report devoted entirely to Devoted entirely to extreme events. And the last two, I would say, general assessment reports. So the AR5 in 2014 and the year 6 last year also make a broad assessment of current knowledge about these events. So the first question I would like to tackle now is which events are we talking about? And I will distinguish events depending on which weather of physical variables are involved in these events. So of course, the first type of event, which is maybe the easiest types of event, are events related to temperature extremes. They could be warm events, they could be cold events. And because global warming is warming and is effective, affecting almost all regions. Affecting almost all regions worldwide by inducing higher temperatures, we clearly expect more warm events and less cold events as the global climate is warming. And so this is the easy case. Then there are heavy precipitation, which means a high amount of rainfall in a relatively short duration, typically Relatively short duration, typically one day or even smaller, one hour. That is pretty easy too because we know that over most regions we anticipate an increase in heavy precipitation to some points we already see that is happening. And another extreme events related to precipitation is of course the draft. Many countries and regions are on the And region on the earth have been affected by drought recently, including the US and France, this year, for instance, right now. But the response about the relationship between drafts and climate change is a bit more difficult because it depends to some point on how you define the draft. Could be a lack of precipitation, could be a lack of water available in the soil, it could be a lack of water in the It could be a lack of water in the rivers, for instance. There are three different definitions. And so the response partly depends on the definitions, the regions, the periods we consider, whether this is a very long or short duration, for instance. For these three types of events, I think the latest IPCC report, the R6, provide very clear take-home messages about how climate change is affected. About how climate change is affecting these events. And so these are summarized by this figure from the summary for policymakers. So on the right-hand side here. And so the top of the figure is about hot temperature extremes. This panel is about heavy precip. And this panel is about one particular type of draft, which is the agricultural and ecological drafts. And in some specific regions as well, so drying regions. Drying regions. So, what is shown in this figure is that for a 10-year hot event or 15-year hot event, for instance, you illustrate how the frequency of this event is evolving as the climate warms at the global scale. So in the pre-industrial climate, for instance, if you take a 10-year event, you have this event occurring on an average. On average, once every 10 years. And as the climate is warming, you see the number of events for 10 trials, the number of hot events is increasing up to about nine events for a four degree global warming level. And another way to look at this is not the frequency, but the intensity of the event. And you see how... And you see how anthropogenic climate change is making this event hotter again as the mean climate is warming. So typically for one degree of global mean warming, you have a 1.2 degree hotter 10 year event. And so you have the equivalent for 15 year hot event and for heavy precip and drafts. So there is already pretty much knowledge available on this. Much knowledge available on this, and there is also in the R6 a translation of this current knowledge about how it will affect various regions. And so this is illustrated by this other figure from the summary for policymaker again. And you see, this is a very stilatile view of the world map. You have, so each hexagon here is a region. This is a North American. This is North America, this is Eurasia, Australia. And this is divided into small regions, for instance, the Mediterranean here and Western Europe. And so for each region, you have this map three times for hot events, heavy precipit events, and drafts. And when you get colors, it's basically that we have already evidence that climate change is affecting this type of events in the considerable. type of events in the consider region. And again you can see that the influence, even in today's climate, the influence on this type of extreme is pretty broad geographically, especially for hot events, but also heavy precipitation and to some point at least for drying, over drying regions, for drafts. But then these are maybe the three types of extreme events which are the most well-known. And in fact, there are many. And in fact, there are many other types of events. This is another list for which the knowledge is not necessarily that well established. So first we have floods. I know floods are pretty related to heavy precipitation, but it's not exactly the same thing. And if you look at very big drainage basins, for instance, evaporation is usually increasing. Evaporation is usually increasing with climate change, and so there is a competing effect of increasing heavy pressure, but also growing evaporation. So floods not necessarily that easy. There is one specific type of floods related to sea level rise. I've spoken already a bit, which are coastal floods and waves also play some role in this type of events. And in that case, it's a bit easier maybe to make recent... Easier, maybe, to make a relationship because we know that the sea level is rising, and this is affecting most regions worldwide. But then, if we continue with this list, there are storms both in the tropics, tropical cyclones, and outside of the tropics, extra-tropical storms. And in fact, it's much more difficult because there are various processing at play relating climate change to these events. To these events. So it's ideal and it's much more difficult to build a strong relationship between storms and climate change. There is pretty much research ongoing with tropical cyclones, but one of the key results is that the proportion of very intense tropical cyclone is expected to increase under climate change, but to some point this could be offset by a decreasing number of total tropical cyclones. And so the message here is a bit more complicated. The message here is a bit more complicated. There are also much, much smaller events in terms of the spatial scale, like convecting storms. And this is a synonym for these events to occur in France, for instance. We had many questions about thunderstorms, convective gusts, lightning, hail associated to convective storms. The scale of these events is typically a few kilometers, and it's very difficult to get models to simulate these events. But in fact, they have also a strong impact. Events, but in fact, they have also a strong impact, and there are lots of questions about how these events will evolve under climate change. And then, something which is a bit new in the literature is and fashioned, I think, at the moment, is the investigation of compound events, which means several types of physical variables being extremes simultaneously. For instance, people have been investigating simultaneous Investigating simultaneous hot and dry events. And another nice illustration I can give for these compound events in which you really need two distinct phenomenons to happen consecutively to have some impact, is a frost on active vegetation, because this is something that happened recently, our friends. So you have in the early spring, you have a period of with very warm, anomalously warm temperature, and this induces... Temperature and this induces vegetation to start growing. And after that, you have a frost episode. So, and so typically, flowers or starting vegetation is impacted by the frost. And the combination of the two things, a warm period followed by frost, is very impactful. Again, to model these events, you need to account for all the The chronology of the temperature, for instance, in that case. Okay, so this is the type of, I would say, the biodiversity of events we might be interested in. And then the available knowledge is very different depending on which type of events you consider. So now I will browse a bit which data we can use to make an assessment of how climate change is affecting these events. Affecting these events. The first one, of course, is observations. And there is a big bunch of literature available to describe how extreme events have evolved over the recent years and decades. I have just a few very simple illustrations here. The top panel here comes from a paper by Robert Votta in 2015. It's just a very simple trend analysis in ground measurement station. In ground measurement station for the seasonal, in fact, the annual max of daily rainfall for various ground stations. So, each color line is one ground station, and you can see the very high variability of the measurement from one year to the next. Sometimes you have a very high amount of rainfall, like this one, unprecedented in the record. And in fact, usually investigating the significance of the changes. Significance of the changes for just one time series is very difficult because the time series are very noisy and the record is quite short in time. And so, there is an interest in combining those series somehow, potentially with spatial aggregation. It could be very simple things like averaging as done here by Vota Artal to make the signal, I mean to improve the signal-to-nose ratio and make inference a bit easier. And make inference a bit easier or accurate, maybe. And another example comes from the latest IPCC report in which there is a description of the observed linear trends in some hot and cold weather extremes over the last few decades. So, this is one type of data available to make this kind of inference. And of course, there will be a lot of. And of course, there is another very important type of data, which is models, climate models. And so, I will take a few minutes to explain what models are and why they are so useful for us climate scientists. Again, I assume not everyone is familiar with this. So, the climate models are basically an attempt to resolve all physical equations we know. All physical equations we know about the behavior of the atmosphere and all the components of the climate system numerically. So, we try to resolve these differential equations numerically. What we know is all the processes. So, we have the Navier-Stokes equation describing the dynamics of the motion of the atmosphere, for instance. We have thermodynamics equation, we have equation describing the radiation and the exchange of energy through the radiation. Change of energy through the radiation. We know all these equations, but there is no easy solution available. And so, to get an approximation of potential solutions, we discretize all the atmosphere. So we cut the atmosphere in small boxes and affect to each box a speed, a temperature, a pressure, and so on, and try to resolve this. And try to resolve these equations numerically. So the typical resolution for global climate models is in fact quite rough. Course is the horizontal resolution is typically 100 kilometers, meaning that everything happening below this typical size is not solved by the model itself. The vertical resolution is a bit smaller, typically a few hundreds of meters. A few hundreds of meters, and the temporal resolution is typically 15 minutes, which means that when you make very long climate simulations from the pre-industrial climate, so the 19th century to the end of the 21st century, in fact, you need to simulate all the states of the atmosphere each 15 minutes over this long period of time. And this, of course, makes that simulations by these climate models are very expensive. Expensive, and we need big computers to run them. But still, they have allowed the community to make big progresses in the modeling and understanding and also projections for climate change. In fact, modeling the atmosphere is not enough. And because the climate system is coupled, you need to model also the ocean, the land surfaces, the biosphere. land surfaces, the biosphere, the cryosphere, which means glaciers, ice sheets, snow, rivers, and other components. So this is a quite quite difficult task in fact. And another thing is when you get these numerical models, you can play with them and you can run all types of experiments, including experiments in which you change the amount of The amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, just like it happened in the real world, for instance, or experiments in which you do not, you kept you keep constant greenhouse gas concentration and you can see what is happening. So I get some illustration of that. The first point here is really to remind that model development and use is a huge effort of the community, maybe one of the biggest achievement in the climate community over the last few decades. Over the last few decades. And then to illustrate the type of numerical experiment you can perform, there is this figure. So, with our climate model, CNRM CM6. And this comes from a paper by World Vital in 2019. In fact, you need first with a climate model to have some spin-up period to reach some equilibrium in the climate. So this is represented by this period of time. Represented by this period of time. So the unit of the x-axis here is Euras. You can see that there are very long simulations up to 1,000 of Euros with this kind of modes. And the black line here after year zero is what we call a pre-industrial control simulation. So we keep everything constant. There is no change in the solar activity, so the amount of radiation coming from the sun. There is no change. From the sun, there is no change in greenhouse gas concentrations. And you can see that there are already some slow fluctuations in the black line here, typically the scale of a few decades to one century maybe here, which are not related to a change in the forcing, a change in which is external to the system, it's just internal variability, which is a low frequency. And then we also compute historical experiments. So there are historical experiments. So there are experiments in which we modify the amount of greenhouse gas and other forcings just as it happened in the real world. And so each colored line here is one historical experiment starting from a different initial condition. And there are 10 such experiments in this case. And in each case, you can see that this is the start of the In the start of the historical simulations during the first maybe 100 years, there is no big warming because this is expected to be the year 1850. And in fact, between 1850 and 1950, there is no big change in the climate system. But after that, you see a quick warming, which is related to the increase of greenhouse gas as a result of human activity, basically. Of human activity, basically, and this is happening for each of the historical runs shown here. Okay, and these historical runs sometimes are continued with assumptions about what will be the future emissions of greenhouse gas over the 21st century and beyond. And these are called scenarios or projections for climate change. And there are also other types of experiments, typically theoretical experiments, in which we double the amount of We double the amount of atmospheric CO2 abruptly, and we see how much time is needed for the system to come to a new equilibrium, and what is the amount of roaming when this new equilibrium is reached. And this number is known as equilibrium climate sensitivity. It's been very, very much used to describe how the climate system responds to an increase in greenhouse gas. So, other illustrations here. So other illustrations here, this is the response for a collection. Yeah, so maybe one point before. There are another achievement of our communities to provide coordinated simulations through multi-model ensembles. And now worldwide, you have about 40 models, climate models available. And of course, you can compare the results from these models. As shown here, this is the response over the historical period and the 21st century. Period and the 21st century to a given scenario. There is this weird name here about this specific scenario: how much the global mean temperature is rising associated in response to this scenario. And you can see that the various models considered here simulate pretty different level of warming in 2100 compared to the reference, which is the pre-industrial time. Even though the change in the atmospheric concentration of Change in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is the same for all models. So, there is this type of uncertainty with models you need to account for. Okay, and in fact, the landscape is even a bit more complicated because I have spoken about climate models, global climate models, which are coarse resolution, but there are also regional models with a bit higher resolution. And now the community is moving toward kilometer scale resolution, the scale of about one kilometer in the horizontal. Horizontal and these models gain new capabilities in simulating small-scale events. Okay, what are the typical questions to investigate about the relationship between climate change and extreme events? So if you have a quick look at the AR6 chapter on extremes, you always find this type of plan. Plan typically outline. The first point is to discuss mechanisms and drivers. And this is typically physics, so I won't comment on that today. Then you see an assessment of observed trends, just as I shown before. This already involves pretty much of statistics, but I have spoken about that already. There is a point about model. There is a point about model evaluation. Are we confident in the fact that the models, climate models we are using have some capabilities in simulating the extreme events of interest? Then there is detection and attribution. And one particular type of that is the event attribution. And there are projections. And so in this section, I will try to illustrate the last two items. And I will start with the easiest, which are Start with the easiest, which are projections. So, the way we investigate the response in climate models in projections is quite simple. In fact, we have this collection of our ensemble of climate model simulations, and we just describe how extreme events are responding to climate change in these simulations. And this involves already some use of the extreme value theory, for instance, but in a pretty simple way. But in a pretty simple way, I have one illustration here on the right about temperature. This is a paper by Michael Wiener et al. in 2020 describing how, so this particular plot is about how the coldest temperature in the year, and in fact not the coldest each year, but the 20-year written value for cold temperature, is warming under climate change. And the response here is shown for two. And the response here is shown for two different generations of climate models, CMIP5 and CMIP6, and for various levels of the global mean warming. So this is for 1.5 degree global mean warming, 2 degrees, and so on. And you can see that there is this pattern of warming for the cold extremes, in which the warming of the extreme is much stronger near the Arctic and in the northern. Near the Arctic and in the northern hemisphere in general, than near the tropics or in the south. Another illustration is for the precipitation, extreme precip. This is a map taken from the AR5 in which we look at the daily, sorry, the change in daily precip. So this is the maximum precip rainfall in one day, and this is a 20-year return value for that quantity. How this is changing. How is this changing for each degree of global mean warming? And you have this map in which you can see that in almost all locations, in particular over land, there is an increase in this quantity. There are few oceanic dry regions in which there is a decrease. And recently, for instance, John et al. tried to provide a confidence interval. So the confidence here is calculated over the Is calculated over the sample of climate models available. So at each location, what is the range for the change in daily extreme precipit expected if you look at the spread of climate model results? So these maps on the right give you some indication on that confidence interval. You have the median and the lower bound and upper bound. Now another important Now, another important question about changes in extreme is about detection and attribution. So, there are basically two concepts here. The first one is detection is basically our observations consistent with internal viability only? Or, and this is the alternative, is there in the observations a discernible influence from some external forcings? External forcings. External forcings could be man-made increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, for instance, or could be other natural forces, for instance, such as volcanic activity. And another concept is the attribution in which we try to assess the relative contribution of various external forces. And historically, in fact, there have been several steps. In fact, there have been several steps in the attribution focus. First, people have been wondering whether the change they were facing was really related to the anthropogenic influence versus the natural forcings. We know there are a few factors naturally influencing the behavior of the planet system, like changes in the solar activity or volcanoes. But in fact, it was maybe relatively easy to Relatively easy to prove the importance of the anthropogenic factors in there because we now know that most of the observed warming is related to the human influence on climate. And then recently, the focus has become more in a subtle distinction between two effects of the human activities. The first one is the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, and the other one is the emission of... and the other one is the emission of aerosol which are in fact particles in the atmosphere which tend to reflect the sunlight and then induce a cooling of the temperature near the surface. So this used to be two compensating effects and people have been working in disentangling these two influences on the mean climate and the mean temperature, but also in terms of extreme events. So a very simple illustration of this is Illustration of this is this paper by Sen Ki Min showing claiming that human contribution to more intense precipitation extremes was becoming significant. And this was in 2011 and was then followed by another paper by Zangetal in which people tried to specifically prove the role of the human activity. The role of the human activities in this increase. I will not comment on the figure because I'm a bit late, maybe. Okay, now a more recent topic has been event attribution. Event attribution is a bit of the same idea, but for a specific event. So we consider a specific event that did happen. And of course, the historical example of that is the European 2003 heatwaves, which was 2003 heat waves, which was the topic of a study in Nature published in 2004 by Stott et al. And we try to investigate and describe what is the human contribution to that event. In practice, people usually assess the human influence on the probability of the event and on the intensity of the event. And so the key indices are the probability ratio. So the ratio between P1, the probability. Between P1, the probability of such an event to happen in the current world, which is usually called the factual world, and P0, which is the probability of the same event to happen in the counter factual world, which is the world in which humans have not influenced the climate. So you have this probability ratio, you have the change in the identity of the event. The same concept, you look at the intensity, so you basically you freeze the So you basically you freeze the probability P1 of the event in today's climate and look at what is the intensity of an event of that probability in the factual climate I1 and in the counterfactual climate I0. And by comparing these two numbers, you get an idea how much humans have made this event more intense. And so this first paper in 2004 described human contribution on the European heat waves of 2003. Heat waves of 2003 with an assessment of the increase in risk related to the human influence on the climate. And so the key conclusion was that the human influence made this event at least twice more likely than what it was without human inference. Now, this area of event attribution is evolving towards two directions, I think. The first one is people. Directions: I think the first one is people are trying to provide very quick, rapid statements about the relationship between one event and specific events that has just happened and human influence on climate. And the World Weather Attribution Group, for instance, is going into that direction. And the reason for that is because there is two assumptions, basically. The first is that statements about the relationship between Statements about the relationship between one event and climate change will favor awareness raising, both in the media, in the general public, and in policymakers. And also another interest, potential interest, I would say, of that approach is the legal aspect, because now in some specific events, people have been suing governments or people responsible for CO2 emissions. For CO2 emissions, for instance, because they were affected by an event for which you can prove that it was made much more likely due to climate change. And so, of course, in this case, there is a clear relationship with causality. So, I wanted to highlight this relationship because I think it will be part of this workshop. Maybe I will skip this 2010 Russian. The 2010 Russian heatwave example and focus just on and mention the work by Alexey, Anarch, and colleagues. We tried to make it clear what is the relationship, the causal relationship between events and climate change by decomponing what is the probability for the necessary causation, Pn, probability of sufficiency causation, PS, and probability for necessary and sufficient causation. For necessary and sufficient causation PNS. So, in these papers, there is a mistake here, LaTeX mistake, sorry. This is one minus P0 over P1. And so it makes it clear that usually in weather or climate events, human influence is a necessary cause, but not a sufficient cause, which means that the event is made. Means that the event is made much more likely by climate change. But climate change alone is not enough to make this event happening, or maybe more specifically, make the event to happen any year from now. And so I believe this work will be discussed later in this workshop. So I will come to some statistical challenges and personal work related to this topic. Topic okay, so I'm okay. Um I will start with with one specific type of statistical model for investigating extreme events, which is non-stationary models. So this one, and this is maybe one of the most popular models at the moment to investigate. At the moment, to investigate extremes, because clearly climate change puts us in a non-stationary context, and we need to account for that. So, I assume here that we have one appropriate covariate XT and one very popular way to model annual maxima in this context is to put the GEV distributions in which the two first parameters, the location mu, the scales, the location mu, the scale sigma are evolving following x as a covariate. And typically people assume that the shape parameter xi is a constant in this model, so it's not affected by climate change. There are a few specific questions related to using such a model. The first is what is the appropriate covariate XT for this type of model. People usually use some temperature. Use some temperature over a big region, which could be the entire globe or a more specific region for that, because most extremes have been shown to scale approximately with a change in temperature. But still, you can wonder what is the appropriate covariate. One type of question not necessarily addressed very often is whether or not it is visible. Whether or not it is reasonable to assume that the shape parameter is constant. And of course, when you focus on very rare extremes, if Xi is affected by climate change, maybe this is the first information you need because it will affect the tail of the distribution very seriously. And then there are other questions related to the fact that annual max for some variables may not fit. Variables may not fit a GEV. The GEV assumption is valid when you compute the max over a very long, very large block of data. But maybe taking the max over just one year does not provide a long enough block to ensure that you are close to the GEV asymptotic approximation. And there are a few papers recently claiming that. Papers recently claiming that you must be careful in using the GEV assumption in that context. A few other points I will mention quickly. There have been specific interest about very low likelihood but high impact scenarios or events in the literature recently. And this was one of the topic in the RSX. And also statistics. And also statistics play a big role in assessing changes for extreme events in which you don't have very accurate observations and you don't have models because models are simply not capable of simulating these events. And in that case, usually statistics are used to investigate how the environmental conditions favoring this type of extreme events, how these conditions are evolved. How are these conditions evolving under climate change? There are a few examples provided here. There are specific statistical questions related to the data themselves. So this might not be well known. I will roll that quickly and focus on one question in the last two slides before I conclude this talk. So people might not be necessarily aware of all issues. Necessarily aware of all issues potentially affecting observations. There are many, and so they always involve a sophisticated statistical method to be addressed. So the first one is measurement uncertainty. Any observation is associated to some uncertainty and now there is a growing effort in internationally shared data sets to quantify the measurement uncertainty. Part of it is related to Part of it is related to homogeneity issues, the fact that when you compare measurement at different places, different periods and with different instruments, you may have some lack of homogeneity in time and this need to be corrected to enable climate analysis. Of course, one of the usual issues with observations that you have many missing data and Missing data and the data you have are not necessarily representative of what is happening over the entire space. So there are issues related to the use of spatial statistics to make observations a bit more representative. And of course, the latest issue is that you typically have short records, which makes that any inference about the trends in the observations might be Might be inaccurate, or I would say, more difficult related to the shortness of the record. There are also issues specific to using of model data. The first one is models do have systematic biases which needs to be corrected. And so there is an entire topic which I will not discuss now about bias corrections for the model. Corrections for the model outputs. And related to this, another issue with model data is that the resolution is often very coarse. So, this is an illustration with this figure over the continental US. You have typically this square showing the resolution of a global climate model. And if you look specifically over some states, it is of interest to understand how the field that is shown here may be Shown here may be varying at a much higher spatial resolution, especially in regions where there is orography playing some role. And so this is another topic connected but distinct from bias correction, which is the statistical downscaling of model outputs. And then of course models do not necessarily agree as I shown before and there is a topic about combining models in assessing the model. In assessing the model uncertainty. And this is made difficult by the fact that the many models we have available worldwide are not independent. They have been developed using the same assumptions and method and even sometimes pieces of code. And the design of the international exercises is not made to sample all the uncertainty on the model side. Okay, then I think there is one, and so this is. Then I think there is one, and so this is the big point I want to focus on the last two slides. I think there is a big topic about combining observations and models. In what I've shown before, there is side analysis of observations and models. But in fact, if you want to provide the best available knowledge about future extremes, probably there is a need to combine these two sources of information. And so this was made. And so this was made for the first time in the latest IPCC report. People have tried to make such combination. And I will illustrate how. So this is not for extremes, but for the mean climate, the global mean temperature of the Earth. And there are a few studies trying to make this combination. And so as an illustration, I put here a figure from RIBS et al. 2021. Again, this is. Again, this is the forced response, so the change in mean temperature induced by external forcings for a collection of semi-models. And if you make comparison with available observations of the global mean temperature of the Earth, you can see that the observed data, the black point here, are consistent with some of the gray lines, but not all. Some of the models are clearly overestimating the warming and others are The warming and others are underestimating the warming over the historical period. And we have observations to claim that there is an overestimation or underestimation. And in fact, you can be interested in calculating what are the future climate and the future amount of warming consistent with the observations we have available at the moment. And this can be done by statistical techniques. And so in that particular paper, we tried to Paper, we tried to make this calculation deriving a confidence interval of what is the future amount of roaming conditional to already available observation. And we make this calculation in a Bayesian way. So the R6, okay, made a synthesis of this result, but I will not detail this figure again. And maybe the last comment on that is that now this is coming towards extra. Coming towards extreme events as well. And there are the first papers claiming that observational constraints may be applied to extreme events, meaning that observations of the extreme events now provide enough evidence to rethink the projections we have about future climate change. Then another way to combine observations and models is, in fact, again to use maybe, and so this was a Maybe, and so this was a proposition in a paper by Rubin and Ribes in 2020, ASCMO, is to use bi-agent statistics to combine the two sources of information for estimating the parameters in a GEV model. So again, I will use the same GEV non-stationary models as I shown before. I assume that the covariance, the covariate X is known here, and so X is known here, and so there are basically five parameters to estimate: mu0, mu1, sigma 0, sigma 1, and x. And the idea in this paper was to try to combine models and observations to make that. The reason, the motivation behind this was that some of the parameters are really difficult to estimate in the observations only because the record is very short. Because the record is very short, and for example, the shape parameter is usually very challenging to estimate from observed records. Maybe the non-stationary parameters are challenging too. And in another side, a few parameters and those representative of the stationary climate, so mu zero and sigma zero. In fact, you can estimate them pretty well using observations because you have enough information. Because you have enough information in the observed record to have pretty accurate estimates for these parameters. And models for these parameters might be easily biased and you may be interested in correcting this bias. So in fact, what we did in this particular study was to assume models provide a prior on the parameters θ, which we took a Gaussian prior. We took a Gaussian prior for Seta, and then given available observations y, we compute the posterior of Seta given y. And this is illustrated in these two figures here for the shape parameter, xi, and the sigma zero parameter. And you can see that effectively for psi, there is a huge uncertainty related to the observation, to the estimation in the Observation to the estimation in the observations, which is shown in green. And ψ is much more constrained in the models. Even though you have different models simulating different values for xi, the range of values simulated by models is much more constrained. And so you can, if you trust these models, of course, you can consider that C is not, for instance, higher than minus 0.1. And so in the posterior distribution shown in blue here, you Shown in blue here, you take advantage of the information provided by the models FOXI. And observation seems to be a bit more informative for the value of sigma zero, for instance. One magic with this calculation is that, of course, if you have a sample of values, values are shown here, and you try to estimate the upper bound. So typically, this is for the example. For this is for the example was for temperature, and for temperature, you typically find a negative ψ, which means there is some upper bound in the distribution, the DAV distribution. And the magic of using Bayesian statistics in this way is, of course, your estimate of the upper bound in the posterior will be consistent with any single observation you have. And so you clearly remove all values of the upper bound which are. Values of the upper bound, which are below one of the observations you have in the record. Okay, I finish here for the technical side. I have just a conclusion slide, a few points I wanted to maybe recall at this time. So there is a wide range of events. The response of some events is very well known and for others, there is a lot of research to do. There is a lot of research to do because we know very, very little things about how climate change will affect them. This is an important point, I think. The central question is still, I think, beyond all what I've shown, attribution, observation, one of the biggest question about what the society is asking to us is about evaluating and quantifying the future hazard. And there is a lot of things to do to make this as accurate as possible, I think. Causal theory is involved in relating extreme events to the human influence on climate. And I think there might be additional societal implication of that, as I suggested, based, for instance, in legal aspects of that questions in the future. And finally, I think so there is a number of And finally, I think there is a number of statistical challenges that need continued statistical research. I tried to provide some illustration of that. One of these is how to perform smart planning of models and observed data. But in fact, there are many others. And I hope the current workshop will provide an opportunity to have a further look at this. at these questions and challenges. Thank you very much and I hope there is still a bit of time for questions.
