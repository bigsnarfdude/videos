Our first speaker today is Natasha Sassam from Rutgers University, who will speak to us about ancient solutions to geometric flows. So, please, Natasha. Thank you very much for the invitation and giving me the opportunity to speak. And I'm sorry I'm not there in person, hopefully next time. So in this talk, I will tell you a little bit about ancient solutions in the sense that I'm going to wrap up, you know, whatever we heard, some results about the ancient solutions so far at the conference. So far at the conference, and also I will mention also some our results in that context, right? So, what we will discuss in this talk is the classification of ancient solutions to geometric flows, mainly it will be the mean curvature flow and the Ricci flow. So, why are these solutions important? We already heard in many talks so far that they occur as singularity models, right? When you study the flow, you take the limit around the You take the limit around the singularity, and these solutions appear as singularity models, and you would like to understand those. So, these are just the special solutions to the flow that you consider. Could be the Minkow-Witcher flow, the Ricci flow, or some other parabolic equation that exists from time negative infinity up to this time capital T. And if capital T is less than infinity, we call dimension solutions. It could be also equal to infinity, in which To infinity, in which case we call them just eternal solutions. Okay, and we would like to get some classification of those solutions, of course, but it can be sometimes very challenging, as you will see. So I will start quickly just with the simplest examples of ancient solutions. These are the solitons, and we heard like about solitons at this conference a lot in the context of both flows. So I will just quickly say that these are the examples of ancient. That these are the examples of ancient solutions, very special solutions that just move by diffomorphisms and homoties. And some very simple examples of those are the shrinking spheres, the shrinking cylinders, which are the examples of the shrinkers. And then you have also these solutions that just move by translations. And these are called the translating solitons in the Minkowitzer flow, or we have the analogous steady solitons in the Ricci flow. Ricci flow. But besides those very simple solutions, you have also other complicated ancient solutions, which makes the singularity analysis very complicated. And like in this talk, the solutions that we will see occurring are the ones that you see on this picture that can be visualized by gluing two solitons and putting a cylinder in the middle to make the picture compact. To make the picture compact. Okay, so this will be the typical behavior of those ancient solutions, which are not solitons that will occur in our talk later in the context of both flows. Okay, so I want to start with something very simple, which dates back to 90s, because this was actually our big motivation for the proof, or for our whole program about the classification. For our whole program about the classification of ancient solutions, we were really inspired by these papers of Marilyn Zach. That I just want to mention the basic idea because we used it a lot, not only us, but also other people later used it in the similar context, right? So here you just consider a very simple semi-linear heat equation. U sub t is Laplace and U plus U to the P. And that's just the equation on Rn. Okay, and I take this P to be in between 1 and N plus 2 over N minus 2. 2 over n minus 2, and I take a non-negative solution. So, as you will see, like we can view this as a prototype equation that occurs in singularity analysis also in our geometric flows, right? So, that's why it turned out to be extremely useful also in our work. So, if you perform type 1 rescaling around the singularity, let's say that the singularity is at A comma capital T, that just means that the L infinity norm of U blows up there, right? Few blows up there, right? So you perform this type 1 rescaling, like I wrote in the slide. Then Giga and Cohn in 85 actually proved that the L infinity norm of this rescaled solution is uniformly bounded all the way up to infinity, which means that the singularity is type 1 in this case. And when you compute the equation of the rescaled equation, when you compute the equation of the rescaled solution, so this is what you get, this Wt. This is what you get. This Wt is equal to this very nice operator that we see here. And so we want to analyze the blow-up behavior of U, right? So like we know that U has type 1 singularity. We rescale U in a type 1 manner. We obtain our solution W. So in order to understand the blow-up behavior of U around the singularity, you need to understand the long time behavior of W as tau approaches to plus infinity. approaches to plus infinity, right? So that corresponds to the singularity of u at capital T and basically those singularity models appear to be these eternal solutions to the equation star and you want to classify those bounded positive eternal solutions to equation star. So these are solutions that are defined for all times from negative infinity to plus infinity. And Giga and Kahn actually showed that both as the limit approach That both as the limit approaches to plus and negative infinity of this w, you just get a steady state. So, what does that mean? That means that just in this equation star, in the limit, w sub t is zero, right? And they also showed that the only steady states are the constant solutions, either zero or this very particular constant k, which is computed in terms of p. Okay, but besides from those steady states, there are also these based independent metermo solutions that I call phi of tau. Solutions that I call phi of tau, which are just the functions of time, right? So they are space-independent. And Liga, Khon and Marilyn Zag actually, they prove that if W is a bounded positive eternal solution to this equation star, then you can have only these three situations, the W is zero, kappa, just that very precise constant in terms of p, or this w is phi of tau minus tau naught, where phi is just like space independent. Where phi is just like space-independent solution, right? So, the main step here is to connect the orbit, so to connect those steady states with different orbits, right? So, the orbits are like my ancient solution, my ancient solutions, and the orbits are like connecting with steady states at time negative infinity and plus infinity. So, if you want to connect orbit at plus infinity and negative infinity to be zero, then you just get the solution which is identically. Just get a solution which is identically equal to zero, and that would correspond to this first case. And then, if you are connecting orbits which are w equal to k at both ends, you will just get exactly that solution, w equals to k everywhere. And then the trickier part is when you connect the orbit at kappa, where you connect two different or like two different steady states, zero and kappa, on both ends, in which case you want to prove that the only solution that you can get is this W that you have here. Get is this W that you have here. And the idea of the proof is like similar actually what we did in the context of the mean curvature flow and the Ricci flow. So you consider this difference V, which is W minus kappa, which is just the deviation from a steady state at time negative infinity. And then you compute the equation for V, right? So that is basically just the linearized equation of W around this steady state, kappa, right? And then you get this. Right, and then you get this very nice operator L, which you will see in the mean curvature flow, and also the Rigiflow when you linearize around the cylinder, you get exactly the same operator. Just the error term will be much more complicated than you see here. And then this operator L is a self-adjoint in this Hilbert space, in this weighted norm, e to the negative y squared over 4, and its spectrum is very well understood, right? And that's what you. Well, understood, right? And that's what we also used in our work. So, like, it has positive eigenvalues one and one-half, it has a zero eigenvalue, and then countably many negative eigenvalues. And the eigenfunction that corresponds to lambda equals to one is just the constant eigenvector phi is equal to one, right? And the eigenvectors of corresponding to other lambdas are just the Hermit polynomials. And then you can decompose this Hilbert space into Hilbert space into the positive part, negative part, and the zero part, right? Basically, these are just the projection on the positive eigenspace, negative eigenspace, and the neutral or the zero eigenspace. And they proved this very nice OD lemma, and that was the thing that allow us actually to complete our to prove our uniqueness results in the geometric flows that we considered, namely like. Considered, namely, like you denote by this gamma plus minus and gamma zero, just the projection of your solution V. V is just like your solution W minus the steady state, right? So you project this on this H plus, H0, and H minus, and you call these projections gamma plus, minus tau, and gamma naught. And then you can compute just the system of ODEs that are satisfied by this gamma plus, gamma minus, and gamma zero. And then And gamma zero. And then, by a very nice, it's not complicated at all, but very nice and elegant argument, you can prove that as tau converges to negative infinity, you always have the situation that either the projection on the positive modes dominate or the projection on the neutral modes dominates as tau approaches to negative infinity. So, there are no like jumps in the behavior, it's always one or the other one as tau approaches to negative. Or the other one as tau approaches to negative infinity. And also, these guys use this to show that once they have that either one or the other mode dominates, then they have to do some extra work, of course, to show that the mode corresponding to lambda one is equal to one dominates. And this corresponds to eigenvector, which is constant in space, being equal to one. And then again, with some extra work, you can conclude that in that case, your only solution is this phi of tau, which Is this phi of tau, which is just the space-independent steady state of the solution that we, also of the equation star that we considered at the beginning. So basically, that is their idea that we tried to implement in the mean curvature flow and also the Ricci flow. And let me just start with the mean curvature flow. We already saw this so many times in the talks at this conference. So I will just At this conference, so I will just say, like, like here is a very familiar equation that I'm not going to discuss any further. And I will just say that, as we saw before, the mean curvature ancient solutions. Some examples are the spheres and the cylinders, as I said in one of the previous slides. They are shrinking solutions. And then we have also the translating solutions that they just move by translation. And like the Bohr soliton, that I'm going to give you the That I'm gonna give you the equation on the next slide is actually the unique convex rotationally symmetric translating solution to the mean curvature flow. It opens like a paraboloid and has the maximum mean curvature at the tip, right? So it's rotationally symmetric, it's graphical, and I'm gonna on the next slide, actually, I'm gonna one of the next slides, I'm gonna even give you the equation, right? So we so what will also be very important for us. Be very important for us is this notion of non-collapsing, which was introduced for mean convex mean curvature flows. This just means that you, I mean, you say that your hypersurface is alpha non-collapsed. If at every point P, you can find this interior and exterior ball of radius at least alpha over H of P, which are tangent to each other and tangent to your hypersurface at the point P. And so I'm going to. And so, I'm going to also introduce the definition of ancient ovals. For me, this will mean any compact, alpha non-collapsed, convex ancient solution to the mean curvature flow, which is not self-similar. Because if it is self-similar and satisfies all these conditions, then it's known that it has to be the sphere, right? So, I want to explore this case because it's very well understood. So, for me, answer oval will mean anything besides the sphere, which I said. Sphere, which satisfies those conditions. And the existence of these ancient ovals, which are rotationally symmetric, was established some time ago by Brian White and then later by Hasselhofer and Hershkovich. Hasselhofer and Herskovic, they gave a more detailed argument about the existence and they also established the existence of ancient ovals with OK cross-oval symmetry. So you would like to So, you would like to say something about the uniqueness of those ancient ovals, right? So, here, like what I meant here by the first sentence, because it seems that I mixed the slides, this is the equation of the Bowl soliton, right? So, the Ball soliton is graphical, it is rotationally symmetric and satisfies this very nice simple equation, okay? And now, like, so. Like, so remember, ancient oval for me was convex, non-collapsed ancient solution, which is not soliton, and they are also compact. And if you take one of those examples, which was constructed by Robert and or or Brian White, like and then you rescale, right? If you take any sequence of points and then you rescale by the mean curvature around those points and then take the limit, you will always see either a ball-soliton or a We see either a ball soliton or a cylinder for those solutions. And that's what we actually proved to, that's what we proved to hold actually for any, for an arbitrary ancient oval, right? Because remember, we want to prove that their solutions are unique. The ones that they constructed are the only ones in the category that we are considering. So here, like, we will also consider the condition of uniform to convexity, which means Uniform two convexity, which means that if you take the two smallest eigenvalues, you require this to be greater or equal than beta h, where beta is strictly positive. And that will just ensure that like the tangent flow at negative infinity is around cylinder, right? That is actually what is important for us. So it has to be around cylinder S and minus one cross R. And so I will also mention a result of Brendle and Choice. A result of Brendle and Choi, who considered actually non-compact, strictly convex, uniformly two-convex, and non-collapsed engine solutions to the miner which are flowing Rn plus one. And they proved that it has to be only the ball solid one. And as a corollary of that, they showed that any blow-up limit. So actually, there is a result of Robert and Bruce Kleiner and Brian White, which first says that if you consider If you consider a closed embedded two-convex mean curvature flow, right, and you want to study the singularity of those, they prove that any blow-up limit has to be weakly convex, uniformly two-convex, and non-collapsed ancient solution. And then, as a corollary of Brandler-Choi's result, we have that if you start the mean curvature flow at any close to convex hypersurface, then the only blow-up limits are the spheres, the cylinders, and the ball solitons. Cylinders and the ball solitons. So, Brendel and Choi they considered the complete non-compact ancient solutions to the mean curvature flow. And what we did with Toti and Sigurd, we considered actually compact ancient solutions to the mean curvature flow. And some time ago, the first result that we proved is like for rotationally symmetric ancient ovals. We proved that our first theorem was. That our first theorem was not saying that they have to be unique, but that they have to have unique asymptotics, right? And we precisely describe the asymptotics of any ancient oval. And then later we will use this result to prove the uniqueness of ancient ovals. So we will then know that the only ancient ovals that exist are the ones that are constructed by Robert and Orr or Brian White independently. And so here I will just mention that the proof of this theorem, That the proof of this theorem involves the analysis of the linearized operator around the cylinder, which appears to be the same operator as Merle and Sag had. And we use also Huskins' monotonicity formula and very sophisticated barrier arguments that turned out to be useful later, not only like in the mean curvature flow, but also the Ricci flow. So Brendley also used the same barrier. Brandle and Choi used the same barrier arguments. Use the same barrier arguments that we discovered also in their work on the complete non-compact ancient solutions to the mean curvature flow. And here, like, so since in this first work, we just consider rotationally symmetric ancient tobacco, they satisfy a very nice equation, which is written here for a profile function u. And so I said, like, once we established the very precise asymptotics of our solutions, now we're thinking we. We managed to prove the uniqueness. So, the first theorem of Sigurd, Toti, and myself is that if MT is an ancient oval which is uniformly two convex, then it has to be rotationally symmetric. So the first thing that we prove here is that if I take any sequence of points in space and time and I rescale by the mean curvature, take the limit, then the limit has to be always either the cylinder. To be always either the cylinder or the ball soliton, and both of them are rotationally symmetric. So, that's very good indication that my solution itself has to be rotationally symmetric. And then we used like the neck improvement arguments and the cap improvement arguments that we also partly heard in Kitten's talk to establish the rotational symmetry. These were the arguments actually that first were established by Brendle in his work on complete solutions to Complete solutions to complete engine solutions to the mean curvature flow. And then, once we know that our solution is rotationally symmetric, any engine toggle is rotationally symmetric, by our previous result, we know that it has to have unique asymptotics. Now, we use that to prove the uniqueness, right? So we prove that if M T is a rotationally symmetric ancient oval, it has to be unique up to scaling and translations in time. So, which means that our ancient oval is exactly. Means that our ancient oval is exactly has to be the one which was constructed by Robert and Orr or Brian White independently. So, what we use here in the proof, as I said, is the asymptotics result. And also, we prove some cursive type of estimates which need to be shown in different regions, the cylindrical and the tip region, because like you remember from the first slide how my solution looks like, like this oval. That's why we call them ancient ovals. Why we call them ancient ovals. And then in the middle, your solution behaves like a cylinder, and then at the tips, it behaves like the ball soliton. So it has different behaviors. So that's why we consider two different regions, the cylindrical and the tip region. We prove some corrosive type of estimates with different weights in both regions. We put them together and hence we prove the uniqueness. And I will just say, like, I also haven't mentioned that Merles AG type. That Merle-Sag type of arguments, we actually used in our first theorem, which was the theorem about the unique asymptotics. So, that OD lemma that I mentioned at the beginning played a very important role in the proof of this first theorem about unique precise asymptotics. And so now I will just put together Grand Lachoi results and our results with Anken and Toscalopoulos that the only non-collapsed unit. That the only non-collapsed, uniformly two-convex ancient solutions to the mean curvature flow are the spheres, the rotationally symmetric ancient oval, round cylinders, and the bulb soliton. And you don't have anything else. And remember, this uniform two convexity ensured that the tangent flow at negative infinity was a round cylinder. So asymptotic behavior of our solutions forms like a round cylinder Sn minus one cross R. So now I want to also like mention some other results like Some other results like which are related to our results. So, the first result that I want to mention is a result by Choi, Hasselpover, Hershkovich, and Brian White, who actually proved our classification theorem. Okay, let me put it here from the previous slide. You see this theorem star. So, they proved this theorem in any dimension, but only assuming that the parabolic blowdown is around cylinder, right? So, this means that if you take this parabolic rescaling, d lambda of Rescaling d lambda of x t is lambda x lambda square t. Then the parabolic down which you obtain when you take the limit of this d lambda j sub m and j goes to infinity and lambda j is a sequence converging to zero, right? So that is a round cylinder. So that was their only assumption, right? So the most important actually like feature of their theorem is that all these conditions Is that all these conditions that we were assuming, which were the convexity, uniform to convexity, non-collapsing, even smoothness, connectedness, right? They were all implied by the theorem and they were not the assumptions of the theorem. Okay, so like it's a really nice, really nice work where they use a variant of a moving plane method to establish both the smoothness and the symmetry of their solution, right? Because before the like the moving plane Before the moving plane method was known how to be used for smooth solutions, right? But here they didn't have the smoothness, so they had to use some variant of this moving plane method, and then they established smoothness and symmetry simultaneously. Okay. And they also obtain different, like, I mean, they also managed to reprove Brandler-Choice theorem in a different way. So, in the complete case, they obtain complete case they obtain classification a little bit differently than brand line choice and for the in the case of compact in the compact case once they established the convexity and the smoothness right and rotational symmetry then they could actually use our result they could rely on our result of classification of ancient solutions in the compact case right so they could say that these have to be either the spheres or the ancient ovals Or the ancient ovals. And so, this like their work has very nice applications. For example, one of them is related to flow through general singularities, which is known that has a highly non-uniqueness phenomenon. But by as an application of their classification result of ancient solutions in a much weaker setting than what we were considering, they obtained that. They obtained that, they actually managed to show that this flow through cylindrical and spherical singularities has to be unique. That's one very beautiful consequence of their work. And then the other one is the so-called mean convex neighborhood conjecture for next singularities, which says that like if a mean curvature develops a next singularity at x naught t naught, then there is a neighborhood of macroscopic scale around that point in which the Around that point in which the mean curvature is non-negative, right? So, if the singularity model is a cylinder, that not only in the microscopic scale you have no negative mean curvature, but on a microscopic scale. And in another work that was described by Otis, in like, I don't remember on which day, like that was a work done by Otis, Joe, Mantulidis, and Schulze, where they considered low entropy hypersurfaces in dimensions two and three, also sometimes. In dimensions two and three, also some classification of ancient solutions played an important role. In this paper, they managed to show that in the case of low entropy hypersurfaces, they can be perturbed so that their mean curvature flow has only spherical and cylindrical singularities, right? And as we saw from Auti's talk, one important step was to establish the uniqueness of ancient mean curvature flows that lie on one side of the That lies on one side of asymptotically conical or compact shrinkers. So, this was another, okay. And then I also want to mention the result of Robert and his student who generalized our theorem. So, they consider any non-trivial SOK cross SON plus 1 minus K symmetric ancient compact non-collapsed ancient solution of the mean curvature flow, and they managed to show that up to scaling and the type. To show that up to scaling and the type shift and the time shift, it is actually exactly the OK cross O n plus 1 minus k symmetric ancient toggle that was constructed previously by Robert and Orr. So what we did, we did the case k is equal to one and then just generalized it for an arbitrary k. So what is special for those solutions is that their tangent flow at time negative infinity is this generalized cylinder, Rk cross. Generalized cylinder, Rk cross Sn minus K. Sorry, we did it for the case K is equal to N, and then they did it for all other cases. Okay, so now like you can ask a similar question, right? Like what we asked also in our case, maybe whether these solutions are also unique, right? Not only in this class of SOK cross SON plus 1 minus K symmetric category. K symmetric category, but unique overall in the class of convex non-collapse tension solutions, right? But actually, in the same paper, they showed that for any k greater or equal than 2, there exists a k minus 1 parameter family of geometrically distinct, and these are uniformly k plus 1 convex ancient ovals that have only this z2k cross o n plus 1 minus k symmetry, right? So, which means that in this So, which means that in this case, the classification is a little bit trickier. So, this means that if you don't see a tangent flow to be just around cylinder, but one of these generalized cylinders, their work shows that the classification, you should expect that classification, if at all possible, should be much more complicated. And also, Borne, Langford, and Tingalia, they construct many examples of ancient convex solutions to the mean curvature flow, so which means that. The mean curvature flow, so which means that if you drop some of the conditions, then like they are not so rigid anymore. You can construct many examples. Okay, so this was all what I wanted to tell you about like our work on mean curvature flow and how it relates to the work of other people that came afterwards. And then for us, like when we did the mean curvature flow, classification of solutions in the Justification of solutions in the mean curvature flow, then we wanted also to focus on the Ricci flow, right? So here is the Ricci flow equation that we also heard many times in the talks at this conference. So I will just also say that in the Ricci flow, also ancient and eternal solutions are the singularity models, and that's why you want to understand them in order to understand your singularities better. And in his In one of his papers, Perelman constructed this non-collapsing rotationally symmetric tension solution on S3. And his construction can be easily adapted actually to any dimension. And then the question that he asked in the paper is whether there exists some other ancient compact solution which are different than Einstein, which means that it's a sphere, or these solutions constructed by Perelman. I will just say. Perelman. I will just say that these solutions constructed by Perelman are not solitons, they are not given in a precise closed form, right? Okay, and only like we know of their existence by constructive means. So they are just constructed, but we don't know, we know how they look like, but we don't know exactly the formula for those. And they are not solitons. So they don't satisfy any other equation besides the Ricci-Flow equation. Ricci flow equation. Right, so what was conjectured in the paper is that if you take S3 G of t to be any compact ancient kappa non-collapse solution to the Ricci flow in S3, then G of T has to be a family of contracting spheres or the Perelman solution. So like that was like the thing that we wanted to prove. And before I just say a little bit words about it, let me tell you first what the Let me tell you first what the paramount solution is, right? So I take any L from 1 to plus infinity, and then I consider this G L at time 0 to be a rotationally symmetric metric on S3, which has weakly positive curvature, right? It's rotationally symmetric, so I can write it in this nice way, like ds squared plus psi of s squared gs2. S2s are just the cross-sections, and psi you can regard as the radius. Can regard as a radius. And so this metrically looks like a long cylinder, right? Whose cross-section is this sphere of radius root 2. And then you just truncate cylinder so that it is like of length 2L. And then you just cap it with smooth caps on both ends, right? Because you want to make a compact solution. And then you use that as your initial data for the Ricci flow, right? So that's your initial. The Ricci flow, right? So that's your initial data. You apply the Ricci flow to it, and then you produce your solution, which depends on L. So I call it GL of T, right? Okay, so now this solution we know develops a singularity at time T sub L. And what was needed to be proved is that this T sub L is uniformly bounded from below and above, right? Independently on L. And now you would like somehow to rescale these solutions and take Rescale these solutions and take the limit as L approaches to infinity, and to claim that you produce an ancient solution which is not a sphere, right? So you have to make sure not that you just produce an ancient solution, but that you also produce a solution which is not a sphere. So that's why you have to be a little bit careful how you do your rescaling. So I call this little T sub L to be the time where the oscillation of sectional curvatures of my solution G sub L at solution g sub l at time t sub l is one plus delta where delta will be some fixed number greater than zero independent of l and then here is how i perform my rescaling so i rescale by capital t sub l minus little t sub l right and now of course you have to put work on it i mean it i mean perelmann just claimed that you can take the limit and produce an ancient solutions but other people actually like wrote up the deal People actually wrote up the details. So now, you have to prove all these curvature estimates and make sure that you can take the limit. But once you do that, you will produce an ancient solution, first of all, which is rotationally symmetric, which is also invariant under reflections. And how will you make sure that it's different from a sphere? So you see, like from our rescaling, that time. That time T L, T sub L for the original flow, which is my G sub L, that corresponds to time t equals to negative one for my rescaled flow. Okay, so this means that at time t is equal to negative one, because I'm taking the limit of the rescaled flow, the oscillation of this sectional curvatures will be exactly one plus delta. And that will imply that my limit is not around sphere. Okay, and this is also a positively curved solution. Is also a positively curved solution, and it was also understood that if I take any sequence of points and I rescale by the scalar curvature, right, and take the limit around those points, the limits are either the round cylinder S2 cross R or the brown soliton. Okay, and that's what will also be important in our work later. And now let me just tell you some examples of three-dimensional non-collapsed ancient reach. Dimensional non-collapsed ancient Ricci flow solutions. So these are like the round cylinders, and we know they are shrinking Ricci solitons, actually gradient shrinking Ricci solitons, which in addition to the Ricci flow equation satisfy also this nice elliptic equation. The same for round spheres. And then Perelman solution that I described earlier, right, that's not given in a closed form and it's not a soliton, so it doesn't satisfy any additional equation, and that is an additional difficulty. That is an additional difficulty, like when you try to classify those solutions. And then we have also the Brand soliton, which is an example of non-compact, non-collapsed ancient Ricci flow. It is steady Ricci soliton, which means that again, in addition, which means that it just moves by diffeomorphisms. And in addition to the Ricci flow equation, it satisfies also this nice elliptic equation, perf is just a potential function. Just the potential function. Okay, so you have here four possibilities: two for complete non-collapse solutions and two for compact, right? Okay, so here is like I just want to tell you the brand soliton. That's a unique, complete, non-flat, steady, and rotationally symmetric Richie soliton in dimension three. Of course, there is like a generalization in higher dimensions, but I'm focusing here only in dimension three, has positive sectional curvature and. Positive sectional curvature and the maximum of the scalar curvature is at the tip, which is the center of rotation. And now, like this solution is rotationally symmetric, and I'm just going to write it in this parametrization, right? Where I want now to consider this z, which is psi squared as a function of psi, right? In this parametrization, then, like, z has this nice evolution equation, and that's what describes the Brand soliton. That's what describes the Brand soliton. So, Brandle proved that it's actually the only non-collapsed steady-rich solitone in dimension three, right? So, the way how he proved it, he considered any non-collapsed steady-rich solitone and proved that it has to be rotationally symmetric. And then we know once it's rotationally symmetric, it has to be unique, right? So, the goal, what is our goal for the Ricci flow is like if you look at the previous slide, you want to say that these are the only possibilities for Possibilities for non-collapsed ancient solutions in dimension three. And right, so like from our one of the earlier works that is actually related to this question was a work with Toti and Richard Hamilton, where we considered ancient solutions in dimension two. And then we proved that they have to be only the contracting spheres and the King-Rosenau solutions. And this King-Rosenau solution. Solutions and these King-Rosenov solutions are the analogs of Perelman's solutions, but the difference is that they are collapsed and they are given in a closed form. So there is a formula for that. Okay, so which made the classification in this case a little bit easier. And from now on, for me, ancient Kappa solution will mean any complete Kappa non-collapsed ancient solution with bounded and non-negative curvature. Okay, so in Okay. So, in dimension three, you can just say like complete Kappa non-collapsed ancient solutions because then because you have like some curvature pinching estimate then and Harnack, so then bounded and non-negative curvature condition will be automatically satisfied in dimension three, right? So, but if you work in any dimension, then this is the definition of ancient Kappa solution. Of ancient Kappa solution. So, Pereman showed that if you have like a finite time singularity of the Ricci flow in dimension three, it has to be modeled on this ancient kappa solution. So now Brandle proved that Brandle classified non-compact three-dimensional ancient kappa solutions. So remember, there are four possibilities, two for complete and two for compact. So Brandle classified a non-compact. Classified non-compact ones, and he showed that they have to be either the shrinking cylinders of their quotients or the brown soliton. Okay, and as a corollary, he obtained like similarly to the theorem that he had in the mean curvature flow that the only possible blow-up limits in dimension 3, right, around the singularity are the like S3 or the quotients of S3, round cylinder, or the quotients of the round cylinder. Round cylinder or the portions of the round cylinder and the brown soliton. Okay, so let me just tell you how, let me just tell you how Brendle obtained his result, and then I will tell you like what we did in the compact case. So Brendle first shows that every non-compact, this three-dimensional engine kappa solution has to be rotationally symmetric. Okay. And once you And once he knows it's rotationally symmetric, he proves it has to be a steady soliton, right? So, what does that mean? That means that it has to satisfy that additional elliptic equation, right? So, once he knows it has to be a steady soliton by his older result, or actually, since he already has rotational symmetry, we know that it has to be the brand soliton, right? There's nothing else. Okay, so why does he need to establish the rotational symmetry? To establish the rotational symmetry first because he wants to use similar barrier arguments to what we used in the mean-Kirvicher flow. But of course, barriers do not make sense in the Ricci flow because it's an intrinsic flow, right? But they make sense if you work with the rotationally symmetric solutions. So in these barrier constructions, he uses some static gradient-rich solitons, which are singular at the tip. They are also found by They are also found by Robert Bryant, and because actually they blow up close to the tip, he Brantler manages to use them as upper barriers, so barriers from above. And he needs to use those barriers like in a similar manner that we used our barriers also to establish precise asymptotics for the mean curvature flow. Because in order to apply this Mer-Lezag OD lemma, you need to use, you need to You need to first work out this localization argument, right? Because you will work with Kata functions, you will have errors coming from the Kato functions, and you want to estimate this. You cannot allow those type of errors if you want to apply the ODE lemma of Merle and ZAG. So that's why he needed barriers to be able to apply Merle-ZAG, ODE lemma. And this like ODE lemma. And these like localization arguments in his case, like he needs actually to estimate the deviation of his solution from a cylinder in a large region by a deviation from a cylinder from by a deviation of his solution from a cylinder at the fixed point, right? Or at a smaller region, so that he can control the errors coming from the cutter functions. And so now let me go to the compact case, right? Compact case, right? So, the first result that we established with Brandle, and that was also established independently by Bruce Kleiner and Richard Bamler by using completely different methods, is that if you consider a 3D closed kappa solution, it needs to be rotationally symmetric. So, the way how we did it, we actually just try to adapt Brandless arguments that he developed in the complete setting, which again are some. Which again are some kind of neck improvement and cap improvement arguments that we heard in Keaton's talk. And Bruce Kleiner and Richard, they use completely different arguments. They use these singular Richie flows to establish that. Okay, so the way how we like, so I will just say the way how we prove this theorem, we first show that there is so-called asymptotic shrinking. So-called asymptotic shrinking soliton, which is associated to our ancient solution. And if our solution is not a round cylinder everywhere, sorry, not a round sphere everywhere, then this asymptotic shrinking soliton has to be a round cylinder. This just means that you can find a sequence of points in time and space around which you rescale and you see a round cylinder, right? So this just means that. Okay, so that is the first step. But then the next step is that you need to prove that if you have this 3D close, You have this 3D closed gapper solution, and if you pick now any sequence of points xk tk, wherever tk goes to negative infinity, and you rescale by the scalar curvature and take the limit, you have to argue that you see either the shrinking cylinder or the branch soliton. And again, like we saw something similar in the mean curvature flow, these two are both rotationally symmetric, right? So, and that is a good indication that your solution itself has to be rotationally symmetric, okay. Rotationally symmetric. Okay, and then, as I said, we adapt these neck improvement theorems from Brandle that he developed in the complete case to finish the argument. And now, once we know that our solution is rotationally symmetric, we can write it like in this form, right? Where s, you see, if I regard s as a distance function to the equator, then my metric g, I can just write as ds squared plus psi squared ds2. S2 is just the cross-section and S2 is just the cross-section and ψ is just the radius of a cross-section. And then you just get a very nice PDE, where, of course, DDS and DDT do not commute. And so I just want to show you a type of equations that we worked with. Since in the middle, right, you see a cylinder, it's natural to perform parabolic rescaling in the middle, right? But at the same time, you also want to do it so that DD. want to do it so that d d tau and d d sigma commute and as a result you introduce this non-local term in your equation that i call j right so you see this non-local term depends on the second derivatives of u so the equation looks a little bit ugly and complicated because of this non-local term that we didn't have in the mean curvature flow so you have just to pay extra attention to it and okay you can you have to do a little bit harder estimates Little bit harder estimates in this case than in the mean curvature flow, but it's still doable. Okay, but this right, so okay, so let me write here. So like you see, this parametrization of the metric is not good at the tip, where psi is equal to zero. This parametrization is the generate there. So therefore, you have to like change your parametrization, right? And then at the tips, you consider this other parametrization where y, which is u sigma squared. Where y, which is u sigma squared, you consider as a function of u. And there you have this like nice PDE that you consider, right? So, okay, so that is again another extra difficulty that, like in the parabolic region, you consider one equation, and then in the deep regions, you have to consider completely different equation, but then in the end, you have to match them, right? You will prove estimates in one region, and then the estimates in the other region, but then you have to make sure that they match at the overlap. Sure, that they match at the overlap region. Okay. Okay, so like in order to establish the uniqueness, we follow similar steps, like in the mean curvature flow. First, we will establish the unique precise asymptotics. And this was the theorem that we worked out with Sigurd and Brendle and Toti. So we considered, so now we know that our solution is rotation asymmetric. So we assume that we have rotational symmetry and we prove that these solutions have to be symmetrical. That these solutions have to have the same matched asymptotics. And I will just comment about the asymptotics in the cylindrical region. So you see, u is equal to root 2, exactly corresponds to round cylinder, right? That's the first order asymptotics. So what we do here is actually we prove the second order asymptotics. And that's again where we use Mer-Les-AG or the Elema, right? To see which mode here dominates, right? So this sigma squared minus 2 is a Fermi polynomial that actually corresponds to the 0. That actually corresponds to the zero eigenvalue of my linearized operator, Ricci-flow operator, around the cylinder. So here is again where we use a Merle-Sag lemma. And then we have some intermediate region which connects the tip and the cylindrical region. I will not pay too much attention to it at the moment. And I will just say that in the tip region, after you rescale the right way, so I will just say that, and take the limit. Just say that and take the limit, you will see the branch soliton, you will get the brand soliton as the limit as t approaches to negative infinity. Okay, so these are your precise asymptotics that have to hold for every closed 3D kappa solution. And okay, so maybe I will skip the comments like so. Here, like I will just say like I will skip this proof, like of the precise asymptotics. So I will just say like that here we've seen the last sentence. Here we see in the last sentence, uh, we used Merlesag, Merle Sag or dilemma, right? So, so because right to establish that the projection on the zero eigenvalue on the zero eigenspace dominates, okay. Right, and then here you see the Fermi polynomial sigma squared minus two, but okay, I'm gonna skip the details, I will just say that now once we know that all our solutions have All our solutions have unique asymptotics, then we are able to show the uniqueness. Namely, if we take a compact kappa solution to the Ricci flow, we show it has to be either the round shrinking sphere or the Perelman's solution, right? And again, we have that our solution is rotationally symmetric and we have to write different parameters, we have to use different parametrization in the cylindrical region and the tip region, and we want Region and the tip region, and we want to prove some estimates in both regions with respect to different weights, right? So I will just say, I will not give details at all, but I will just say that here is our cylindrical region where this u is greater than theta over 2. U is just this radius of a cross-section. And here we just use the okay, so we use just this norm, which is the usual norm, like which comes from this self-adjoint operator that you get when you linearize. Operator that you get when you linearize the Ricci-flow equation around the cylinder. And then we have the tip region where u is less or equal than 2θ. And now, how do we argue? We assume that you have two solutions. We call them U1 and U2 in one parametrization. And in the different parametrization around the tips, this corresponds to Y1 and Y2. And we consider the difference of those. We need to use the cutoff functions. And then in this cylindrical region, we use this weight here that I wrote. Here, that I wrote, and in the deep region, we use some much more complicated weights, but nevertheless, we managed to find the weight and prove the right estimates. And then you just need to match those estimates to show that this U1 has to be equal to U2 and Y1 is equal to Y2. Like, okay, there are some parameters floating around that you need to fix that correspond to the scaling, parametrization, choice of your parametrization, and translations in time. And translations in time, but I will not talk about that. I will just say, like the following. So, the question now is: what about higher dimensions? Can you expect a similar classification of ancient solutions in higher dimensions? And the situation here is also a little bit tricky, as we also discussed in the mean curvature flow, because Bacchus, Kong, and me construct many positively curved, higher-dimensional, so any strict. High-dimensional, so n is strictly bigger than three examples of kappa non-collapsed ancient solutions and also collapsed ancient solutions. And so maybe before there was a belief that Kappa solution on a sphere must be rotationally symmetric, which is the case in dimension three, but that speculation was also shown not to be true because Walkers, Kong, and me construct examples. Construct examples that show actually that this is not true. So, what would be then the right assumption under which you can expect to have any classification? So, maybe, like in the case of the mean curvature flow, maybe you can say maybe we can try to classify kappa solutions in higher dimensions whose asymptotic solutions is a cylinder, is a round cylinder. Maybe in that case, you can expect that the analog of this. That the analog of this conjecture that we proved, let's say, in the COMPA case, holds here as well, right? But we haven't managed to do that quite in higher dimensions. We focused on a curvature condition, which is the so-called positive isotropic curvature condition in higher dimensions that is known to be preserved along the flow. And here, I just quickly say that here is the definition of weakly positive isotropic. So, you will say it. Positive isotropic, so you will say it right that the manifold is positive, will positive isotopically curved if this condition is satisfied by the Riemannian curvature. This condition is known to be preserved along the mean curvature flow, and we will say that our curvature is weakly peak 2 if m cross R2 has no negative isotropic curvature. And now, in this context of higher dimensions, I will just say that ancient kappa solution when n is greater or equal than 4 is non-negative. Greater or equal than four is non-compact, non-flat, complete ancient solution to Terici flow, which is uniformly peak and weakly peak too, and has bounded curvature and is kappa non-collapsed. So this condition is also good, not only because it's preserved along the flow, but because also there is a Hamilton's Harnack inequality for peak two solutions, for example. And so I will just finish by saying that Brendle and Saying that Brandle and Nath they consider n-dimensional ancient kappa solutions in higher dimensions, right? Kappa solutions in the sense of this definition that we have on this slide in dimensions n greater or equal than four. And they proved that these solutions, which are non-compact and strictly peaked two, are rotationally symmetric. And Li and Zhang classified rotationally symmetric solutions with those properties and they so And they show that you can have either the round cylinder or the Bryant soliton. So, this means that under this condition, under these conditions that we have here, you see ancient Kappa solutions, if we define this way in higher dimensions, then in the complete case, you can have only the shrinking cylinders and the brand soliton. And I will say that recently with Brendle. That recently with Brendle and Keaton and Toti, we considered the Kampa case, right? Where again, ancient Kappa solution is in the sense of that definition which I gave like two minutes ago. And we showed that if you consider any such ancient solution on Sn, it has to be rotationally symmetric. And once we know it's rotationally symmetric, then we can prove also the uniqueness, right? So you can show the analog of. So, you can show the analog of our theorem that you can have only the round spheres and the Perelman solutions as those Kappa solutions on Sn. And we just adapt basically the ideas of our proof in the three-dimensional case. I mean, you have to pay more attention because there are more terms, there are like a little bit more complicated estimates to take care of, but I mean, the ideas are already in the 3D paper. Paper. Okay, so thank you very much. Thanks, Natasha. Are there questions, Natasha? Actually, I was curious about this, just this minor point, this global term that shows up in that one equation. This is just because you're using the time-dependent arc length parameter or something? An arc length parameter or something? Is that why? Right, we want to introduce this sigma so that dd sigma and dd tau commute, right? Yeah, okay. Exactly. So it's like here, right. So now in this, like dd sigma and dd tau commute. So also, I think I missed it. You said there was this sort of counterexample to the idea that ancient solutions should be rotationally symmetric. That ancient solutions should be rotationally symmetric, but then you guys prove that they are. So I think that's a problem. But you guys do prove. I think I missed. No, okay. Right. So this is like what we did was in 3D, right? Okay. So then I said, like, what about higher dimensions, right? So what about this? Yes, okay. I didn't say here, but this is referred to n bigger than three. It's a speculation that any cup. Speculation that any kappa solution on spheroid must be rotationally symmetric is refuted by one of their examples in n greater than three. But isn't that what? So, isn't that what you guys proved, though, just now? Or I no, I think I'm confused. Ah, okay, now, no, in higher dimensions, right? No, in higher dimensions, I said that if you just assume tapp and on collapsedness, and even if you assume just positive curvature, for example, that's not enough because That's not enough because of those examples by Bacchus, Kong, and me. Okay, this means you have to assume more. Maybe the natural assumption would be that the asymptotic solid, asymptotic soliton is around cylinder. Maybe. Yeah, I don't know that, because that would be very hard to prove. Because that would be analogous to what Robert and Choi and these guys have for the mean curvature flow, but there they worked with the weak solutions. And right, so now, okay, we have some notion of weak solutions here for the rich. Notion of weak solutions here for the Ricci flow. So, I don't know, we would have to look at that, but that will be much more complicated. So, here we just focused on another set of conditions. We assumed this peak condition, positive isotropic curvature. Oh, okay. So this result on the final slide is for peak? Yes. Oh, okay. Okay. That's right. Here. Right. Because I said, like, when I say kappa, non-collapsed in higher dimensions, so this is what I mean. Oh, you're including that in kappa. Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay. In capital, okay, yeah, yeah, okay. Yes, right. Sorry, I just rushed to it. So, no, no, it's okay, yeah. And those examples by Bacchus Cogni are they actually Kappa solutions? Do they have positive curvature or political? Yeah, some of them they do. Yeah, yeah, they're right. That's kind of surprising. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, we thought first, like maybe if it's, you know, if you assume positively correct or so, but then no, they're so they construct in high. I don't know in which dimension. It's like very funny. I think they construct in something like n is 15 or something, but I don't see why they couldn't exist. I don't know. I mean, they look at those connecting orbits between non-standard Einstein metrics. Yeah, but that's surprising. Yes, I think that maybe the right condition would be what you, Robert, you know, with your collaborators considered. That's what somehow we believed, but like would be much higher. Believed, but like would be much harder to prove strict flow, I think. So if it's correct, yeah. Are there any others? Well, okay, if not, let's thank Natasha again for the very nice talk. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Okay, so I'll stop sharing, right? Sure, yeah. I'll stop the recording.
