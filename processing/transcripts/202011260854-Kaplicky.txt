Introduction. So I want to speak about uniqueness of non-Newtonian fluids with critical power law. So I will consider the following model. This model of generalized Newtonian flow. We have U for velocity, P for pressure, F as external forces and the extra stress tensor is St. And here Ladya. Ladyzenskaya in the 70s suggested that T1 could be of the form of a P growth where P is some number larger than one and the typical examples would be like T1 or T2 of course if we set P equal to two we obtain a Wierstog system and And as I mentioned, if P is different from 2, it is modeled by Ladijenskaya, and it was stated, say, in her book from 69. So we have the equation, and then we can think about solution and its regularity. So if we test the equation and integrate And integrate by parts, we obtain some kind of energy inequality if we assume that everything goes well, because the convective term which is here disappears due to its structure and also pressure disappears. So we can assume that it's reasonable to assume that the solution would satisfy this kind of energy inequality, and in particular, it should have. It should have a natural regularity of solution. So we will assume that the solution is L infinity L2 and Lp W1P. Yes, and in this setting, this such a solution that satisfies these two things we will call Leray Hop solution of our problem. Okay, so now I would like to do some show you some brief summary of existing. Some brief summary of the existence of solutions since there was extensive work on the problem since the 70s. So, I will forget someone, so I apologize in advance for this. So, the studies started with Ladyjenska in the 70s, and she proved that if P is larger or equal to 11 over 5, then we have the existence of the solutions, and the proof was based on monotonous operator theory. On monotone operator theory and compactness. So, in order to deal with an elliptic term, we use monotone operator theory. In order to deal with a convective term, one needs to get some compactness of some embedding. And everything is allowed due to the fact that for p larger or equal to 11 over 5, convective term is sufficiently good so that it's allowed to test it with a weak solution. Then, Then I will just take some of the list, some results of the list. Then Nechas and his collaborators around 1993 studied if it's possible to obtain some information by formally testing the system with Laplace of solution. And it appeared that it's indeed so. Therefore, they showed that for P larger, That for p larger than in case of periodic boundary condition, one gets some information, some higher fractional differentiability that, however, is say below regularity scale of the natural solution, but which allows to pass to the limit to identify the limit in the construction in the elliptic term. In the elliptic term, and they proved the existence of a solution for p larger than 9 over 5. And I will like to say that this method gives also some regularity, but for larger, larger p. So, this was for periodic boundary conditions. And then the similar method was applied also to homogenous 35 boundary conditions. And it was shown that the solution exists for p larger than 2, and that it's possible. 2 and that it's possible to show higher regularity in space if p is larger or equal to 9 over 4. Then there appeared two other methods. One was based on L infinity test function and the other on Lipschitz test functions, where the problems with passage to the limit in approximations of elliptic term was overcome. Was overcome by modifying suitably the weak solution in such a way that it is also for such a small p a suitable test function. So I just want to say that in a sense this result for p larger than 6 over 5 is in a sense terminal result because this bound corresponds to the fact that v1p is To the fact that W1P is compactly embedded into L2, and this is a border for compactness, which allows to deal with a convective term. So, this is say optimal result about existence of Larae Hoff solution. Then, we have some other results on existence of some other types of solutions. So, I should mention that there were studies of measure-valued solutions. Studies of measure-valued solutions by Nechas and his group, and it was proved that the measure-valued solution exists for P larger than 6 over 5. And recently, there appeared a new notion of dissipative solution, which now goes below the bound 6 over 5. It allows that P is only larger than one. And these are dissipative solutions by Anna Abatiello and Eduard Firezo. And Edward Feyerazo, where these solutions somehow somehow, in the definition of these solutions, there appears some one more additional term, which in the weak formulation of the equation that somehow captures the possible troubles with a passage in a convective term. And I would like to say that these solutions also satisfy some kind of energy inequality, but again. Energy inequality, but again, in the energy inequality, there appears one additional term due to convective term. Very recently, there appeared an article by Burjak, Modena, and Sekulahidi. And they show that there exists energy solution. And for them, an energy solution is a solution that satisfies the equation. The equation in distributional sense and has a correct regularity, so the regularity that was mentioned before, but they don't need to satisfy energy inequalities. So they showed that such energy solutions exist for p larger than one by method of convex integration. So say this is somehow this goes. Somehow, this goes okay. So, this goes deeply below the six over five. So, now I would like to speak about uniqueness. So, now basic approach to the uniqueness of weak solutions is following. So, we have two weak solutions corresponding, say, to two different right-hand sides. We will assume that we can test this problem with a sort of. With the solution itself, so p is larger or equal to 11 over 5, and we define p unique as this number. Then, if we subtract the two equations and test them with the reference of the solutions, we obtain such an inequality where on the right-hand side we have all nice nice terms and on the right we have difference of right-hand side, which is okay. Difference of right-hand side, which is okay. And then there is a reminder of the convective term, which is basically the difference in L2 squared times, and now there is U2 in W1P to some power p. And we see that it's prepared for the application of Grandva's inequality if this function, which appears here, belongs to L1. So if u2. If U2, big solution U2 belongs to the space LP unique, W1P, then we obtain uniqueness. So we see that regularity of solutions immediately implies uniqueness in this sense. So let us discuss uniqueness in case of periodic boundary conditions. So already Larizenskaya noticed that if p is larger than 5 over 2, then actually p is larger than p meet and p of larger than p unique and t obtain uniqueness. If p is larger than 12 over 5 we can test equation as ut obtains but ut belongs to L2 and some other regularity properties and again for this range we can easily relatively easily obtain ignitance. If we want to go below then we need to improve regularity somehow and that's why I mentioned this this result by Nishas and his colleagues This result by Nicholas and his collaborators from 93 because if I already mentioned that they test the equation with Laplace U and try to get some regularity out of this, and it appears that in case of periodic boundary conditions, if P is equal than 11 over 5, that they obtain such a regularity that uniqueness is implied. And we see that this result is actually, in a sense, This result is actually, in a sense, optimal because in the recent article by Burƒçak, Modena, and Shepela Hedi, they construct these already mentioned energy solutions that do not need to satisfy energy inequality, but they are non-unique. So, actually, they show that for a given initial value and right-hand side, if they are suitable, then there are many energy solutions. Energy solutions if P is less than 11 over 5. And in this article, there is one more interesting result, namely about Larry-Hoff solutions, which are solutions that lie in a correct regularity class and also satisfy energy inequality. And namely, it's shown that if P is less than 6 over 5, then in some cases of pseudo. Some cases of suitably chosen initial value and right-hand side, Levob solution is not unique. For six over five, then in case of homogeneous derified boundary conditions, then the regularity is much more technical, so the results are slightly different. So, again, Larigian square result holds for. So, again, Larisian square result holds for 12 over 5. This is, say, relatively easy. But then, the method of testing with Laplacian was applied by Malik Michazovichka in 2001, and they obtained that if p is larger than 9 over 4, then in case of homogeneous verified boundary conditions, one obtains sufficient regularity in space in order to get uniqueness. Concerning the non-uniqueness of energy solution for p less than 11 over 5, I don't know. This result is not yet available. It depends if the group dealing with convex integration will write down or not. So, I don't know if it holds, but I would think that it's probably also true. So, here we see that in case of homogeneous differ boundary conditions, there is. Homogeneous Definite boundary conditions, there is some gap because 9 over 4 is larger than 11 over 5. So there is some gap about uniqueness. So we can ask if the weak solution is unique for b larger than 11 over 5 or equal to 11 over 5. And this I want to address now. So we have already seen that if we want to test with a time If we are allowed to test this time derivative, so here appears u, so we did an experience, and for p larger than 12 over 5, we obtain sufficient regularity to get uniqueness, pi La Desian square. So then, but we don't know how to decrease this bound. So if we think about some other tests, suitable tests, let's say testing itself. As I say, testing the second time derivative situation is even worse. So, p for which it works is larger than 5 over 2. So, we don't know how to deal with these two test functions. So, what we try is that we try to somehow test with some fractional time derivatives in a sense that we will test with different differences and then divide. Differences and then divide with sometimes the h. So, for this, we need to know the definition of Nikolsky spaces. So, here the Nikolsky space is a space of function that somehow have S time derivative, where s is between 0 and 1. And the s is here connected with the fact that we can that after division of a difference. Of a difference of a norm of difference of solution in Lpx by H2 minus S. This quantity is bounded uniformly with respect to H. So we see that the Mikovsky spaces are relatively easy to deal with. So what we observe is the following thing. So we rewrite the equation in this parabolic sense. In this parabolic sense, and then we see that on the right-hand side, the main troublemaker is a convective term. And now we realize that if this convective term, if the right-hand side belongs to some Nikolsky space with delta, then it somehow transfers to the regularity of solution u. So we obtain that u belongs, that the regularity of u is improved. So originally, we had L infinity, L2, and now we obtain. infinity L2 and now we obtain Nikolsky some tau some differentiability in time infinity L2 and here we originally had Lp W1P but here we obtain again some sigma differentiability in time with some tau and sigma. So you see that regularity here improves regularity here on the other side. And the second observation is a reverse. So if we have the So, if we have the information that we have here as a conclusion, then we can ask if it improves the convective term, and it's indeed so. So, we obtain that from the regularity of u, we obtain regularity of convective term for some suitable delta. And now it appears that this delta is larger than small delta, and we can iterate this procedure and get that if p is larger than eleven over five. P is larger than 11 over 5 and F is sufficiently smooth and U is a weak solution to the problem, then in case that U is in L2, we obtain local regularity of solution, and if U is better, we obtain global regularity of solution, which then implies uniqueness or P equal than 11 over 5. And of course, still the case of The case of critical exponent p equal to 11 over 5 is not solved. But unfortunately, this iteration doesn't work for p equal to 11 over 5. So one needs to do something else. And the else is initial improvement of regularity by some Goering argument, Going lemma. So what we need to So, what we need to get is to locally in time obtain such kind of inequality, which then immediately by Goering's lemma improves regularity of U in time, just by small epsilon. But this epsilon then allows to start the iteration process and obtain sufficient regularity for the mutiners. So, here I just said what one does. Set what one does. B-test equation with u minus some time independent capital U. Use good structure of convective term. This is very important that convective term doesn't make problems in these considerations and obtain this inequality, which is good up to the time derivative here. But one can estimate also. One can estimate also this time derivative so that it disappears, and what remains is exactly prepared for, it's exactly this equation, this inequality in the first line, which is prepared for application of the Goering's argument. So we obtain improvement of, by epsilon improvement of regularity of the exolution in time, and then we start the iteration and obtain the theorem. The theorem, which is again the same as the previous one, but now for p equal to 11 over 5. And I think that my time is over, so I think I would stop here. I wanted to say something about cognitive Brinkman for Heimmann model, but I think I lost my time. So, thank you for your attention. So, thank you for your attention. Okay, thank you very much, Beth.
