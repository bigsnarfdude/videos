And I found that there are some talks on the alignment model by Changy and Treber and Yan. So I don't want to focus on the motivation or the background of the model. And also, I don't want to give you too much details on the analysis. So I will just state my research. Just state my research and the theorem, and just give you some idea of the proof. Okay, so let me first write down my main equation today. So, my equation is called the philosophy of alignment model, and this is also called the kinetic. According to Kennedy co-customer model This is the flux of type equation. So we have a speed transport part, so TTF and V graph XF and we also have a portion term here. DF. This is a forcing. And here DF is a function of TXV. So this is the particle distribution function. And we are in the whole space. So V and X and V are in Rd and T is positive. And here the X. And here the F this F is the velocity alignment force which is given by this. So the integer and the phi of x minus y and w minus v and f y. And F YW T Y T W. Yeah, actually, we already seen this model in the talk by Yan. And this the V function is called communication weight weight function or inference function. So basically, in the forging term, there is a relative velocities, which is weighted by the disappear function. And typically, this phi function is given as a non-negative and degrading function. And in my talk, I would like to consider the singular communication weight. Singular communication rate. So our phi function is given by one over modulus x to the power gamma. Gamma is strictly positive. So this is my main equation for today. So let me put the label here. VA, class of alignment model. Yeah, so yeah, so I'm going to discuss. Yeah, so I'm going to discuss some egg distance theory for this kinetic equation. And this equation is closely related to the Kukosme model. So let me write down this equation also. So Kukos-Smei model. And so Kuko and Smeier propose this model to describe. This model to describe some flocking behavior. And this is very simple second-order ODE. So here the Xi is a function of time, which is the position of isopoly at time t. And here we have the equation for Vi, which is given by this Xi minus Xj and Vj minus Vi. And in this original paper, KuCoins may consider the regular communication weight. So Communication weight. So they consider this R square minus bel over two. And they found some sufficient condition leading to the flocking behavior of solutions. Yeah, but the system cannot guarantee that there is no collision between the particles. And if we simply And if we simply replace this regular weight by the singular one, like this, then we can avoid the collision between the particles. So actually the motivation is the following. So think of the situation that two particles are approaching. Then the distance between these particles is decreasing. So that means this. So that means this here, this wave function, the value of this phi is increasing. So those particles have a very strong tendency to have the same velocity. So they may be aligned in velocity before the collision. Of course, if the singularity is not so strong, then they may collide. But actually, in the paper, in my paper, with the paper uh in my paper with uh garelu and uh and uh muha kyotran muha and uh yan pesche yeah we actually uh found some uh very uh sharp result so basically if the here the gamma gamma is greater than equal to one then uh there is no collision uh generically so Generically. So, yeah. And this reject is very sharp because if the gamma is less than one, then we can construct some initial configuration that leading to a finite time collision. So yeah, so in this sense, the considering the singular weight is interesting. And our documentation And uh and our the kinetic uh model is also related to the uh Euler alignment model. Uh I think we already seen this model uh in this workshop and this is also called the the hydrodynamic co-customer model. And this is the pressureless Euler type equation. So we have a continuity equation. And we have the momentum equation, but there is no pressure. And on the right-hand side, we have this alignment force. This alignment of force is given by like this mu x and rho y dy. And but here there is an important thing that this now this divorcing term has a commutative structure. Structure. So actually, this the Porsche tongue can be written as the phi convolution and u and low. And as I know, this commutator structure is importantly used to study the existence of solution to this Euler alignment model. And in the regular communication way case, there are some global Are some global repogenists studied by Ha Kang and Kwan and Tan and Lesili. But the singular case, the singular weight case, I think in the one-dimensional case, the existence of solution is well studied. So actually, So actually, in the one dimension, in our case, the gamma is in the interval 0, 3. Then there is some existence of solutions and maybe the uniqueness studied by Shit Koi and Tadamore and Kiselaf and Kiss the left and tan and others. And in the multi-dimensional case, when gamma is in this interval plus two, then there is the global repository theory obtained by Schtkoi and Passcheck. Pass check and others. And as I remember, in the paper by Koi, he considered the Sobolep space. And the Yan, Patrick, he considered some Basop space. Yeah, and in my recent work with Ginook, we also studied the multi-dimensional case. Multi-dimensional case and where the gamma is less than d. In this case, we also obtained the global resistance and the uniqueness of solution. Yeah, so actually, in this case, we obtained the solution in this. In this space, so rho is in L infinity and U is in W1 infinity, and we have the uniqueness of solution. Okay, so then let me now tell you how they are related. I mean, these systems, of course, the Jan also mentioned about this. So, the mean field limit and the hydrogen limit. Okay, so I think I need to put the label here. This is Euler alignment model. Okay, and then we have a Kukosmere model. This is a particle system, and we have the kinetic equation plus of alignment model. So we have a Kukosmere particle model, and we have And we have a velocity alignment model, which is a kinetic equation. And we have an Euler alignment model. It's a hydrodynamic model. So here we have the solution F. And here we have the solution rho and U. And here we have the solution XI and the Vi, but here I would like to use the empirical measure. Use the empirical measure. So it's a munt, it's the empirical measure associated to the particle system. So here we have the D-Lang measure, XV. Yeah, so here the Xi and the Vi are the solution to the particle system. And actually, the formally, we can show that this empirical measure associated to the Measure associated to the particle couch-smere model is the solution to this kinetic equation in the sense of distributions. So if we can do some stability estimate, then we can actually measure the error between this, the mu n and the f. So actually, formally, formally, we can show that the this imperative. Can show that this empirical measure is like F for N is sufficiently large. And regular case, there is a study rigorous derivation of the velocity alignment model from the particle system. But the singular case, there are, I think, as I remember, there is only two. There is only two results. So, actually, yeah, of course, in my paper with Sheng Dao Zhang, we use this the legislative model just presented by Yang. But actually, we show some convergence of this empirical measure to the empirical measure to the solution f to the kinetic equation. So the gamma is between zero and one. Then in this paper we obtain some Legross derivation of the philosophical Reimote model with a singular case from the particle system. And in the paper by And in the paper by the Yan and Piotra, the Mohai and the Petchek, they also study some existence of the measure value solution to this philosophy alignment model. And from the kinetic to the hydrodynamic model, if we assume that the F That the F F is like a monokinetic. Yeah. Yeah, then we can show that this the low and U are satisfied by the Euler alignment model. And then this the rigorous derivation is studied by Figa Li and Kang. Figa Li and Kang. Yeah, of course, if we simply start from the flux alignment model, then there is no motivation to get this monokinetic answers. So we need to add some additional singular term, and then we need to study some singular limit to have this monokinetic answers for df. But as Dian already said, we can also derive this Euler alignment model from the particle system directly. So actually, we can show that this the empirical measure, as I said, empirical measure is a solution to this kinetic equation in the sense of distributions. And also, if we consider this the monokinetic answers, also. Answers associated to the Euler alignment model. That means this rho and u are the solution to this Euler alignment model. Then we can also show that this is a weak solution to this kinetic equation. So actually, this is also a solution to the kinetic equation. And this monokinetic answer is also a solution to the kinetic equation. So again, we can measure the error between these two solutions. Solutions. So we can show that this is also under certain conditions. We can also show this relation for sufficiently large N. The regular case is studied by the Galileo and myself. Yeah. And the singular case, I think there is no. I think there is no, in general, there is no research on the hydrodynamic limit and this hydrodynamic limit and this membrane. Okay, so let's get back to our domain kinetic equation. I will tell you some known literature on the kinetic equation. And I will tell you our main goal in this project. So let me recall our kinetic equation again. So this is our domain equation. And the F is given by this. And actually, there is a little literature on this kinetic equation. Actually, there are lots of work on the particle Cookosmail model and the Oriental model. Yeah, but this kinetic equation is not the way studied. The rest of it, in my opinion. So, in the multi-dimensional case, the gamma is less than d minus one. Then there is a result on the local in time existence and uniqueness of L-in-finish solution. Of adding finished solution. That's the bylaw, myself, and Joré. Yeah, and then, as I said, in this paper, they also study the major value solution to this kinetic equation. And also, Jan just presented about the inhabitability of the monokinetic distribution. Monokinetic distribution. Yeah, but there is no existence theory for the case where the gamma is greater than equal to d minus one. So yeah, so actually that is the motivation of this project. So our goal is naturally to study the ecosystems and the And the uniqueness possible of solutions to the plus alignment model when the gamma is greater than or equal to d minus one. Okay, so Okay, so now let me state our first theorem. Theorem A is on the existence of an infinite solution. So let the d is greater than or equal to one and gamma is less than d. And D. And suppose that F0 is in L1 and L infinity and first moment in X is bound. Okay, then there is some time and the solution F. Infinity to the flash alignment module. And moreover, if the gamma is in this interval, zero and d minus one. So now the d minus one is included. The solution you exist. Exist uniquely. Yeah, unfortunately, we cannot cover the whole region for the uniqueness. Yeah, but we are able to touch the boundary of this interval. Then let me give you a summary remark on how. Mark on how we can touch the boundary. So, actually, as you might notice that our this kinetic equation is very similar to the velocity pulson, the system. So, so actually the velocity pulson The system is given by this here WP F and of course this can be the plus minus so here the BPF is given by X minus Y over y over x minus y to the power d and y w d y d okay so if we just focus on the singularity then this is like one over modulus of x minus y d minus one okay and here if we And here, if we focus on the singularity, then actually this is like 1 over x minus y to the power of kamba. And for this plus or pausing system, there exist the research on the uniqueness of like L infinity solution. So actually the So actually the in terms of this singularity, actually the gamma equals d minus one case corresponds to the plus of Poisson. So we try to get some idea from the proof of the uniqueness of solution to the Blasso-Poisson system. That is actually the key idea, how we can how we are able to have the uniqueness. Have the uniqueness forward gamma equals d minus one. Okay, so the idea of proof. Yeah, actually the equistance, the part is not so hard, I think. Yeah, but let me give you the idea. Instead, one, we first need to regularize the system to remove the singularity. To remove the singularity in the equation. So we consider this a P epsilon. True. And the image data is also regularized. And for this regularized system, we can easily have the existence and uniqueness of solution. The obsolution epsilon. And then we need to do some uniform in time. Sorry, the uniform in epsilon estimate. Yeah. And then here the smallest of time appears. So we can have this estimate. Yeah, for some small time t star. And then we can also show that this support of the epidemic in velocity is contained in the spurt of the initial Initial F influence and then yeah, we pass the limit. Of course, our system is non-linear, so we have to have some strong compactness. And for this, we use the velocity averaging memo. Yeah, and actually, I'm going to tell you more details on the Bilos Laboratory later. So I don't want to tell you more on this lemma. But actually, by using this lemma, we can have some strong compactness. And we also have some. We also have some weak compactness from this uniform bound estimate. So, yeah, we can pass the limit to get the to have that the limiting function f is the solution to our kinetic equation. Yes, and then but here I want to focus on the uniqueness part uniqueness for the gamma. is for the gamma equals d minus one um yeah so um actually uh we for the uniqueness we uh actually estimate the stability of solutions so we consider the two solution solution f1 f2 and the initial data okay and then we consider some optimal transport map Transport map here. So F two zero is the push forward of F one zero by this map T zero. Okay and then actually by using this the characteristic the flow we can also have the F1 T this characteristic. It's characteristic flow P because our the kinetic equation is a transport type equation so we can easily check this is true where the gi is the x i t to p i t this is a characteristic flow so it satisfies the W minus VI Xi minus Y to the power gamma Y W T Y T W. Yeah, of course, we have to show that this the G I this characteristic flow are very Characteristic flows are well defined. But actually, we can show that when the gamma equals d minus one, then we can have this logo leaps type estimate. Add infinity, and I'll exit. Infinity and our X1 X2 look, the negative part of the look. True, yes. Yeah, so we can have this locally just estimate. So by using the old school criterion, we can have that this. We can have that this GI is already defined. So, yeah, so this is okay. Okay, and then we consider transport here, so which is defined by this. So F2 equals the TT F1 where the TT is Yeah, Z2 T0 T zero and here the Z one this should be backward like this yeah and then we estimate the error between these two solutions by using the first order Baselstein distance. So then D1 F1 F2 is less than or equal to the C1 XP minus C2 here the C0 X V and F one C yeah here the Z is the X V And then, if we set the right-hand side the q, then we can show that this dtq less than or equal to cq, some constant c, and 1 minus rho q. So, from here, we can have the uniqueness of the solution. Yeah, so this is. Yeah, so this is the sketch of the proof for the unicorns. Yeah, and I want to give one remark on the plus of Poisson system. Yeah, because our strategy cannot be directly obtained from the Obtained from the proof of the uniqueness for the velocity Poisson system. Actually, in the paper by Leper 2006, actually for the plus of pulse on the system, we can easily obtain this functional relation. So row one minus rho two. Here, the low is the local density. The local density, local power equal density, and h minus one dot is less than equal to rho one at infinity, the maximum at infinity, and one half, and t two, row one, row two, and p2, and infinity. Yeah, but actually, in our case, we cannot use. In our case, we cannot use this functional relation. So we have to actually directly estimate the distance between these two solutions in the first order Baselstein distance. And of course, I think the result can be extended to the estimate in the piece order baseline distance. But we actually want to use the weaker. Actually, we want to use the weaker assumption on the initial data. So that's why we consider the first-order path of samples. Okay, so yeah, so this is the proof of the uniqueness of solutions. And our second theorem is on the existence of regular solution. Actually, here. Actually, here we consider some HS solution. So actually we are not able to have the uniqueness when the gamma is strictly greater than d minus one. So here we want to consider that case. One and gamma is in this interval except the D and suppose the initial layer is A1 and HS and complexity supported in X and V o Then there exists some small time again and the uniqueness, I mean the unique solution f in this subfunction space to plus online mount mod. Yeah, so actually we can also have some local verpogenis for Hypogenes for the gamma, which is greater than d strictly greater than so we can actually consider some hyper singular communication rate. Yeah, but in this talk, I want to only focus on the hyper singular communication rate case. So the gamma. Uh synthesis. Okay, so again the idea of the proof. Yeah, so actually instead one, we have to reformulate because if you see the our the forcing term, there is the integral of the phi, and actually if the gamma And actually, if the gamma is greater than d, then this phi function is not integral. So we have to reformulate our system. So let the gamma equals the d plus pair with the parallel is between this the zero and one half, one quarter. And Here we rewrite our function v in this way. So, actually, this is equal to the divergence of dx over minus par x d plus par. And again, this is the yeah, some gradient of Of the plus pair minus two, one over modulus of the plus parallel minus two. Of course, I mean, except if x is not zero, then this is true. Okay, okay, then our divorcing term is double minus v. W minus V minus Y T plus better and F Y dy W. Then by using this the risk operator, we can have that this is like divergence of minus two plus better and the m m is the local moment. The m m is the local moment and the v divergence cross beta and low. Here the low is the local particle density and m is the local moment and the lambda is the minus La Prussian and half. So now we said this is our U1 and this is U2. Okay, then now we our alignment model is in some weak sense. This is can be rewritten in this way. U1, U2, the V, and F equals 0. Equals. Yeah, so yeah. And then we need to do some HS estimate. And but again, we have to control the propagation of the velocity support. But actually, the plotting model has some natural phenomena that the support of the density in velocity cannot be enlarged. Cannot be enlarged, but actually, after having this leap formulation, we cannot have that estimate. So here in step two, we estimate the support of the density in velocity. Yeah, so if we set the R over T is the supremum of the modulus of V. Of the modulus of V, where the V is in the support of the F. Okay, then we simply have that this R of T is bounded by the R of zero and then the exponential and some C and T u one tau at infinity and U2 tau at infinity. At infinity, yes. And then now we estimate the HS normal dissolution. Yeah, so after some long computation, we can have this estimate. HS U2 HS and F of T H S. But here, if you see the U1, U1 is something like this 2 plus beta and then cloud M and in terms of the regularity, this is like This is like modulus of the gradient. And here we have the minus two and one, one, so beta n, okay, in terms of the regularity. And but here the better is strictly positive, so that's the problem. So if you simply estimate the u1, h in s norm of the u1, then this is like m h M H S plus beta. Okay, and beta is positive strictly. And of course, we can also have that the Hs norm of the U2 is also the Hs plus better norm of the law. Yeah, but the law is the integral of df in velocity, and then the yeah, and then the And yeah, and then we can actually control the velocity support. So we can simply, if we just simply estimate the HS norm of the law, then this is bounded by the HS norm of F. Okay. Yeah, but here we have the HS plus better. Okay, so we have this estimate. So if we just So if we just bound this U1 and U2 by this quantity, then there is some problem because we are estimating the HS norm of F, but on the right-hand side, we have the HS plus better norm of the F. So in order to close this estimate, we need to gain some additional regularity of Additional regularity of the law or the m compared to f okay, so uh yeah uh so to get this uh additional regularity uh we use the velocity level genember. So actually it's stated in the book It's stated in the book by Glassie. So let me write down the statement, very rough statement. Alpha V G alpha. So basically this the abolition landmass says that this kinetic says that this kinetic transport operator improves the regularity of averaged quantity compared to the h here. So actually if the h is in L2, simply L2 and the G alpha here is in L2, then actually the integral of the H and some function test function the function test function the for C, the V. So this averaged quantity the H S is bounded by the L2 norm of H and L to normal of the G alpha. Of course here the 4 S is one over two times n plus one. times n plus one. So here we only have the L2 regularity for the H and the G alpha, but we have some additional regularity for this averaged quantity. So actually in our equation is a plus of type equation. So we have the grad B so we apply this lemma with m equals one. One, so we have the s equals one quarter, so that's why uh yeah, we have this one quarter here, okay. Yeah, of course, he this test function is uh cc infinity, so uh yeah, we need to do some work, but after some computation, we can obtain that this low to t Low to t uh h is plus one quarter and plus n or so. This is bounded by one plus R T plus the A2 and Hs in some vector Zeta is a strict deposition. Yeah, so Yeah, so yeah, so the main idea is to use this velocity diversion lambda to get some additional regularity for rho and m. Then we can close the this HS, the estimate for the F. Of course, this is just a priority estimate, so we need to do some work. Yeah, but you can find the details in our paper. In our paper. Okay, so let me finally summarize my talk and leave some open questions. Summary. We consider this a plus alignment model with some singular weight function. And then we have the local in time. The local in time, the existence of an infinite solution for gamma less than d and our uniqueness is obtained for the gamma is less than equal to d minus one and then the And then the local repoteness in our Hs for the gamma in the minus one in the plus one quarter except D. Yeah, so actually there are lots of open questions because we don't know how to Because we don't know how to prove the uniqueness for the case where the gamma is greater than d minus one. So uniqueness or non-uniqueness for them the minus one and t yeah yeah I think maybe solution is not I think maybe the solution is not uniquely exist, but I don't know. And maybe there is some finite time the singularity formation. Because actually here, yeah, there is like some condition on the gamma. Condition on the gamma. And also the mean feed limit and the hydrodynamic limit is also open when d is greater than or equal to 2. And of course, again, the local reporting is now for gamma greater than d plus one colour. Than D plus one color. Of course, there are some interesting questions. Okay, so yeah, that's all. And thank you for your attention. So your page has solutions. So your HF solutions, what is their time irregularity? Yeah, actually the S is greater than D over 2 plus 1. So the low NM is like somewhere, maybe the is continuous. Obviously it's continuous. Obviously, it's continuous and uh no, but uh I'm asking about time regularity of f is there any time regularity for the f for f yes um infinity yeah yeah uh uh I mean if the I mean, if the S is very large, then I think we have some additional regularity in time. But because the reason I'm asking is it seems to me that like an hour ago, I was trying to convince everybody that the only situation available with singularity that is larger. Singularity that is larger than D is monokinetic. And right now, maybe I'm missing something, but I'm trying to wrap my head around it because it seems to me that, well, your solution is not non-opined, of course. Because F is regular. Particular cannot be directed. Yeah, but Jan, but you're working with the classical formulation. Formulation. He's working with something else, right? Yeah, I think the notion of the solution is different from yours. Okay, okay. The formulation. Also, you're working only with... So how does it relate to the RASOF alignment? Sorry? Okay. Somehow I think that maybe the best thing is to. Maybe the best thing is to give voice to Changri, who also wants to ask a question, and I will ask you this question later, maybe. Okay. I probably have this question too. You have the, so for your what you call the ultra-sync art, so gamma greater than B, you reform, you have a reformation of your system. Of your system, your information of the equation is that the same system that you're working on, or it's a different you put a tilde or similar sign in your notes there. Yeah, this four thing between the top lane. the the the the top lane uh top line of the of f of f and and the the second line is this is it the same is this the same thing or is it so yeah it uh it's they are same in the in the weak sense distribution sense they say yeah it's good i if so if i if i put a uh if i put a smooth f here on top then uh the On top, then the top integral is not bounded yet. Where if I have a smooth f, I can have the expression downstairs still being bounded. Am I missing something? Sure, I cannot clearly understand your question. Clearly, understand your question because there is some cool the original formulation just doesn't make sense, right? Yeah, so his new formulation is the only one available, so we cannot compare that. I think it's the only the idea is that his new formulation makes sense, right? So, the question is: can you obtain that in, for example, mean field limit? So, can you justify that formulation in mean field limit? I think it's one of the questions that he listed in the end. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But the original logic doesn't make sense. So I think that sort of makes the tricks. So this is a kind of a change of the formulation. It's a change of the formulation. And change of the force. The force has been changed. So the big question is whether you can justify this through discrete mechanisms. That's right. That's right. And it's important equivalent, but the first one doesn't make sense. So I actually have a question also. The only restriction on beta less than a quarter, right, coming from the application of the average in demo. Is that correct? Sorry, can you say again? So why the condition on beta is less than one? Less than one quarter, yeah. So the only place where it comes into play is through the averaging lemma. Is that correct? Yes, yes. I think so. There are some other averaging lemmas by Bruce Scher which reaches the regularity one-third. Oh. And that's what people use, for example, for one down the collision. Or one down the collision moments. So you may want to look at it and see if it applies. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Then the average, you can improve your result just by applying more efficient averaging then. Oh, okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. And I think, yeah, I mean, of course, I think we can also go further, but the regularity can be. The regularity can be, I mean, the solution becomes less regular because there is a paper on some singular kinetic model. And if the singularity is very large, then even if we assume that the initial data is in Hs, but the solution belongs to the Hs minus one, something like this. So yeah. Of course, if we don't want to lose the regularity, then we can study the analytical solution. Take reservation I think maybe of us are leaving. I'd like to thank the organizers.
