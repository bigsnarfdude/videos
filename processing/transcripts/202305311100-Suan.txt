Alright, so welcome back. So for the last talk in the morning session, we have Caleb Suman from University of British Columbia and he's going to tell us about flow of GPU structures associated with LAB. Okay, yeah. So first, can you guys hear me in the back? Sometimes I tell that I speak kind of soft, so just making sure. All right, I'd also like to. I'd also like to thank the organizers for organizing this convention and giving me the chance to speak. Hopefully, I don't get too nervous up here, so we'll see. All right, so this is going to be on something that I did last year with my advisor. And our goal is just going to look at the Laplacian flow and coflow on some sort of Taurus bundles over Cloud Via. Of torus bundles over cloud, VA2, and three folds. We can put G2 structures on those. Run those flows and see what they sort of happen on the base manifold. We're going to establish a correspondence between the Laplacian flow and co-flow of these things called Mondra pair flows that can be done on SU3, SU2, SUN bundles, I guess. All right, so this is joint work with my supervisor, Sebastian Picard. So, just a general structure of what's going to happen. First, we'll just define all our structures, what Claudiel Structures, what clavial means, just then a quick review on G2 structures, and then talk about how we can put structure, G2 structures on these Taurus bundles that I said. Then we'll talk about Laplacian flow, the co-flow, and then see how these things converge and talk about their limits in the end. All right, so one of many non-equivalent definitions of Calabiel manifolds, we'll pick this one. So, for us, everything's going to be Kaler. Everything's going to be Kayler, and a cloud V out and full is just complex dimension n. And we have Kayler metric and a nuller vanishing holomorphic n form. So holomorphic volume form omega. So with the Kayla metric, we have the associated Hermitian metric, Riemannian metric, and complex structure. All of that. I'm going to refer to small omega and big omega as a collabyl structure in general together, as long as they are compatible with each other. So you don't insist that the metric is reached by that? Insist that the metric is reached flat. Yeah, we don't insist that the metric is richly flat, but there exists, there will exist one in the co-emologic class, right? If it's compact, yeah. We're going to be working on compact, if I forget to mention that. All right, so because this big omega exists, the canonical bundle is going to be trivial. This gives us match the first Turing class and existence of, and we get the Reach V flat KL metric. Also, we can write the Reach Volt. Metric. Also, we can write the Ruisby form this in terms of this log of big omega, the norm of big omega with respect to small omega, that vanishes if and only if that norm is constant. You can show that by some maximum principle. All right, so just quick thing on vanishing first turn class on compact K manifolds. Gauss theorem is going to give us the existence of this Riji-flat K metric. And there in the cohomology class. There in the cohomology class, omega. And the metric is unique in the scalar class. I'm just going to refer to it as a collab Yao metric. And the whole Yao's theorem involves the solving and modern complex modern pair equations as sort of a starting point here. So these have been studied quite extensively. All right. So I guess it involves the solving of like the determinant of omega plus eigenvalue R U for that. A plus sign, I'll don't worry you for that rate. So it'll be more apparent in the next slide. All right, so on Calavial, sorry, so not on Calavial, but more generally on Haler manifolds, there's a general class of flows that are related to complex modern pair equations. These were studied by Sebastian Picard and Xiang Men Zhang. So, if we have a compact Kayler manifold, if we pick this function A and this increasing function H smooth, then Smooth, then we have a solution to this parabolic complex bonded paraguitation. So it involves the determinant of omega plus delta bar u. And so long as we do this, we get long time existence. They study long time existence and convergence of these solutions. And this is going to give us a family of Kayla metrics over there. These omega tilde of R, omega t tildes. Is h multiplying that thing, or that's the argument of h? It's the argument of h. So. So, yeah. So, they say conversion is useful, conversion UCK CK norm to some limiting metric. And in the particular case that we care about on Calabiao, the limiting metric is going to be exactly this unique 3G flat K or metric in the cohomology class of the starting point small omega. So, these complex modern pair flows are sort of more a generalization of other flows that. More generalization of other flows that might have been studied before. So, for example, if we pick the function h to be log, we get the Kayla-Ricci flow. If we pick the function h to be just h of rho to be rho, we get the anomaly flow. There are a lot of other more specialized flows that have been studied, but this is more of a general framework that encompasses all of them. So, what's the role of pay? Uh, I'm honestly not too sure. Just picked it to work, but uh To work, but yeah, I think H is the one that really determines the whole flow itself. A is sort of auxiliary to that to make it work. So A is positive, you're studying? A is anything. We're taking E to the minus A. So when you're looking at the special cases, they'll be completely interested for A just equal to zero? Uh I think you can pick it to work. Yeah. Isn't it the A in sure that U has eight? U as e to zero? No, so when they did the convergence, the u they studied the convergence of these u's and made it so that it has integral zero on the thing. I don't think A affects that at all. Yeah. Okay, so for us, we're looking at the plastic flow and co-flow. So we'll actually just look at two particular cases. The first one is this MA one-third flow for moderate pair. One-third is because Monjo pair. One-third is because h has this power of one-third to it. A is picked for convenience, and we have this 6k that's just going to be there. K is a constant. This gives us that evolution equation. And the Taylor Region flow, we pick that. If you look at d by d T of omega, it's going to be d by dt of i del del bar of u, and then that's going to give the Chelegi-Rig-flow equation that's more familiar. That's more familiar. All right, so as I said, these are sort of generalizations of the Kayla-Ricci flow and these other flows. So we have uniform estimates. Basically, everything that you sort of expect from the Kayla-Ricci flow should follow from these. So we get the same uniform estimates. We get positive constants that devolving metrics are uniform there, bounded by this. We also have exponential conversions of the flow. So it's this equation over here. Equation over here, and like I said, these are things that we already knew for things like the Kamucci flow. So, I think if I'm attributing it correctly, these uniform estimates are by tau. And the exponential convergence was by Fong and Stokes. Why is there a tilde? The tildes are the evolving metrics. Why is that just 260? Because I want the actual ones to be the ones that solve the Laplacian flow. So these are sort of auxiliary. These are sort of auxiliary. But at t equals zero, g tilde at zero is. G tilde at zero is g. Yeah. That might be not the best choice, but the tildas are eventually going to be like these auxiliary things that will get us the solution. So that's why they're not the actual ones. All right. So now that we've defined these collabiologists, a very brief review on G2 structures. You get a three-form on a seven manifold. If this thing doesn't banish for any vector, then that's. Banish for any vector, then at the D2 form. And this induces a metric and a Riemannian volume form by this relationship. The details here aren't very important, except that we get the metric and the Riemannian volume form. And this gives us the hot star operator and the dual floor form sine. Yeah, this slide basically serves the purpose to say that I agree with Sri Luz conventions on the orientation because I would try to say this. Because I would try. Because I would try. All right, so we can decompose the space of forms into irreducible G2 representations. My actual representation theory is probably a bit lacking, but we'll just go with this. We take D of phi and D of psi, we get these four torsion forms that are Yeah, this will give us the like 16 classes dependent of G2 structure depending on which of these are zero and non-zero, right? And for us, we care about these three because we're running the Laplacian flow, co-flow, and I'll explain more on that later. But for us, we mainly care about the closed ones at zero. If phi is closed, then three of the tortion forms vanish. If psi is closed, two of the torsion forms vanish. And third and free if it's both closed and co-closed. Torton-free if it's both closed and co-closed. And I think, as mentioned before in previous days, when we have the torsion-free G2 structure, the holonomy is contained in the group G2 and it's region flat. What am I doing on that? All right, so just brief introduction to the Laplacian flow. So now we have moving G2 structures that depend on time. If we define this on some interval, this will satisfy the Laplacian. Some interval, this will satisfy the Laplacian flow equation if it moves like it's Laplacian. So that delta dt is the Hodge Laplacian D D star plus D star D. But remember, since all these structures depend on the G2, since all of those depend on the G2 structures, then use them, the Hodge star will change with respect to time as all these structures move. So this was introduced by Brian. It's been studied a lot. And we know that the critical points of these flows are torsion. Critical points of these flows are tortured and free G2 structures. So, on the compact case, you can just do some integration by parts argument to show that, but it also holds in general. I think it's in one of an argument is in one of JSON orthographic surveys on it. If it's if it's closed, right? It's already closed. Closed JSON. Yeah, if it's closed. And this flow preserves closeness. And so we usually just restrict our attention to starting with a closed E2 structure. With a closed G2 structure and study, we have this theorem by Brian and Shree that says that if we start with a closed G2 structure in a compact seven-dimensional manifold, then the plastic flow has short-time existence and uniqueness. They did this by linearizing it and showing that it's parabolic in the direction of exact forms, I guess, since actually we flow by exact forms, right? In the closed case, using some Hamilton-Nashmoser. Alright, so that was the Laplacian flow. We also have the co-flow, which is instead of flowing the three-form by its Laplacian, we flow the four-form by its Laplacian. Similar idea, this was introduced by Spiro and his co-authors, but they did it with a minus sign. And this is the part where I don't agree with Spirit. Yeah, there's some slight nuance in the fact that the four form doesn't define an orientation, but if we fix it, then Find an orientation, but if we fix it, then we'll all be good there. Again. So, again, integration by the pore form defines these defaults. Not quite. He said that it doesn't define the orientation. The four orientation. Yeah. Yeah. So in the compact case, integration by parts is still going to tell you that the critical points are torsion-free G2 structures. And like the closed, like the Laplacian flow preserves closeness, we restrict the closed. We restrict the close. Co-flow, there's co-closeness. We restrict the co-close and generally work with error. But unlike the Lafossian flow, we don't actually have the same result of our energy. Their argument doesn't port over exactly. Okay, so those are just brief introductions to all these things. Now, let's talk about how we can take a Calabiow manifold and cross a torus bundle, cross a torus in, and generate D2 structures. So this only works for a small enough collab. This only works for a small enough club manifold to small enimmension because if it's too big, then we have too many dimensions. We only looked at the two-fold and three-fold case. I'm pretty sure that if you start with a one-fold, you can cross in like a five-torus and do the same thing, but I haven't figured out what those are. Not sure if that's been done, but someone probably can figure that out. Okay, so the two-fold case, let's look, let's start with a Claviat two-fold. And if we choose this function f, that's a nowhere vanishing complex function, and Complex function and choose a strictly positive function g, then we can define the g2 structure by crossing in a three torus in this form. So here, R1, R2, R3 are going to be the angle coordinates in the torus. And we can define these to be our G2 structure like this. So here, like the real part of omega and the imaginary part of omega is supposed to sort of mimic the hypercaler structure. Again, here we're not assuming that the original omega is the Rishi flat one, so these aren't exactly. Is the Rishi flat one, so these aren't exactly the hypercaler things, but these will sort of mimic their roles. Also, they're not normalized to be like the same length of each other, but that's not really going to be a big issue. Now you've switched to the other sign convention. Yeah. Right. But why did it say that you picked? Is there a reason why you picked G to appear the same and F to appear the same? You could have had them all different. Yeah, I think it's because. Yeah, I think it's because I wanted these to sort of be the other two and they have to work in tandem with each other. And I don't know why, I just picked G to be different. It happens to work this way. It seems to be distinct. This sort of distinguishes the R1 coordinate from the other two, but. I think Jason's asking why the two G's are the same, right? Yes. Yeah. I don't remember why exactly I did that. I think. I don't remember why exactly I did that. I think I saw something similar and just worked it out in this case. It might work out in more generality, but it works if I pick G to be the same thing in both the R1, R2, R3 wedge each other and the R1 and Omega component. In some sense, the omega isn't going to move in this game. GDF is really R1. Yeah. You put it on the omega, but it's really GDR1. Yeah, I put it on the omega because. Yeah, I put it on the omega because the G is on the base and isn't exactly on the torus, so it has no impact in that sense. But yeah, G is sort of with the R1 and then F is sort of with the R2 and R3. It's trying to distinguish G and the R1 between solid. It's interesting that that's actually going to work. I think if you had different ones, you could just absorb one of them for the Omega. Yeah, that's all. That's right. Yeah. That's why you say the F said. I just mean that it's going to have an F, the R1, the R2, etc., and a G there. You can just redefine the omega again. Yeah, yeah. But I don't understand why. I also don't understand why you have F twice. But omega match flows. You can imagine shifting those. Anyway, it's okay. So you can compute the associated matching in volume form. You can do that in coordinates. Coordinates. Yeah, and this. So the metric isn't exactly just the product metric, it's some sort of work product. And these two sort of appear just because of the whole Kaler permission metric and the Riemannian metric. There's a factor of two appearing. So those two are just sort of inconsequential, but just happen to be remnants of that. And you can also compute the volume forms, just basically match the three coordinates together and put the volume form, the colour two form. And then you can. Yeah, twofold. And then you can compute all the hot star, however, it is. But basically, the main idea is that if you take a hot star of a form on the seven, on the product, it's basically just doing it on the base. And then you just wedge in the other three, the other angle coordinates as required and have the right side up to subfactor. Okay, and we can check what the dual form is, and that's what we get. All right, and we can do it. We can do it in practice for a second. Okay. Yeah. And we can play a similar game with threefolds. Now we cross in a one sphere instead of a three torus. Still sort of the same framework, like a nowhere vanishing complex function and a strictly positive function, and we can define it this way. And you can again compute the associated metric. The factors are two, again, from the complex Hermitian. Again, from the complex Hermitian compared to the Riemannian metric. Wait, which sign of action is this one now? It's the same because it's minus on the small omega. 20 by omega. Yeah, this one is also. Those are self-dual, right? Yeah, here the the omegas are self here the omegas are self-dual. Like the real part and the magic part is self-dual. It's like the hypercade I think. Yeah, so I think the point is yeah, it's all about Jason talks about pretty much. So what Jason talks about, which is very important. I know the speaker wants to meet with Danjo, both organizers. So long as you help him through it, it's copy. Yeah, I mean, they're consistent with the different cases that you do. Perhaps you should alternate every display with what you do. Yeah. Yes. That's where the frustration starts with us. All right. But Alright, but basically, a similar idea: hot stars on the product are basically hot stars on the base, up to some factors. And then we get the dual four form in the same way. All right, so we're talking about the Laplacian flow. We want to start with closed e-two structures. So I think in this case, we're sort of forced on what f and g have to be to make these closed because we know that small and big omega are already closed. So if we take anything else up to scaling by some constants. Constants and type, you don't get a closed structure. So here we have to pick f to be this norm term and g to be one. You get this closed structure. They're functions on the on the base. Yeah. So f and g are functions on the base. They don't care about the torus at all. So we do that for both cases. We get these structures. These are closed because small omega, mega omega are closed. And we can compute their Hodge Laplacian. And we can compute their Hodge Laplacians with all our pop stars and using d d star plus d star d and all those formulas, we'll get this for this on the three porous cross x4 and we'll get this on the other case. Right, so these are closed. We can also compute the torsion forms. Think like if we start with a bonus structure, then Then this is minus tau d of tau2, and if we start with this will come out later, but not really come up later, but we can just see the relationship between the torsion and the lafaci. So in this case, the In this case, the torsion is just, and the Laplacian differs by just this exterior derivative, and we can see that, right? So, here this is interior multiplication, and using Cartan's magic formula, we've turned that into a lead derivative with a sign change. But yeah, these are all going to be intermediary things if you compute with all those formulas we have before. You can show that here only the tau2 part of the torsion exists as expected because we're closed. And again, these vanish if and only if we're actually using the cloud geometry. Okay, so now we're going to do some naive stuff and look at how the Laplacian flow should work. So let's naively assume that Laplacian flow preserves the end-to-ends, right? Where of this formula we did. So if we shove in this time derivative and our Laplacian, we get this on t3 cross x4, or this in the other case. Or this in the other case. And we stare at it and see if this tells us anything. If we stare long enough, we can maybe realize that our angle coordinates shouldn't be changing. And since this vector is really only caring about the base and not any of the angle coordinates, the leader of this sort passes through anything that involves R, R1, R2, and R3. And if we look at it closer again, anything involving small omega sort of has the same behavior. Small omega sort of has the same behavior in both cases. Anything involving big omega has the same behavior in both cases. That helps. We'll color it in. We'll see that small omega terms before the equal sign are multiplied by two. And whatever two factors at the start, that depends on the dimension. It's still a constant. And terms involving big omega, they get their significance. And now we can do even more naive stuff and say, all right, small. I use stuff and say, all right, small omega multiplies by two, big omega splits of sine. Let's just combine these cases together and just say that let's move small omega by that lead derivative term and big omega by that lead derivative term. Again, no real reason to assume this, but let's do it and eventually we'll see that it works. So we'll combine both cases because in both cases we have the same behavior. This pre-factor was a constant, just depending on the dimension. It was a constant, just depending on the dimension. So we'll just let H denote whatever metric we had on the base before. So we get these two sort of coupled evolution equations for small omega and big omega. And if we have structures that follow these, then they should solve the Laplacian equation from before. Okay, so like I said, Flabiel structures satisfying both of these will satisfy the Laplacian flow. Now, at this point, we also have to be. Now, at this point, we also have to be careful because now we're sort of evolving small omega and bigger independently. And our initial structures require this actual collaboration structures, right? So small omega determines a complex structure. Big omega has to be holomorphic with respect to that complex structure. And if that doesn't work and they move in different directions apart, then these don't work and we don't actually have SU collabial structure to begin with and can't play this game. So we have to be careful. So, we have to be careful that when we find solutions, not just finding solutions to these, but finding actual compatible ones. It's not going to be a problem later when we look at the solution that we found that it works, so there's no issue there. All right, so let's look at these equations sort of separately and see what it tells us. We can compute these in local coordinates and just write that first equation out as I del del bar of. As I del del bar of that norm term to the minus two-thirds. We'll relate this to the MA1 third flow a bit later, but this is what tells us that that's the flow we should be using. And those T's are jumping a little bit ahead that Dalbar sort of is dependent on the complex structure below. And if we look at the second equation and compute it, it actually doesn't stay n0 with respect to whatever complex structure we start. Respect to whatever complex structure we started with. So, if we have any hope of solving these equations simultaneously, the complex structure is going to have to move. So, you're not assuming that omega omega t and little omega t are compatible for all t right now. There's just two. There's just these two. So, how is j t defined? You said you said little omega determines j? Yeah. How how does how are you getting j for little omega? So we start with that time. We have the if we take the Clavial structure that already has all these things happening, right? Like at any point in time, we define the G2 structure from Clavial. The metric isn't fixed, but okay, so at this point, it's just like snapshot in times. We pick one time, so the metric is fixed at that point, assuming we start with Clavial. If we flow independently. Flow independently, then we have to move the G2 structure. We have to move the complex structure accordingly with one of them. Now nothing is exactly moving yet. We're just seeing if we start flowing, what has to happen to make everything? If you have so so what what are the what are the conditions? Little mega t and legal mega t, they're just a two-four method. And so if we start and assume that they're compatible at time t. Assume that they're compatible at time t. But at other times, what are you assuming? Nothing. We have no assumptions yet, but if we start at this and start flowing with what we feel our evolution equations should be, then we know that the complex structure has to change or, well, they have to stay compatible in some sense because we don't know yet how it has to change. Yeah. This equations, but the factors are different. We need, for example, look at the separate equation. Yeah. Like only map like names the norm of omega, whatever this is. And then if I do the same thing to delete the omega t, it doesn't seem to match the stability. Yeah, so eventually we'll get everything to work out by having a diffimorphism but also flowing things together and that will sort of reconcile any differences in. Of reconcile any differences in how these change. I think the only confusion was you said it's in general n-zero form aspects of the composer JT, but there is no JT yet, it's just a J0. Yeah, there isn't. Yeah, just right now we're at T, right? Well, T equals T0 or something. We're fixing a timer. All right, so we need to just address all the compatibility conditions initiative, basically. So maybe we should try and keep the complex structure fixed by moving everything by some defeomorphisms. Everything by some diffeomorphisms, and if we look at it moving with the diffeomorphisms, then the complex structure is fixed in some sense. So each point in your fluid is a clavicle. Yeah, it has to be a collaboration. All right, so how do we get a solution from this MA1 third flow? Well, let's just fix the initial Clavier structure on some Clavier enfold. And our MA1 third flow gives this evolution equation with the 6K. So I So, like this, this flow gives us a family of Kayler metrics, but this has a fixed complex structure with what we started with. And this is how our Kayler metrics will evolve, right? So this omega t flows like this, which is kind of similar to what we had before. So capital omega is fixed in the. Here, capital omega is fixed. So we start with an initial structure that has a Kayla metric, complex structure, and then we. Complex structure and then Riemanniometric, and also this holomorphic N-form, N0 form. These are, those will stay fixed. Then you can move the Kayler structures, keeping the other ones fixed. Normal. Normal for me to stick fixed. So this one is moving. This one has the tilde. So the tildes are moving. But the the omega without the t is it's the initial one that that that one's fixed. That one's fixed. So maybe you had some feeling function H. Yeah. So in this case, H is what? So here, A B of rho is 6k rho to the one third, right? And A is equal to 2 log. So these are like fixed. This doesn't change because this is misrespect. This doesn't change because this is with respect to the initial structure. That's just a function on R. That's just the argument for H, right? But this is what's being acted on by H, right? E to the minus 2 log norm term and then the quotient of the determinants. Big omega cannot change even by the phase because that would shift in the way. Yeah, we're not changing big omega, we're not changing small omega. So without any t's, those are going to stay fixed. Without any T's, those are going to stay fixed in time. But this one with the tilde end to T, that one's changing. All right, so we get this family, moving family of Caleb metrics. We can use them to define this time-dependent vector field. So k is still the same constant. And using that vector field, we can have a one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms acting. Acting on the manifold generated by y. And everything is compact. We're initially starting with compacts of this vector field. This one parameter family exists for all t. And then using these diffigrances, we can start pulling our tensors back. So this is the family of differing horses we're going to use to pull everything so that the tensor structure will move according to time, but we'll stay still as we move with the. Stay still with the diffeomorphisms. And since everything below was compatible as a Cloud Val structure, if we pull them back, these are still compatible. So if we take these as our solutions, we have no issue with the compatibility. We have been on the HTTP solutions to the MA1 flow first. Yeah, the tilde ones are the solutions to the flow on the base first before pulling back. So that's why I said they're going to be the auxiliary structures. They're not the ones that will solve the low fashion flow. They're just the things that we have to do and then we have to. They're just the things that we have to do, and then we have to pull them back, and then they saw the robots flow. All right, now this is what we expect to be our solutions, and we can just verify that. We can use the Turks trick and just compute what these will be. So this computing and pushing things forward, pulling things back, using any things that we know about the d derivatives and tensorial properties and whatnot, we can eventually show that we get the equation that we want. So now, all these, at the end, we no longer have to tell. These at the end, we no longer have to tell this, right? Because everything's been pulled back and we've accomplished for that. So, this is that first evolution equation that we want to solve. And if we want to look at big omega, same thing with the turkey, except that that second term actually doesn't exist because there's no like big omega tilde t. That one's constant. So, philosophically, what you're saying is that the Laplacian flow after composing with a different orphan is the only flow. Yes. Yeah, they're not the same flow, but they're different to each chip. Yeah, so after this diffeomorphism, they're basically the solution, the solution, well, uniqueness tells us that the solution to the elastic flow above is given by the MA1 third flow below on the base. It's time dependent, yeah. And it depends on the moving method. And it depends on the moving metrics. Here, big or big is still fixed. We didn't move that at all. Can you say, how do you see this fact that you just said that the Laplace influence related to this MA1 third flow? So these solutions, omega t, we obtain them from the omega tildes, and the omega tildes were obtained by the MA1 third flow. And after this pulling back by the beta t's, these untilded structures, they sat. These until the structures they satisfy the original evolution equations that we said should hold for a solution to the Laplacian flow. So using the Turk trick and all that, we can, well, as a summary, we get this fact, right? So the non-tilde structures are going to be the ones that actually solve these evolution equations that we naively impose, but well, they work. So they're a solution. But you get this different lattice factor. This different lattice factor, because again, you're pulling back by the same. Yeah, we're pulling back by a diffry morphism, but the diffromorphisms were generated by the things by basically this thing here was the vector that we were taking the lead derivative of respect to. So that gives us that. And by scaling it, that allows us to change the parameters on like the small omega and the big omega. Big omega. It's because the omega t, there's two on the right-hand side, there's two t's, right? The theta and then the. Both are randomly pulled back. Yeah, it's basically you're pulling back to make omega constants, big omega constants. Yeah. That's how you choose one. And then the resulting thing. Yeah, it's just very bad. Hundred? Is that true? Is it in the turkey? Is it in the trick? Yeah, so that lets us differentiate the detector. Can we just think this calculation in the directory in the truck trick? Yeah, because the flow already exists, right? Yeah. Yeah, using this particular calculation. I guess that's on this note. That's the question for him to respond. Like, he talks about the core flow of the colour to ask the question. Is there a vector field related to tau one? A vector field release of the. Of thing you used to put simulated Tau? Uh yeah, so Tau Tau 2, right? Tau 2 was this and it basically 0 here. Tau 1 is 0, yeah. But Tau2 is your vector field something, right? Yeah. Tau2 is basically that vector field, but before the pullback. It's got one part of the question because we had never thought about. Alright, so, and because of how we constructed these, we don't have to worry about the compatibility conditions, right? They're already settled. So now we can see that whatever associated D2 structures that these ones induce, then these will satisfy a Laplacian flow equation. This is nice, right? We have uniqueness of the solution and we've exhibited this. So this means that the Laplacian flow actually does preserve the zontons. Yeah, like all of them move omega in the same Gala cluster because it's adding i del del bar, right? So that always adding something ED bar exact. Okay, so now we're gonna do the same thing for coflows, co-flow for the co-flow and using co-flow structures. A lot of what happens will be extremely similar, actually. Similar, actually. Okay, so if we want a co-flow structure, we can reverse our choices for FNG, and these will get us close for form since then. I think these might also be forced, but I'm not sure. We can go back later. But if we do this, these are closed because again, small omega and big omega are closed. And if we compute the Hodgelopacians, we're gonna get sort of similar things, very similar ideas that are gonna start showing up. Similar ideas that are going to start showing up. The main difference here is that instead of this norm turn to the minus two-thirds, we get log of it, which somehow feels more natural, which is the interesting part. Oh, I guess one thing that we should say is that this one-third appearing in the MA1 third flow, not really sure where that comes out from. Initially, we started with doing it on a collab VL three-fold, and we're like, oh, one-third, one over N, that makes sense. And then we did it with a two-fold, then one third. And then we did it with the two-fold, then one-third still shows up. So we're not sure where that three is, where the one-third is coming from. Maybe. Yeah, but the co-flow is the four-form, and then we get a log, which isn't the same pattern. So that's why it's, I guess, interesting where that comes from. Hey, and we can do the same thing. We can compute the torsions. It's cold closed, so we expect maybe tau naught and tau 3 to not vanish, but. Tau naught and tau3 do not vanish, but tau naught also becomes zero in this case. And similar idea, because tau naught is zero, the Laplacian is D of tau 3. So we get the same hooking into a form into this closed form in bi-Cartan's fashion formula that turns into a d derivative again. And same thing, these vanish if and only if our metric is collaby out. We do our We do our same naive assumption that we should satisfy the same ensats, and we get these evolution equations. And if we started them long enough by comparing these small omega terms and big omega terms, we get similar things, but the coefficients are different. So here, small omega gets flipped, the sign gets flipped, and big omega terms stay the same. Unless I'm reading that wrong. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. That's correct. If you ignore the pre-factor at the front, it just flips small omega flip sine big omega stays. In the first quarter, right? In both. In both. You have an omega t squared or. Yeah, but then when you take d by dt, you get omega wedge d omega. So it becomes linear in that sense. All right, and same with the lead derivative. Alright, and same with the V derivative. Alright, so we match terms, similar idea, and we have our same warning that we have to maintain compatibility, but again, we're going to get solutions from the same way. So we use our evolution equations, but now using this rescaled Reky flow. Then, sorry, if we look at our evolution equations, this tells us that maybe we should be looking at the ReSki flow, Kayla Regi flow. And the second equation also tells us. And the second equation also tells us that, yeah, we have compatibility issues if we don't move the complex structure in some sense. Same idea. So now, if we start with this rescale Rigi flow, we can get a moving family of K-bometrics again. These determine the time-defendant vector field, and we just tack on K there, and we don't flip the sign this time to just make all the equations work out. And same one-parameter family. These still exist by the same reasons. And we pull back structures again. And we pull back structures again. And using that one trick in the Turks trick and computing everything, then we get the same evolution equation we want. So we're just careful that when we pull back all the structures, then the complex structure changes as well. That's why... Whoops. What happened there? What happened though? Actually, it's a good news. Okay, there we go. Alright, so similar summary as before. It looks like the co-flow above is given by the KLG flow below. So, can you go backwards and say if you had a flow, one of these monitor pair flows for some capital H? Yeah. Capital H. Yeah. Find out what the float structures correspond to. I feel like you should be able to do that. You still don't know what it happens. I mean, if there's some nice, if there's some other nice floats of like, you know, two floats of two floats, then you can predict some potentially interesting floats of the district. Yeah, that's what I was hoping. But here you can't say that. Well, we have a solution for long time, but. Solution for a long time, but we don't have uniqueness, right? I think that the choice of close four form is also forcing f and g, but that might not be true. That one has like a norm of f, so I guess you might be free to have some angle coordinate, some angle that's being changed. That might give, that might like kill the uniqueness of GoFlow, but I might be wrong on that. Can you show again the torsion of gas circles? So this one, the torsion, only So this one, the torsion, only tau 3 is non-zero. Okay, so now that we have the solution, we want to see what happens in infinity. Because the flows on the base exist for a long time, we have that those ones converge to the collabi out. We want to see what happens when we pull the structures back. Okay, so this is what we have. The flow is basically solved. The flow is basically solved by structures below using this pullback of the tilde ones. Those are given by some modern pair flow, and we have uniform estimates for them. And the diffeomorphisms are given by this time-dependent vector field that we defined. Now, we're going to prove convergence using something that I saw in one of the papers. But basically, what we want to show is that this theta t converges to. That this theta t converges to some diffeomorphism that's not degenerate in some sense. So, again, you can recall how we define those kind-defended vectors. And because of this omega tilde t thing, and we know that with the Calabiam metric, that's constant. So, this derivative should vanish in some sense, right, as we go. And we have exponential convergence of the omega tildas. Omega tildes, so that's going to give us exponential convergence of the vector field y. Okay, and now we want to show that some limit exists. So we're going to do some uniform convergence arguments. If we pick any two times, we have a path between them using the thetas. And if we integrate to find your distance, that basically gives us y, and we know y converges exponentially. So that gives us uniform convergence. We can do this for any k. Convergence, we can do this for any k. So we get convergence in the CK norm to some limit map that we'll call theta infinity. Now, the next thing that shows that the state infinity is not degendered in some sense, so we'll look at these volume forms. I guess we're looking at the functions in front of the forms. But yeah, by using this argument, and we have estimates on, this all comes back to the estimates in y, the vector field y, we have those, so we can show. So we can show this uniform estimate of this full back theta t star. Those are uniform, so that tells us that each of the theta t's are the determinant of their before it is non-zero and bounded away from zero. So that can push that onto the limit map. So this estimate is passed on to the limit, so that limit map is non-degenerate. And then Is non-degenerate. And then, so it's a local diffeomorphism. Does that tell you then that the volume is bounded? Yeah. Yeah. It looks like the initial volume. By some constant of the initial volume, yeah. Which is interesting because both flows are the gradient flow for the volume. So even though it's increasing, it can never exceed some initial bound a priori bound. Yeah. I guess this depends on the actual flow that you're using. Depends on the actual flow that you're using. Each individual one parallel has its own constants. All right, so theta infinity is our local diffimultance by image function theorem. And then we obtained our theta t's this way. So we can conclude that theta infinity is rejective. And then by compactness, we get this covering map and home topic identity. So we'll eventually conclude that theta infinity is injective. And so we have a bijective local diffeomorphism, which is diffeomorphism. Diffeomorphism. And then we can eventually show that this, our structures are going to converge to that pullback of the collabia. All right, and that's pretty much the end. So if we just put everything together, we get what we've shown. The flashing flow basically reduces to this MA1 third flow up to some difficulties in the pullback, and we get stationary points in this form. And analogously, co-flow can start with something of this form. You get a solution from the Kalerishi flow of the differomorphism again, and stationary points still list. Same argument applies for both the co-flow and the flow. All right, thanks.
