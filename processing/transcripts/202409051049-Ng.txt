Yeah, I have a question. So, Okay, so for our last talk this morning, we are delighted to have Thomas Hong and he's going to tell us a boundary criteria for relative pupilage. Criteria for relative population and special. Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, special things are relevant, I guess. Okay, so yeah, thanks for having me. Thanks for the invitation. Thanks to be here. Right. So it's nice speaking later in the week because things were defined for me. But somehow my favorite definition of relative. Somehow, my favorite definition of relative probability didn't go up. So we'll start with that. Maybe a word before I start, right? The idea here is that, right, we've seen a lot of things about cubulation. I don't think anyone, well, so we've seen a little bit about relative cubulation. A relative cubulation is when a relatively hyperbolic group acts in a very nice way on a cancer cube complex. So let me first start with P is a collection of subgroups. Of subgroups of a group G. So it's some finite collection. Say that the pair is relatively hyperbolic when when there is a hyperbolic graph. This is Bodig's definition. Gamma such that g acts on gamma and I want that action to be co-compact. What else do I want? I want that for any edge For any edge in gamma, the number of embedded cycles through the edge E has to be finite. But you have to say down a point. Sorry, for any n. For any of a fixed length of length n. Length n, thank you, is finite. Okay, yes, and then what else do we want? But we want that the stabilizers of every edge should be finite. Yes, you could say that. Yes, we could say that Kv is the stabilizer of a vertex and is incident, then this group is conjugated into our collection P. Okay, so somehow this is, yeah, okay, so such a graph is called a finite. Okay, so such a graph is called a fine hyperbolic graph for P, and we'll say that gamma witnesses relative hyperbolicity of G. So actually maybe it was a little artificial for me to define P first, a specific peripheral structure. You can just find a group that acts in such a way on a graph without this last condition, and such a group will be hyperbolic relative to the Be hyperbolic relative to the vertex data. Right. Our, I guess, prototypical example is if I take a free product, I'll act on that SAR tree. That's perfectly good. That's also a nice action on the cube complex. So that's the kind of actions that we'll be most interested in. And so I guess the I guess the setup, sort of like maybe why would you want to have a relative cubulation, is maybe that you'd like to find actions of a group on a cube complex. And I wonder, is the action on the one skeleton going to witness relative hyperbolicity? So that is some ways to start. Perhaps you want to change this. Let's change this example slightly and look at. And look at, I could product these groups just with some finite group, like a smallest finite group, function to a finite group. And so that will act until the green green is actually invisible. Let's see. Yeah, invisible. Okay. So, right, let's. Right, we have some tree that we started with, but maybe actually we'd like the action to be faithful, and so you have actually an action on a tree cross-integral. So that's a kind of action that we have there. This group is hyperbolic relative to these vertex groups. And so that's the kind of cubicle action that we are looking for in our code. So now let me recall the definition of a relative geometric action that we saw yesterday. So we suppose that G acts on X, I can't throw a cube complex, is relatively geometric. Let's do this again. When the quotient is compact to, we want is relatively hyperbolic. Every peripheral subgroup is elliptic. Subgroup is elliptic on x. And lastly, the third condition is that if I have the stabilizer of a cube is infinite, then Kc is Kc is, let me say, finite index inside of some conjugate of one of the peripherals. That's the definition of relatively geometric. And so that's sort of designed to allow for actions on Q complex where you see a little bit more of the group. Bit more of the group. And so when a group acts, admits a relatively geometric action on a factor Q complex, we say that G is relatively cubic. The definition was somewhat clear. I guess, first of all, this was not always my favorite definition of relatively hyperbolic. Maybe it's. Maybe it's it was certainly the weirdest one for me. Right, but something that sort of came out of thinking about relatively cubulated groups is that there's, in work with Einstein and Groves, we show that, right, if you have this condition, then you can look at all the cubes that have for a fixed peripheral subgroup. For a fixed peripheral subgroup, you can look for all of the cubes whose stabilizer is commensurable with that specific peripheral, and then you can collapse them down to a point. So you can electrify your Q complex, and you get a fine hyperbolic graph. So you can produce the graph that witnesses relative hyperbolicity from the Q complex. Collapse, I would say, P subcomplexes. P sub complexes to get our strength. Okay. So great. I mean, that's, I guess maybe that helps to justify the definition, but why would you want to relatively cubulate a group? That's sort of one of my goals. I'd like to convince you of that. So maybe let me mention that. Maybe let me mention that as a question. How can we relatively accumulate let me be a little audacious and say every group and actually maybe before I answer how, let's explain a little bit why. Um 2020, excellent. Um so Einstein and Groves and then using using their work and then also results in Groves Manning these are both both in 2020. So this is like two general, right, relatively hyperbolic groups. There's so many of them. You can take any group, a free product with any other group, it's relatively hyperbolic. Not so helpful, but if every peripheral subgroup is residually finite, then oops. Oops. And G is relatively cuculated, then G is residually finite again. And you can do even better than that. You can say that, and full Full, relatively quasi-convex subgroups are separable. So I guess from my point of view, that's right, so you started with a bunch of residually finite groups, you produce some new group, and we get that's Produce some new group, and we get that's residually finite. And why? Because that group acted on some hyperbolic cube complex. So I think of this sort of in the same way that I'm thinking of maybe Eigle's theorem, where if I have a group that acts geometrically on a hyperbolic cube complex, then you know that it's virtually special, so you get particular these nice separability properties. But here, maybe you started with groups. Your favorite group for some reason is like SL3Z. You're not going to get a geometric action. You're not going to get a geometric action on a cat 0 cube complex. That group has property t. But maybe you can still hunt for an action of your ambient group on the cats 0 q complex that is, say, relatively geometric, and you might still be able to show that your ambient group is positionally finitely valid. Keep and then we'll keep track of where all the great erasers are. That's a good question. So if you have a group at the co-compact complex group, that's saying that it's relatively geometric for the family of all cube stabilized. Well, so we don't know. Right, so so The cell stabilizers are very carefully controlled to only be finite or finite index and maximum. So you're asking, is your question about non-relatively hyperbolic groups? For example, if you allow two peripheral subgroups to, like I've specified some collection of subgroups, and I'm allowing them to intersect quite a lot. Quite a lot. So, here, what's important is that the relative hyperbolicity says that these peripherals are isolated. So, they shouldn't be intersecting too much. So, what I don't want is to have a chain of cubes that intersect, and maybe this cube is stabilized by both of those. So, where does that appear in the picture now? Well, it's sort of implicit here where I'm asking that the cube stabilizers are finite indexed in this family. In this fail. So, right, this couldn't have been, because then you'd need to be finite index inside of both peripheral subhypes. In this picture, this cartoon I'm thinking of this as P1 and P2 may be the hull of their orbit. So, um This is a good place to put. Okay, so I didn't say it at the beginning, but everything I'm speaking about is joint work in progress with Teddy Einstein and Sirosh Krishna. But now I'm going to reuse that. So, right, this idea of trying to use boundaries of groups, right, why specify relatively hyperbolic groups? Because there's a nice way to compactify such groups. And before going to relatively hyperbolic groups, you can ask about hyperbolic groups. So Bergeron and Wise in 2012, sorry, 2006, right? Sixth, right? Okay. Saying that if G is word hyperbolic, and this is sort of the inspiration for this kinds of results, and let's take H to be a collection of Quasi-convex codimension one subverse of G. And suppose further if for every pair of distinct points A and B in the visual boundary of G, Visual boundary of G, we can find some subgroup, let me denote it, H alpha beta, in this collection. So Jason was describing this situation this morning so that alpha and beta are separated then Then, first of all, there's inside of this collection, I can find a finite sub-collection. This is separated by the limit sets of page chapter 3 stuff. Yes, yes, so the question is, is what does separated mean? Let me draw a picture of that. So, okay. I don't have any dimension restrictions. I don't have any dimension restriction, so I'll draw my boundary higher-dimensional. I think of alpha and beta as two distinct points. We say that we're looking for some subgroup H so that the limit set in the boundary, I can look at the limit set of H. So if I look at boundary of G, removing the limit set separates. Sorry, well, I guess the no, just Sorry, well I guess the no, just this is the boundary of G. This limit set separates alpha and beta from the boundary. So that's the definition of separating. We want them to be in different H components, right? You don't allow anything. Different H components, yes, yes. Separates up to the actual H. H component. Right, so H in general is permuting the complementary components of the boundary. And I've sneakily drawn the boundary as if it's connected, but in general, it could not be connected. And H could be permuting these different components. Components and we want them to be in different each orbit subcomponents. So there's this finite sub-collection of subgroups so that G acts on some cube complex X. This is the cube complex that will be dual to the translates of these family here. So that's the original version on the wise boundary criteria. So now when G is relatively hyperbolic. We would like a boundary for that. And so the way that I want to, well, to try to justify the definition of relative probabilistic that I put up, we can I want to describe a boundary for the structure P. So something that hasn't really shown up and will be relevant in just a bit is that a fixed relatively hyperbolic group, so a group that has a relatively hyperbolic structure, you can change that structure. So for example, I've already erased the picture. So for example, I've already erased the picture, I think, of trees again. So if I have a group that's acting on a tree, let's say again, let's say a free product, we can add in to my peripheral structure the subgroup generated by some loxedralic element. And that gives you a new relatively hyperbolic structure on your group. So each of those different structures will provide a different boundary. Structures will provide a different boundary. But the boundary of the group we could take to be the visual boundary of a graph witnessing that relatively hyperbolic structure, union is the set of vertices with infinite stabilizer. That's the boundary as a set. That's the boundary as a set. The topology is significantly more technical to try to describe. But from the point of view of boundary separation, as long as we know what the points are, we can try to describe them. At now stage, Stop me at any moment, any time. So it's our main theorem. Actually, it was, let me attribute it later. Let G be relatively hyperbolic, GP be a relatively hyperlike. Relatively hyperbolic, GP be a relatively hyperbolic pair, and let H be a collection of full relatively quasi-convex subgroups. It's going to look exactly like the first round-wise result over there. If alpha okay, fine, I can do it this way too. Um leave a space if every pair of distinct points now in the Bodish boundary of G is separated by some subgroup in the collection. In the collection, then we can again find a finite subcollection so that the group acts on the dual cube complex. The dual cube complex to that collection relatively geometrical. So you might complain that I wrote Q instead of P. Right? So I meant it. Where Where if I take any Q here, Q is a subgroup of P, some P and P. So here we had to change the relative structure, and when we have this condition here where we're passing to smaller subgroups inside of our original peripheral structure, we're going to call this a refined peripheral structure. Refined peripheral structure. So are you allowed to just completely get rid of some? Is this that smaller too, or is there like a cube for every P? Right, okay, so yeah, it will turn out that for each P we will refine each of those. Let me first just write, before I forget, find peripheral structure. Yeah, how is Q going to show up? Yeah, how is Q going to show up? Is that from the action on the Q complex, we might have to split P. And so P will be hyperbolic relative to some subgroups Q, which will be associated with each P. And so you replace each P with that, those new subgroups. It might be that the Q you take is exactly the original peripheral subgroup. Yes, wondering, could you? I was wondering, could you explain the definition of full again? I didn't define it. So that's a perfect time to try to define it. Okay, so great. This is very helpful. Let me define here. Before I go back to that board, definition. Definition. So H is full, and actually, now that we're varying peripheral structures, we should specify that H is full with respect to P when I look at the intersection of H with P, with any peripheral. With P, with any peripheral subgroup in my collection, the intersection is either finite or finite index full, and so I didn't attribute this. I guess if I'm calling it main theorem, then you'd Main theorem, then you'd guess that I should probably write at least the letters for each author. But I should keep going. Let's do all these colors. So this is the same Einstein and grows. And they prove A very related result where they ask also that they add the extra condition that every P in P is one-ended. Our main contribution is that we were able to remove this extra hypothesis. That's what we can deal with. That's what that we can we can deal with multi-acted groups, peripherals. Good. Uh okay. It kind of came up yesterday. It kind of came up yesterday in Murphy Kate's talk about why would you want to use a boundary criteria for cubulation other than it's great? And I told you that it's great. You should always use this to cubulate things. The main thing for me is that, maybe let me try to describe an example that maybe, again, let's think of a free product, but we know a little bit more that each of the factor groups. That each of the factor groups acts on a space on some other space. And maybe those are nice. Perhaps, for example, you might add in colors that we might want these to be viewed complexes, for example. Okay, but in general, not. So, first of all, let's call this G. And so you have a perfectly good relative. Good relative cubulation coming from the action on the backsaire tree. Okay? And so, what does that do? Is that already could be, for this example, I could add in an edge group, why not? And so here, right, we have the edge groups are codimension one. The edge separates the tree so that. The the edge separates the tree so that the tree's not so hard to see. Um oh, I probably need C to be quasi-convex. Um let me just make my life easier and make the edge group trivial again, just for simplicity. There's ways to rescue that. Okay, so that's fine, right? So that's one source of codiment on subgroups, but perhaps you'd rather, we also have a second action of the group, but the group will act on the tree. group, the group will act on the tree of spaces or replace each tree of spaces, or replace each vertex with the corresponding space for the vertex stabilizer. Okay, so now what happens is maybe when I look at this larger space, we can also see ways that say the vertex groups are being cut up. So in this example, say you have the hyperplanes in XA, that's a cat-to-cube complex. That's a cat's OQ complex. That is a new, maybe these groups here could provide new sources of codimension on subgroups. And so to me, the real benefit of using a boundary criteria is that you're able to accumulate things using multiple actions of your group. Find different actions that are seeing different sorts of fineness. Sort of fineness of your action, and whichever one is appropriate, then try to use that to add things to this collection. This is just any collection. You take any collection, and you can refine that to a finite collection. And so it avoids trying to have one space where you build all of your walls in one space. So this is sort of like the warm-up case. You can then, this sort of framework is actually quite general. Yesterday, Porphyca was describing that you could think of, say, G having some complex of groups decomposition, where instead of acting on the tree, you act on the development of the complex of groups. And then there's this, there's a lovely And then there's this, there's a there's a lovely global construction that sort of comes, is, like I said, it's, to me, it's the analog of a tree of spaces, but like a complex of spaces that Alexander and then also in joint work with Marcus Steenbach developed that is sort of the starting point for, oh, maybe just let's write it, why not? Let's let's write it. Why not? Yeah. Another example is that G is the fundamental group of some complex of groups. Then you can get G's acting on, I'll write the development of C, and then you can blow up this space in certain situations to A larger space. And this is sort of the setup that we're using in the random quotients project to show that random quotients of free products are relatively key. Actually, so we like. What are some situations that we okay? Yeah, so I mean it looks like. I'm just gonna say something else. I mean, look like if g is, say, the quotient of a free product, right? And so if this quotient satisfies, say, C prime one sixth, Or random, then we can sort of run this. But you have some kind of criterion in terms of all the groups. I don't, Alex, but I. And so, yeah. Good. Okay. So, right, what's the difficulty? How do we go about trying to prove the main theorem? Um yes, maybe uh um like the goal is that you want to start with a relatively hyperbolic pair, and then you want to um build this kind of a relatively geometric action. And so to begin with, so maybe I'll move here. ideas of the proof are that right first first we start with this the same setup and what's what's great is that the votage boundary is compact and so then you can sort of run a finiteness argument which is exactly the same argument that's used in Bergelon and Wise and from that that already And from that, that already produces for you a finite collection of subgroups where we wanted to separate every single pair of points in the Bodish boundary. And so the compactness argument says, well, you didn't need whatever collection you started with, but you picked finite collection to start with. And then the translates of that will do the trick. And so at that stage, just from the compactness argument, you already have an action of your group on that cats or Q cover x. On that cats are Q complex. So G is now acting on that, the complex dual to those subgroups. And so the work comes in here where now we want to say that that action is actually nice. And so that we want it to satisfy these three conditions. I'll remember them. And right, it's it's amazingly not so obvious to prove any of them, to me at least. At first I looked at this and I thought, well, it's certainly going to be true. Like, how do you show that the action is co-compact? So the naive thing that's wrong is to say, oh, well, I have finitely many. Is to say, oh, well, I have finitely many orbits of hyperplanes, and so the finitely many hyperplanes feels very compact. That doesn't work at all. You could over-accubulate, so you should think about, you should be worried about accubulating the plane with too many families there. That is not co-compact. So one needs to do work. And so And so and I guess to me, this condition here, too, is sort of, is quite nice. We should be trying to prove that, right? In terms of like, there's been a few talks trying to talk about finding elliptic subgroups. When your peripherals are elliptic, that's excellent. So. So Einstein and Gross proved a proposition which is sort of building on our results of Huskman-Wise, where I guess theirs is a relatively geometric version. If I have, oh, okay. Yeah, if. I have, oh, okay. Yeah, if GQ acts on X and every Q in Q is elliptic, then the action of G on X is code on that. So that gives that, so the goal is then to have. So, the goal is then to how do you find two? And two will give one. And so, I guess the idea is that we want to now use the finite intersections of P, right, so if P was not elliptic, you can now split it along the intersections with hyperplanes. And you can try to get your subgroups Q. And if you were Ted here, if we were thinking about that and said, If we were thinking about that and said, oh, okay, great, we can cite Danmodi, but actually can't. We have to get into a bit more technical details about how the peripherals are actually splitting the peripheral. Anyways, thanks for your time. Questions? Questions? Quick question. Do you know of any criteria for a group pair to not be relatively cubulated? Not be relatively cubulated. I guess for just regular cubulation, you have like a t is that's a problem t, but it's not. That's why the personal subjects could be like non-triviality. Yeah. Right, right. Yeah, right, right. So, okay, I didn't, okay. So here's the answer to your question. That's a relative cubulation group. So the question I put up, the obnoxious question I put up, every group is relatively cupulation. It's not telling you much about the thing. So can I just see if I understand what's happening in this queue? What's happening with this Q. So you find this H from the compact side, H0 from the compacter side. And now you might get P, you cubulate your P's with respect to that. Because they were full, they can only cut the P's in finite subgroups and bound them. Correct. So now you've got some cubulation for P with compact walls. Right. And now you somehow find a peripheral structure from that, from the component subversion. Right. So you can now look at the walls that cut P. Now, look at the walls that cut P. Okay, so you can use that to, like, this is exactly what you're saying. Use this to build some new complex, which is dual to this subcollection. And then now you use this action to say this is quite a nice action. You can actually get that P is, now that this cube complex that we get, in fact, has one skeleton, which is a fine-technopolic graph. Skeleton, which is a fine hyperbolic graph, so that witnesses relative hyperbolicity of P. And that then the vertex stabilizers here are precisely the cues that we need to use to refine the difference, right? I want to follow up on Chris's question. Are there groups whose only relative accumulation? Well, if the whole group has property T Then, right, we're looking at an action on a ball-cube complex. Then we want that every elliptic subgroup should be conjugate to the fact. So that would be right. So this would be within groups that you can have sort of relative property T. Sorry, if your peripherals are the only things that have property T, then you can still sort of rescue those those groups. But if your whole group has property, you're kind of still in trouble. Is there a relative version of the property too? There are a relative version of the properties. No, I shouldn't have said that. I don't know. So entirely as the expert, but I think the answer is yes, but it doesn't mean what you might hope it does here, it means something else. Yeah, but I think it's a good question. I think everyone we should be trying to find more examples of relative etiquette. Weirder and weirder actions on key components. Okay, well I was thinking. Okay, well let's thank Tommy's money.
