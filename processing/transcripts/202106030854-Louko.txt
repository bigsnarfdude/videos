Okay, so I'll try to do the desktop. Perfect. I can see okay. So I'm seeing all of you on the bound on one side of my screen. Is that a problem for you? Is that a problem for you? No, we don't see each other. We just see your full screen and just yourself. Very good. Perfect. So the next speaker is Giorma Ruku, and he will talk about thermality of circular motion. Please, Joma. Thank you very much. Thank you for the organizers for putting together this program in these challenging times and for giving me the opportunity to contribute. So, this is a talk. So, this is a talk about relativistic quantum field theory. This basic observation that if you experience some sort of acceleration, then there's a certain kind of temperature associated with it. And specifically today, I want to talk about circular motion in the analog space-time paradigm, analog space-time setting where you model relativistic space-time phenomena. Space-time phenomena in a condensed matter system in the laboratory. So, this is work that was done by a fairly large collaboration put together by Silke Weinfurtner in Nottingham. And there are approximately seven authors, and here's the reference, involving both theorists and experimentalists. So, I'll be talking about the theory side, but there's the experimental side. But there's the experimental side very close under the surface. And tomorrow, Silke Weinfurtner will be able to tell more about the experimental side of things. So this is quantum field theory. Now, I do have here the code words, the keywords of the meeting. So how does the topic fit with these keywords? Quantum, certainly. Foundations, well. Foundations. Well, we are pushing the boundaries of the subject, but we are pushing it within the established formalism. We are not pushing the formalism as such. Gravity, we are working in a relativistic space-time. For today's talk, that space-time will be flat, but if you happen to get a curved laboratory system, most of these things will generalize in a straightforward way. Finally, cause. Finally, causal order. This is a bit of an embarrassment. There is a causal order issue in today's story, but we want to steer well clear of it. In fact, I will not even mention it. If you want to challenge, you may enjoy thinking what is the causal order issue that I will be suppressing for the next 25 minutes. Plan. Plan. So, first, I'll recall a few things about the acceleration effect in relativistic field theory, both in the usual relativistic space-time setting and then in the analog space-time setting that is my point of interest here. Then there's a technical part. So, what is the formalism within which I want to address this? And solid state people know the code word as quantum dot. Know the code word as quantum dot and relativity-oriented people know the code word as the unruh-weight detector. We've had talks about that. So, this is the technical background part of the talk. Then a few things about the circular motion. So, what is special about circular motion? And a particular point here is that I want to do things in a way that's working both in our whole space-time dimension and one dimension lower. The reason being that the The reason being that the systems you want to build in the laboratory, it's easier to build a system with two spatial dimensions in the laboratory, water surface or surface of some sort. And with all of that, I'll show some results. And so a key point is how well is this linear motion prediction that we know for 45 years or something? How good is that linear motion prediction? That linear motion prediction when you want to address a circular motion. Is this ratio close to one? Is it far from one? If so, and so on. So that's the plan of the talk. And I understand the format does not really allow taking questions in the middle of things. So if I don't hear objections, I'll just plunge along. So, this acceleration effect, UNRWA effect of following day, this UNRWA effect is from 40 years old, well-established part of standard relativistic quantum field theory. And its basic form says if you're in uniform linearly accelerated motion, then you're a localized quantum system. You see the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state, in a sense, and the temperature. State, in a sense, and the temperature is associated with is proportional to the acceleration. There are standard caveats in getting this formula, like usually discussed weak coupling limit, long time limit, and so on. But for today, I'm not going there. But I want to emphasize that this is very concretely observable effect. So you observe or you can observe the difference. Difference between excitations upwards rate and excitations downwards and de-excitations rate, and that is related to the gap of your states. And there's the temperature. So the picture I have in mind is that I've got a spaceship, and then on the shelf, I've got a jar of antimony atoms and beryllium atoms and something. And once in a while, I look in each jar and I is what fraction is accelerated? What fraction of these atoms is excited in each char? So, this is a measurable effect. You can say it's so measurable that you can cook a steak with it. To date, no steaks have been cooked. When you put in the numbers, there are constants of nature there that say to get one Kelvin units and ridiculously large accelerations. So, no experimental verification in this relativistic form yet. Relativistic form yet. So I want to think of circular motion. Why? Well, one obvious advantage is that if you want to do something in a lab with linear motion, you will run out of lab space shortly. But if you're in circular motion, you can keep accelerating in principle for an arbitrarily long time. And there has been work that goes back decades. Bill and Lane also talked about acceleration. Leyen also talked about accelerator storage rings and spin polarization effects there and how that how this uh how this uh unroll effect might show up there. There are some limitations of what measurement you can do, but it's okay, that's a subject for another talk. For today, I want to think about analog space-time, so some some system that you can build on a desktop in a condensed matter system, maybe both Einstein condensate, maybe superfluid helium. Maybe superfluid helium or something of that sort. And Silke Van Fortner can tell more about that on Friday. Today, so I want to ask the sense of temperature. If you are in circular motion, what is the sense of temperature that you would like, you would hope to observe in your system? This topic, even in circular motion, has been around for decades. Circular motion has been around for decades. So, why now? There's a concrete experimental proposal by the same group of people in another recent paper proposing how you could use a certain laser light arrangement to observe these things in the laboratory. This figure is just cut and pasted from the paper, and I'm not going to talk about the details of the proposal, but it relies on two. But it relies on two fundamental advantages of circular motion. One is this finite size advantage that I already mentioned. The second thing is that in a relativistic space-time, you have time dilation. In an analog space-time in your lab, you might have a relativistic-looking field equation, but you certainly don't have time dilation. And time dilation is an essential part of the usual UNRO effect. So, how do you want, how can you model time dilation? How do you want? How can you model time dilation in a laboratory system? With circular motion, this is a piece of cake. There are gamma factors there, but those gamma factors are constant in time. Putting in the gamma factors are something that enters only at the level of data analysis. You don't need to do those gamma factors at the engineering level. It's a data analysis level. Okay, so there is this recent motivation. And motivation. Today, well, I won't be talking about this laser system. I'll be thinking in the usual setting of a quantum dot. I'm envisaging that there is some localized quantum system that I move around in the BEC or COVID felon, and it has some internal energy states. So that's the mathematical formalism that I want to use in the usual weak coupling, etc., assumptions. And I want to. Assumptions. And I want to focus on the differences between a relativistic space-time and analog space-time. How close is the analog space-time really to a relativistic space-time? And I want to focus on the distinction between 2 plus 1 and 3 plus 1. So that's for today, but not today is the translation of this quantum drug business to the actual experiment. Technical background. So, two overheads of this, what a quantum dot really does. This is well familiar to many of us, and we've heard other talks that use the same formalism, but let me show two overheads above this anyway. So we have some sort of localized two-state system, point-like, moving on a specified world line with two energy states. You could have a harmonic oscillator, you could have more states. Many corsilator, you could have more states. It doesn't make a difference for what I have today, but let's think of it as a two-stage system in the Minkowski space in a strong space-time dimension. And the quantum field I think of is a real scalar field. It's a pretty good approximation to Bose-Einstein condensate in the phononic regime and so on. And so, this is a system of interest. Coupling, you can think of this as a Pohman versions of the dipole coupling with which. Dipole coupling with which atomic orbitals coupled to the electromagnetic field. The crucial point is that it's a point-like thing, coupled at the space-time point to the field. There, there's some structure that has to do with the atomic orbitals that you mean. There's some story about a coupling constant in which you do perturbation theory. There's some switching story and so on. It's linear, it's point-like. And then you think. And then you think of the experiment where you start with your jar of atoms all in the ground state, then you accelerate for a while, then you look in the jar again and you ask how many of your atoms are now in the excited state. And you don't ask what's happened to the quantum field that's present in your space-time. You just look in the jar. And so there's a standard calculation. There are some prefectors. There are some pre-factors, but all the interesting things, your things about your quantum state and the trajectory get encoded in this response function, which is a double Fourier transform of the Weitman function, the two-point correlator of the field. And it's a distribution, so there are issues of can you really measure a space-time field with a space-time point? And this formalism is, in a sense, on a knife's edge. Is in a sense on a knife's edge, but it's really okay, it's just on the right side of the knife's edge. There are some I epsilons here, but nothing is hidden in the I epsilons. There are no no divergences that you need to deal with. It's mathematically well defined. We want to be in a stationary system, so circular motion, stationary circular motion, and then we want to pass to the long time limit. And how you do that is a talk in its own right, but you can do it. But you can do it. And then the characteristic, the way you characterize temperature is this detailed balance condition. You think of the ratio of upward versus downward transitions, and you use this formula to get the temperature, because that's what you do for conventional thermal states, genuine GMS, Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states, if you like. And this is the formula that for the well-known linear acceleration case produces for you the Produces for you the unruly temperature formula. So, linear acceleration, that's the temperature. For circular acceleration and for other uniform motions, well, so I am going to use this formula. There's some fine print in that it's no longer a genuine KMS state. This temperature also depends on the energy gap and other parameters, but this is the notion of temperature I'm using. And I want to ask how close is this temperature to the To us, how close is this temperature to the linear motion, linear acceleration prediction? So that's the technical background. So for the moment, I'll put in stationary, I'll put into space-time, output in stationary motion, output in the vacuum state, circular motion. We know how to write down the circular motion, okay? And we even know how to do it in a relativistic space. And there are some gamma factors that go in, and there are the gamma factors. In and there are the gamma factors put in the right places. I need the Whitman function, so the two-point correlation function on this circular world line. And I even know what that is. And here we start to see that things depend on the space-time dimension in which you are working. In our home dimension, it's one over delta x squared. In other dimensions, it's a different power of one over delta x squared. In particular, in two plus one, there's a squared. In particular, in 2 plus 1, there's a square root involved. Yeah? Okay, so something will need to be done about the square root. And yeah, and now I've got all the pieces of background together. I want to ask, given this trajectory, I can go and work out what the circular acceleration temperature is, worked out from this uniform, from this detailed Balas formula. And I want to ask. Formula and I want to ask how close is it to this linear motion prediction given that you compare them at the same proper acceleration. So, first in relativistic space-time, then in analog space-time. And I'm almost ready to start showing results. But, okay, on this overhead, let me make one comment, final comment before we go to the results. So, I have these different powers. Results. So I have these different powers of delta x squared, and I have here a fractional power in two plus one dimensions. And this has the funny feature that in two plus one, this Weigman function is actually imaginary for time-like separations. Now, the quantum dot doesn't worry about this. The quantum dot is, in a sense, a Hermitian operator in the right sense. So if there are some imaginary things above the dot Imaginary things above the diagonal, they are balanced by imaginary things with the other sign below the diagonal. This is all hermitian in the right sense. Imaginary things are not a problem as their own, right? But they will have some issues when you want to think about the experimental setup in a laboratory. And I'll comment on that at the very end if I have time. So let's store that thought here. And with that, I'm ready to look at the results. Okay. Right. So, some of us remember who were Torville and Dean, specifically in Canada. And this is a good moment to remember that Torville and Dean came from Nottingham. In fact, in the tram system here in Nottingham, we have one tram car that's called Torville and Dean. So with that inspiration, I'll first do the artistic. First, do the artistic impression and then do a little bit about the technical merits. So, I want to show a picture. So, in relativistic space-time, what is plotted is this ratio of the actual circular acceleration temperature divided by the linear acceleration prediction. Okay, the ratio, and it's on the vertical axis in three plus one dimensions, two plus one dimension. One dimensions, two plus one dimensions. On the horizontal axis, I have the velocity, okay, the orbital velocity, and then I need to have the energy gap. And I'll normalize the energy gap to the relativistic acceleration. We know that for linear acceleration, that's the sensible quantity to use. So I'll use that for circular acceleration, too. And here are the two plots. So, ladies and gentlemen, what's the What's the immediate observation? Well, if the circular motion temperature was the same as the linear motion prediction, you should be getting a flat plane at one. You're not getting a flat plane at one. So it's not quite the same. How different is it? You see that there's something different over there. Let me make those two plots smaller and then start fishing. Plots smaller and then start fishing out the differences. So there are those two plots smaller. So, how different are we here from one? There's one obvious regime where there is a difference. Here, if you go to small gaps, well, we're sort of still within one, but here in view are in two plus one dimensions. If you go to small gaps, something rather different happens. So, the basic story is the only place where two plus one differs significantly. place where two plus one differs significantly from three plus one is if you go to small gap everywhere else the ratio is more or less one and you can put some more quantitative detail of what that more or less one means and in the paper we have various analytic limits and the moral of the story is it's really more or less one except if you're in two plus one and you go to very small gap energies then the temperature is much smaller than you'd expect Much smaller than you would expect. And you can consider several limits here. And yeah. But more or less, it's one unless you're at a small gap. So that's the relativistic space-time. Analog space-time. So now I need to put the right gamma factors in the right places. I want to do similar plots to these. So I want to plot the laboratory circular motion. Laboratory circular motion temperature divided by the linear motion laboratory prediction. So for me, these hats mean they are the non-relativistic ones. And this index lab here means it's the lab system and R means its ratio. When I first did the version of this plot, I called this laboratory ratio. I called it T lab RET, but then I Rat, but then I thought I'm never going to get past my experimentalist co-authors. So it's R as in ratio measured in lab. So that's the quantity I'm plotting. 20 minutes. Thank you. Very good. So that's the quantity I'm plotting. And if we still remember the plots from the previous page, they look quite similar. So this is now Lebert quantum. So, this is now Labette quantities, okay? And when I mean velocity here, it's velocity in units of speed of sound in your relevant system. So the goes up to 0.95 and so on. They are really quite similar. So just from the plot, it looks like the main difference is again at small gap. If you go to the 2 plus 1 dimension case and in And in the paper, we looked at various limits analytically. Now, in 2 plus 1 lab, the system that I'm really interested in, there is another regime where something interesting happens. And my plotting here goes in velocity to 0.95 V, V 0.95. And that's where my numerics became unstable. Now, if you look at this. Now, if you look at this graph, it looks like you just might be standing at the edge of a cliff. And you do. If you compare, if you continue this all the way to v equals one, it does go to zero fairly slowly. It only goes to zero like one over log gamma, where gamma is this gamma factor, but it does go to zero. So in two plus one dimensions, So, in two plus one dimensions, there is a significantly lower temperature at small energy gaps, and if you push very close to the sonic limit. Those are the two regimes where you need to be careful with the comparison. Over most of the parameter space, the linear motion prediction is okay. And with that, I'm at the end of the day. I'm at the end of the oh, right, right. So, suppressed in this Niasonic limit in 2 plus 1. And with that, I'm at the end of the story. So, I was looking at the circular motion unrule temperature for a quantum dot in relativistic and analog setting. Temperature as characterized by the detailed balance condition. And the outcomes is: if you're in three plus one dimensions, it's basically. Three plus one dimensions is basically of the same order, some quantitative differences, or it's basically the same. Whether you are relativistic, same as in linear motion, whether you are relativistic or analog in two plus one dimensions, which we think the best laboratory bet is, well, then it's almost one for most of the parameter regime, but there are two regimes where you need to worry about, where the effect is smaller than you might have thought. Effect is smaller than you might have thought. Right, so there's lots of stuff I've neglected here. Like if you're in a BEC, you can never put it to strictly zero temperature. There's some ambient temperature. And you can't make a BEC of infinitely large size. And it has a desktop system, small desktops. And these are things that one should look into, and work is in progress. But last time I checked, you can't really buy a quantum dot from a standard online store. And the best experimental prospect is this experimental scenario using laser light and that I mentioned. Now, talking about that is a subject for a different talk, but the connection there needs to be made. There is some work to that effect, but one aspect, one significant aspect in making that connection is In making that connection is this fun fact that in two plus one dimensions, these time-time correlations are purely imaginary. They are anti-symmetric and purely imaginary. And if you pick up a standard quantum optics textbook and you look up what does a photo detector measure, the textbook tells you the photo detector measures the symmetrized time-time correlation. Time-time correlation. With this Weitman function, the symmetrized time-time correlation is zero. So that's some part of the story here that needs to be worked out and work there is in progress. And I hope to be able to report about that work on some future occasion. Thank you very much. I'll stop here. Thank you very much, Orma. Thank you very much, Jorma. Very nice talk. And let's open the ground for questions. I still don't see any raised hand, so I have one question. And then I will give the word to Ian. My question is the following, Yarma. Maybe it's a silly question or a curiosity. Is this imaginary character or the white map function in two plus one somehow related to the Augens principle or the fact that the Augens principle is violated? Eugene principle is violated that the scalar field propagates inside of the light coin. Yeah, it's part of the same story. I mean, if I look at those formulas for the Weitman function, so in four dimensions, I've got delta x squared. In any even dimension, four or higher, I have delta x squared to an integer power. But if I'm in an odd space, If I'm in an odd space-time dimension, I have delta x squared to a fractional power. So, this it is part of that same story. Okay, thank you. And we have a question from Ian. Hi, Jarno. Jarno, thanks for the talk. I'm sorry, but I couldn't help but ask about what the thing to do with causal order was that you mentioned and didn't want to mention again. To mention again, well, I was expecting that question from Rob Mann, but you beat Rob to it. Okay, so let's look at this diagram here. So the effect is strongest when you are close to the sonic limit. If you are in a relativistic space-time, you can't go. Space-time, you can't go beyond the ultra-relativistic limit because you can't push a dot faster than the speed of light. You don't have enough energy to do that. But if you have a quantum dot in a BEC, there's nothing stopping you from pushing it faster than the speed of sound there. So, on the one hand, you would like to be as close to the sonic. As close to the sonic limit as you can, because there the effect is the largest. But you'd still like to be below that limit so that you know how to map your phenomena to the relativistic space-time. And the question there is, how well can you control the speed of sound in a Bose-Einstein condensate? And experimentalists tell me if you are very good, you can control it to about 1%. But not better than that. So if you are at 0.99, so what is the gamma factor at 0.99? So 5 or something. So the gamma factor, it's not 50, it's not 100, it's some number that's still of order unity. So you'd like to stay there below the sonic limit. If you go above the sonic limit, then the Then the microphone just breaks down and you don't want to go there. Great, thanks. Okay, perfect. If there are no other questions, and at the moment I don't see any other question, but in any case, there will be the discussion section. Ah, no, wait, wait, wait. Okay, now we have a question from Anupa. Please go on. Very nice talk. I really enjoyed it, Jorma. Very nice talk. I really enjoyed it, Jorma. So, I wanted to understand what was the purpose of looking into white men function. Ah, right. So there's this, so there's this technical background bit. You are looking at this two-state quantum dot that you move around. And then the question you're asking, what is the probability for your quantum dot to make a transition, maybe an upwards transition, maybe a downwards transition, but what is that probability? Downwards transition, but what is the probability? And there's a calculation for that time-dependent perturbation theory, and so on. And the outcome of that calculation is this line over here. And the calculation tells us the interesting things are in this response function, and that is where the Weitman function enters. Okay, I would say that we thank again Yarma for the nice talk. And right now we have the break. I would say that
