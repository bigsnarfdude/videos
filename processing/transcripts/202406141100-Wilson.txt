So our next speaker is Bobby Wilson from the University of Washington. And Bobby's going to be talking just about distance problems for polyhedral remarks. Bobby, it's an honor to introduce yourself. We're important. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot for everyone for coming, for saying. And thanks for the organizers for having me. This has been a great week. I think before I start on a talk and maybe ruin the vibes too much, I think you should probably thank the organizers. Thank the organizers for bringing such a great group of people together and organizing such a great workshop. So, thanks, Alexia, A.V., Crystal, and Ben, Berlin. Um, so what I want to talk about today is joint work with um Mike Bushman on this evening and Igor Balto, who is doing And I want to talk about distance sets problems for polyhedral doors as I said. The motivated question start with something easy consider the L infinity model of R2. So the L infinite R2. Obviously, question, what is the question? What can you say? About the distance set with respect to this albumin. Okay, and so why I asked about this is it's a much easier thing to deal with than one. So I guess I was, I felt like I wanted to gain some information about the distance like condition. Gain some information about the distance like conjecture that I didn't have before. And so, in particular, you know, the first observation should make a very easy one, this one, at least, is that if you take the distance set, it should be containing the distance set on the projection. So now everything's very nice. It's the question why was I gonna conjecture this? Okay, so what can we say? So for one, the Falkmaner's distance at conjecture doesn't hold in this case. So there exists E, and let's maybe try to write it in general dimensions with With the value pressure. Okay, so um so Um so a few people have have proven this in different settings, I suppose. Uh I think the first that I can I can that I know of is convergent whole squared when your norm is not L infinity, but it's uh ignorant normal. So d equals two it's polygonal. With algebraic angles. It's one of many corollary things. So the paper is discrete because it says you can have this one. Cause I'll tell you the word. Um polyhedrons for this construction, this construction, the full dimensional set, but that's and then uh more recently, Bishop Drillick. I'll look for course one. Again, general B luxury norm. I'll write it this way, it's just well approximated by all the each of our it's not this is not how I basically stayed, but um this is how I understand it at least. So This is how I actually had it at least. So if I'm missing some cases of this, then I apologize. Okay, again, you can construct the same type of example. Alright, in this case, actually, there are some strictly convex norms that you can find. Five or there are strict complex norms that fall into into this umbrella. Okay, so same strict compact in this case. Okay, um so let's get a sense of why I'm getting efficient. And this is just an example from Kaufmann's notebook in 1985. And B, you're constructing something in R2. And in fact, okay, this is not important. And what do you do? So consider A1. A1 A2 plus sort of ten where they have their disjoint decomposition, C plus of the density of these guys. Then I'm just going to define E is a value to be where let's see maybe infer the binary expansion. Let's call it X of N, let's call it X of K. Uh, uh, is equal to zero of n using a sub so just a nice fact, not that nice, but can't just say it. All right, cool. Um and then of course, let's say E and this is just a it's right in the It's very equal. So it's something very plastic. Alright, um, and so then, of course, um, we add a sensitious map. So it takes E so then now the dimension Hausdorff dimension is variable to the Hausdorff dimension again. House organization. One, of course, the housewife will mention, and of course, there are kinetic distance size for the signs also is just a translation. So, yeah, so we have this example. Of course, I didn't construct something two-dimensional with zero. Construct something two-dimensional with zero Lebesgue, it constructs something one-dimensional with zero-dimensional pin distance sides. Okay, so what can you say in general? So Three plus oh, I write it as a two-part here. Or any more information say uh R D plus R. Call star element dimension of the pin distance with respect to, and maybe I should write it this way, upper x and lower star, something like this, of two dimension of d minus one d. Sorry, E, okay. Um, for for E and then for any polycontrol form space. So you just take a uh spanning set and then you define the norm of the signal. The norm, like the same thing, just take the max of the dot products. The morning space exposed public control like that. And you take an S between B minus one and D, there exists that E. Set E such that the host or dimension is equal to S and the half store dimension of distance for all X in E. Yeah. Uh so I was just having a conversation with with Brian about this. And we had a conversation about this before. Uh the way he proved this, okay, the way it's written is for some X. The way it's proven, you can see that it's for generic X and question about whether that's even necessary or maybe it was just an artifact of how we proved the statement. An artifact of how we proved the statement? I don't know the answer to that question. But yeah, thank you. So, probably, I'll say probably generically as well. So, okay, it's good that I have this work here. So, what can you say, right? Like, fix an S between B minus 1 and D, right? You can ask yourself, okay, can we generalize this type of argument, right? And the obvious thing maybe is to say, okay, well, you defined A1 and A2 in this fashion. You have the limit of 0. Set this to be like delta or S minus T minus 1. Maybe you don't have a disjoint combination anymore, but it has to overlap. Have some type of overlap. Go through this argument again. We'll probably be able to convince yourself that the dimension, the household dimension of each of the projections is going to be delta at that point. And I think this is not controversial. I said, if I can say this, then this dimension has to be basically equal to this limit. Then the question comes, how do you estimate the dimension of E? dimension of E. This argument here with this Lipschitz projection or Lipschitz image can get you one at most. Did I say it's zero? One. Why did I say it's zero? Sorry. Okay. Yeah, so this is going to get you almost one, right? So we need some way to estimate below this dimension of E. And so we need to probably We should probably figure out some way to do a nice covering or something with this, most likely. But what we used was something that was introduced to us by Matt Mariana called complexity or effective methods. And so, and I guess the main thing that I wanted to emphasize is that what I hope to show is that what's the effect. What I hope to show is that with the effective method, I can turn a lower bound for this construct dimension. I can reduce it to some type of computation, some type of computation. So I'll give some definitions, but they won't be correct. They'll be kind of approximations of the definitions of the pieces of the complexity. And I hope, I suppose, the two people who understand this a little bit more, at least two people. This is a little bit more, at least two people who understand this a little bit more, Mariana and Ryan. They won't be too mad at me my very hackish definitions. But I hope that just a very simple thing. You can at least understand exactly how it works. Okay, so X V so this is four. Let's call it, I don't know, let's say that we see some A and Z, but then maybe the first part of which many data I'm not so happy. It's usually an R, but I don't like that. So we're going to say N, and then we're going to say K, so N X is going to be the number of bits of A. Is any necessary to encode the inf binary or the binary extension? Of x to precision 2 to the x. Probably not a very good definition, generally speaking, but I think for our purposes for this thought, it should be okay. Okay, so what does this mean? So if you take a string. Elements in the binary detention of X. Of course, it has D of them. Now I was string, excuse me. And it's very random in some sense. It doesn't have any patterns. It should be maximally hard to encode it. So it should require a string in numbers, say, in numbers 0 or 1. 0 or 1. And if it has no patterns, then it should take like in bits to encode that script, generally speaking. But if you have many patterns, then you should be able to compress this. And as we've been learning with a lot of linear studies, whether or not something has patterns depends on a frame of reference. And so it's necessary when you're trying to understand the complexity of a point to have some kind of frame of reference. So you define, and part of doing that is defining a portal. And the only thing I'll say about this is that it helps to understand the frame of reference, or to set a frame of reference, from which to understand how complex a vector is or a point is. Okay. So given this, you can define, I think I have enough, yes. Okay, and then you can define your A on x complexity with respect to the mm. And now you have the notion of, let's say, effective emotion. We'll call it D. So D is E is going to be equal to C. No, sorry, I've already made a mistake. The minimum overall or equals A. Oh, I've made others. No, hang on. Okay, no, okay. Okay, x n going to infinity a in x okay. So um So there have been a few people who've been applying or using comical complexity and just area GT for a little bit now. First, both of these roots and loots field 18 and in particular mission. And then you can use some methods developed by Goots and Stole over the last few years and you can And you can more or less construct the guy that you want it and reduce essentially the computation of the dimension of the. So let's say, let's, I guess, rewrite what we had before. Let's say we've got A1 delta, A2, delta. Plus and you have to arrange them in some sense, but you have the limitation of T of A delta T and L I in delta Delta, you define E1 and E2 way. You define E the same way. And I didn't say exactly how A1 and A2 are arranged, but you can arrange them so they overlap well enough to be able to say that this now implies that your dimension is a little bit of time, but um So I've lesson things of the construction, but I guess I promise that you can arrange them in this fashion. And this type of computation or the computation of complexity will basically amount to a computation of the body complexity of these A1, A2 at every scale. Okay, cool. Um, so and uh, I just want to speak about a couple things that have come up since. I wrote this paper, just a couple questions. Talk about it briefly. Um, question. Oh, what about packing dimension or what about some type of S today in terms of packing, let's say? Okay, so but why? Well, you have from But but why? Well, you have from this a a similar characterization of packing dimension with respect to complexity. I like that packing dimension of E ought to be the same thing. Minimal or reference means summary at E, then assumed suit now as that goes to infinity, okay in A, X, or A. Okay. And so now that we have a little suit thing. And so now that we have a little sweep thing, I'm a little bit more than the example that we did before. I kind of got that one go, of course. So in some sense, the sharp examples will necessitate some type of symmetry, at least if you're looking at the elementary case, in terms of two axes, I suppose. But since it's a question that we're thinking about at the moment. And then there was a question of. What about the hump restriction? So, suppose you have a warm space in which you can find examples where Find examples where, or generic examples, which you have very few distances, is that in the product that you have to be following? So this is the question is coming from this work of Joseph Chwalo. And again, in the discrete case. An example of what they show is another norm. This other norm, and you say you have some set in R2, it's a discrete set in this log screen. Okay, so it's like C2, more or less. And let's say, and this is one of the examples of the statements to have. I say that the something like this. Let's say this is one I want to repeat. If this is true, then um then it's limited all. Liminol with final nicotine. The reason I mentioned this is that I just want to spend one minute talking about this, the argument, because I think, you know, if we ever actually formulate exactly what the conversion should be and figure it out, one of the main or probably the main geometric observation will be basically this one. Observation will be busy for this one. And I really like the argument as well, so I find excuse about it. It's very, very nice. And I want to do the moboralogy. I'll just draw the picture. It's simple. Since you have a logistic percent, you can always find these two points, or you can always take two points that make any type of direction, columns of whatever aperture you want. And you're well attributed. There are many points inside the intercept. But you're a few distances. So there are a few annuli that these points all into. So there must be, by figuring all principle, one pair of annuli that has many points. And in fact, you want to need three. And because you're convex, this implies that you have to have. Convex, this implies that you have to have a line segment on your norm in this direction. Make sense. Okay, that's all I've said. Question for the speaker? Thank you. Um so kind of understand that I don't I don't know what Oracle does, so that's probably. Oracle dark, so that's probably the definition seems like on the local buttons, like point flies. And so, if that's supposed to agree with Hausdorff Dimension, is it like the oracle that introduces some like relationship with point and neighborhood or other points to the city? It seems like the definition was for point had some complexity. Yes, yeah, each point had some complexity, so it seems like this is uh maybe possibly very uh stable in some sense, this is newer. In some sense, it's a similar sign? If a point has some complexity, then, well, the house structure mentioned the point should be zero. Oh, yeah, okay, sure. In essence, right? Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I suppose you're, what you're doing, and the Oracle does come into play here, but I suppose there should be some points, if you have a large enough set, there should be some points that have very, very, very, must be very complex. Must be very complex in some points. So you could have some points in which you have very low complexity, like just zero or something like this, depending on what oracle you're taking. Maybe zero is a very low complex vector. But if your set is big enough, then it has many, many points. And it has to have many points that have high complexity if it's big enough in some sense. Like the definition of complexity is in relation to the. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. Dependent point if you're framework optimal somehow and optimal heavy so hi, I think we have time for maybe one more quick question. We have to cut it somewhat short since people are traveling. Can you defend the box dimensions? Uh I believe oh, I think you need to take so, but I don't remember how to do it. Brian, give it a thumbs up. Ryan, give it a thumbs up. Give it a thumbs up for my not answer. Okay, I think we should end questions here and thank Bobby again. That concludes our final session. So, I think it's a good question.  That was also a little more toxic, but pointed out. But we mentioned that. I always try to set up a way to share the file. Yes.
