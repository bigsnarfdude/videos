And thank you, of course, to the organizers for inviting me. It's a delight to be here and at this wonderful meeting. So I'm going to be talking about pairs of trans-series fields. And of course, there are many people in the audience who are moderately to very familiar with trans-series, but not everyone is. I'm going to start with a few words on trans-series, a reminder. On trans series, a reminder of a couple of things that Mikhail said on Monday and a couple of other points that I will need that will be relevant later. So, this bold T is going to be the differential field of logarithmic exponential trans series, the one I have in mind constructed by Foundries, McIntyre, and Marker. And it's not, so it's a field of generalized power series in some sense. Power series, in some sense. It's not one of these time fields that Picarro described, but constructed as an intricate union of such things. And so let me just give you a single example element in which we can already see several features of P. So it's a series. I'm writing it from left to right. So this X is some kind of, although this is purely on the Although this is purely on the formal algebraic side, I'm thinking of x as some infinitely large element. So this e to the sum series is much bigger than e to the x squared, which is much bigger than x to the square root of 2, and so on. So it's in decreasing order. We have real powers. We are closed under exponentiation. You can exponentiate series. You have some, the support of your series is well the reverse of it. Is well, the reverse of it is like some countable ordinal. We have logarithms. What else am I saying? It has addition and multiplication in the way that you expect and we have seen already several times, which moreover makes it a real closed field. And for this talk, although it's closed under exponentiation, as an exponential field, it is an elementary extension. It is an elementary extension of the real exponential field, but the exponential function is not present in that language for the model theory. Today, instead, it's equipped with a derivation, and the derivation satisfies some things like the derivation of x is 1, it's compatible with the exponential function and with the ordering in general, so it's not going to be generic in the sense, in some sense, maybe that Anton Julio was talking about. Sense maybe that Anton Julio was talking about, but really it has a lot of compatibility conditions that I'm not going to describe because they don't play much role directly in the results. And the other fact is that by nature of its construction, it's exponentially bounded in the sense that any series is bounded above by some finite iterate of the exponential. So there's nothing really transitive. Trans-exponential in T. Okay. And so it's a differential field. It's a real closed field, so equipped with an ordering. And thank you to Sebastian for the pictures in the morning. I'm going to redraw one of them just so you're clear on what's going on. So we have T here. We have t here, and I will take as blue, so here's zero in the middle, and I have my real numbers. This form some bounded subset, and the convex whole of the real numbers forms a valuation ring. And inside here, around zero, we have It's maximal ideal. These are all the things around zero that are infinitesimal with respect to real numbers. So everything that's smaller than every positive, the absolute value is smaller than every positive real number. And so t as a structure, and moreover, it's completely axiomatized by this theory, though you don't have to remember any of these words for the purpose. Remember any of these words for the purpose of this book. I just mention it so that I can give a name to it, TNL Small, so you know where the N and the L are coming from. And this is one of the main results of the trans series book by Ashton Benner, Frankenstein, and Flanderhoeven. For people who are familiar with valuation theory, the Newtonianity property is whatever the right differential analog of the Huncelianity is in this context. The concealingity is in this context. And I just mentioned the Louvre closed because it includes the condition that t is closed under exponentiation. So you can always find an antiderivative and also exponential integration. So you can always find something like e to the integral of a. So even though I don't have the exponential in the language, kind of speaks into the differential field axiomatization. And I'm not giving you, of course. And I'm not giving you, of course, the full strength of their results. There are various refinements in the book. Maybe you're more interested in model companions and things like this, which you can. It is the model companion of some theory, which I don't want to mention. So just remarks on the language. T is construed always as an ordered differential field here, and with the calligraphic O, I'm expanding it to an ordered value differential field. Ordered value differential field. So I made the choice in these slides always to write valuations because there are later going to be two valuations. And so I want to just hopefully try to keep it clear which valuation is which. Right. What else can I point out? As a differential field, this valuation ring is existentially definable from the border ring because The ordering because I did the differential field structure because it's just the convex hull of the constant hole. Right. And so the point that I want to make on the language, especially if you haven't seen it before, is that this T as a differential field is not model complete without the valuation. And so, for instance, one problem that you might have is maybe in some bigger extension of t, you have some element here that's You have some element here just outside the valuation ring. And if you go to some even bigger field, some extension, you cannot know just from the differential field structure here whether you're going to add a new constant to bound it or not. So it's not going to be model complete as just a differential field, but that has value different. Okay. Any questions or Okay. Any questions about transitors? So to talk about pairs, so a trans series, as I said, is some non-standard model of maybe if you have the exponential as an exponential field or just as a real closed field. But for this talk, the trans-series field is going to be our standard model of this theory, TML small. And so we're going to go to an even bigger, non-standard model. Bigger non-standard model. So we've seen this functional equation several times already. It doesn't have a solution in t, of course, because any solution will be trans-exponential. But it does have some nice solutions, for instance, in parting field. And you can construct an algebraic object, H, that has a field extension of T called hyper series, which was done by Back. Series, which was done by Bagayoko, von der Hoeven, and Kaplan. And it's closed under these hyper-exponentials, x alpha and hyperlogarithms log alpha. So this is for all ordinals alpha. It's a very big class-size field. And for instance, x omega should be seen as the solution of this functional equation to the top. And then the theorem of Pagayoko that's relevant here is that h, together with the natural valuation, still the convex hull of the reals. Still, the convex hull of the reals, but in this much bigger structure, is an elementary extension of t as an ordered value differential field. And really, the meat of the work in this theorem is actually extending, so I just mentioned here it's a field, but extending the derivation to h. So, in particular, this structure is more completely. But I want to describe a second valuation because it's model complete just in this language, but now as a non-standard model, we don't see somehow that this is a trans-exponential structure and this is really an exponentially balanced structure. So, what am I going to do? I want to introduce a second valuation ring, which is just the convex. Which is just the convex hull of this so-called famous talk standard model T inside H. So let me try to indicate this in my picture. So now I'm not in T, but in H. Let me shrink this a little bit. So I have my real numbers, and this is what I'm denoting by O sub H. And maybe there are lots more, well there are also things here, of course, elements that are in T, so these real numbers are in. These real numbers are in blue, and the trans series are in orange. And their convex hull is still a small thing inside h because everything here is exponentially bounded. Whereas you have all the x omega, x omega plus 1, and so on. And this OH has a maximal ideal of infinitesimals, as I said, which are smaller than every real number. And this O And this O, what do I call it, O dot, has an even smaller maximal ideal here called, that I'll call little O dot. So these are all the things that are smaller than every positive trans series, an absolute value, inside h. So what are the things here? You know, here we have things like 1 over e to the x, and so on, but these are not small with respect to the convex hull of. To the convex hull of t. So here we have things like 1 over x omega, things that are really going to 0 so quickly, faster than every iterate of, 1 over every iterate of the x branch. So here we might have 1 over e to the x, and here we might have 1 over Omega x. And so what does it mean to relate to numbers via these valuations, to elements of H via this valuation? Well, let's first say B is non-zero here for this to make sense. This A is really strictly dominated, much smaller than B with respect to this first valuation, the natural valuation, if the quotient is smaller than every positive real number and absolute value. Most trivial number and absolute value. Whereas with this coercion valuation, A is much smaller than B if the quotient is smaller than 1 over every iterate, finite iterate of the exponential. So it's telling you, really, that this quotient is going to zero much, much faster. So, just some simple examples. Our infinite element with respect to the natural valuation is strictly smaller, strictly dominated by xx, but it's not the case that it's strictly dominated by x in this coarser evaluation in the convex hull of t. They're really in the same class here. And on the other hand, of course, what is something that is? What is something that should be strictly dominating x? Well, one of these infinite iterates of the exponential function, like exponent. And so the idea is to introduce this second valuation ring, increases the expressivity about h. We can say that things are close, not just with respect to real numbers, but also with respect to. Real numbers, but also with respect to some trans-exponential stuff. So maybe you want to ask whether some differential equation, algebraic differential equation over H has a solution that's close to some value. You can say here with respect to is it close in the first valuation or is it trans-exponentially close with respect to the second valuation? One more complicated things. So the main result here is that, well, in this expanded language, which I will describe in a second, with more expressive power, we still retain model completeness. So the structure is still model complete. So H hyperseries together with its natural valuation is model complete. Moreover, if we add a predicate, A predicate for a subfield together with its natural valuation, that's model complete. So it looks a little funny here. Let me tell you what I'm doing. So we have H, we have this T inside of it, and it's not going to be the case that H together with T is model complete, but what I can do is find a bigger structure, T star. structure T star with more of these orange lines but that still remains exponentially bounded so it has the same convex hull h but it's going to be a lot lot bigger I mean this is certainly in cardinality in some way much smaller than this proper class but t star is going to be a proper class and so now I have h I have I have H, I have T star, this exponentially bounded model of the theory of trans series of T and L small. I have its natural valuation, which is just coming from its own convex hull of real numbers. And then I have to add also the convex hull of T star, so this O dot here. So I have both of these valuations around. Then this structure is my. Structure is modeled. Make a couple of remarks and questions. As stated, the result is a little unsatisfying because it would be good to actually have some t star inside H that we can describe. And I've had some productive conversations with people. You're the real experts on hyper-series. About what such a T-star should look like. But there, you really actually have to work with the structure of H. So the results that I'm telling you about, in fact, do not really depend so much on H. They can work in other non-standard models of the theory of K-Naus fall. So that's the remark that in any kind of large model like NO or a maximal Harding field. And O or a maximal Harding field, you can do the same kind of trick and get the same result. So in NO, the NO is an elementary, this is the surreal numbers equipped with the derivation constructed by Berarducci and Antova. That is an elementary extension or an elementarily embedded copy of T inside it by more ADH results. Or maximal Hardy fields. This is also a recent result that they are modeled. That they are modeled DNL small. Okay. And any questions about this? Why not HT? So I said it a little bit. T is too small. And so there's the Cardinal D thing. But to make the model theory work, we need to add enough elements to T. For instance, this log alpha is for, say, an infinite alpha. Infinite alpha is an exponentially bounded thing. It lies here, but it doesn't have a standard part in T because you only have log, log, log, log, log, log, and so on. There's nothing that is really sufficiently close to it for the model theory to work. And so that's where the tameness comes in. And the tameness is, in the sense, a real closed field, it's not some model-theoretic sense, NIP or epidemiology, or so on. So now O dot disappeared from the considerations? Yeah. What was it? So this is O dot here. Oh, yeah. Because this is the convex hull of T star in H, it's the same as the convex hull of T in H. So this is. So this is H together with O dot together with a predicate for this differential subfield T star together with the natural valuation of T star. And of course I need this natural valuation of T star because I want this to be model complete as an ordered value differential field. Okay, so let me describe tame pairs of real closed fields. Of real closed fields. So we have a pair, K and L. L will be my smaller real closed field. And it's a similar picture. I have some substructure with a convex hull with a real closed field, so it's an elementary substructure. And again, I have some infinitesimals. Now I only have one O, one, two. And the tameness says that. Um and the tameness says that every element of this, so let me just throw one again. So I have k and I have l inside of it and its convex hull, and here's zero in the middle, then everything in this convex hull should have a standard part in L. That's what this condition is saying. So everything in this construct, So everything in the convex hull of L is just equal to some element of L plus something that's very close to zero with respect to L. Right, so this picture has lots of gaps, but the idea is that taken care of there, of course, very few gaps. L is quite filled out inside L. And so some examples, just as fields, the T The t itself, together with the real numbers, as we started with, is a tank pair. So everything that's really bounded by a real number in trans series, just by virtue of, if you remember, the first element I had written had some stuff, and then it had a real number, like 42, and then, I don't know, something else, and whatever. So this was an infinite part, this was just some real number, and then you have something that's very small with respect to the real numbers. Or maybe you can consider the Puizot series. So this is the union of the R T, the Hahn field, of the Ron series field, R T with powers 1 over n. Take the union over N, you get something that's much smaller than the Hahn field with all rational powers, say, but still is a real closed. Um but still is a real closed field, the real closure of the Laurent series field R of t, and the, likewise the real numbers together form a tank pair of real closed fields. And the introduction of tank pairs goes back to McIntyre and Trillin Lickman, but enrichments of these structures were studied by von de Bries and Luhenberg, where they are not just fields, but they have extra hominimal structure and everything compatible in the right way. And I guess the terminology maybe And I guess the terminology maybe is due to them. I didn't find it in the TrillanticLot paper. And I don't have access to I can text thesis, so I'll be sure about that. Right. So the framework that will lead to this model completeness result that I described a couple of slides ago is obtained pairs of trans-series fields. So trans-serial tame pair is going to be a pair KL of differential fields. Of differential fields that is, they're both models of T and L small. This is just the theory of trend series. The L is a smaller proper differential subfield of K, and they're tamed just as real closed fields. So the idea is that, well, not T, but with whatever T star we can find later, this is going to be a transerial team pair. Serial team pair. Questions about the definition? So, this is an enrichment of tame pairs of real closed fields by a derivation. Well, this is my remark, is that I do mean actually here as differential fields. But it's a lemma, an observation, that in fact, because of the tameness, they must have the same constant field. They must be elementary extensions. They must be elementary extension as bordered value differential field. So the definition works just fine as differential fields. So why do we call it transient? Because they're models of this theory of transients. I welcome other suggestions for a better name, certainly if you have one. Yeah, a tame pair of Newtonian, omega-3, exposed H field to a small. H field to a small derivation. Right. So, yeah, just to say this lemma, I defined it for differential fields, but actually everything works nicely. They're already an elementary extension. That's what we're calling differential fields. They even have the same constant field. And this is just an observation that comes from the team this and some simple properties of these models, TMS models. Um so now the the real main result, um rather than this statement about H and T star, was that in this axiomatic framework for trans serial tame pairs, it is model complete in the language of ordered rings together with the derivation delta together with a predicate p to be interpreted as the small differential subfield together with Together with natural valuation of this L. Although here we need to be a little bit careful, we may not have exactly some real numbers as our constant field, but the right analog in the setting of models of TNL is to put the constant field there, so the natural valuation with respect to all the elements. With respect to all the elements of the derivative of zero. And together with O dot, which is this corresponding valuation, the convex holiday from the small subfield inside the large subject. Okay. So let's see how we get from the model completeness of this trans serial tame pairs to this result that I had for H. This result that I had for H and T star, and where this T star comes from. So, what the first thing that we have to check is that given one of these pairs, even if the small one is not contained in the large one, well, we can always form, as one does in valuation theory, the quotient field of Field of, for instance, of this O dot by its maximal ideal little O dot. Okay, that's going to be a residue field. It's going to be equipped with derivation that descends to the k dot. And moreover, you can check that this k dot is in fact itself a model of TNL small. So it is Newtonian omega-free Louvoclave. An omega-free UVO closed H field with small derivations. And this is just the statement that I had before. And so I just want to show you where this T star comes from. And what do we do? We have H, we have this Coarson valuation ring O dot. And we can just, we have T inside of it that's exponentially bounded. We can just extend T to a lift of the resolution. To a lift of the residue field. So this k dot is this residue field, o dot modulo little o dot, and a lift t star of k dot is just a subfield, differential subfield here of o dot that maps isomorphically onto this k dot as a differential field. And so you just use the differential Henstelianity to extend, you know, when you have a You know, when you have a if you don't have, you know, t is maybe too small, but then you want to extend it, well, if you have at the algebraic extension stage, you have a algebraic, differentially algebraic extension of the residue fields, you lift that to put a differential algebraic extension in O dot by this property of differential extension. And then once you add enough elements to t to get t star, you will get something tame. And then you get molal completeness, by the model of completeness for the theory of trans serial tank pairs. So we already see here that we need to know some properties of H together with O dot. So here H O dot, I just have this valuation ring O dot, I don't have its. Valuation ring O dot, I don't have its natural valuation in the language. And so a key step in establishing, improving the model completeness for the theory of trans serial tank pairs is to develop the model theory of structures like KO dot. So this is a little bit vague, but they this HO dot, so H together with this course evaluation ring is not a model of T and L small. It has some other A model of T and L small. It has some other properties as a value differential field. And so one has to develop the model theory of, well, the algebra and model theory of such structures. And you end up with, or I end up with, with the theory of pre-H fields that are differential Hinselian and levo-closed with non-trivial evaluation. What these words mean doesn't have too much bearing in this talk, so you can forget it. Hindus talked, so you can forget it. Again, differential Hencelianity is right analog of Hencelianity for these kinds of structures, KO dot. U o close is just the same thing that we had before. And the small derivation is already baked into differentials there. Alright. So I just remind you of the earlier axiomatization, just so you can compare the words if you want. So we have a similar. But uh so they have a similar shape, let's say, for that sensitization. Um but they're neither is modeled the other. Okay um and then what you can do is show that when you have so we saw already that when you have a transferial time pair, its residue field is a model of TNL small. And you can also check that this KO dot is That this KO dot is a model of TDHL. It's a pre-H field that's differential Hencelian and we'll close. And the converse is also true when you have a model of KO dot whose residue field, so you have a model of T D H L whose residue field is itself a model of TNL small, then if you equip A with a lift of its residue field, you get a transerial tank pair. So I like this because somehow it shows that in these trans serial tank pairs we are decomposing the information about this larger non-standard model K or this larger non-standard model H here of the theory of trans series into two parts. The smaller part, maybe this exponentially bounded part T star, is a model of the theory of pens series. Of pence series. And this KO dot part kind of doesn't see so much the exponentially bounded behavior. You just have the valuation ring really for the trans-exponential behavior. Indeed, to prove the model completeness of these transerial tame pairs, it kind of goes. Tame pairs, it kind of goes via this decomposition in the sense that you have the model completeness of TNL's mole and all the embedding lemmas that you that are established to obtain the model completeness. And then you also have to develop the embedding lemmas for TDHL, and then you can put them together in the right way, the right back-and-forth system, to obtain all the completeness. completeness. So really this theorem kind of gives you the idea of the proof that you need both the model theory and the embedding lemmas for these two kinds of these two theories, these two kinds of structures, which you can put together to get model completeness for the pairs. So let me give a brief interlude that has really not so much to do with the rest of the talk, but I mention it for a couple of reasons. I mention it for a couple of reasons, which I will say in a second. So, no model of this theory of differential Hanselian pH fields that are loud closed is spherically complete. So, this is the right kind of completeness notion for value fields, or if you don't know what it means, just think isomorphic to one of these unfields, these power series, generalized power series fields. And the reason I mention this proposition is point out a couple of things. Point out a couple of things. One is that this theory, in some sense, doesn't have the Hahnfield models. The models of this theory do not look like Hahnfields. And also, you use the logarithmic derivative map and integration to abstain a subjective logarithmic cross-section, whatever that is, doesn't exactly matter, but in your structure, you find some amount of exponentiation somewhere. So it's not on the whole field, but you can find on some subgroups. But you can find on some subgroups somewhere an exponential just from the differential field axioms. And so there are already some exponentials coming into the picture, although it's not in the language model theoretically. And then such a thing, and so this, whatever this is, rejective logarithmic cross-section, relates the valuation, brings the value group into the field in some way. And this cannot exist in Hunt fields. Fields by a result of Cool Man, Command Chill R. Finally, I want to state what are maybe the really real results, which are that I was telling you about transiterial tank pairs, but in fact this residue. But in fact, this residue field does not have to be a model of D and L small at all. Everything works relative to some theory of the residue field. So we have this TDHL, whatever it is, differential amity, luval closed, pH fields. It has a residue field, and maybe this residue field has extra structure. Maybe it has, in the case of hyper series and T, we have. Hyper series and T, we had this extra valuation ring, but it could be any additional structure that you like. And since you can always lift the differential residue field, we might as well consider it as a pair and add this extra structure onto this predicate. And now it's a name pair, so we should expand with some standard part map so we really can have. Have in our language a function that picks for each element in this convex hull, the standard part in this k dot. And then everything works relatively. So this first statement is just to say that this theory TDHL is complete relative to the theory of its residue field. So if the theory, if you have a K and a K star, and if their residue fields also And if their residue fields, possibly, differential residue fields, possibly with additional structure, are elementarily equivalent, then so are the larger structures, again, expanded by the extra structure on the residue fields and the standard part map. And likewise, the allocomteness is also relative. So, if the theory of the differential residue field, again, together with Differential residue field again together with its additional structure is model complete, then so is the whole structure K, together with its evaluation ring O dot, together with the structure, richer structure K dot, and this tangent part. And so at the end of the day, the model The model, all we ultimately really needed was the model completeness of TNL small to run this game. And to get more information, like about this T star, you really need to go further into the structure of H. And so let me just end with a few questions and or work in progress. So this is something that I'm working on now. Something that I'm working on now, so not all the results are finished. Maybe the first two are work in progress almost done. This is item one is a relative completeness. Item two is a relative model completeness. Of course, one would also like a relative modifier elimination with the standard part map, and they have something written down for that, but it doesn't quite give me what I would like. What is the structure induced on this subfield k dot? It would be nice to know that. It would be nice to know that it's just this k dot together with whatever else it started with, as one hope. Of course, in a vague question, what are the further applications to hyper-series or other non-standard models of T and L S Hall? To surreals or Maximal Hardy fields or so on. It would be algebraic. Algebraic consequences for these structures, or of course, more model-theoretic things, NIP transfer, distality, things of that kind. And after Sebastian's talk this morning, I added a question about what about adding the exponential and or trans-exponential function. Maybe you want some kind of trans-exponential on the the big thing and an exponential on the residue fuel. Um but uh that's just a speculative question. just a speculative question, which would require, of course, a lot more work even just to understand what it would do on T itself. So I, as I like to say in the airplanes, I made a few minutes up with my tailwind. So thank you for being here at the end of the long day. Questions? Just a clarification on the last theorem. You say positive expanded with a different structure, do you mean induced by the structure of K or dot as a differential value T? As a differential value thing. Or could you really have even more structure? You could really have even more structure. So, indeed, in this case, it really is induced from H, as we saw. But everything works really with any additional structure. You add any whatever structure you want on K dot, and then you just make it trivial off of K dot. Yeah. So you said that the theory T D H L has well. DHL has, well, every model of that theory has some kind of partial exponentiation. Are there models that have full exponentiation? There are models that have full exponentiation. I mean, so yes, in the sense that you can take t, this is a field, a differential field. It has an exponential function on it. And then the exponential function is functional. And then the exponential function, you know, if you're asking, just is there an exponential function, then sure, I can just coarsen the valuation ring and get something. I don't have to coarsen it very much, just make it larger, and that doesn't affect the exponential option anymore. Anything. It only changes the valuation, not the differential or exponential option structure. Whether that has the nice properties with this course evaluation or anything is a different question. Be my nice package. I have a question about if you like. So, why there's no gamma in this year? Like, if you expand gamma or something, does it still work? Oh, yes. That's a good question. So, the axioms of TDHL, differential Hexelian, Yuva closed pH field, determine a complete theory of the value group. It's not only. Value group, it's not only a divisible order to abelian group. So double-closed includes real closed. So the value group is going to be a divisible order debelian group. But together with the other assumptions, you may or may not have seen that in this trans series context, this value group is typically equipped with an extra map that comes from a logarithmic derivative. But the other assumptions in TDHL still determine a complete theory of the value groups. Complete theory of the value group together with the conditional value. Yeah, yeah, right. What I was asking is: I mean, here you're allowing expansions on the resolution, right? You're asking whether you can expand the value. Yeah, I see. So, yeah, a better one could try to improve the results by removing the real closed assumption, and then you have maybe different, not quite divisible or non-divisible theories of. Or non-divisible theories of the value group and doing really a. Even if it's still divisible, you just want to put extra maps or whatever. Yeah, I guess I don't really see it. It doesn't appear because it's determined, it doesn't appear anywhere in my back and forth system, so I don't, there's no place to put it. See, but if you, but what I mean to say is that a better way to do this, if you can carry it. This, if you can carry it out, would be you might as well remove the real closed assumption and then do everything with three things at once. That's what I'm saying. And then, in that case, once you have both the value group and the residue field there, then you can, of course, expand by additional structure and hope to get a process stuff. When I tried to do it, I ran into some problems. But the The problem is you have this logarithmic derivative map and maybe you mentioned that anything NICPT or that kind of properties for this thing. Anything known so far? Yeah, so that is something I have not done in this paragraph. I have some stuff in a two-sorted context where really things are more separated because you. Things are more separated because you have a main field and then you have a separate sort for the residue field. And there you get things like NMP transfer. But with the residue field being, in fact, an actual subfield of the main field, I don't, I mean, I would expect it, but do not have anything to that effect. Questions? So, what are the possible theories of K dot? Can it be CODF? Yes, it can be CODF. Yeah, so oh, yeah, that's a good question. Any theory of order differential fields that is real closed, closed under exponential integration, and linearly surjective in the sense that every linear differential equation in k-dot has. Equation in K dot has a solution in K dot. Given those three axioms, then you can find a model of K D, K, I'm sorry, a model K of T D H L with resolution of that. That is an only yeah, those conditions are also necessary. Okay. I'm going to write it up. Any more questions? Any more questions? Not let's thank Jan McMeiger. And we're convening 15 hours and 6 minutes, okay?
