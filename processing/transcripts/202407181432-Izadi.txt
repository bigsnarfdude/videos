They'll talk about dynamics and stoppage mechanisms and scholastic suspects. Thank you so much. This morning Ian came and talked with the topic. Let me talk about my problem. I was afraid that Ian is going to talk about me, but he talked about my problem. So I am Matthew. I am a postdoc of PNS team. And today I want to talk about an industrial problem of squeeze submitting as we can explain briefly. So before going to the presentation, I want to acknowledge the efforts and help that I received from my teammates, Emod, and also Elizabeth Putakir. So I will start by explaining what is a problem in industrial terms and how we want to idealize it and how we want to make it a mathematical problem. But I want to bear in mind that this problem is not about to be accurate, but it's about to be efficient because we're going to talk about the larger scale industrial problem. Industrial problem. And after idealizing the problem, I want to talk about the mathematical model and the closure that we have and present a bit of results that we already have. So, briefly speaking, this is how an oil bay looks like. So, we are talking about a cascade of casing and steel pipes with a diameter that is reducing as it goes down, so it becomes smaller and smaller. And this casing is shrouded with a cement feath to provide zonal. To provide zonal isolation, which means that we don't want to have any unwanted flow from the wellboard to the adjacent zones and vice versa. But what is happening in reality is a little bit different. So if you zoom in, we can see that this cement sheet is going to have some imperfections or some voids that can happen for a variety of reasons. It can be because of the thermal tracking or any kind of debonding. And in this research, we are mainly interested in a kind of what happened. So this imperfections, the most important one is known as mitroannuloid, which is a debunding from the cement sheath from the street casing or adjacent woodwork. And why it is important. Adjacent wellboard. And why it is important because we have a gas resource in the reservoir down the wellboard, as you can see here. And this gas can migrate through these imperfections to the surface. And to solve this problem on the industrial side, the solution is known as the screen cementing, as can be seen here. They create some perforations in a helical pattern, and by injecting cement slurry, they aim to feel and seal this microarnibod. Microantibody. So if we unwrap this section that can be from 1 meter to 50 meter based on the country, so we can see that it can create a helisaw with multi-perforation. And we want to indeed study injection of semiconductor in multi-perforation of this mitroannuloi. There are questions that we need to answer before moving to our idealized model. First, what a mitroannuloi looks like, and then what semantic story means in this context. means in this context. Because there are models considering semantic story as a beautiful plastic fluid, but then it comes to the scale of fractures, everything's going to be different. So the first question is that how, what is a microannulus? There are different ways to answer this question. If you ask it from an engineer, it's going to come up with some sort of experimental test like this one, and they create the seminars and they study like what we can see. And they study like what we can see here, and microannula appears to be tiny but irregular kind of geometry here. Or another technique can be, as can be seen here, is CD scan. So they send the camera to make 2D cross-sections and they use some 3D techniques to just stack them up and make the 3D geometry. But as we can see, they don't provide the general information. All they can give us is that we are talking about irregular geometry. If you are talking about irregular geometries, another way to look at this problem is the solution that is done by my colleague Tudel and also Elizabeth. So what we have is the leakage rate. We know the leakage rate. Why we shouldn't do inverse engineering. So we have the flow rate and we can have some sort of Darcy flow and some sort of random generation of H to reconstruct a microannulum. So this is the technique that we'd be using. So, this is the technique that we use here. Our team has generated a code that we can use this daily leakage from the data that we got from industrial sectors to regenerate the microannula, and this is how they look like. And this is a scale version, so it has been from CMP 4.5, and you can see that it's very variable and it's changing in one sample. This is a scale by 160 microns, and this is a section of 12-meter, which is the conveyor. Of 12 meters, which is the conventional outsize for Canada into pi r, and the score is going to be changing as the computer is going to get higher. So, this is the first thing that we want to talk about. And the next thing is what a cement slurry looks like. Cement to slurry is a viscoplastic suspension engine, and those solid particles are going to be about 15 micrometers roughly, depending on the type of cementite you're using. We are not interested in bringing a lot of complication into our model because it's going to. Into our model because it's going to give us a lot of computation costs. We want to move with the simplest assumptions that we can have, and probably it's one made by Broadcast. And it's mentioned that the cement star will penetrate the fracture if the fracture size is bigger than the particle size by three times. So probably the simplest way to look at it is to update our logical description of a Herschel-Botti description and just multiply the yielded stress in a function. The yielded stress in a function, as can be seen here, to give us an infinite. So it's not going to let the semi-story indeed go into, although it has a lot of simplification, but it can provide us just this simple thing. So our idealized models look like this. We have, so if you open a fracture, you're going to have a multi-perforation design. But firstly, I want to talk about what's happened around one perforation and see how I can move forward. And see how I can move forward and see how I can take care of a huge 12-meter or 15-meter sample. So, for one case, we can see here that if we open the fracture and just take a tile, you can look at it as a Haiti shock problem. And the governing equation will be continuity and momentum, as can be seen here, and also addiction. The beauty of the momentum equation here is that, first of all, pressure is going to be constant across the fracture, thanks to the disparity of the Hairisha. Of the Helisha approximation. And the last thing is that we want to also consider the effect of surface tension because we have a displaced technology. One complaint is that obviously this is going to be negligible somehow, but we're going to check the result to see if it's real or not. So here is the heavy-side function. So, and also we can see that by heavy-side function, you can create a pressure drop at the interface. So, pressure in this displacing, which can be more or less based on this wetting or non-vetting. So, this term is going to consider that. Numbering. So this term is going to consider that, and this is our momentum equation. If we interpret the momentum equation due to the fact that pressure is constant across the fracture, we can have this equation as a 2D gap average momentum equation. And this is just a generalization of Darcy's law, because if you just put on the yields of zero and just the Newtonian thing, you're going to get down to 12 equations. So to solve this equation, you have to take off the inverse form. The inverse form. Indeed, we want to inverse this and write pressure create it in terms of the string function. And the reason is that this is gonna be a function that can be numerically solved and it can be solved for when grad psi is bigger than zero. So our scale equation will be this one and so we can solve this inverse pressure gradient where s is defined as this one and also this the And also, the size of this grad of string function can be written as this. And as can be seen, we have the kind of Darcy law that encodes the reality of the displacement for you that displacement. Another thing that is interesting is that the momentum equation doesn't have temporal terms, and the temporal terms indeed enters a closure just to the advection term. I mean, the equation that we have for concentration, which means that at each step, we can solve the momentum equation and then advance. equation and then advanced, then advanced the flow and advertise as a tension. We use Aguanta-Lagrangian method within Ozova iteration and Ozova just simply brings this non-linear elliptic equation to an elliptic and some sort of iterative method to solve it. And we use finite element and this continuous Galilean. And here is our sample. For simplicity, indeed, it can provide more information if needed, but we just sold half of the domain, so half of the fracture, because Domain, so half a fracture because you have a indeed a preparation within, and we have forfeit pressure and also an injection pressure. And we want to look at it as a constant pressure injection form. And we want to see if it's going to stop, and when it's a stop, what's going to be the preparation pattern, what's going to be the feeling in the pathology. So, here are some sort of results. Morning, Ian just showed the bear, but I can show that in this view we have a lot of other animals as well. You can see raven, you can see butterfly, but all. You can see butterflies, but all is interesting here is that you have variability here. So, here, the part A of these three figures, you can see the age variation, and you can see when you're playing with the rheological parameter y number, the filling pattern will change the amount. So we have a variability that comes from the random geometry and also how the rheology acts with respect to that. And lastly, And lastly, I added the surface tension to the equation. And it is interesting that for the same H variation as we can see here and for the same rheological parameter, y number equal to 0.5, we can see that changing the surface tension changes the preferential passes at each time step and it can change the final morphological behavior of the feeling. So here you can see that we can have a non-bitting and bitter and also Weighting and also surface tension equals to zero, and we can see that even the instability is coming, like finger-like instability is coming, the thing is going to appear in our closure. So far, we just studied one perforation, and what we got was that we have very random results, and we have a variable result that we should uncertain. So, how to quantify? One would be the morphology, we can take care of the radius. Morphology: We can take care of the radius in terms of it's going to be the minimum, maximum, equivalent, or we can talk about the displacement efficiency, how much is the void area remaining, or even the connectedness, but as we go further, I'm going to show that they are not enough. So, the penetration around the perforation shows us that the effectiveness is going to be described in terms of y number only, because at the end of the day, a stoppage occurs when y number is balanced with the current. Other parameters like shear tenning would affect the feeling time or other parameters. The feeling time or other parameters, but the feeling morphology is not based on that. And the other thing is that there is a considerable validation. It is important in an industrial term because sometimes you're unlucky enough to put the perforation right in the place that is not receptive and you're indeed making the perforation somewhere that is tight already. But in other terms, you can have a lot of perforation. So, but in a multi-perforation problem that we wanted to look at, Problem that we wanted to look at, we have two challenges. One was the uncertainty that we wanted to take care of it, and for that, we use a Monte Carlo type simulation. We did 18,000 simulations to just regenerate some sort of mean value with confidence in terrible. And other thing is that each computation is going to be very expensive. So if you want to just do one simulation, it's going to take a couple of hours. And each of these matching perforation designs concerns three hundred holes. Moreover, we don't know even the interaction of these perforations. Interaction of these perforations. So, we introduce a tiding strategy here. So, this is one perforation that we already studied, and we regenerate the whole geometry based on this for a random H that we go for 12 meter. And we can have the fixed area and non-fixed area, and now we can study the peak through this. So, I just provide the results here. The first thing is that the blue thing is before. The blue thing is before making the multiple version before doing the squeeze 17, and red one is after the squeeze 70. So, there are some sort of intuitive results, obviously, when tow white. I mean you're reducing yield distress, you can penetrate deeper, you're going to have a better job, you can have a better displacement. And also, you can see variations like this. And we came up with some sort of industrial suggestions in terms of shot perforation or other industrial terms that are not in the complete. Other industrial terms that are not in the context of this talk. But I want to come back to the question that I asked previously. So, are these parameters like R mean, Hmin, or other metrics that I tried to define from this uncertain geometry are enough or not? The fact is that they are not enough. First of all, you can see that they can change even for very small yield distress they can from 0 to 1, which means that it's going to be uncertain. Lastly, we try to plot the final. Plot the final reduction in the leakage with respect to them, and there is no meaningful relation between them. So, yeah, this is all I wanted to say. And thank you so much for listening to my presentation on the question. Have you heard anything about questions? Oh, go ahead.
