I'm not a math modeler, absolutely not, and my math etiquette ended in college. So one of the things I want to propose is that I'm looking for how the work I'm doing right now can actually include math modeling or some form of understanding the problem using the tools that you have. Because I don't know what those tools are, I just know that this big problem has. I just know that this is a big problem, and I don't know how to get ahead of it. I really don't. So, working off of Karen's work is sort of thinking about how can we do more collaboration. So, I changed the name from the other thing because I like this one better, One Crisis to Another. So, I've been doing interviews with frontline workers on mental health and substance use in the small city where I live, which is Sault Ste. Lauren, Ontario. Okay? So, why this research? Got a graph here that really shows, and you can see since the pandemic, things have really escalated. In Canada, so many of the people I speak with don't realize how, they'll say, oh, the pandemic is terrible in the world. And I'm like, yes, but we are 137 times what other people are experiencing in the world. The Americans are 200 times. So, when we think of what the opioid Think of what the opio crisis is in Canada, it is actually quite different than it is in other jurisdictions. So, really kind of getting our heads around that, because I don't think we have our heads around that. And so, this is the area that I live in, and I know these are not large numbers, but in terms of the population, in terms of what's actually going on, they are. So, this is a strain on the public health system. It also means that people are dying. Means that people are dying. These are the EMS calls for suspected opiate overdoses and deaths attributed to opiates in the district. And you can see that it's just kind of gone up and up. And we are not returning to pre-pandemic. We're not. It's just getting worse. So I don't know what to do about that. And when I work in this, I think, okay, well, I need to do something. I don't know even how to get ahead of. I don't know even how to get ahead of it so that we can sort of say what's working, what's not, and how do we backtrack this. So the problem, communities like Sioux, we're often overlooked in terms of resource allocation. That includes access to modelers and having data and getting the data and doing all of that. The lack of resources suggests additional burdens on both workers and volunteers. There's little research and consultation done with frontline workers. Done with frontline workers, and the data is often out of date. And I was speaking with one of you about this. The crisis is overtaking the capacity to do data collection and analysis. So because we're in an active crisis, the data just isn't giving us the tools to come to some sort of a conclusion about it or to figure out solutions. Questions that remain: the data is not useful for prevention programming at all. At all. The crisis is happening, therefore, the data is lagging. Substance users do not use this information since it is so out of date with lithium. So what we've got is substance users who are just like, nope, this will not. There's nothing in this information that gives me anything, any information about what I can do or how I can change it. So that also includes frontline workers. They're in the midst of the crisis, they don't know how to get their heads around. They don't know how to get their heads around. So, these are literature gaps that I identified in order to come up with the study. Just multi-pronged approach needed. I was talking to Betsy about this. It was like, yes, that's what we need. I don't know what that looks like. So, I've done qualitative research. I've started interviews. I've completed 10 today. I've got some more. I'm already finding saturation, though, which is We're already finding saturation though, which is kind of interesting because it's a very low number to be finding saturation at. That's because the frontline workers who I'm interviewing, my volunteers, are just overwhelmed and that's where they are. Oh, saturation means that I'm starting to see things replicate, like said again and again and again. So preliminary findings. Many of the frontline workers have actually been changing and shifting job rules as they go on. Job rules as they go on. So they're just responding to the need. That's all they're doing. There are lack of supports, wraparound services are required, and we have exhaustion and burnout. So many of, and I've got a few slides on this, many of the workers actually reported the need to pull back at times, like saying, okay, I need to take a break because this is overwhelming. I was doing some work in the community last week, and I was speaking to someone who said that what they do is they get up from their desk. What they do is they get up from their desk once a half an hour and they walk around the block and administer naloxone during the day. So that's the kind of thing that's going on. So we are, that's what's going, that's happening today. And the link to mental health, I mean, it's very clear. So what's going on is that people are like, they're vulnerable and then they're intersected by the way that this really count. So we've got in Sault Ste. Marie, we've got a high indigenous population. Got a high indigenous population, that population is disproportionately affected. Claritrant trans folk, disproportionately affected, racialized folk, disproportionately affected. So we've got vulnerable people who keep on being vulnerable. So there's a lack of staff and untrained staff. They have very little capacity. The pandemic has made things significantly worse. As I said, there's no return to pre-pandemic. There's a lack of trust for services at the hospital. There's a lack of trust for services at the hospital because of stigmatized behaviors by staff. They assume that people are drug seeking, they assume that, and so therefore we do not treat them very kindly. And then the stigma that's been applied to clients actually gets attached to support workers. So one of the things they often speak about is the fact that they're doing this work, but when they say they're doing this work, when they're at dinner or something like that, people around them go, oh, why would you? Those are not really humans. Not really humans. So, suggested by other, I'm going to go on pass that one. Okay, things I found, volunteers and workers come from more privileged and are generally well educated and are colleged or EA to do this work. So there's a significant difference between the people who are doing the work and the people who need the work done. A sense of civic duty is often why they're doing it. They're service-oriented. Service-oriented. And in Ontario, if you have a one, after one year, they expect a 1% recovery rate. 1%. So that's what they're looking at as successful. You will keep your programming going if you demonstrate 1%. I don't know. I think that's probably statistically valid. Most clients, the vast majority, and this is something I've been finding that I haven't seen any. I've been finding that I haven't seen anywhere else. Most of the clients have spent their entire lives inside the social service system. So we've got people in the child protective services when they're young. They graduate into these kinds of services and some of them will end up. And the stigma, yeah, as I said. So this is me sort of theorizing. I didn't bring in any names or anything because I thought that would be new here. Here, class-based issues are really entrenched and reinforced. There's little difference that we can make at the structural levels. The whole system would need to change. This is micro-level work, and that means one-on-one, individuals to individuals. And until the structure changes, supports are needed for capacity on the front lines. So, here, figure out the relationship with large data and real-life experiences, trying to figure out how to. Experiences, trying to figure out how to get something in place so that we can actually persuade and change policy. I would think these numbers are terrifying enough that that would work, but it doesn't. So I'm going to be setting up in-service days for workers to network and exchange information. And that includes understanding of statistics and that kind of thing, that they can know what's going on in their own communities and with each other. And then I'd like to work with other people. And then I'd like to work with other researchers to create scenarios and potential solutions, and of course advocate for structural change. Thank you very much. This is really, really right in line. I think some of the people are thinking. So, thanks very much for the information. Just a few quick questions. One is when you mentioned the success rate, you said one person was expected. Is success determined as abstinence? Determined as abstinence. Abstinence for a year. Abstinence for a year. Is harm reduction, meaning just like a reduction? Anybody who's aware of what's going on in the province of Ontario realizes that, so there's an administrative addictions, and he is not a believer in harm reduction. So most of the insight, most of the safe injection sites have actually been closed and are in the process of being closed. Are in the process of being so in terms of the work that the workers are very working on, what kind of work is it? Is it getting them into methadone programs or is it getting them into other types of what type? Most of it is actually sort of soft counseling, encouraging people to sit in abstinence, that kind of thing. You're doing some work where you're trying to get people into different centers, but we don't have enough facilities. So it is very difficult to keep people in the facilities. Very difficult to keep people in the facilities or find the beds. One of the things that's happened, certainly in the Sioux, is that we've got very few beds. The hospital has just opened nine emergency beds, but it's probably closed. And one of the things they keep talking about is how there's so much of an intersection between vulnerabilities, mental health crises, and like these are
