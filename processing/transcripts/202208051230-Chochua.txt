Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Gosho Shosho. I'm a technical advisor at Farmer Jam. So for those who don't know, SummerJen is an oil-field service company. However, just listening to the previous presentations from BP, we're doing a lot of same things we started to do in the new energy, same hydrogen production. Hydrogen production, the environmental solutions, a lot of similar projects. But today I'm going to talk for some remaining projects in the traditional oil-field production. So I'll talk about high flow rate open hole completions, sound rotation tests, and these 3D, 2D, 3D CFD multi-scale. 3D CFD multi-scale modeling technique and a couple case studies. So in order to get oil, we need to have oil and natural gas out. We need to have a few technical bricks. We need to drill the wellboard. Second, we need to complete it. So putting some hardware downhole. And then third, we need to produce, get that all down. That oil down. So, the completion and production work together. So, when oil is being produced, a gas first it goes through the rock, through the formation rock, to the completion, flows there. Then it has to pass through so-called sunscreens. Because with these hydrocarbons, we have small particles of rock, basically, which looks like a sharp sand. which looks like a sharp sand and all this is being filtered out by this filter medium then because we have multiple sections and permeability of different sections could be different we don't want like one all the oil going through one section and other sections are not go because we could have water breakthrough or some unwanted fluids breakthrough so these devices have so-called icds in flow control devices i mean these are control devices i mean these are completions and this in flow control devices uh they are just orifices which which chalk chalk the flow equalizing it between different different sections and of course is then being delivered to the surface so uh we'll talk today about this problem multi-scale problem of these sunscreens this this screen if i take a look it's a If I take a look, it's a filter media. It's a rope. It's a wire rope which has a gap between wires. It's a less than millimeter fraction of a millimeter gap. And all this completion goes hundreds of feet. So it's a very long completion system. So we have base pipe, which is under in that pipe, hydrocarbons being produced. This filter-mended media and under. these filter main media and under filtering media some series of chocks which which equalize which equalize flow now let's look on the physics schematic how this flow is being produced so we have flow coming from the formation which could be non-uniform it could be more flow coming through the hill portion which is closer to the surface than the top portion which is further down top portion which is further down further down hole and which are separated by packer each section typically is plugged by packers so we have zones separated second dust some flow is coming from the previous zones from the up upstream zones and a flow fluid always tries to find path of minimum resistance so whatever is coming from the upper zone whatever is coming from the upper zones he has the freedom to go through this series of perforations in the base pipe reach the these anos between base pipe and the wellbore and typically then it needs all to go down because there is no way we have a packer no way to continue flowing in the anode and flow returns back when it returns back it it tends to return at the hill so most of the flow high flow rate returns at the hill this suggest returns at the hill this i just return back this sense sunscreen uh protection if it gets breached in one spot all the sand will just go through that one spot so we can have hundreds of feet of the completion but it only takes one one erosion hotspot to to break that sand rotation and that sand will go with the hydrocarbons to the surface and can damage equipment there. So our goal is to equalize that flow, not let equalize gut flow, not let all the fluid coming through the heel and or at least for the lifetime of that well, which is up to 20 years, not to make sure that it does not erode that sunscreen. Second, potential of a fracture. A fracture in a rock would have a higher flow rate hydrochemical. the hydrocarbons will be produced at a higher flow rate and they would be hitting that sunscreen at one spot and hitting it at one spot would erode it here and then all the sand which which was filtered can uh can can can flow to the surface so it's uh this is this is another scenario so to uh to mitigate that uh uh we have so-called uh high rate so-called high-rate screens, high-rate completions, which are designed for the cases when well boards are producing a lot of fluid at higher velocities and there is risk of breaching this filter, metal filter. For example, in the traditional compression, we have just a few perforating holes or so-called, we sometimes call them ICD in flow control devices. devices and flow which comes from the formation all focuses to that single hole which you can consider as a sink as a hydrodynamic thing and there is high velocity on on on on the screen just just above it the idea of hydrate completeness is to of the design is to fall to move sunscreen further up you can see there is bigger gap gap this is output laser point this is a bigger gap between sunscreen and the perforations and have more perferential more smaller perforations this is what we call so-called icd effect since pressure drop is proportional to velocity squared in in an ordinal orifice flow will tend to equalize through these holes giving less maximum velocity more or less uniform velocity, more or less uniform flow through each of the sunscreens. Okay. Now how to size these sunscreens? Because sand could be in all different varieties. And this is a picture of that sunscreen. So sand could be characterizing by this D10. So D10 is in this case is the biggest 10, is a massive. 10 is a mass, the percentage that 10% of the biggest sand has. So is the size, basically 10% of the mass is the size of 150 microns, for example, in this case. It should be sand one blue line. And in the other sand, which is shown at the bottom, it's 243. But very important is the uniformity, D40 over D90. Some sand could be more or less uniform, having the same, even the same size. even even the same size, medium size. They could be uniform set or highly non-uniform sand, having very big particles and having very small finds, which would be this red light. So these completions are typically go, not complete, this sunscreen after we design, they go through tests for all different sun sizes. And there are two parameters to see. Is the retained permeability? The retained permeability. That means after it packed on top of that sunscreen, liquid still can go through the sand and they need to retain at least 50% of its original permeability. Not to block the flow. On the other hand, it should not produce too much sand. So our goal is to produce less than 0.15 pounds of sand per square foot of the sand. square foot of the of the sunscreen. So sunscreen size and design they are tested and the idea is to have majority of the sand, these are all different tests, all different sands, to be more than 50% of permeability and under 0.15 pounds per square foot. Okay, now modeling. So we have a task to model that sunscreen of 400 feet and see what erosion risk we have at. risk we have at the hill. Our starting point is a 3D simulation of a relatively small quarter foot portion of that completion. And from this we extract the effective property. Sometimes people use the word homogeneation or we use the poros media properties for the screen for this perforated base pipe and other components. So first we extract effective First, we extract effective properties. Then we have a reservoir simulation modeling which can run and give us profile of a production for a specific field. Then we apply that profile in a 2D model. This 2D model, it shows on the portion, but it goes hundreds of feet. It's a very big computational, very long computational mesh, but since it's 2D, it can handle that length. and we compute boundary conditions for the 3D simulations again so that's why 3d 2d 3d so we need to know how much flow is coming to that last few feet through the base pub how much is coming through the analysis and how much is is being is being produced then returning back to that 3d simulation now each sand screen wire is specifically screen wire is specifically modeled we have boundary conditions and this applies and we can see what velocity field is being developed you can see this is um i'll show later but this is a plane just two millimeter above the sunscreen and by the velocities above the sunscreen we can see where are the like where we have perforations and they are deeply down but since they are like sinks they are still since they are like things they are still seen at some distance above so this is the the modeling methodology that that we use for reservoir modeling sometimes we can do use upshore reservoir if it's known from the field but if it's if it's not known we can create an artificial reservoir and and find the distribution or we call it synthetic reservoir and call it synthetic reservoir and finite distribution of the production. And typically reservoirs also tend to produce more liquid towards hill than at the top. One other scenario we would consider what if you put packer in the different zones and can also see we can see that it still produces more at the heel because there is lower pressure at the heel due to pressure drop in the pipe than in the toe. So fluid always refreshes. in the top so fluid always tries to find part of minimum resistance and all being jammed into one spot which which can compromise the integrity of the completions due to due to erosion so uh and i will consider show you two case studies first case study is the is 39 000 uh real barrels per day ultra light oil oil production so in this in this case So in this case, it's a 440 feet section. We approximated production profile this way, that one joint, about 40, 39 feet, it produces 25% of the total flow, while the remaining nine joints produce the remaining 75%. So it's a skewed profile through this towards the hill. And you can see that. And you can see the highest risk that last foot of the completion. That's typically what gets eroded. So running through that 2D, 3D scenario, we find the most critical spot. This is the perforation and we see how it pulls, it shows with velocity on over one meter per second maximum, how it pulls flow through these. these through pulse pulse flow in this through production. So the velocity in two millimeter above the screen is 0.17 meters per second, which we consider to be acceptable and based on some field data. But that's the so-called approach velocity. In the gap, the velocity actually reaches 1.8 meters per second. 1.8 meters per second. You see, velocities are not very big, but remember, this competition needs to operate for 20 years, so it's a very long time. And the second, it just needs to open a little. It doesn't take too much, little opening. As soon as it breaches one of the gaps, sand will flow through and accelerate erosion. But these velocities are considered acceptable. are considered acceptable. So we built this completion and that flow rate considered to be high. Typically we don't do completions for that high of high flow rate, but we build it and put them in the Gulf of Mexico. And it's very high pressure, 15,000 psi, 350 F, some harsh conditions and it's already in operation for many years and for many years and there are no sun production. So it's safely, it performs its functions. Sunscreen is functioning well. Second case study is now gas, natural gas. Natural gas is of course has better ability to penetrate through formation. It has lower viscosity, lower density, it flows easier through small channels. through small channels. And here we did the similar study where we considered, so this is flow in the tubing. So when we started the thought, there is no flow in the tubing and then all the flow needs to end up in the tubing. And in the tubing, we see centrally high velocity 80 feet per second, which is normal. The key is in the analog sound flow. analyst sunflow, it builds up in the analys and then suddenly in a jump, this picture you can see a little better, it goes, all goes down in the last foot of the completion. Here we also studied the scenario. What if the well bore is 8.5 inches in diameter or 9.5 inches in diameter? And we studied the effect of the packer. Packer short has absolutely no effect on what's happening. no effect on what's happening at the hill. If you split that completion in half, fluid readjusts and returns back to like the one they were no packer. And but what we can see that if the well bore is bigger, then more flow is coming in the annulus because it's easier to flow through finds part of minimum resistance. So there is 3.85 3.85% of the overall fluid comes through the anodes, which must return in the remaining foot or so of the completion versus 2.62 in the 8.5 inches of wellbar size also also matters for this uniformity. So it's plus 47% of the percent of the flow needs to become spent back that means that's about the amount of this velocity higher velocity we would expect in a bigger in a bigger completion so running similar simulation as as before we are getting velocity of order of 0.7 feet feet per second two millimeter above the screen which and it's five feet per second in the gap these are in the gap. These are also considered to be acceptable velocities. That means all this completion is doing right function and it equalizes velocity. So we try to find the highest velocity in the whole completion. We find it and then we see at what velocity hydrocarbons are being produced. If the velocities are produced if digital losses are acceptable we accept that completion and we can install because failures of completion could be extremely it's extremely costly it's a very it designed to produce for 20 years and if it's if it breaches it has to be redone it could be quite expensive so in conclusion high rent high rate standalone screens in open hall completions provide better economics for production provide better economics, lower productivity, and mitigate erosion risk. Extensive sun retention and erosion tests are conducted to determine optimal screen size. What this study showed is multi-scale 3D, 2D, CFD and single-well modeling methodologies to enable quantifying carogen risk. And we showed case studies and insulation history, which offer proof of the technology. At this particular stage of the study, particular stage of the study we only considered the velocities we knew what is the safe velocity so we had a velocity based base practice now we already did a few few studies when we explicitly modeled the erosion on the screen so rather than having velocity based base approach we had computed the actual erosion so and more information on this study could be found in the sp Study could be found in the SPE paper, which was published this year. Thanks for your attention, and I'll be happy to answer any questions. Let's thank our speaker, Gosha Choshua. Thank you. If there are no questions, can I ask question, Goja? We have also done similar work on completion modelings. But this is very interesting. You're looking at the screen. So you're already sending. So you're already sanding, sand, you know, are you looking at the onset of fines migrations and sand production, or you'd assume that the sand was already in the in your stream for erosion modeling? Or you're also looking at what operating conditions you will do finds migration. Okay, so for this particular study, it was only velocity-based. But what you're talking about, this last company, we already did study. For that, we have our internal rules. We have our internal rules which says typical completion produces so much sand. But yeah, you're correct. We had a customer, one of the customers which came to us and they gave us sand size and sand distribution. They measured it. Typically what happens, even if we're building a new completion, this field already has some history. So they had So they had, they know what sand size or distribution they had and what is the concentration of that sand. So talking about that sand. So there are two ways. If we don't have any information, we assume our standards, this is API-based standard on. based standard on for production of the sand. But if there is an information measurements from the same field, we can use actual sand conditions, both on the size and on the size distribution basis this curve we can use and on the concentration. Well, thank you. Another, this has been a pretty fascinating talk. Fascinating talk in terms of learning about the technologies of the downhole equipments that are put in the oil and gas wells. So, we have your contact information, but for the sake of time, let me thank you again and try to kind of bring in the close to this workshop. But before I do that.
