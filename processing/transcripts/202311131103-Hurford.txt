Next, we are very happy to have Amy Herbert from Memorial University, who is an academic, but who is extremely engaged in providing advice to governments. And I'm going to stop myself from going on for lengthy introductions. So, please. Introduction. So please go ahead. Thanks, David. And I'm a bit nervous if I don't touch my keyboard enough. I'm going to lose this whole thing. So, Irene has been very good at the support. Thanks for having me here. I'm very excited to be here. I wanted to talk about four different ways that modeling can support regions that are implementing an elimination strategy. So these are the subheadings. Models that can be fit to data in regions that have implemented. Fit to data in regions that have implemented elimination? How do you do scenario modeling for these regions? The theory to support elimination and data and analysis needs. And I might skip over number four because I feel like I probably have too many slides. I wanted to start by defining elimination. So elimination is where you have incidence reduced to zero in a given area. In a given area. If you eliminate everywhere, that's called eradication. And elimination contrasts with mitigation and suppression. So suppression, you just have a low incidence. Mitigation, you're trying to manage for some target, like keeping below hospital capacity. So, just so we all remember, elimination is where we have no cases for some period in time. And often when I talk about it, And often, when I talk about it, it's no community cases. It might be travel-related cases. I don't know how I'm going to get through the talk like this, but I think I know the problem. I think we can fix it pretty easily. Yeah, it's probably batteries. Because you're on a battery, it keeps shutting it off. See, I should remember what my next slide is. Yeah, so thanks. So, elimination, that's when you don't have any community cases. This is what it looks like. Community cases. This is what it looks like for Atlantic Canada and the territories that there was enough data for. So travel-related cases are the ones that appear below the black solid line. In Newfoundland and Labrador, actually, so those are importations below the black solid line. The dotted line, those are close contacts of travelers. These are usually people that are in isolation, like the family members of travelers. So everything that's below the dotted line is a travel. Below the dotted line is a travel-related case. There's an outbreak, a community outbreak here in February 2021 in Newfoundland and Labrador. Here in these graphs, I've said what is the percentage of reported daily cases that are travel-related. So for Newfoundland and Labrador, it's 77%. Most of the reported cases were travel-related. And not only that, it's periods where every single case is travel-related. And then most of the cases are community cases. Of the cases are community cases, and then you go back to every single case is travel-related. So, you know, we talk about elimination as having occurred in Atlantic Canada. I think certainly from the graphs, you see that in Newfoundland, Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island. New Brunswick has quite a bit of community cases, although like low numbers. And there's just actually not a lot of cases in the two territories where there were data. Word data. So that's what it looks like. And now I can't advance my slides, but we want to imagine a model that. I feel like I'm co-presenting now. I don't know. I'm sorry. We want to imagine, like imagine you created MacFan, or some, you did actually, some of you in the audience create MacFan, and you want to fit it to this type of data. That's a community service model. It's not really set up to fit to this type of data. Set up to fit to this type of data, but if you're from Atlantic Canada, you probably feel a little bit left out that everyone is getting their outbreaks, their COVID data fitted. Okay, so when you're working with data from Atlantic Canada, the territories where there was elimination, I really think of this as you need three models that you have to put together. There's the importation model, which for me was trying to predict travel-related cases. Travel-related cases. So, usually, importation models, your variables that are going into it, are reported cases in all the regions, inbound travel volumes. And when I did this, I also considered testing because I was trying to predict travel-related cases and who was getting tested was a variable that went into that. You have your community spread model, which is something that you're probably familiar with, these SEIAR models. And then you have a model that links those two layers. Links those two layers. So you need some kind of description of how your travel-related cases are going to get out into the community and start a community spread model. So there's actually three models that you need to do, and maybe the most important part is the link between the travel-related case model and the community model. This is one of these mechanistic importation models that I did. Models that I did, you see, it has these spikes in it, which seem really weird, but that's when there were known exposure notifications for flights. And so, a lot of people were getting tested. So, you'd expect to have a lot more, or at least the model was expecting to have a lot more cases reported then because a lot more testing was being done. So, there's a lot of data that goes into this about mobility and infection prevalence in source provinces. The yellow is if they're of domestic origin. is if they're of domestic origin, the travel-related cases. The gray is if they're from international origin, the province was reporting the travel-related cases in this way, so I thought it might as well predict them that way from this mechanistic model. And then down here, we try to come up with a good model for travel-related cases, reported travel-related cases. And you can do a lot of epidemiological detail like that, or you could just try to do it statistically, and that's what's going. And that's what's called the BEST model, like doing it statistically. And this is monthly reported travel-related cases. The BEST model, which is a statistical one, explains 55% of the variants. The epidemiological model is worse, quite a bit worse. So I'm not really sure if it's worth going into so much mechanistic detail for your travel-related case model. And for international origin travel-related cases, it's just there's absolutely no predictive event. It's just there's absolutely no predictive ability for any models. The community spread model, you're probably familiar with these. This is the one time that I was able to do it at the time when I was helping public health. So this was an outbreak of the alpha variant in February 2021. So those are the first two models that I talk about, but I think what's maybe most important is trying to connect your travel-related cases to the Your trap-related cases to the risk of a community outbreak starting. And this is all the things that, this is trying to summarize everything that might go into that, the chance that an infected traveler starts a community outbreak. So this is a seven-day rolling average of importations to Newfoundland and Labrador, and some colors for what variants they were likely to be. And then can you? And then community members over time will get vaccinated. So, if an infected traveler comes into contact with them, then they're probably not going to start a community outbreak. So, over time, people get vaccinated, and that makes it less likely that an outbreak from Delta or Alpha Verne can happen. But during, this only goes through to the start of 2022, so there's no, not many people were boosted at that point. So, there's almost no protection against Omicron. And then the other. Omicron. And then the other element of that is your non-pharmaceutical intervention. So that also plays a role in whether there's likely to be a spillover. So there's a mechanistic model behind all that. If I put it together, then the model can predict the weekly expected number of infections that are spread from travelers to community members. So that's the prediction. And then at the bottom are where there were actually community outbreaks that happened in Newfoundland and Labrador. Labrador. This Mount Pearl outbreak is happening at a time when it seems like there was pretty low risk of traffic getting into the capital. So I mentioned that, you know, if you're from Newfoundland and Labrador, you might feel left out that it would be hard to fit a model-like Mac Pen to your data. But actually, Steve helps us, so Steve did help us, and we did. So, this is a Mac Pen fit to. This is a matte pen fit to the data from Nicola Labrador. This is work by Zara Mohamedi. There's really two models here. There's an importation model and there's a community spread model. And there's a pretty simple spillover model, which is just that you turn on the community spread model where the dashed lines are. So you start off with a community spread model, but you don't have any. Spread modal, but you don't have any infected individuals. And then, when this dashed line happens, I mean, we kind of know that there had to be a community outbreak that got started where the dashed lines are. So we just put the initial condition in the community spread model so that it starts a community outbreak. And then when you get over here, where there's not much cases anymore, we set the community spread model back down to zero. And so it's kind of And so it's kind of like a switching on and off, like you have an importation model, and that's on most of the time. And in terms of how I'm thinking about what is the R of T at those times, I mean, I'm thinking the R of T, the community spread rate over here, like it's actually bigger than one, but it's just that there's no infection in the community, so you don't know what the community spread rate is at that point. So here, I don't really think R of T is equal to zero at this point. Is equal to zero at this point. It's just that there's no infection in the community. So, this is a description of the importation community spread switch model. It's just the idea of switching between an importation model and a community spread model. And in terms of why you want to do it like this, so you can get some really undesirable dynamics if, say, you try to. If, say, you try to fit a stochastic model and you treat the start date of the community outbreak as being uncertain. So, this could be an example of something that you might think is a good idea to fit to the to, you might think a stochastic model like that is a good idea to fit to data. It's kind of representing the dynamics that you would see in an elimination zone where you see these outbreaks and then you see no. These outbreaks, and then you see no cases. If your underlying model was stochastic in that way and you tried to fit it to thanks so much, Irina, I don't know why stochastic. Do we need another laptop that's not? It's my laptop, but we will switch next time. This is my laptop. That's fine. But I think we'll try to use their laptop. Yeah. Let's just make this one. Should I abort and try this later? No, just keep it if Irene is willing to keep doing the presentation. Yeah. Yeah, getting some good spots in, it's good. All right, so if this is your stochastic model, and this is one realization, and this is another realization of a stochastic model that's representing the type of elimination dynamics that you get, what you really don't want to do is do that a thousand times and then take the mean prevalence at each point in time, and you'll get this black line. And so you can't be treating the stored data of community outbreaks as uncertain. You can kind of guess what they are, and you should use that information in your model fitting. And you should use that information in your model fitting. And the other thing that you can't really do is you can't leave a fractional number of individuals that are infected in the community. You need to, this happens with differential equation models. You have a really small number of infecteds, and if you release restrictions at that point, as you might want to do in an elimination strategy, you'll get the infection coming back. But yeah, so maybe you should just teach me what to do. It's okay. How about. To do. It's okay. How about you just keep going and I will just stand here and hope for the best. I'll just hang out over here. Okay. Oh, there's a chair there. I don't mind. Oh, yeah. You can put the loose connector or at least a loose connector with a HDL. Because it's plugged in power for sure and it's working. So it's not the battery shutting it off. I'll just hang out here. There is a chair there. Let's just hang it around. To have it around? Oh, no, no. Don't worry, buddies, but I'm trying to remember what's my next point. So yeah, so I don't know. If you don't want to use the switch idea, then you could just fit the community outbreaks separately like they did with Mount Furrow, but I feel like that's less fun. Yeah, if you're okay with that. Yeah, totally. Okay, and we can also do scenario modeling. And so this is just an illustration of what a scenario might look like for a region. Might look like for a region that has elimination of these solid bands here. This is travel-related cases, so we've eliminated the community outbreak then. When you have a community outbreak here, it's kind of based on the number of travel-related cases. So when there's more, you're more likely to start your community outbreak. That's part of the spillover model that underlies this. And RFT, like the community spread rate, it's bigger than one for all of that situation. It's bigger than one for all of that simulation, except once the case prevalence gets up to 100, then you implement strict non-pharmaceutical interventions with RFT less than one, and you eliminate the outbreak until the number of cases gets to zero. So you could do scenario modeling for a place implementing elimination that way. Some good ideas, if you wanted to report your results, would be to report the average number of community. Report the average number of community outbreaks that happen across multiple scenarios like this. So we got one, two, three, four, five. The average size of the community outbreak, and the average number of days without community cases. A really bad way to report your results would be to take the average prevalence across all your simulation runs. And you also don't want to get super carried away about the date that these outbreaks start. Like this is just supposed to be illustrative of a time series that could have happened. A time series that could have happened, but you don't read a lot into the actual dates. You can make a spillover model by thinking about your travel-related cases, and the travel-related cases are at the top in the black. And then I kind of, this is just based on the idea that by the time the travel-related case gets reported, there's probably been a delay for testing and reporting. So I imagine that those individuals were infectious in the community. Individuals were infectious in the community for five days prior, and then that's the green. The green is kind of representing how much infection pressure you have in the community due to infectious travelers. And then if you want to make your spillover model and figure out, like, how should I sample a date from when the community outbreak starts, you could just use this empirical cumulative density approach where you just take green and you make it. You just take green and you make it cumulative and you scale it to one and then you choose random number between zero and one and then you map it down and that tells you what is the date that you should start a community outbreak and you can a priori decide how many you want to have. That's a way of doing scenario modeling. Or I think an even better thing to do for your spillover model would be to work in these ideas of spillover depending on pharmaceutical interventions. Pharmaceutical interventions and non-pharmaceutical interventions. So make this graph into one of those empirical cumulative functions and get the dates that way. I think that would be a good idea. This is a picture by my former postdoc, Maria Martignoni, and I think it was really insightful and has framed a lot of our thinking on elimination. So this is kind of the difference between elimination and Of the difference between elimination and mitigation. And in the red, you have severe non-pharmaceutical interventions, and in the green, you have really relaxed ones. And the difference, really, between the elimination region and the mitigation region is how often you're having these spillover events happening really frequently in the region that has the mitigation. But for elimination, the time between your community spillover events. Community spillover events is larger than the time it takes you to get rid of your outbreak through non-pharmaceutical interventions in the right. So if I take that idea a little bit further, this is kind of a toy model example, but I think the toy model helps you scaffold your thinking so that you could, these are going to be the underlying dynamics that maybe you could add in some region-specific factors like contact tracing. like contact tracing. These are just the toy model that illustrates the parameter space for where you have elimination versus suppression versus mitigation. So if you're in a region where the best you can do is, or the best you want to do, is to get the community spread rate to be some value that's still above one, then you're in a mitigation region. If you can get the Can get the community spread rate to be less than one, then you're either doing suppression or elimination. And it just depends on how many days are expected between the community outbreaks as to whether you're going to have a period with no cases and be in the elimination zone. The other thing is there's sort of different levels of elimination. So, the top blue line, you have a period where you have no community cases, but it's like very, very short. Very short. So these other lines are the one-to-one. The one here indicates that the length of time when you have no cases and the length of time when you have cases are equal. So when you go down on those lines, you're in more favorable elimination zones. And then eradication is off to the side there because I think if everyone globally is eliminating, then you're going to have a lot of days between community outbreaks. So, Newfoundland and Labrador, we had the outbreak in March 2020. Like, over the period of a year, I think we had two to three community outbreaks. So, you know, maybe we're somewhere in here, like expect 180 days between community outbreaks. So, there's quite a lot of space in there to be able to implement an elimination strategy. Okay, I am going to skip lots of slides now, but my slides will get uploaded to the To the hopefully, so you'll be able to see the slides and all that that I just skipped over. There was some good stuff in there. So, all right, so what are my key take-homes here? In a region that's implementing an elimination strategies, decision makers are going to want to know how non-pharmaceutical interventions are impacting the number of cases. But there's actually no community cases. No community cases. So, like, that's really hard to know what you're supposed to do. You can't really estimate a community spread rate when you don't even have any, like, usually we're estimating the beta from fitting to cases, so you don't even have any community spread. And you kind of know if you do things like capacity limits, it's going to change the community spread rate. But you're trying to answer that question without even ever really getting any data to estimate that parameter. That parameter. And you're also really in this catch-22 because if they ask you about an intervention and you say, well, like it's probably going to mean that we still aren't going to have any community cases, then that's kind of unremarkable because you currently don't have any community cases. Or if you say that you do something like relax an MPI that's in place, that it's going to predict that you have some cases, then that seems like a disaster. So you kind of don't want to do that. So, you kind of don't want to do that either. So, it's very hard to, it's a very hard situation to be in. The decision variables when you're trying to work with data from a region that's doing elimination are different. I think what you're interested in presenting to decision makers as considerations are the spillover risk, the expected number of community outbreaks over some long time period, and the expected number of days where you could. Number of days where you could ease restrictions because there's no community cases. I think those are more interesting decision variables, they're more relevant decision variables than doing modeling that predicts infection prevalence cases. You need to thoughtfully link your importation and community spread model. It doesn't really work out if you just let importations happen as a random variable. That doesn't work out. I'm sure that works fine. Out. I'm sure that works fine when you have community cases. It doesn't really work out when you have elimination. I think the spillover model is really important because it links between the data that you have, which are travel-related cases, and the community. And we get asked all these questions about how do characteristics of the community affect our risk. And so the spillover model lets you link between the data that you do have and properties of your community, which is what you get asked questions about. Is what you get asked questions about. And I think we overall need models that can recommend elimination, like the colorful plot that I showed at the end, to show that there is some parameter space where elimination can happen. We need models that can recommend elimination. I don't know that there are, that ever really was a recommendation prior to the pandemic, but we saw examples of it being celebrated as a good strategy. So there's a bit of a mismatch, I think, between the theory and I think between the theory and what happened. We also need guidelines to support elimination strategies, so, things like criteria for reopening, travel bubbles, and other things. I think this is necessary because decision makers did this, it would seem, that decision makers in Atlantic, Canada, and the territories implemented an elimination strategy. And I feel like, as scientists, we can back them up with some theory that shows. Them up with some theory that shows that it's a reasonable strategy. I think it's also necessary for health equity. Some vulnerable groups might have more at stake for trying to eliminate. And if we just ask questions without considering those groups, then we're maybe not going to recommend elimination, but it might be necessary for vulnerable groups to be recommending stronger strategies. To be recommending stronger strategies than suppression and mitigation. So, thank you to my co-presenter. So, some of these ideas and figures are by Maria Magnoni and Zara Mohamedi. I didn't list everyone's names on the slide because we've had a huge amount of support during the pandemic. Rather than just write the names on the slide, I just wanted to Names on the slide. I just wanted to do this picture, which I think maybe embodies the spirit of how much I appreciate the support, maybe. So it's like this is the little support over here, and this is me over there. I really, yeah, I work at Memorial. I live on an island, and it was part of the community through CanMod and the infectious disease community that was hugely helpful for me. People literally bailed me out by having Zoom meetings with me. Meetings with me. So, like, that was just such a huge thing for me during the pandemic. A lot of people that were part of that are here. So, thank you. And soon, I'll be thank you.
