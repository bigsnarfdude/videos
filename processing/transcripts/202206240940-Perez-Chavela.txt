Okay, this is a joint work in progress with my colleague from Japan, Toshiki Fujiguara. So, let me remember very quickly the notion of relative equilibria on the Euclidean plane. So, a relative equilibria is a special solution of a system of n positive particles, point particles, of course. Point particles, of course, where each particle is rotating with uniform velocity around the center of mass. The mutual distance among the bodies remain constant for all time. This means that all bodies behave as if they belong to the same rigid body. So for the Euclidean The classical Euclidean tribody problem, there are exactly five relative equilibria: tricholinear or Euler relative equilibria, and two equilateral triangle shape or Lagrangian relative equilibria. So in the for the for the Euclidean plane, for example, in the tree body, if you have this situation here, you choose. This situation here, you choose the center of mass, and in order to find the relative equilibria, you have to look for a particular velocity, the uniform velocity, which do this effect. So these particles with the velocity are rotating uniformly and always are in the and always are in this collinear configuration in this case. Okay. When we extend the concept of relative equilibria to the sphere, the main problem is that we don't have the center of mass as a first integral. So if you don't have the center of mass as a first integral, how you choose the rotation nexus? The rotation nexus. So it could be a difficult problem. So in this talk, I will show you a new method to study this relative equilibrium. And the source of this research were two questions. The first question is The first question is: Is there any first integral that can determine the candidates for the rotation axis for a shape given by the R angles? This sigma ij is the R angle between the particle i and the particle j. And the other question is given a shape, what are the main properties that the rotation axis must have? That the rotation axis must have. So the answer to the first question is yes. These two new integrals are two components of the angular momentum. And the answer to the second question is the main properties are given by the inertia tensor. So I will spend the rest of my talk explain these two answers. Okay. Okay, so first the notations. So I use spherical coordinates. Given a point, x, y, z, we write in this way, classical spherical coordinates, theta is between zero and pi, and phi is between zero and two pi. The curve length between the two points is. The two points is given by the distance between the points that we write in spherical coordinates. The arc angle sigma ij that I mentioned before is the minor arc length divided by r and it's equals to the angle between the two points seen from the origin of the shear. So the r length. So the R length is between 0 and Ï€ by definition, and doing some spherical trigonometry, we find these relations. This relation in particular is very important for us because you can write the R length in terms of Are length in terms of the spherical angles theta and phi. Okay, well, I will apply it a lot in the rest of the of the talk. So, as usual, we write the Lagrangian for the actually, this Lagrangian is for the end-body problem, it doesn't matter, but I will focus just. matter but i i will focus just on for the case n equals three and we have the the lagrangian uh kinetic energy plus potential energy this is the kinetic energy written in spherical coordinates and this is the potential energy so i will use that or let us observe that this potential it's the sum of m i m j times this Times this function here, any function, which only depends on the mutual distances, the R length between the mass i and the mass j. And this represents derivatives with respect to t as usual, and this prime represents the derivative of the we only use for the potential. only use for the for the potential the derivative with respects to the argument that in this case has this form and i will assume that this derivative is negative so we are in an attractive problem okay so the angular momentum fortunately it's a first integral on this It's a first integral for these systems. And we write, and this is because the Lagrangian is invariant on the action of this group. So we write the angular momentum, write each expression from the angular momentum in terms of the spherical coordinates. Then, Then, definition. I will give the definition in terms of the spherical coordinates. So, a relative equilibrium is a solution for the questions of motion which satisfy that this angle is zero. This means that the particle is rotating on the same height. And these angles here, phi i and phi j equal zero. phi i and phi j equals zero. This means that all the angles are equal and this is represents the angular velocity. So by definition phi k of the derivative of phi k is constant. This is will be the angular velocity. So the motion or phi k has this form if you are in a in a relative equilibrium. In a relative equality. If omega is zero, we have a fixed point of the system. Okay, so we have two kinds of relative equilibrium: the collinear ones, which means that all the embodies are on the same geodesic. If this is not the case, we call not. Is not the case, we call non-collinear relative equilibrium for the for n equals three. If for the collinear case, we call Eulerian relative equilibria and the other case we call Lagrangian relative equilibria. We will explain in one moment why this name. So The angular moment. The angular momentum plays a main role in this analysis. So we will fix the rotation axis as the z axis, but we don't know where is the z axis, okay? So in this case, the relative equilibria has this has this form zero zero cz. zero C set where these are the coordinates for c sex. Here we substitute the derivative by this parameter omega and we observe the following. This is a nice observation because if we take the limit when the sphere is almost the Euclidean plane, we recover. Euclidean plane, we recover the center of mass. So taking the limit, we recover this expression here, but this is expression for the center of mass in X and this is expression for the center of mass in Y. So transiting from the Euclidean plane to the sphere, we lose two integrals, center of mass, but we gain two new integrals given by Cx and C and C y. Cx and Cy. On the Euclidean case, these two components are identically zero, so it doesn't matter. Well. So when you study the rigid body, it's very important the inertial tensor plays a main role. So it's natural to think that the That the inertia tensor also plays a very important role in this analysis. The inertia tensor is a symmetric real matrix defined by this expression here, where this is the inertia around the x a x a the x is x the x is y and the The X is X, the X is Y, and the X is Z, and these are the expression in spherical coordinates for the mixed terms. I don't know if I am doing something wrong. Well. So, since the inertia tensor is a symmetric real matrix, this eigenvalue problem has three eigenvalues and three mutually orthogonal eigenvectors. Mutually orthogonal eigenvectors. These eigenvectors are called the principal axis. The condition that the terms, but these special terms, so that this term i x set, which it's equals to iz x and y z z, which it's equals to y set y, it's zero, represents these two entries in the matrix. Entries in the matrix, but this is the condition for these components of the angular momentum to be zero. So we have the inertia tensor is partially diagonalized in this form. This means that if you solve this problem, then you have the excess order of rotation. But this problem. But this problem could be difficult. Not difficult exactly, but it implies a lot of tedious computation. So it's not at the end, it's not easy to manage it. And the set axis is one of the principal axes of the inertia tensor, therefore, the problem of finding Source, therefore, the problem of finding a candidate for the set axis through a given shape. So, if you given by sigma ij comes down to computing the inertia tensor as solving this problem, you have many symmetries. If you can diagonalize the matrix, then it's easy. But this is just, you speculate about one solution, take the inertia tensor, and then we can check if. Attention, and then we can check if this is a relative equilibria or not. Okay, well, I forgot to mention that when you take one spherical coordinate systems, the definition is independent of this coordinate system that you are using. You can change and the same notion persists. Okay, so what are the geometry for the collinear relative? the collinear relative equilibrium well i could take the as i i told you the rotation else axis the rotation axis always will be the set axis and i have to look locate what is where is this set x's so uh so for the collinear for the collinear case we have two possible we have only two possibilities the first possibility is that The first possibility is that all bodies are on the equator, on this geodesic, or the bodies are on a rotating meridian. It's not possible that the bodies are on a different geodesic because by the physical laws, so you cannot maintain this perfect equilibrio, equilibria between. Equilibria between the attractive forces with the centrifugal ones. So we have these two possibilities. When the particles are on the equator, actually, we don't need any new methods. It's just geometry because this is the simple case. So I will escape. I will escape from this case and I only analyze what happens when the bodies are on a rotating meridian. Region. So for this case, we enlarge the range from the for the angle angle theta to minus pi and pi. And this condition we can is simplified to this expression here, one. So this expression only depends. Expression only depends on the angle theta k as usual. But let me denote as theta ij, as usual, the difference between theta i and theta j. So for the collinear configuration, we obtain that this arc length is represented, but this quantity here. It is collinear. So we take So we can take independent shapes theta chi1. So for the collinear case, if you are in the n-body problem, you have n minus one independent variables. Okay, so this quantity here, using some computations, can be written in this form. be written in this form a times cosine two times the arc length equals zero where this this a has this form here so what is interesting is that if you compare this equation with this equation we can translate one shape to the To the is the relation is a translation between the arg length quantities to the configuration variables. So you can pass to one shape to the relative. I will use this. We are looking just for the shape and then take this rotation axis, use this translation. Use this translation formula and then we get the relative eclipse. It's similar to the Euclidean case. To the Euclidean case, well, it's a parallelist, which with the shape is like if you determine the central configurations, and then using these equations, the translation formula, you find the relative equilibrium. So we have this result here. Actually, these are the formulas for the translation between the arc length and the configuration configuration configuration variables. variables. This appears x equals plus minus one because well we have two extra principal x's for the inertia tensor. But when we study the questions of motions, we can determine exactly what is the sign that we are we have to use. Okay. Good. Good. So, what happens with the geometry for the Lagrangian, not collinear, relative collinear? Well, this could be in general a difficult problem. But fortunately, we found a matrix J, this matrix J is here, and this matrix J is similar to the inertia. Is similar to the inertia tensor. Actually, this was not too easy. We have a lot of computation, but finally discovered that this metric is similar to the inertia tensor I. And the idea of the proof is the following. So we calculate the characteristic. Calculate the characteristic polynomial of the inertia tensor I, and that this polynomial is its, as I told before, this definition is independent of the spherical coordinate system that you are using. So we discover that this is the clever point here. We discover this new spherical coordinate system where we put coordinate system where we put this mass m3 here also in the north pole of the of the shear here are these arc lengths and this angular angle alpha which is given in terms of the arc length so in this in this new spherical coordinate system we compute the the characteristical polynomial for the inertia tensor i Inertia tensor I and then we discover that this characteristical polynomial is exactly the same polynomial that the characteristical polynomial for the matrix J. But then you have two real symmetric matrix we have real Real, we have real AM values and mutually orthogonally eigenvectors. So this means that these two matrices must be similar. So, but this with this matrix, with this matrix, we can do a lot of computations. Okay, so So actually this we find this this eigenvector in fact we we have that for Lagrangian relative equilibria on the sphere if omega is different different from zero then this vector is an eigenvector of lambda and actually this And actually, this eigenvector of lambda will be the rotation axis for the Lagrangian relative equilibrium. So we have found the rotation axis. And well, this part here only depends on the R length. And this is R the translation formula that we call. Because if you have, this means that. You have this means that if you have the shape, you have the corresponding relative equilibrium because, and you find exactly where is the axis, the rotation axis. And actually, this CK is a normalized eigenvector, which is useful for the computations. And here, this capital M. This capital M is the total mass of the system. Okay. Now, what are the questions of motion? Just for the, let me start with the colliminor, with the Euler and relative equilibria on an rotating meridian. So after study the geometry, we obtain the questions of motions for an oil. Motions for an Eulerian relative equilibria on an rotating meridian, and they are given by this expression here. If A is equal zero, we obtain these nice expressions here. But all these expressions only depends on our length. And these are the translation formula. If you have the shape, you can find the corresponding product of equilibrium. Corresponding productive equilibrium. Well, I don't like to enter in the small details because it could be really boring. So let me present just the ideas. So first result, easy result is that for any three masses, Three masses. The equilateral triangle means that these arc lengths are the same, and it's equals to 2 pi over 3. This equilateral triangle generates a relative equilibria on an unrotating mirror. Which was natural. Now, let me write the previous equations, these previous equations in These previous equations in a more compact way, but there are exactly the same quantities here. So I will write in this form: f of j, it's equals m i m j the sine of this arc length times the derivative of the potential with respect to this argument. And g i j is this expression here, which only depends on the Here, which only depends on the arc length. So, all these expressions, these are exactly the equations that I have here, all these equations, but written in a compact form. So, again, this formula, this equation, only depends on the arc length. So, this is a formula. So, this is a formula just for the shape, which is more easy to compute. And then, and this is the formula. I will show now. If you have the formula for the shape, and if you find the shape, then we have the translation formula, and then you get the relative equilibria corresponding to this shape. You can see the masses are equal, for instance, one of the masses. For instance, one of the buses could not fall, yeah, but otherwise it was found. I will show one example in exactly this example in some minutes. Okay, so this is an uh just a comment because if I shave on a rotating nerve and On a rotating nerve and generates a relative equilibria, then if you take the potential, the repulsive potential, you also have the same result. Actually, the corresponding two configurations differ by an overall angle of pi over 2 or 90 degrees. So, the theorem, the condition for the shape is given by this expression here. But this is a necessary. Here, but this is a necessary and sufficient condition for a shape to satisfy the equations of motions and then to generate a relative equilibrium. So, you have to solve this algebraic equation, and you get the shape, and with the shape, you obtain the relative equilibrium. The proof is, well, if they satisfy the conditions, it's obvious that this determinant is zero because I take for the Is zero because I take for that. And in the inverse, well, we have several cases. For example, if all the terms are zero, this is the trivial case which corresponds to one equilateral triangle. And if no, we have to, what happens if this is zero, etc. No, it's a technical proof, that's all. Now, what are the equations of What are the equations of motions for a Lagrangian relative equilibrium? So the conditions to have a Lagrangian relative equilibria are the following. So the sign of theta k must be different from zero because we can prove that if they don't satisfy these conditions, then you are on one meridian. But if you are on one meridian, this case was. On one memory, this case was distributed before it's collinear. So, these are the conditions to have a Lagrangian relative equilibrium. So, and this and we have this trivial result, which says that the three bodies form a Lagrangian relative. If three bodies are in a Lagrangian-related equilibria, so the bodies must be on the same hemisphere. So, it's not. So it's not possible to have some bodies on the north hemisphere and some bodies on the south hemisphere. But this is what is interesting is this is for any attractive potential. It doesn't matter. It's which only depends on the motor distances, of course. And why the name what we call extended Lagrangian relative equilibria to the non-collinear? Relative equilibria to the non-collinear relative equilibria. Well, because if you consider the limit when r goes to infinity, we obtain this expression here that this the derivative with respects to this argument, it's almost the same that the derivative with respect to this argument, and it's always the same with respect to the other neutral distance. Name this arc length. This arc length is almost the same. So, in the limit case, you have an equilateral triangle, which is the usual Lagrangian relative equilibrium. So, this result also is, I like because it's in general for any potential. So, for any potential, which depends on the mutual distance, an equilateral triangle is a Lagrangian relative equilibrium. Is a Lagrangian relative equilibria if and only if the masses are equals and the angles are equals. That's all. With Flory and Manuel Santo Prete, we found these results when we for the cotangent potential when we put the collateral triangles on one parallel. Okay. So the questions of motions, this is also one technical part. The questions of motion for Lagrange and relative equilibrium are equivalent to these expressions here. But this means this quantity is positive. So this means that there are not Lagrangian relative equilibria. not Lagrangian relative equilibria for repulsive forces. We can have collinear but not Lagrangian relative equilibria for any potential. Oops. But for this case, n equals three on the sphere, we can compute exactly what is the eigenvector, that is what is the rotation axis. What is the rotation axis? What is the eigenvalue? And what is the rotation velocity? So, which is this lemma and this corollary? And actually, if I put all together, we get this theorem for the Lagrangian relative equilibrium. So, this theorem gives us necessary and sufficient conditions for a shape given. Conditions for a shape given by the R lengths in terms of the cosine, of course, to form an Lagrangian relative equilibria. And this condition is that this metric J has the Eigen vector C, which is the principal axis or the rotation axis, the Eigen value lambda, and the angular velocity omega squared, as I show here. So we have exactly the form. So let me answer to. Answer to SQL. Of course, if you want to take examples, you have to fix the potential. But now, actually, this was the inspiration for us to work in the corvette problem. The corvette problem is that you have the Euclidean plane, and then if you curve this Euclidean plane, This Euclidean plane, you have the problem on the sphere or the problem on the hyperbolic space. So in particular, if the curvature is positive, we have the problem on the sphere. And we have worked with several colleagues, mainly with Florin, on this problem. But in this problem, we found some families of relative equilibrium. So the potential for the positive correlate problem is given by this expression here. We call cotangent because this after reduction, you have this form, but this is given by the cotangent of the The cotangent of the distance of the arc lengths among the particles. But finally, you have this expression here in spherical coordinates as before. And the derivative has this form, which means that we are in an attractive problem. So, in this case, how we use How we use this method. For instance, consider here at the North Pole, as you told me, the mass M3. More easy. Assume that this mass is 3, this mass is 2. And the arc length is pi over 6. So the question is where I can put the third mass with mass one. Third mass with mass one, such that the shape satisfies the equations of motions to have a shape. So the answer is that if this mass is three, if this mass is two, and this arc length is pi over six, then we have six positions for the mass m3 equals one to have a shape which satisfies the equations of motions. Which satisfies the questions of emotions. Now, which are the corresponding relative equilibria? So we have to fix the how you find we can find we find the rotation axis, put the rotation axis on the direction, is a set axis, and then these masses are rotating here. So this is really. rotating here so this is rating here here and here okay for the for the second shape for the second shape which is this so consider mass three mass two and mass one and then the corresponding relative equilibrium is is this here so they are rotating always around the z axis but this is the But this is the corresponding relative equilibrium. I think it is the answer to your question. Yes. Okay. And also, well, for the other positions, this corresponds to not to the shape, to the real relative equilibrium with just three different masses. Okay, yes, yes. Okay, yes, yes, thank you. Okay, so this is this is just for the equal masses case. So for the equal masses case, one question that we ask to us, one question is, it's possible if you have equal masses, it is possible to have scaling triangles which A triangles which form a relative equilibria, and the answer was yes. This is one example. This here is one example of one of one scaling collinear relative equilibrium. Okay, and this these two, this also is curious because if you have isosceles relative equilibria, then if this is Then, if this three mass, if the angle is smaller than 2 pi over 3, and of course, this cannot be pi over 2 because you have one singularity. But in this case, this term mass must be on the north pole. But if the angle is between 2 pi over 3 and pi, this term mass. And pi, this terms must be on the on the equator. And they form the isosceles collinear relative equilibria. And well, let me escape. This is one open question, for example. It's consider the collinear, the collinear relative equilibria, the number of the number of relative of the number of Eulerian collinear relative equilibrium is finite or not for some time we we thought that the maximum number was six but Toshiaki found one example with eight possibilities so now one potential The cotangent cotangent, yeah, in the corval problem, yes, and then for the contact for the equals messes case, so let me escape here. So what's happening with the Lagrange and relative equilibrium for the Lagrangian, we we can have this situation because uh well, this is the Well, this is the shape and isothis. Sorry. So yeah, so this is for the cotangen, collinear, so here for the Okay, this is for Lagrangian relative equilibrium. So, for Lagrangian, here is the matrix J explicitly, and we are looking for isosceles Lagrangian relative equilibria. So, this is matrix J. We compute the hem values, the other I HEM vectors. We have all the information. So, and with this information, we get We get the pictures, no, the Lagrangian, the corresponding Lagrangian relative equilibria. And well, no, for the Italian questions or comments for Ernesto in the room. In the room, see, I have a question. In the case of the non-collinears, sorry, when the bodies are in the equator. Equator. Equator, how many is the same that the planet and body problem they are calling uh cocircular? Yes, yes. Yes, it is. Actually, on the equator it's very easy. Actually, on the equator, it's very easy. It's the solution is that for the collinear, you have this case, but you have at least three rush for ordering. And for the equal masses case, that's all. But if the masses are different, no, I don't know exactly. Exactly. We escape for that case because another question of or comment for Ernesto? I have a question. Yes. Yes, yes, Ernesto. You mentioned at the beginning that, I mean, you were writing a formula for any number of masses. So maybe have you explored simple cases for more masses? For more masses? Well, for the collinear, it's possible to do the same analysis that here. If you want to find specific samples, you have to fix the potential. But with this method, you can find many new families of relative equilibria in the collinear case. For the non-collinear. For the non-collinear case, it could be a very difficult problem because if you don't have the rotation axis, you have to solve the eigenvalue problem that I put at the beginning, but for a general matrix. And this could be a very difficult problem. Yes, yes, that's what I thought. Yes, yes, that's what I thought. Okay. Well, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you, Soneto. Another comment or question for Ramasto. We think you he wants to say something or no? We think again to Ernesto.
