Okay, everybody. Now we're delighted to have Eliana Firumati, and he's going to tell us about both the automorphisms of special groups. Portomorphisms of special groups. Alright, so first of all, many thanks to Kasha and Chatur for inviting me to this really fantastic place. Right, so before I start writing anything down, so let me give some motivation, sort of like place the topic that I'm going to talk about today a bit better. And so I've added a subtitle here. You can see this as a programmatic question for this. So is there any structure in automorphisms of non-hyperbole groups? Of non-hyperbolic groups. So let me explain what I mean by this. So, first of all, there are two groups, or rather, two families of groups for which we really do understand automorphisms really quite well. So, these are Henry's Q cousins, right, free in surface groups. And they're, well, the outer automorphism groups are respectively out of fan and marking class groups, of course, surfaces. And there, well, for these groups, of course, there are many questions. So, of course, there are many questions, there are many aspects that we still don't fully understand. But we know that outer final macroplescopes do have a lot of structure, right? They do have a lot of structure, and in some sense, we understand them quite well. And these two groups, free and surface groups, are the cousins, and they're really quite far away from anything else when it comes to automorphisms. They are really, within any reasonable class of groups, free and surface groups will be by far the most symmetric ones, the ones with the most automorphisms. And I'll make this precise. And I'll make this precise as I go along the talk. And I would argue it's not that surprising that we understand automorphisms of free and surface groups so well, because, of course, these are basic, fundamental, very important groups in geometric group theory, but it's not just that. These are trivially, right? These are concrete groups, right? We have a presentation, we have a classifying space, we understand that geometry very well. And these are really groups you can touch and get your hands in there and do things with them. So, what I find, what I think. So, what I find, what I think is much more surprising, and this is really one of the most important pieces of geometrical theory, in my opinion, it's something that comes out of the work of Rip Sensella in the 90s, right? So we actually understand very well all automorphisms of all gromo hyperbolic groups. So we don't understand the family of gromo hyperbolic groups as a whole. Gromo-hyperbolic groups are certainly not classified. You can't touch them and work with them concretely. But we do. Like concretely. But we do know very general things like the algebraomorphism group of any hyperbolic group is finitely generated, which maybe doesn't sound like much, but this is not true in general, where bounds like solids are groups for which algebra is infinitely generated. And even more, like if you have a JSJ decomposition of your group, even if you don't fully understand the JSJ, you can really write down all orthomorphisms of your group. So we really need to know quite a lot for very general family groups. So this is fantastic, but there is also another side of But there is also another side of this story, which is a very sad one. It breaks my heart. So, in the 90s, we had all these fantastic, I would say unexpected results about automorphisms of hyperbolic groups. And since then, our understanding of general families of automorphisms of groups hasn't really evolved qualitatively. So of course, many of the results we had for hyperbolic groups have been extended to relatively hyperbolic groups, various families of relatively hyperbolic groups. Various families of relatively hyperbolic groups, and the extension is not straightforward. But the techniques that go into it are quite close to the hyperbolic ones, right? And once you leave the world of relatively hyperbolic groups, almost like really next to nothing is known when it comes to general understanding. So there are some families where something can be said. So there is some work of the VIT on automorphisms of generalized bound-sized solidarity groups, not that general. There are some limited aspects of There are some limited aspects of osomorphisms of right-angled arting groups that we understand. They are very interesting, but right-angled arting groups are, again, not a general family of groups, right? You can touch them. You have a presentation, you have a synthetic complex, you can really get your hands in there and do things with them. And yeah, so when it comes to understanding of general families, you can really wonder, I mean, like, is this really the end of the story? Like, is it really that beyond relatively heavy body groups, everything gets so wild that we cannot have any coherent? Wild that we cannot have any coherent general theory, or is there more that can be said? And there are certainly examples of wild groups that you can construct with wild automorphisms, but they are artificial. And I would say, so this is what I want to talk about today. And of course, I'm not going to talk about automorphisms of general non-hyperbolic groups. I mean, that's pointless, I think. So, I'll add a word here, keyword that is accubulated. There are two reasons. There are two reasons why I'm adding this, so it fits well with the topic of conference. But also, so Roops and Sala have been recently wondering explicitly about the structure of automorphisms of tubulated groups, and I think it's a very interesting problem. So here, so very recently, Sala has some papers that develop some very general techniques to study automorphisms of hierarchical hyperbolic groups. The problem is that, as far as I understand it, the situation has not changed. These techniques Situation has not changed, these techniques run into trouble at some point, and in the end, you do not actually get any concrete results about photomorphisms. You don't know that algae is finely generated, for instance. So I will use different techniques. I'll say how they're different later. And I won't study general cubiated groups or general HXGs, but I will restrict to automorphisms of special groups, or virtually special groups. So there will be a phi-index subgroup that is the fundamental group of a compact special group. Is the fundamental group of a compact special cube complex in the sense of how you and y is, but that's all we assume. And the cool thing is, you can actually develop a coherent structure theory for automorphisms with these things at this level of generality. And so the aspect I want to focus on today is growth of automorphisms. There are many other questions that you can ask, but I won't get into them. And the question is: you have a group element, you have an automorphism, you apply powers of your automorphism to your group element, and the length of your group element is going to grow. The length of your group element is going to grow. But how fast can this grow? And what does this tell you about the group elements? And here, maybe one last remark before I end this monologue. So you might argue, okay, maybe you don't care about automorphisms or special groups in general, but right-angled outing groups have very interesting automorphisms. And for right-angled outing groups, what I'm going to discuss, so growth, So growth, next to nothing was known about this. And it is a complicated problem because you don't have train tracks. And what I think is cool here is that it is actually easier to study growth for all automorphisms of all special groups and then deduce results about automorphisms of rags as a special case than it is to study automorphisms of rags alone. So there will be some procedures in which you want to split your group into simple pieces that decrease some kind of complexity, and if you start with a rad, the pieces will be split. Start with a rat, the pieces will be special groups, but not rats. And so you really need to be able to leave the world of rats. Okay. So I think there are questions because everything I said was very vague. So let me start with some precise definitions. So I'll define things a bit more generally because I want to give you some examples. So let J be a finite genomic group. Let S be a finite genomic Be a finite generating set. So this gives us a word length that I will denote like this. So simply the length of the shortest word in the generators and their inverses that spell a given element of group word. And I'll actually be interested in outer automorphisms. And for them, the most natural notion of length is not word length, it's conjugacy length. So this will be the simply infimum. Simply the infimum or the minimum of word length over the conjugacy class of your group elements. Okay? So this is more geometric. It has more geometric meaning. The word length, if you have the fundamental group of a negatively curved closed reminded manifold, conjugacy length is really comparable to the length of the closed of the geodesic representative for the hyperbolic method. And so here is And so here's the definition, the notion that I'm going to be interested in. So if you have an outer automorphism of G, I'll say that a growth rate of phi is an equivalence class of sequences, so is so the equivalence class. Of a sequence n goes to conjugacy length of phi to the n applied to g for some gen g where equivalence of sequences is bilatuous equivalence. Is by H is equivalence. Okay, so we're going to say that a sequence AN is equivalent to Bn if there exists a constant C such that AN over C is at most BN is at most C AN. Is this still visible or too small? Okay, so each element gives you an equivalence class of sequences up to value. Equivalence class of sequences up to Elusitz equivalence. And a priori, different elements can give you different sequences. So a priori, you have infinitely many growth rates for your automorphism. So there are two things I need to say here. So here, I'm not writing my generating set as a subscript anymore, because it doesn't matter. So if you change your generating set, word length and conjugacy length will change by Lipschitz equivalence. The sequences you will get will be equivalent. So generating set is irrelevant. That is irrelevant. Second comment here: outer automorphisms are equivalence classes of automorphisms. So they're not maps from the group to itself. So pi n of g is not a well-defined element, but its conjugacy class is well-defined, and the conjugacy length only depends on the conjugacy class, so this is well-defined. So let's see some examples of how growth rates behave in the classical groups. And so, in the groups we understand, where we understand automorphisms well, these growth rates all behave in the same way. So, let me just say at the beginning what you should be looking out for, and then I'll list the groups where this is the structural growth rates. So, examples of groups G such that for every outer That for every outer automorphism phi of G. So, first of all, phi has only finitely many growth rates, but not just only finitely many, but at most a bounded number that only depends on the group. And secondly, these growth rates are not some weird log, log, log nonsense, but Nonsense, but so each rate is of the kind a polynomial times an exponential. So I will index my sequences all by n. So if I use n for anything that is not the index of a sequence, please correct me. Otherwise, it will be a mess. So each growth rate is of the form a polynomial with integer exponent times an exponential. An exponential. And the base of the exponential is not just any number, but it is always an algebraic input. It's an algebraic integer. So it could be 1, in which case you just get a polynomial, or it could be strictly bigger than 1, in which case you get a polynomial tent and exponential. And algebraic integers, so for me, there will always be real numbers, of course. Always be real numbers, of course. They are the, so something that is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. So there are only countably many algebraic integers, so it's kind of, it's non-trivial, right? That these are the only bases of exponential growth that we can do. Okay. Questions up to now? Sorry, what was that first example supposed to be? No, so I'm just telling you what these are going to be examples of. What these are going to be examples of. So I'm going to give you some classes of groups. And rather than repeating this for every example, this is what the groups will, this is the absolutely non-trivial structure of growth rates that you see in the classical groups, right? So a priority, there is no reason why phi shouldn't have infinitely many growth rates or why there shouldn't be something more frequent. Okay, so example number one, the most classical one, are surface groups. So let's say that Are surface groups. So let's say that we have the fundamental group of a closed surface, closed-orientable genus at this two. And here, so let me just say why this is true. And the key word is Nielsen-Turston decomposition, right? So in the point here, the outer automorphism group of the surface group, this is really just identified with the extended mapping plus group of the surface. So you can really just think of homeomorphism. So, we can really just think of homeomorphisms of the surface. And so, 5 has a Nielsen-Thurston decomposition, meaning that there will be some finite collection of queries disjoint simple closed curves on the surface that I'll draw here in purple. Let's say these. Let's say these. So, in general, phi can, so it's a think of phi as a homeomorphism of the surface. Growth of conjugacy length just means fix some metric on the surface, for instance a hyperbolic metric, apply powers of your homeomorphism to some curve on the surface, and see how the length of this curve grows. So, your homeomorphism will permute some of these curves. In this case, let's say it fixes. Some of these curves. In this case, let's say it fixes them all. And then on each complementary component, it's going to do something. Let's just. So let's say that here it's the identity. Let's say that here it's some supernosso thing with some stretch factor. Let's call it lambda 1. And let's say that here it's also some supernosso thing, also with some stretch factor lambda 2. And then this is pretty much it. There was something more. This is pretty much it. There's something more that can be happening. There could be maybe some game twisting here in this silos. And once you have a picture like this, you know exactly how the length of each curve goes. There aren't many options. So if you have, let's say, this curve here, what happens to it? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing, right? So the growth rate is just the equivalence mass of the constant sequence. That's of the constant sequence or of bounded sequences. This is a growth rate you always have because the identity is an element of the proof. But then, if maybe this curve is a little more complicated, maybe it crosses this curve where I'm doing some twisting, then what I'll get is something linear. So the equivalence class of output here n, the sequence n, being a growth. And then if it's even more complicated, maybe it goes through one of the pseudonosis. Goes through one of the pseudonyms of surfaces, then what you'll get is a purely exponential rate, no polynomial coefficient with base the stretch factor of your pseudonym. So in this case, for surfaces, it's a bit better than this. You don't get any polynomial things other than linear. And the exponential ones are purely exponential. There is no coefficient. The base is not just an algebraic integer, it's a Parallel number, it's again more than that. And clearly. And clearly, you only get five too many because you cannot decompose a surface into too many subsurfaces, right? This is bounded by the complexity of the surface. And things get a little more complicated in the next examples, but this is really the picture you should be having in mind because it's always going to essentially look like this. So anyway, yeah, okay. Questions? Good. So next example of three groups. Three groups. So here I won't say anything, I'll just say that this follows from the existence of three tracks. So there exist relative train track maps representing phi. You should think of something like this. So, this is due to Besvin and Handel originally in 92. Then, if you really want to understand growth really well, you need an improved version that is about 10 years later with Fanin. And then, the person who really fully understood growth using train tracks is Levit, around 2005. And here, same pictures. Here you do get all these polynomial terms can occur. The third example, I guess, it's hyperbolic groups. And so here this comes out of the work of Ribs and Seller mainly. So here there are two very non-trivial facts that go into this. So the first one is that G has a canonical JSTA decomposition. It has a JSTAD composition and it is canonical. And secondly, there are some rigid vertices of the JSTAD composition. Of the JSJ decomposition, and another very non-trivial fact is that these region vertices don't have any multiple physics, they only have finitely many. So one-ended I thought it worked. Yeah, so if I'll pretend G is one-ended, if G is not one-ended, it splits as a free product. If it splits as a free product, you can use relative train tracks to understand both. Anyway, so there's more that I should be saying, but that's the idea. So, but when g is one-ended, so it's a if g So let's say if G is famed, let's say torsion free for simplicity, and let's say not a surface group, which we already understand, then G splits as out G invariant graph of groups. such that edge stabilizers are cyclic and vertex groups let's say are either free and I mean of course we know a lot more than them just being free but let's say the vertex groups are Let's say the vertex groups are three. You should really be thinking of a surface with boundary, all have finite outer automorphism. And so now, so moreover, every automorphism of G is just assembled from automorphisms of the vertex groups, necessarily the free one up to small business. And then maybe you can do some dangerous. And then maybe you can do some dangerous thing like this one around the n-groups of this quote. So Merva, every file in L G is assembled from automorphisms of the vertex groups. Plus, some day twisting around the edge groups. And of course, you might have some symmetries of the graph of groups or other things like that. In twists around edge groups. Okay, and so growth here is going to behave basically just like growth on the vertex groups. And here in the one-ended case, should not be thinking of the free group situation. Be thinking of the frequency situation, but it will really look more like this. So you only get linear polynomials, and the exponential ones don't get any polynomial coefficients because here the non-trivial vertex loops you should really be thinking of as surfaces rather than free loops. Questions? So, in all of these examples, this is a very fairly non-trivial result, right? I mean, train tracks are, this was a conjecture of Thurston before they were constructed. Here, there are many parts of this that come out of the workgroups themselves that are really deep. I think. Let me add an example that is not so deep. And these, since I'm going to talk about non- And these, since I'm going to talk about non-hyperbolic groups, is three abelian groups. So here, this is really not at hard. The only thing you need to use is that out ZK is naturally identified with G L K Z and that there is a Gerardin decomposition. You do the Grodand decomposition over C, let's say, but it doesn't matter. This is an ectospace that you can write. And here you do get the polynomial factors. They come from Judah blocks, right? Non-triple Judah blocks. And I lied at the beginning of the talk, right? So this is also a third cousin. So this is another guy that is very symmetric. But he doesn't get invited to the parties you're winning because people like everybody. Okay, it's invited to the special. He's invited to the special party. Yeah, he's invited to the special party. She's always welcome at my house. So here's a bad example. So the thing that is slightly frustrating with this whole story is that these results are really hard to prove. But it's also really hard to find any group where this is not true. So the easiest thing to do is just not know what is going on somewhere. But so I don't know. I essentially only know a single example. Essentially, I only know a single example where it's known that you don't have that structure. And it's quite recent and due to Cluan. I don't think it's because they don't exist. I think it's just we haven't really looked into it very much. But so Cluan recently constructed a fighter-generated group, not fight represented because it comes from the Rio's construction, with an automorphism, an outer automorphism of intermediate growth. Of intermediate growth. I'll call it. So it grows faster than any polynomial, but slower than any exponential. And he constructs actually a lot of them. So it's a related reconstruction of all Shansky of groups with distorted specific subgroups. But, so, and here, if anybody is into constructing bad groups, please do this. I mean, I don't know a single example of a group with an absolute. I don't even care about 50%. With an outpost, I don't even care about phytopresented. I mean, like phytogenerated. I don't know a single example of a phytogeneric group with an altruomorphism that has infinitely many growth rates, or where you have something that grows exponentially, but the base is not an algebraic integer. I mean, surely there must be something that, but I don't know how to do that. Okay. Theorem. Are there any questions? Well, how does the good example imply that this is not true? Oh, because these are all growing. Oh, because these will grow at least exponentially or at most polynomially. So if lambda is one, this is a polynomial. If lambda is bigger than one, this is at least exponential. And he constructs a whole bunch of things that are in between. Do they violate the first point? No, they don't violate the first point. I don't know a single example that violates the first point. Surely it exists, but I don't know how to construct it. But I don't know how to construct it. How do you specify this mode D with your rate? This is somehow the maximum of the growth of Mottin is the maximum. Yeah, I think he can construct them so that they have a single growth rate. I mean, all elements that are not the identity grow at the same speed and it's done. So in general, that's another good point. It's not even clear, and I don't think it's true in general, that And I don't think it's true in general that growth rates are a totally ordered set. So these guys, you can, you know, if you take two, one is faster than the other, up to constants. But in general, it's not clear to me that growth rates have to have this property. They could have like some something that grows like a log along a sub-sequence and log log along another sub-sequence. I mean, I don't know. Okay. So this is not on the archive yet, but hopefully will be. So let G be a virtually special group. So a fine-time X subgroup is a fundamental group of a compact special cube complex, or you can view it as a fundamental group is a subgroup of a rectangle ding group that acts. Right angled arging group that acts compactly on a convex subconvex, if you prefer. Phi any outer freedom, then we can see a few things. So first are those, so there is a constant only depending on the group, such that phi has at most that many breath widths. Second, each is of that kind, almost. So each rate is either at most polynomial. And here I'm not saying exactly polynomial. And the problem is that here it gets really fiddly to understand sub-exponentially growing ones. I think it should be true, but there are other things that I wanted to look into first. So meat rate is either at the most. So initiate is either at the most polynomial or exactly polynomial times exponential, where again the power of the polynomial is an integer and lambda is an algebraic integer. And you can see exactly what algebraic integers come up here. It's exactly Integers come up here, it's exactly the ones you see for fully reducibles of free products. So those will be Perron numbers, and exactly those you get here. Then here you get not Perron numbers, you get weak Perund numbers that are algebraic units. And I can explain what these things mean, but maybe not now. Okay, and third, and this explains my whole discussion about how everything Everything that is not one of, is not free surface or free abelian, everything else is quite far. So essentially, all the exponentially growing automorphisms are caused by one of these guys. So maybe I put the three there, just because it might be longer. So if so the top the top rate, if it's at least exponential, is realized on a phi k invariant for some power k convex compact subgroup. So that is one of the three kinds. Let me just say a couple of words. So convex co-compact means if you look at G acting on the universal cover of its cube complex, H will act co-compactly on a convex sub-complex. So this tells you slightly generated it's special. It's the right notion of quasi-complexity when you're dealing with non-hydroboltic special groups. Psychain invariant I mean. Phi can invariant, I mean just some power of phi will preserve the conjugacy class of H, right? So some power of phi has a representative in the order of the move that will leave H invariant. And you get three things. So the first thing is pre-products, where either H is infinitely ended and it has a non-sporadic vector system such that the restriction is fully reducible. So this is not quite free groups, but it's free products and you cannot pair it down to free groups, unfortunately. But morally, it's that. Second case is surface groups with boundary. So all H is the fundamental group of a complex surface, and the restriction of phi is. And the restriction of phi is to an osero. It's a geometric uh automorphism. Or third case, morally free abedon groups, it's not just them, unfortunately, but it's uh something that has a center. So O H is H prime cross at least a rank two. At least around two of the examples. And there are really examples that you can construct where you cannot realize it on a free game. And the technique... Oh, God. Ah, okay. So this classical bad example of this kind is when you take a product of a free group. A product of a free group and a free abelian group, which is the abelianization of the free group, and you take a fully reducible positive automorphism to the free group acting in the free group and this projection to the abelianization acting in the abelianization. And it's more like a triangular matrices. There is also some whole morphism that twists the thing, which is just the projection of a three-group twist of organization. And these things are a real mess. I don't think I have time to actually. I don't think I have time to uh actually write that one. Oh yeah. What does your k there in mine three appear? Do that event just on G? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Because this does not come from a graph of group splitting of G. It might come from a graph of group splitting of a subgroup of G. And what subgroup? What subgroup? Maybe one can control it, but I haven't thought about it already. So, one can say more. So, another thing I wanted to say: so, if the automorphism coarsely preserves the coarse median structure in G, and this is not that strong an assumption because it's always true when G is hyperbolic, it's always true when G is a rectangle outing group, sorry, rectangled hox of a group, and when it's a rectangled outing group, this is called being untwisted, and it's a well-established notion that has been studied. So, if you have this additional assumption, Been studied. So, if you have this additional assumption, you can say more on the straighter. So, you can look at the straight subsets of your group where at most a given growth rate is realized. And these are a finite union of conjugacy classical subgroups, each of which is finite-generated special commons component. But this is false for a general authority. So, I want to say a couple of other questions. I want to say a couple of words on how. I want to say a couple of words on how this is proved, or rather, on how this is not proved. So, in particular, this is new for rectangled articles, I should say. So, Regman and Ching had the only previous result on growth in rectangled article groups, and it only applied to automorphisms that have a very special structure that slightly generalizes positive automorphisms of free groups. And there, they show that the top growth rate is algebraic and it's realized on one of these things. On one of these things. But then, for more general automorphisms or more general below-top growth rates, nothing was normal. And the point is that I think many people also try to construct train tracks for right-angled outing groups, but that's very, very hard. And so this is not done by constructing train tracks of any kind. This is really done by classical Rippsila theory, like the old kind, and really constructing some kind of JSJ composition, some canonical JS-J composition for Ripple. Some canonical JSJD proposition for your group. The key point to remember here is that abelian splittings, the splittings of abelian subgroups, are not enough. So there are examples of right-angle darting groups. Maybe this answers your question, Taya. There are examples of right-angle darting groups that have infinite outer automorphism group, but no abelian splittings whatsoever. And so in particular, you cannot approach them just by studying actions on acylindrical actions on hypnotic spaces. Like acylindrical actions on hyperbolic spaces, because there will be sequences of automorphisms that diverge, sorry, that don't diverge in any acylindricle action on a hyperbolic space. Of course, weekly acyl action are a different story, but I don't know how to use them because you always have the problem that the kernel is going to be ugly. So instead, the way I approach this is forget about asynchronicity, like really embrace lack of asynchronicity, split over a stone. Split over, study real trees that don't have small edge stabilizers, split over big subgroups that are not just ugly, but there will be centralizers, so very nice subgroups. Split, and then try to construct some JSJ composition. So for this, you need to prove accessibility over centralizers. It does not follow from any known form of accessibility because they're not asylum and they're not small. And then you need some other techniques that allow you to promote an invariant definition. An invariant deformation space of trees to an actual outgreen invariant splitting. And again, you would like to do something like the trio cylinders of Girl with it, but now you have a super complicated intersection pattern on the edge stabilizers, and their technique does not work there. But you can do something, because you have other movements. Okay, I have three minutes, is that right? Oh, sorry, you're at the chair. So let me just write some ingredients. Let me just write some ingredients. So, number one, and this is not new, I proved this a few years ago, but this is kind of like the key point without which you would not be able to do anything. So, if the outer automorphism group of a special group is infinite, then G acts on a mountain stably With arc stabilizers that are centralizers or Corbelian subgroups of them. And the arteries we use to this are, in some sense, the obvious one. If you have that in mind, it's that. If you don't, it's okay. If you don't, it's okay. Okay, so you embed G into the rag, the rag acts in the Solvetic complex, the Solvetic complex embeds in the product of trees, you take those trees and you take a limit. The problem is that those trees, the X stabilizers in G are horrible, they're not algebraically significant. When you twist my automorphism, all health can break loose. But you can show that actually in the limit, they become central. And this is kind of like a key point here. Two, you now want to use the splittings that you get from the ribs. Things that you get from the RIPS machine. And for this, you need to show that GE is accessible over the centralizers. You can forget about the bad things. And this accessibility ultimately, I mean, it requires some work, but ultimately you can reduce it to the Bespina Fein accessibility over small subgroups with some work. And then you construct some kind of JSJ in the It's not truly a JSJ in the sense of Eurodell the bits, but it is an outgreen variant splitting, and it does have some fragmentative hanging vertices. So I'm going to call it a JSJ. So last ingredient. So if G is one-ended, then G splits as an An out G invariant graph of groups such that edge groups are either cyclic or centralizers. I'll be done in 30 seconds. Or centralizers. You have a lot of elliptics, so all You have a lot of elliptics, so all anything that has non-trivial centralizers, so all non-contracting elements called non-arranked elements of tree are elliptic. And finally, vertex groups, they might have infinitely many automorphisms still, but you know more. So vertex groups are either Are either quadratically hanging, so they can happen. I'll just wait to wait, are either quadratically hanging, or they are convex co-compact, so again special groups. And now the top growth rate of any automorphism is realized on a lower complexity subgroup. And there is some notion of complexity here that I'm not talking about. The vertex groups don't increase it, but they might also not reduce it. But they might also not reduce it, but they will have some smaller complexity subgroups on which the top growth rate of any automorphism is realized. And so you can argue in some sense by induction. And top rates are realized on lower complexity size. That's it. Thank you. Questions? So what was QH and CC? So CC is convex co-compact. So it acts co-compact here, a convex, co-compact. QH is quadratically handy. So it's something that is standard terminology in JSJ theory. Standard terminology in JST theory, it means it's the fundamental group of a compact surface with boundary, and all incident edge groups are cyclic and they go into the boundary subgroups. And this is the typical thing that causes you to have a lot of automorphisms. Even in the JSJ of our hyperbolic group, I wrote that some vertex groups are free, but I meant this. But you assume it to be totally free because it actually gets better than it over. So virtually, you can't like it you can ignore it for free. Yeah, special groups. And special groups are torsion-free because of the embedding marks. Yeah, it's no bit weak. And that does make your life a lot easier when it comes to groups type stuff. So, particularly, your infinite ended age is, in fact, total free as well as infinite ended age. Absolutely, yeah. As well as a finite edge. Absolutely, yeah. It's really a free product of free lean decomposer groups and some free factors. I mean, they're always at most exponential because your maps are Diletschitz. Holtomorphisms are always Diletshits with respect to conjugacy length. So it's always at most exponential and I think you can get arbitrarily high, arbitrarily fast. Get arbitrarily high, arbitrarily fast expulsions, probably. Yeah, it's certainly just passing to power is overkeeping water. You said the definition of the splitting at the end is different from the Guerdella, KSJ, decomposition. Construction. How different is it? Is there still a nice kind of algebraic definition for the point is, sorry, I'm interrupting you. Yeah, the in the end you manage to construct it purely. In the end, you manage to construct it purely out of the algebraic intersection pattern of some edge state connectors. But it takes work. So first you use accessibility to get an invariant deformation space. So a tree that is maybe not invariant, but the collection of elliptic subgroups is invariant under rollotorphisms. And once you have that, you look at the fixed sets of the edge stabilizers and you run some construction that, I mean, you're a little high. Some construction that I mean, Uradel has used to study arteries, but we need to do it a bit more carefully. But it's not something I can explain into words. Okay, let's thank you later. Okay, so is your D you're ready? Very nice. Um, is your D you're ready to go? Um is your instrumental or this one.
