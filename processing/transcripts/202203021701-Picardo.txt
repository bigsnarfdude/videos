Me this chance to talk about some recent work we've done on flames in turbulent flow, and I would have really liked to for all of us to be together in person, but nevertheless, this is a nice opportunity. So, okay, so let's get started. So, today I'll be talking about a fluttering flame and its intermittency and how this connects eventually to the KPZ equation. So, I'm at the chemical engineering department at the Indian Institute of Technology. At the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, in Mumbai. So, my main collaborator on this work is a recently graduated PhD student, Amitesh Roy. And he did his PhD at IIT Madras. So, this is Amitesh. And he's looking for a postdoc, by the way. So, if anyone has an opening and would be interested, do let me know. So, he did his PhD with Sujit at IIT Madras. With Sujit at IT Madras, and our other collaborators are Benjamin Emerson and Tim Lewin at Georgia Tech. Okay, so a flame, a fluttering flame is quite fascinating to watch. It's something that you can stare at for quite a while. And I'm sure it's something that also fascinated our early ancestors who discovered fire. And I think one of the things that makes it so interesting is the fact that. So, interesting is the fact that such a flame undergoes these big excursions, this bursting kind of behavior. And underlying that is a sort of intermittency, which is of a large scale in the sense that it involves the large scale motions of the flame, which can have this on-off type bursting dynamics. So, this large-scale intermittency has been well recognized in the combustion literature and in flame dynamics and has been extensively characterized. Been extensively characterized and, in a sense, is akin to the kind of intermittency one sees in non-homogeneous transitional turbulent flows. But that's not what I'll be talking about mainly today. Instead, if you look at engineered flames, so I'm talking about flames in a combustor, in a jet engine and things like this, which are well controlled, well maintained. And if you go to the region of the flame, you know, where it's sustained and well maintained, it appears relatively boring. Appears relatively boring in the sense that there are fluctuations, but they're typically Gaussian. But even having said that, if you're in a turbulent combustor and the flow around the flame is turbulent, one realizes that these flames and their fluctuations actually span the inertial range of the underlying turbulent flow. And so, a natural question arises whether these fluctuations, though they may appear Gaussian, if one would look at, for example, Gaussian, if one would look at, for example, the increments, would you start to see a non-Gaussian signature? So, in other words, do flames contain an additional inner intermittency or small-scale intermittency associated with the small-scale albeit which may appear to be self-similar fluctuations, but which may actually hide a multi-scaling behavior. So, this was actually postulated by people quite a while back in Srinivasan Sam. People quite a while back, and Srinavasan summarizes the situation and terms this kind of multi-scaling behavior as inner intermittency to contrast it with the large-scale intermittency of the non-homogeneous overall flow, which he called outer intermittency. So the question is, it does seem like it should exist from various arguments, as we'll see as I go along. But what we've done here is provide, we think, the first experimental evidence for it. Okay, so before I go there, the first question is: what is a flame? So you can have different kinds of flames, typically pre-mixed or non-premixed. So a pre-mixed flame is essentially a situation where you have the fuel and the oxidant are literally pre-mixed together and then they are ignited. And in the other case, you have fuel and oxidant on either side of the flame. So I'll focus on pre-mixed flame. So, I'll focus on pre-mixed flames today. So, in a pre-mixed situation, right, the flame is essentially a surface embedded in the flow that separates out the burned from unburned stuff. And so, a schematic is shown here where this line is, this surface is the flame. And of course, the flame now can get distorted by the flow, but it also has its own self-propagation because of the active burning of the unburning. Unburned stuff, right? So it propagates from the burn towards the unburned material and it propagates perpendicular to its surface, as you see here. So one can essentially think of a flame as a self-propagating surface embedded in the flow. And it's a kind of canonical, let's say, example of these systems, of self-propagating systems. So there are different regimes. I just want to clarify this before I continue. So if you think of the Of the Kurmogorov length scale of the turbulent flow and compare it to the thickness of the flame. So, if the Kurmogorov length is much, much larger than the flame thickness, then in terms of the flow, the flame really is an infinitesimally thin surface. So, that's what we would call a thin flame. And this is really the regime that's most amenable to mathematical description of the nature I'll be going into a bit later. Later. The other extreme is where the Kermogorov length is much smaller than the thickness of the flame. So, by the way, the thickness of the flame is something determined by the chemical properties of the fuel and oxidant. Essentially, it's their diffusivities, molecular diffusivities, and the reaction rates involved in the combustion process. So, that is something that's determined by just the chemical properties of what you're burning. And now, that thickness, if you contrast with the property of the flow, namely. The property of the flow, namely the Kermograph length. So now, if that Kermograph length is much smaller than the thickness, essentially the turbulent flow can penetrate the flame and start to mix it up. And really, in this alternative regime, there is really no flame. Instead, you can just think of this as a reacting flow. You can't really identify a flame. And then you have the moderate situation where the turbulence can penetrate the flame and broaden it a bit, but you can still identify a flame surface. So, this you would call. Flame surface. So, this you would call a flame with some finite thickness, a diffuse flame. And experimentally, we are actually in this regime. But even though you're here, you can still describe the flame surface. And with some corrections, you can use a mathematical treatment that takes you to something like a KPC equation, which I'll show you later. Okay, so with those preliminaries out of the way, let me show you the kind of experimental setup on which the measurements are done. So, this is a combustor, a V-flame combustor. A combustor, a V-flame combustor that's at Georgia Tech in Tim Lewin's lab, and his students Luke and Ben have worked on this. We're especially grateful to Luke for the data, some parts of the data. So essentially, it's a system where you have this stable V flame that's set up on a flame holder, and the flame holder can be oscillated in the transverse direction. At the same time, below this holder, a flow is injected and A flow is injected, and you have two plates, perforated plates, below this holder, which you cannot see here. And air is passed through them, and turbulence gets generated, and then the turbulence meets the flame. So that's the setup that we have. And you have cameras to kind of take pictures, to take videos. And we use TIO2ME scattering to detect the edge. And there's also PIV setup to measure the flow field. So, this is a typical snapshot of the flame where you can see the edge, and if you binarize it, you can kind of locally define the edge of the flame. Now, of course, there will be some holes and some islands of little flame ridge, but for our purposes, we neglect those things. Like this is a hole, for example, and this is an island. So, we neglect these small features and focus on the dominant flame edge. And if you do that, you can extract out an edge that. That you can extract out an edge that looks like the blue line you see here. So, a bit of, I mean, just to set up the geometry of the problem. So, we have in the direction, let's say, of the mean flow, we have put in the y coordinate and the x coordinate is transversed to that. And this zeta is the location of the instantaneous flame. Of the instantaneous flame. And then we can define a mean and a prime variable to denote the fluctuations. And so here you see the way I formulated it, it appears to be single-valued. In reality, you can see that it can be multi-valued at some points, but that doesn't really contribute to analysis. We've done some checks to make sure. So one can simplify it for now and think of it as being single-value. So, an important experimental point here is that the setup is inherently loose. Here is that the setup is inherently limited in terms of spatial scales. So, the smallest spatial scale of interest to us is the diffusive scale associated with the flame. And then the largest scales are set effectively by the system size. In fact, a size less than that if you want to have approximately isotropic flow conditions and so on. So, you are fundamentally limited in terms of the range of spatial scales you can access unless you can build a huge combustor. Unless you can build a huge combustor, which is not something we could do. So then, but to help us, on the other hand, we had very reasonably accurate high-resolution temporal measurements. So we could have a single location and measure the fluctuations of the flame and also get decent information about the flow in time. Or, in other words, these snapshots were available at pretty good resolution in time. So we have a decent rate. In time. So we have a decent range of scales temporarily. And so the rest of what I will be showing you, I'll actually do in the time domain rather than the space domain. Okay, a final word about the background turbulent flow. So these are just pictures for, you know, to set the stage. Here, the background is the field that's extracted from PIV. It's the water city field. You can see we don't have much resolution, again, even in the PIV field. That's another reason why we don't really do the analysis. Another reason why we don't really do the analysis in space. But we have the field at various instances of time, and one thing we can do is compute, for example, the cross correlations of the fluctuating flow field. And you see that there are significant correlations towards the edges of the system. But if you look in this boxed region, you see that these cross correlations become pretty small. And that's an indication that we are achieving. Indication that we are achieving at least locally something that's close to being isotropic. And we've done other checks to see this. So that's just to show you that at least approximately one can think of the flame being in a kind of isotropic homogeneous flow, at least in this local region. Okay, so let me now begin by showing you some measurements. So, what I'll be showing you, so this on the left is You so, this on the left is the flame. This uh, the curve is the instantaneous flame, and uh, I'll be looking at the fluctuations of the flame at different axial locations y. So, in this window, you'll see fluctuations pretty far from the flame holder. That's y five times lambda c, where lambda c is a decorrelation length scale in the y direction. And it's so it's it's a large length scale, this lambda c. So, five lambda c is. So, 5 lambda c is pretty sampling the kind of large-scale fluctuations of the flame. And then in the second box, we are coming closer to the flame and again measuring the fluctuations. And in the third box, you are looking at the increment of the fluctuations in time. So you take the fluctuation at two different times at an interval of tau and you take the difference. The usual way we would measure, we would define increments, except we're doing it now in time. Okay, so let me play this movie. So you see the Movie. So you see the flame is undergoing its fluctuations. There are large kinds of oscillations far from the flame holder. And that's manifested here in the top box. You can see this kind of bursting type of behavior. So it really has this on-off type dynamics. And that's a consequence of the large-scale dynamics of the system, the coupling between the burning and the flow that leads to the flame sometimes propagating. Know the flame sometimes propagating very far and sometimes not at all, and so that's what leads to this on-off type bursting. And you can see this has a clear intermittent characteristic. So, this is what would be called outer intermittency. But if you come closer, the flame always exists at that location, right, when you're closer where this green dot is. And so now you kind of lose that character. And as I'll show you in the next slide, it appears to be relatively Gaussian. But then, if you look at the increment, you once again see that, you know, there's. You once again see that you know there that it does appear to be intermittent. So let's look at it in more detail through the PDFs in this slide. So here again, I'm just plotting the fluctuation at different axial locations. So the dark color corresponds to the far from the large scale motion. And there you see this spike near zero. The reason is that whenever the flame doesn't propagate all the way to the furthest location, we just mark it as being zero. As being zero, and if I plot the flatness factor now of these PDFs, so the fourth moment, versus the axial location, you see that far away, I do see a high flatness indicative again of this outer intermittency, a large scale intermittency. But as I come close, you start, you really approach the Gaussian value of three. And so, what this suggests now is that yes, you have this flame girls have this large scale kind of. This flame does have this large-scale kind of intermittent flapping. But if one were to go close to the flame holder, things would appear relatively tame and be almost Gaussian. As you can see from this, the lightest PDF here, the lightest color, and the dashed line is a fitted Gaussian. Okay, but that's really not the whole story, and that's the main point of my talk. So, if you now look at the temporal increments over the time interval tau and then look at the PDF, right? And then look at the PDF, right? And then do the usual thing that is very familiar to all of us, I'm sure. That now, as you decrease tau, right, at large tau, you see what looks really to be Gaussian, that is the orange curve here. But as you decrease tau and go to smaller scales, you start seeing the strongly non-Gaussian behavior with these flat takes. And this really looks very much like what we would see if we would take, let's say, velocity increments in a turbulent flow. And from large scales, Verizz Gaussian, we see. Large steels where it's Gaussian, we start seeing non-Gaussian weight. So I think this is a clear telltale sign to, especially to people in this field, that this is going to be intermittent. But then, of course, one can think about now looking at the structure factors to see if there is multi-scale. But before I do that, let me first wanted to see whether there actually is a power law range of scaling in these fluctuations. Fluctuations. So, for that, we looked at the power spectra of our measurements. That would be like looking at, let's say, in another way of looking at the scaling of the second-order structure factor. And I'll come to that in a second. But first, we just looked at the spectra. Another reason being that people in this field typically plot the power spectra if they have temporal measurements. So, this is what we're looking at here. This is the energy spectrum over the frequency omega, non-dimensional. Frequency omega, non-dimensionalized with the large scale frequency associated with the integral length of the turbulent flow. And what you see is that once you come below the large time scale, omega L, you do hit this kind of power law range. And eventually our measurements cannot resolve it so that the stuff here is really just because we are under-resolving, we don't have the temporal resolution. Don't have the temporal resolution. If we could go further, we would presumably hit the diffusive scales corresponding to what's known as the Causon scale. That's omega C here, this first dashed line, and things would start to decay. And if you go even further, you would hit the Kolmogorov scale. So we're not able to measure things up to there. So within the range of our measurement, it does appear like there is a power law range. And that exponent seems to be close to minus two. And we've done this for different flame configurations. This is for different flame configurations labeled here F1, F2, and we measured the exponents at different axial locations within that box region which I'd shown you in the PIV diagram earlier, where things are locally isotropic and so on. And then we do see that we're relatively close to an exponent of minus P. So the main message is, yes, within this local regime of the flow, the flame does show what appears to be at least self-similar fluctuations at first sight. And then the question is, where does this exponent minus two come from? This exponent minus two comes from so to understand this, let's look at the equation that describes the dynamics of a flame. So, if we think of the flame as being given by a following surface, right, G of in two dimensions, x, y, and t, but you could extend it to three, of course, being zero. So, really, the contour of the zero contour of this g field is going to determine my flame. And this g then would obey a advection diffusion type equation. So, you just have. Equation. So you just have advection by the turbulent flow on this term. And then on the right-hand side, this first term is the self-propagation of the flame in the local normal direction, where SL is the burning speed. So this is the speed that comes out of the combustion chemistry. And it's this rate at which this flame would propagate if we were in a cohesion flow. Sorry, in a quiescent paddock. In addition to this, you have a kind of effective diffusion. Of effective diffusion, this D is not the molecular diffusivity, it's what's known as the Markstein diffusivity. It's a kind of effective diffusion behavior of the flame, and it's finite for us because remember, I told you that our flame has a finite thickness, and we are in that regime of things. And then there are some corrections because the flame is not infinitesimally thin. So, those corrections are on the order of the thickness of the flame delta. Now, for our purposes, we want to identify a kind of self-similar range. So, we need to see if there's scale separation. Range. So we need to see if there's scale separation. So each of these terms can be associated with a different length scale on the right-hand side. To see that more clearly, I'm just using the definition of the normal here in terms of the gradient of G to get this term. Okay, so what are the scales that come out of here? So the first term can lead to what's known as a Gibson scale. In other words, it's just the length scale at which the burning speed, right, SL, becomes equal to the Equal to the turnover, let's say speed becomes equal to the speed of an eddy of that size. So, in other words, Lg is the scale at which if you look at a turbulent eddy of that scale, you know, using the usual Kolmogorov scaling that V goes as L to the one-third, that velocity when it matches SL, that's the length scale, which is known as a Gibson scale. So, in other words, fluctuations at this scale would be equally affected by the self-propagation and the The self-propagation and the background turbulent flow. So, this is one length scale, and this L here is the integral scale, the large integral scale of the flow. So, it's this Gibson scale is given in terms of that. And V is the RMS velocity. I can then, the second term, diffusive term, then gives me a dissipative cutoff due to diffusion, which is the Kautsen length scale, and it's related to the Kolmogorov scale via the Schmidt number. In our problem, it's actually a little In our problem, it's actually a little larger than the Kolmogorov scale, as you saw earlier. And this delta F again is a small length scale, the thickness of the flame. So the main point is we do have a range of scale separation. So if L is the integral scale of the flow, closer to the system size, and if the RMS velocity is much larger than the intrinsic burning speed, you do have a scale separation with LG and certainly with the diffuser scales. The diffuser scales. So, over that range, right, when you're saying essentially that you're smaller than the system size, but much larger than this Gibson scale or the Carson scale, then you can effectively neglect these terms. And what you see is you have something that looks just like the ejection of a passive scalar within that sub-range of scales. And so, probably unsurprisingly, it was shown, it's been known for quite a while, and it's there in this book by Peters, that the power, the spatial energy spectrum of the flux. Sorry, spatial energy spectrum of the fluctuations of the flame have this kind of behavior where you do have a power law behavior over this intermediate range, but then it hits this exponential decay first due to the self-propagation. So the Gibson scale comes here and then later further decay due to the diffusive effects. This is the Causen length scale. But the main point for us is that you have this k to the minus five-thirds behavior and what is really the inertial convective, you know. Convective regime of this plate. So, okay, so now we want to come back to the time domain. So we start with what is known in the spatial domain or in the wave number domain that the spectrum goes as k to the minus 5 third. And then what we think of is a very simple argument. So basically, you imagine you have a flame, and this flame is now going to be perturbed by a range of. By a range of eddies, if we look at, if we think of it in a Kolmogorov picture. And so each given eddy of a size 2π by k would be creating a perturbation of that length scale. And it would be associated with the velocity, of course, that goes as k to the minus 1. So now with this local velocity of that eddy of size 2π by k, I can think of a frequency that it would produce on the flame surface. So that just dimensionally that. Surface so that just dimensionally that frequency is the velocity times the wave number. So I get that frequency goes as k to the two by three if I use the scaling of the underlying flow, right? The inertial range scaling of the flow. And then with this relation, along with just the simple fact, right, that the integral of the power spectrum ultimately has to have the same content as the spatial spectrum, I would then extract out my power spectrum E to go as omega. To go as omega to the minus two. So, what we are saying here basically is if we start with the known spatial spectrum for the flame fluctuations and just use the inertial range scaling of the flow, we should expect to see an exponent minus two in the power spectrum of my flame fluctuations. And that's actually what we see experimentally. Okay, so this is just to see that the measurements are consistent and also it kind of helped us to think about things in the temporal domain. Now, let's return. Now, let's return to the question of intermittency by looking at the structure factors. So, I come back to the increments of my flame fluctuation and then I raise it to a power p and take the average, in this case, time average where things are stationary. And so I can define structure factors of order p. Now, the second order structure factor will follow from my the power spectrum. And I see that second order structure factor goes as tau. Factor goes as tau. And so if things are non-intermittent, a naive expectation would be that the pth order structure factor should scale as tau to the p by 2. So this p by 2 is my straight line, let's say. But then when I actually calculate the zeta, sorry, when I calculate sps and see how they scale in tau, I do get a decent range of scaling. But I see that it goes as tau to some exponent zeta p, where zeta p does not follow p by 2. Instead, it is concave. Or p by 2. Instead, it is concave and strongly, I mean, it shows strong anomalous scaling, as you can see here. So, clearly, this is definitely intermittent and scales enormously. In fact, it saturates. And this sort of saturation behavior is quite reminiscent of a passive scalar, the intermittency we see in passive scalars. Although it seems stronger, but it's hard to compare because right now these are the exponents for the temporal scalar. For the temporal scaling. So, what does this thing mean quickly? So, basically, we have this, I mean, in the passive scalar case, this saturation indicates is due to the fact physically that you have these ramp cliff structures where you have perturbations of the order of the RMS amplitude, but happening in the diffusive scales. And if you can take the diffusive scales to smaller length scales to increase the Reynolds number and the Peclet numbers there, then you. And the Petrie numbers there, then you would have these jumps, RMS jumps in shorter and shorter distances. In our case, since we are doing things in time, it's really the flame thing, the same thing. The flame, even at small scales, is undergoing very rapid fluctuation. So it advances or recedes by an amplitude of the root mean square fluctuation, but in the diffusive time scale. And if we could take this time scales to be smaller and smaller, we would have these more increasingly rapid extreme events. And now, this has some implications for, you know. This has some implications for operation and heat release rates and things like this, which we are yet to calculate, but it certainly will be there. Also, it would manifest in space, possibly as this ramp lift kind of structures on the flame surface, but we can't see this experimentally because we have a limited range of scales, as I had said. So, to understand these things more clearly, it would be nice to have a simple model. And that's where I'll take you through in the last couple of minutes. In the last couple of minutes. So, how can we come at a simple model to understand these flame fluctuations? So, if we return to the g equation, let me start by assuming it to be single-valued. So, this the location of the flame is now given by h, which is just a function of the transverse x. I can then rewrite my g equation in the following form, where this u and v are the velocity field. I then make a further simplification. I then make a further simplification. I replace the flow. You know, this is something we are all familiar with now with Gaussian noise. In fact, I take it to be delta-correlated in time data. And then you see the equation now starts to look more and more like the KPZ. I've assumed here that the flow perpendicular to the flame balances out its laminar flame speed so that the flame would stay within the region of interest. You could also just think of having a moving coordinate. Having a moving coordinate. Now, it still is not really KPC, but if you assume that the slopes are small, you can say this DHDX is small, and then you can simplify this term, and you really do get KPZ with now two noise forcings. So the first three terms are just KPZ, our beloved KPZ, but then you have two forcing. One is the forcing that comes from the velocity component perpendicular to the flame. So that comes in editing. Perpendicular to the flame, so that comes in additively, but then you have the tangential component which comes in multiplicative. And this is what makes this thing fundamentally different from the version of the forced KPC that has been mostly studied, which is the additive noise case. So we have this multiplicative noise, which should be interpreted in the Stratinovich sense, and that changes things, as I'll show you in a second. Okay, so this is pretty much. Okay, so this is pretty much the end. So, what we did is we just started looking at this now in terms of doing some calculations. So, we do stochastic simulations. We take the noise to be delta correlated in time and have a spatial spectrum. Right now, I've taken minus 5 third because the noise, we want it to mimic the background flow. And we've done simulations with the full equation I showed you before, not the small slope version, but the full equation, which has a KPZ-like character. So, we do full simulations. So, we do full simulations, you know, including both additive and multiplicative noise. This is just showing you the perturbed flame fluctuation field in space and time. And we do the same thing just with the additive noise, which would be more like, you know, just additively forced KPC. And then I can calculate the increments and their PDFs. And you see that it's just the additive forcing, things remain Gaussian. But with the multiplicative forcing, where you have this random advection effect, you start seeing non-Gaussian flare tails. Non-Gaussian flare tails in the increments. And I can calculate the exponents. And the first one is in space. You see that there is some indication of intermittency here. And if you do it in time, that gets even stronger. So it does, this, our initial calculations at least show that it's the random advection, the multiplicative forcing, that is producing the intermittency we are seeing rather than the self-propagation aspect. A self-propagation aspect. Okay, so with that, I'll conclude. The main thing we've seen here is that, yes, flames have this large-scale outer intermittency kind of behavior, but if you go closer to the flame, where things seem boring, it actually still is intermittent. And one needs to look at the structure factors to reveal that. And we've shown the first experimental evidence for this kind of inner intermittency, but the story is a familiar one to those of us who come to this problem from turbulence. You know, from turbulence. And more recently, what we're doing is to try to develop some kind of theory of this using this KPZ-like equation, but accounting for the multiplicative, spatiotemporal multiplicative norms. So with that, thank you very much for your attention. I'll be happy to take questions if there's time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Any questions? A fifth of question I wound up week.
