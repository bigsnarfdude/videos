My talk is about cyology. I'm only doing theory. We heavily rely on people doing experiments. This work was done by my student, Shi Li. She just has just moved to Shanghai University to be a faculty member of LEA. And this project was initially. talk well at least project was initiated after I attended the fascinating talk given by Professor Bodiaski. Several speakers have talked about colority. Colority has been attract more and more attention. Colority uses at different scales, at the molecular scale, single, serial scale, a tissue or eigen level. Tissue or eigen level. At the organ level, the organs, different organs displayed with asymmetric structure, position, or functions. This colority at the macroscopic scale is suggested to be connected to the colority at the molecular scale or cellular scale. However, the underlying colour. However, the underlying decadent is still not fully understood. To fill this gap, studies at cellular scale or cell population scale have been carried out in different labs around the world. This is the experiment done by Professor Briasti's group. This is the charity of a single cell. When a fibroblast was seated on a circular adhesive band, the side skeleton will evolve from a symmetric pattern into into color pattern into colour pattern. Indochiral pattern. Most intriguing, this chiral pattern can be reversed by the concentration of actin-1. See this figure. At low concentration of alpha-actin-1, the color decoration is mostly counterclockwise swording. However, at high concentration, a portion of cells A portion of sales switch to clock clockwise swallowing. Clockwise thwarting. The actions of saturn is mainly comprised of radio fiber and transverse fiber. For transverse fiber, it's mainly comprised of anti anti sorry. Sorry, and parallel acting bundles, it's contractile. For radio fiber, it's mainly comprised of parallel acting bundles. It was suggested the cellular colority is determined by the colority, by the RF rotation or radio fiber rotation. This was also confirmed in our very simple FEM analysis. When we apply core, When we apply cork onto individual radiofiber, the thyroid skeleton displayed with asymmetric deformation. When we change the sign in a simulation, the color deformation is just reversed. So the question which puzzles us is how Which puzzles us is how does alpha-actinine-1 concentration affect the rotation of radiofiber? When radio fiber rotates differently, cells will display with different colority. How does radio fiber rotate? Well, this is illustrated from this video. When it's due to the colority of Colority of acting filament. When an acting filament glows at its bubble end, it interacts with formine. There is a relative rotation between glowing filament and the formine. Those are forming is anchored to flogation. So this relative rotation will induce torque within the radiofiber, which will then cause a radio. Fiber, which will then cause the radio fiber to rotate. So, how could rotation along a one-way dilution can drive the radio fiber to load differently? This is the question we want to answer. To answer this question, we need to know the details of the structure within a radiofiber. This is the Alright, fiber. This is the schematic showing the main components within the radio fiber. It has filaments, formine, capiene protein, and close-linking proteins, which are actin 1. Imagine, this is imagine. If you imagine when the actin filament, actin filament needs to interact with formine, forming is anchored to focalization. The glues of filament will be terminated at certain point, for example, by capping proteins. The length of the filament should be limited, for example, about one for example about one micron the radio the length of radio fiber can be uh tens of tens of micron so we suggest there is a region which we called a growth dominate region in the proximal area to the whole region within this region the growth of filaments is dominated Is dominated. Based on the structure, we developed a theory, a model. This is the slide I need to talk clearly. We only consider the contribution from a single chlorine filament. This filament is simplified as. Simplified as a one-dimensional elastic rod. It interacts with forming. Forming is represented with a torsional spring. When a new monomer is incorporated into the filament, there is a mismatch in the rotating angle between acting filament and forming. The filament is subject to a tensional force. This force is due to the contraction of Is due to the contraction of transverse fiber. The filament will be closely linked to labels through R vactin 1. Well, within the growth storm region, let's imagine, everybody is growing. They are cross-linked. So the cross-links will cause hindrance. So this guy will feel the hindrance from his labor. The hindrance from his labels, we represent this hindrance with a fixed substrate. So, this is your substrate. Within the glow-w region, the glowing filament is cross-linked to a fixed substrate. After the filament grows beyond glowstomial region, it will drive the growth of the whole radial fiber. whole radio fiber. Well, this rotation we consider as a plastic remodeling. We use a dashboard to represent this plasticity. With this model, let's see how this model works. We make a prediction. To make prediction, we need formulas. Well, this is one formula which relates to the attachment. Attachment rate of cloth linkers. These cloth links can randomly attach and detach from the filament. The attachment rate, which is denoted as KON, KON is related to the concentration of other actinin-1. With increasing concentration, Kaon will increase and then saturate. We also have other formulas. I'm not going to. Formulas. I'm not going to talk about them in details. We then make predictions with the theory. This is one figure from our operation. X coordinate is time. Y coordinate is a rotating angle of the radio fiber from the contribution of the growth of a single filament. Well, there exists three phases. Within phase, at phase one, the lutein. At phase one, the looting angle maintains zero. At phase two, looting angle increases. At phase three, the looting angle decreases. Let's see why. At phase one, the gluon filament is still within the glow stominal region, so it will not cause any rotations of the refiber. At phase two, after the filament grows out of the list. out of the this region it will drive the rotation of radio fiber because meanwhile meanwhile these guys will store a portion of elastic energy these guys okay at phase two when a filament the end this end is uh captured uh has captured uh capping pretend to dissoci to be dissociated from forming Dissociated from forming the stored elastic energy will be released. The release of released elastic energy will cause the whole structure to rotate backward, backward. Well, the net rotating angle will be the competition in phase two and phase three. So the net rotation angle can be negative at no concentration. Low concentration and can be positive at low concentration and negative at high concentration. So, we want to convey this idea that late rotating angle is determined by the competition between the positive drive due to the growth and the negative drive due to the release of stored electric energy. We make more predictions. This is this figure. uh this figure x coordinate is uh attachment rate which corresponds to the which is related to the concentration so high concentration will be will lead to high uh k on a large k on and low concentration will be will lead to a low a small k on so as see from this figure when the concentration is low cell prefers to rotate positively Positively. The routine angle of IF is positively, and then the XL will counterclockwise at high concentration, which will give a large KO. The rotating angle is negative, which will cause CO to rotate clockwise. These predictions appear to be consistent. Appear to be consistent with the experiment. The physics, this model is very simple. The physics insights our model are trying to tell is given here. At a low concentration of R actin1, actin filament will quickly glow out beyond the glow stormy region and cause radiofiber to rotate positively and then cause a CO. Positively, and then cause the cell to swirl concludewise. At high concentration, the hindlance from labeling glowing actin filament is so high that the actin filament will grow slowly and that build up a lot of elastic energy. The release of this stolen energy will cause the cell to swallow clockwise. Well, this is the end of my first talk. Now, let's come to the part for the currentity of cell population. This is the experiment done by Professor Wentgroup for when a self-population was seated on a ring-shaped substrate. A strong color pattern occurred. Let's see, they prefer to rotate clockwise along the inner boundary and counterclockwise along the outer boundary. Such a color pattern was also observed for different different different cells from different animals well on when the substrate is rectangular this is taken from professor banan's uh group when the substrate is rectangular the cell proportion the cells tended to align along this diagonal direction List diagonal direction. In trickling, when the colority of individual cells is reversed, the cells tended to along this diagonal direction. So we will interest in this phenomena. The question we were interested is: how do this multi-sector? How do these multicellular color methods emerge and how are they connected to the individual cell colour? To answer this question, we built a very simple model. This model is very simple. Maybe you can think it's overly simplified. It's a cost view. It's cost view. Well, we simplify. We simplify a single model, a single single cell, single cell as an ellipsoidal particle. This particle is subject to a driving force, a concentrated driving force, and also a chiral moment due to chirality. You can also call this chiral moment as a talker. Well, how this talker is induce. This toka is induced, it's not, we are not sure yet. It can be due to the anatropy of the saxoskeleton due to chirality. It could be due to the chiral rotation of adherent philopodia. And with this specified chiral moment, our analysis will show still what Where she would prefer to move in a circle. In this formula, there is a parameter n1. N1 will be shown to control the sign and the strength of individual cellular collective. We also specify the sale-sale interaction. Sales interaction can be passive. Interaction can be passive or active. The sales cell interaction can communicate with sales-substrate interaction. The contribution from the sales-sale interaction to respect sales can be different. This interaction can be long reciprocal. And in our simplification, we simplify the interaction, cell-cell interaction, as a concentrated as a concentrated force, concentrated force and also a moment. The concentrated force is related, it can be positive or negative. Adhesion can be due to cellular interhesion, repulsion can be due to elastic deformation. It's linear, it's in our model, it's linearly related to the overlapping area between neighboring cells. In defined moment, since cells behave like pneumatic liquid crystal, we specify this formula for the cell-cell interaction moment. In the action movement. Well, with this formula, labeling cells would tend to orientate parallel. We also specify the interaction between a cell and a boundary. They also exist with the interaction is simplified with concentrated force and the moment. And the moment. With the force of movement specified, we can calculate the resultant force of moment on individual cells and then use this formula to calculate translational velocity or rotational velocity of individual cells. Okay, that's the main theory we have developed. Now, let's see if how this theory. How this theory works. This is the analysis from our theory. We found that N1 in our theory controls the strength and the sign of colority. When N1 is positive, CO will move clockwise. When N1 is negative, 0 will move counterclockwise. When the absolute value of The absolute value of N1 is large, the curvature radius is small, the cell will have a stronger chirality. We simulate the movement of individual cells along boundaries. Let's see, for cells with clockwise calority, we found that cells prefer to move clockwise. Move clockwise along the out boundary and it changes to counterclockwise along the inner boundary. These guys will not move stably. This will be kicked out when it moves oppositely. Well, when we switch the colority of the individual cell, we find cells with conical-wise colority prefers to rotate conical. Counterclockwise along the outer boundary and clockwise along the inner boundary. We then investigate the chiral pattern of cell population on a substrate. This is ring substrate. Individual cells have the same colority, clockwise colority. Let's see, cells will move. Cells will move clockwise along out boundary, clockwise along the inner boundary, and a strong color pattern occurs. When we switch the color to individual cell, the color pattern is just opposite. It's just opposite. So the color pattern on ring subjects are predicted by our theory. Our theory, these predictions seem to agree with the experiment. We adjust the thickness of the ring in our analysis. When the thickness is small, thickness of the ring is small, the color pattern is strong. When the thickness When the thickness is large, we see the boundary effect. Only cells close to the boundary can align well with the boundary. And cells in this region, the movement are not so regular. This is clearer in this case when the inner boundary When the inner boundary almost disappears, cell line well only near the boundary, it's about two size of two cells. And these cells, the movement of these cells are relatively random. So our analysis indicates there's a strong boundary effect and the regular color pattern only occurs on Occurs on relatively thin green substrate. We also adjust the cell-sale interaction in our analysis when the cell-sail interaction is too weak. Too weak, well, the influence range of the boundary effect is only about It's only one cell in this case. On the other hand, when sales-sale interaction is too strong, we found sales tend to class together and it's not good for the alignment either. Either so the influence side, the boundary effect is affected by a cell cell interaction, and cell cell interaction also regulates the color pattern of cell propagation on substrate. We also adjust the individual cellular colority. When the colority of single cell is too strong, we found that cell cannot align well. Or, cells cannot align well along the boundary. On the other hand, when the quality of single cell is too weak, the movement of cells is random and the cell tend to form congestion. So the color pattern of population is also regulated. Is also regulated by the strength of individual cellular colority. We also investigate elliptical ring substrate. For elliptical ring substrate, its curvature varies along the boundary. We found that a strong color pattern still occurs. And we also found that still we also found that they'll prefer to move stably along this region with a low curvature and they tend to switch the moving direction along this region with large curvature we change the green substrate to rectangular substrate we found that when cells with a When sales with clockwise colority, cells tend to align along this direction. When we switch the chirality of individual cells in a simulation, we found that cells tend to align along this diagonal direction. This prediction seems to be consistent with the experiment. Motivated by the existence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic services in the existing literature, we also design vertical boundaries. In the above analysis, sales near the boundary are trying to align parallel to the boundary. For vertical boundaries, in our analysis, sales would try to align vertically. Try to align vertically to a boundary. In this case, the outer boundary is parallel, the inner boundary is vertical. So we can still see a strong regular pattern. This case is different. The outer boundary is a vertical boundary. The inner boundary is a parallel boundary. The strong color pattern still occurs. So we pop out the alignment angle. The alignment angle along the distance from the screen center, we got this figure. This trend seems to bear some similarity to this figure. This C figure is for the myocardial fiber angle evaluation through ventricular wall thickness. To complete our study, we have assigned different distribution. Different distribution of myocardial fiber chiral alignment on left ventricular. And we use FCM to perform the simulation. Our simulation indicates that the chiral alignment distribution has a strong effect on the deformation of the left ventricular passive process. It's just for a demonstration of the function of the chirality. Of the function of the colority. The physical insights this our students try to convey include there exists a strong size effect in the chirality of cell population and cells with chirality seem to move relatively easily along boundaries and the chiral movement And the chiral movement of cell progression can be modulated by different factors, including boundary feature, individual cellular charity, and cell-cell interaction. This is the conclusion of my talk. I'm not going to read them. This is the end of my talk. Thank you for listening.
