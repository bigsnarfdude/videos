More relevant. And in part, this is going to be playing off of some of the conversations and topics that came up yesterday on vaccine uptake and vaccine hesitancy. Hopefully it's something people are interested in. If not, kind of too bad. There we go. If one were to go look into the vaccine hesitancy literature, just my opinion is seen to fall into one of two categories. The one on the left considers vaccine hesitancy as a mental state. Hesitancy has a mental state, and usually that's what was quote unquote, a state of uncertainty. Should I or should I not get vaccinated? Should I wait to get vaccinated? Some happens to other people, that sort of thing. The information that feeds into that are generally surveys and interviews, and it's asking the question, what creates hesitancy? The outcome of that sort of research is really a list of factors. And here are the aspects that seem to be related to whether or not people are vaccinated. People are vaccinated. The second category of literature, as developed there, are those that, at least methodologically, are considering hesitancy, relating it more to behaviors. So did somebody actually get vaccinated or not? The information feeding in that are also surveys, but also some vaccine uptake numbers, so the proportion of the population that did or did not get a vaccine. That category of work is focused on the question of what predicts. Focus on the question of what predicts the final vaccination status. Similar to the first category, the outcome is generally a list of vectors. Purely predictors, often statistical or mostly some machine learning approach, say, hey, if you have these characteristics, then you are this person likely to get the vaccine. So those are all great things. Especially if you're in government, then this is kind of where we've focused. Then this is kind of where we've focused. This is where you have your engagement specialists going out. Saying, identifying: this is the population that is not getting vaccinated, these are what's keeping them from getting vaccinated. Let's target those people with these reasons and try and come back. So, again, all good things. Unfortunately, it's not good enough for what I'm asked to do. So, the graph here on the left is COVID vaccine uptake in Yukon. Doses is one. In UConn, doses one, two, three, and four. And something that the government likes us needs to do, not only for COVID, but for all of our vaccines, is how many doses do we need to order for next year? And what is the dose five curve going to include? So all of the literature and work that was described previously is really focused on this part of the combination. Who got vaccinated? What portion of the population got vaccinated when everything is said? And again, important. Is set in. And again, important questions. But that doesn't do anything to help me explain what is the shape of this curve. And that is what the government is interested in, in part because it deals with vaccine rollout. If we're limited on the number of doses that we can get at any particular time, that differs from here, or the uptake differs from here, than it does from here, than it does from over here. So the timing of things is important. So the question that I get asked. So, the question that I get asked, and the question that this presentation is going to work more on, is: why are the curves the way they are? Not just that little peaky part, but why is the slope, that slope there, and that slope there? Something this talk is not going to get into is what dose phi is, and why is this one different than this one? I'll explain why I can't do that. At least not yet. The working answer that I think there's never Think there's you know, makes sense, and there's probably not a lot of argument about is well, the differences in vaccine uptake is due to this nebulous concept of vaccine hesitancy. How do you get vaccinated for whatever reasons? Okay, but that doesn't really help me fit curves or predict the next set of doses. So, really, the point of this presentation is to do exactly that. First, I would like to parameterize vaccine hesitancy. Let's stick a number to it so I can Let's stick a number to it so I can try and do some sort of modeling or numerical quantitative thing to it. And by doing that, you get to infer something about the mental state, which is hesitancy, based on the time series of vaccine behavior update rates. At least that's cool. Assuming that I can do that, then I'd like to ask the question, can we group people by this vaccine hesitancy? Hesitancy. And if we can do that, then we can make statements about who is in the group and how large are these groups and what caused people to be in those groups. And that kind of plays into what Rebecca said yesterday. We can get some interesting dynamics happening when you have people with different opinions. And those dynamics change on how many opinion blocks you have. Well, maybe there's a relationship between people with opinions and the strength of vaccine hesitancy that you have. We can say something about. Have. If we can say something about what is hesitancy and can we put those into groups, then maybe we can tell Rebecca, hey, you need four groups of people with the strength of opinions, and then go forth. Yeah, so in the end, I want to be able to take an uptake curve, like this, and you probably can't see the x, that is the dose one uptake rate to ucon by time, but to be able to take that curve and kind of decompose it into, say, there's x number of groups that have this strength. That have this strength of vaccine hesitancy. That's the idea. To do that, we're going to take you back to freshman chemistry 101. You have reactant A, reactant B, mixing together, you get product P. Maybe. So if A and B have enough energy to overcome that sort of barrier, then you get product P. And if you mix them together and they And if you mix them together and they don't have enough energy to create that transition state or overcome transition state energy, then you don't. That's kind of familiar to people. Same plot over there. And if we refer to everyone's favorite Austrian physicist, Ludwig Boltzmann, he derived a distribution, really a probability distribution, that a particular molecule, a particle. Particular molecule, particle would have enough energy to overcome that barrier. That barrier we call the activation energy of the state chemistry model. The functional form of that distribution, conveniently named the Boltzmann distribution, really confusing the Boltzmann-derived the Gaussian distribution, something like that. The functional form of that distribution is this kind of negative or proportional to this negative exponential functional. Functional PA is the activation energy, so it's the height of that barrier. And that KT is kind of energy in the system as parameterized by temperature. The law of mass action says the rate of our reaction is going to be related somehow to the amount of stuff we can react, and there will be a little exponent in there, times that constant. And the Rhenius equation says, well, that constant depends on what kind of proportion. How kind of proportion of that can react, which we're going to say is related to the amount of particles with sufficient energy to overcome the barrier. When we put all of that together, as we do in String 101, we get the rather simple thought process that the higher the energy barrier there, the smaller the proportion we have that has the necessary energy to react, and so we get slower reactions. Again, it's all just basic chemistry. We're not here to talk about basic chemistry, so why am I? Talk about basic chemistry, so why am I wasting your time? Let's make, I'll channel or interlisa, and make a big conceptual leap and do something way out of the box. And what if we said, really, what if we tried to directly relate the idea of vaccine hesitancy to this activation genome? And so let's say that we're starting off with reactance of unvaccinated people, and there's some barrier to them getting vaccinated, which we will call conveniently vaccine heads. Call conveniently vaccine hesitancy. And that if they have enough motivation to overcome this barrier of hesitancy, then they get vaccinated. We could also say that there's some sort of distribution or amount of motivation that people have, but if that barrier is high, if there's a lot of hesitancy, then there's going to be a relatively small proportion of the population that have enough motivation to go out there and eat. That might be kind of today's situation. Kind of today's situation. Way back dose one times when everyone is super scared of COVID, jab me and jab me now, then perhaps we're back here. There's low hesitancy. There's enough motivation to get poked that we have a relatively large proportion of the population that's willing to get vaccinated. At any particular time, vaccination rates, the number of people getting poked, would be the number of people that could get vaccinated and find some proportion of that. And then we may. And then we make that conceptual leap, or a second leap, of let's say that K is distributed the exact same way that Holtzman said it should be for chemistry and particles. Where there's some energy, or I guess some barrier term that we're going to call vaccine hesitancy. And there's some, in the chemistry world, kind of energy in the system. And for us, it's going to be vaccine motivation. Some motivational force that's going to encourage people to be vaccinated. As far as this goes, As far as this goes, for me, the vaccine hesitancy and vaccine motivation are both latent variables, they're concepts, and I can't distinguish the two of them. So I'm going to lump them together into one big thing called the vaccine hesitancy ratio. So the ratio of hesitancy divided by motivation. So, really, that exponent there. And if we're all okay with that, which we may or may not be, and I look forward to your comments at the end of all of this, then we can say the same kind. This, then we can say the same kind of thing. The higher the vaccine hesitancy or the hesitancy ratio, then the smaller proportion of people have sufficient motivation, sufficient enthusiasm to get vaccinated, and slower vaccination. That's the idea. We can take that a little bit further, and still pulling on a little bit of chemistry. That if we take the probability of vaccinated and the probability of unvaccinated, and take the ratio. Of unvaccinated, and take the ratio of that, and some of our constants cancel out, and we get this general negative exponential. Again, we're going to combine hesitancy and motivation because I don't know how to separate those two components. And so we get this negative exponential vaccine hesitancy ratio. Simple little algebra, we'll say we can take the vaccine hesitancy ratio, which is kind of my way of saying this is vaccine hesitancy. Say, hey, what I'm looking for in the end, vaccine hesitancy. For in the end, vaccine hesitancy ratio is the negative log of the odds of vaccination. We have lots of super smart people and talented statisticians, so if you were like me, who does not fall into one of those categories, still, log odds, it's no logistic regression, it's a log odds. And I do want to point out that what we're doing here has nothing inherently to do with logistic regression, so don't get confused about that. So don't get confused about that. We just have a log odds going on. But if we were to look at a time series of the log odds or the vaccine hesitancy ratio, and it turns out that there was some structure to it that involved time, then that would allow us to separate vaccine hesitancy ratio into groups using time as a signal. So, in fact, we're kind of So, in fact, we're kind of leveraging the logistic regression equation without doing logistic regression as a classification scheme. All good so far. That's all theory. Let's talk data. So I'm from the Yukon. Yukon is way up north, so kind of left side of Canada, next to Alaska. We have a few municipalities, kind of the biggest one, well, by far the biggest one, is. The biggest one, well, by far the biggest one, is White Horse, not Yellow Knife, but it's worth. The data that I'm using is pretty limited in scope, so I chose just the age 30 to 49, in particular because it was a very clean data set. So there was a single start date. It does include both sexes, and it's just in Whitehorse. And on some level, that might not matter because almost all of the population is in Whitehorse anyway. So you're capturing the vast majority of everyone by using Whitehorse. Waitors, but also most of our communities are very small, there's a very high indigenous population there, so they tended to get earlier vaccination than everyone else. So by kind of instilling or applying this set of restrictions, then we have a very uniform start time for everyone that could get vaccinated, hit the go button, and we see what happens. Data. So I noticed when I was sitting in the back that nobody can actually read. When I was sitting in the back, nobody could actually read the labels on the turds, so that is unfortunate. On the top left, we have the dose one uptake rate, so number of needles and arms on a particular day, and time on the x-axis. You can see that there's some downward, curvy functional form there. Kind of law of mass action equation, or if you don't want to call it that, says vaccination rate, so the change between each of the dots are going to be the number of people who could get. Are going to be the number of people who could get vaccinated. We're going to take some proportion of that. We could treat that proportion as a probability of vaccination if you wanted it to. Plot over here is really just taking those two variables. So we have the uptake rate, the vaccination rate there, and the number of unvaccinated people on the x-axis, which is all there. So if that probability was constant over time, default assumption, then we should see a straight line on this plot. And hopefully, I'm not the only one. Plot. And hopefully, I'm not the only one that thinks a straight line would not be a particularly good fit on that. It might actually be okay down there, but it would do a bad job of incorporating all the dots up here. So I just did some kind of non-linear fit. It's not particularly important what that fit is for my purpose. Just highlighting that. It doesn't seem reasonable to me that the probability of vaccination stays constant over time. It's changing. And that's great for my little activation theory of vaccine uptake. Theory of vaccine uptake, because that theory also says it should not be constant. It should change over time. The way it should change over time is related to this odds ratio. And so if we were to look at whether or not there is in fact a time component, we can plot the odds ratio and see whether or not things change over time in some identifiable way. And that's what this plot is. We have the odds ratio, or the odds, which is that guy, and time on the x-axis. And time on the x-axis, and if this created some sort of shape, then great, that allows us to say something about the vaccine hesitancy ratio and be able to separate it over time. And to me, although it's definitely a bit messy, but yes, there is some time-based structure to how the odds are changing. Turn, that's great, because that means time is important, and then maybe we can do something about separating out the overall vaccine hesitancy ratio so we can get that number. Vaccine hesitancy ratios, and we get that number for each day. We can separate out groups of people with different vaccine hesitancy ratios using time as a separate meter. So I do that. This is our kind of master equation. Vaccine hesitancy ratio, it's kind of our proxy for vaccine hesitancy, is that negative log of the odds. We plot the vaccine hesitancy or the vaccine hesitancy ratio over here and time, because we just identified that time can be used to try and separate. Can used to try and separate out groups of things. And then those are my groups. I haven't done anything fancy here other than look at it and say, well, these kind of look like groups to me. Next steps. But by doing that, I see there's kind of a low hesitancy group here, where the vaccine hesitancy ratio is low, and then a larger, medium group, and a high group. All of the plots that I had dots on them are people who actually got vaccinated at some point, but there is a group who. At some point, but there is a group who never got vaccinated, and so they never appeared as a dot. So they are a fourth group, they've never vaccinated. And then kind of a weird outlying group here, and I'll tell you just about it. So if we accept this just kind of eyeballing clustering for the moment, then we can translate people that are in those groups to our actual time series. So that the low vaccine hesitancy ratio people here, so those that either have a low hesitancy or high motivation, or some permutation of the tune. Some information too. But those guys that got vaccinated very early and had the steepest decline, or call it that. Medium group is where the inflection in the curve was, and the high group and the never vaccinated are all appearing here, where there was very few people that got vaccinated or nobody that got vaccinated much later in the time series. And in the time series of the vaccine uptake rate, there's this group way down here. There's this group way down here that got vaccinated early, but at substantially lower numbers than the premise. That corresponds to this kind of outlying group here. And when you look at kind of the outlying level data, if you look at the data per day, it turns out that all of those people get vaccinated on the weekend. So find that there was actually a day of week effect where people purposefully seem to avoid getting vaccinated on the weekend. So they didn't spend the weekend in bed. Spend the weekend in bed recovering than vaccine, and would rather get vaccinated on work days so they can test work instead. So I think that's what's going on with the weekend part. Now that we've clustered things, we can say, well, we know how many people are in each of those dots. So we can say, at this point, we're going to define four clusters of vaccine hesitancy groups, and we know what the size of the clusters are. And we could further explore and say, well, what are the characteristics of the people in each of those clusters? In each of those class students, and do some sort of classification stuff, if you want. So, I think this slide kind of summarizes the three main objectives that I want. Can we parameterize vaccine hesitancy, sort of, kind of, through the vaccine hesitancy ratio? I would like to try and use that to create groups of vaccine hesitancy people. Or can we count how many groups there are who's in the group? Hopefully, maybe, using the vaccine ratio and time and seeing how those cluster. Time is possible. The number of never looks very low. So is it really true that 90 or 95% of people got vaccinated, or how did you decide how many? We had a 96% update. So the reason I'm surprised is your curve topped out around 14 or 15,000. Is that everybody who's eligible? Between the 30 and 49. Thank you so much. I know I was missing something. Good. I went through that same thing. I went through that same thing. Actually, it's actually well worth that. Are you doing this just from numbers and days, or do you have landless data that are telling you what individuals solved? All of this is numbers and dates. So you have a day and it's a Saturday and you know how long time has elapsed and you can get these. Hesitancy ratio is just a fraction vaccinated over unvaccinated on that day. Okay, I guess. So, to summarize all that nonsense, the rate of vaccination is probably related in some way to hesitancy. Really, no surprise there. I would like to say quantitatively it is related to this concept, this thing, that is the vaccine hesitancy ratio, which I'm defining as the negative log odds of being vaccinated. And why is it that? Well, it's from this amazing thing that you'll go tell all your friends about activation theory of vaccine uptake. Activation theory of vaccine uptake, which has a latent, unfortunately, hesitancy and motivation component to it. And by using this particular parameterization, we can create plots in the evolution of mental states of vaccine hesitancy. But the potential to create clusters or to cluster it. How many groups of hesitancy are there? What are those groups? And then ideally dive further into kind of the light level. Why is these? Do come to the light level: why is this person in this particular cluster? Coming to that, in the future, it would be super nice to look at new vaccines like flu, because this still works. I'll admit, I'm not convinced. COVID, especially DOS 1, DOS 2, really all of the doses were nice because it was a very fixed start point. Now it's where you're eligible in starts. So I think flu has a much more fluid start time, so I'm not sure the So I'm not sure the segregation by time is really good. And even if this was great for what we saw, it is very much retrospective. We had all the data to begin with, so we could do this decomposition. It remains an unsolved question for me as to whether or not this can get applied or how we would apply this to what is do 5 when we don't have the uptake curve. That's it. Thank you for not pulling us in.
