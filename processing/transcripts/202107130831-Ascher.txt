Back to the second session of second days. So, second speaker is Kenny Ascha, and he's from Abai, and he's going to speak about hyperbolic or varieties of logogen type. Okay, so please. Yeah, thank you for the introduction. So, everything I say today is joint work with Kristen de Fleming and Amos Turquette. So, I want to So, I want to begin with reviewing some things that actually Ariane mentioned yesterday. So, we're going to start with C being a smooth projective curve over a number field K. And so we have the theorem of faultings. Right, so this says that if the genus of C is at least says that if the genus of c is at least two then c of k is finite and so you know naturally there's various questions we could ask from here we could ask you know how many points and this gets into uniformity questions and there's been lots of progress in uniformity though i don't want to necessarily talk about that today instead i'd like to talk about what happens in higher dimensions and so instead of focusing on the theorem of faultings or maybe On the theorem of faultings, or maybe the related conjecture of Lange, I want to mention a related result. So, again, this is for curves. The following are equivalent. So, again, C is just a smooth projective curve over K. The genus of C is at least 2. Two the canonical is ample the set C L is finite for any finite extension L over K right so here we're so I think Ariane referred to this yesterday as Mordelic so we could use Yesterday is more delicate, so we could use that terminology today. And then I want to introduce a new one. So any holomorphic map from the complex numbers to C is constant. And so this notion of hyperbolicity goes under Brody hyperbolicity. And so the key point here is to use Riemann uniformization plus Liaville's theorem, right? So we know that the universal cover of Riemann surface of genus Li's II is the disk. And so you lift the map from C to the disk, and so it must be constant by Liaville's theorem. And so here we get that any holomorphic map is constant. And so you could view this theorem as saying that at least for curves that various notions of hyperbolicity are coinciding. And not only are various notions, And not only are various notions of hyperbolicity coinciding, some arithmetic statement, some geometric statement, but we also have some intrinsic geometric condition that characterizes this, namely the genus or equivalently the positivity of the canonical bundle. And so the question is essentially how we could try to generalize this theorem to say higher dimensions as well as say quasi-projective varieties. Okay. So yesterday, again, So, yesterday, again, it was mentioned in Arianne's talk that there's a conjecture of Lange. So, I think he referred to this as weak Lange's conjecture. And so what this asks, or what it predicts, is that if X is some, satisfy some higher dimensional generalization of genus at least two, so if X is so-called general type, then some statement about Then, some statement about the arithmetic properties of x, namely x is not the risky dense. And again, it was pointed out that we cannot expect finiteness. So instead, we replace the expectation of finiteness with the expectation that the rational points are not service intense. So let me very sort of quickly remind what this notion of general type means, since it'll be important for the rest of the talk. Okay. Okay, so again, let's just suppose now x is smooth and projective, not necessarily a curve now, and then w, sorry, omega x is the canonical. Suppose that if I look at powers of omega x, suppose this is non-zero for some positive m. And so then we can define this map that sends x to the That sends X to the projectization of the ringo sections. And so from here, so we think about this for a moment. For instance, maybe the easiest example to keep in mind is if x is canonically polarized, so if omega x is ample, then some power is very ample, and so actually you get an embedding. But in general, this is, of course, not the case. So you could think about, you know, for instance. So, you could think about, you know, for instance, like an elliptic curve. So, in general, we say the Kadara dimension. So this is usually denoted kappa x. This is defined to be the maximum of the dimension of the image under these maps here. And so once we define the Kadara dimension, this allows us to say. The Katara dimension, this allows us to say when a variety is of general type. So X is of general type if the Katara dimension is equal to the dimension of X. And let me also point out, since it will come up towards the end of the talk, that an equivalent way to define a general type is to say that the canonical bundle Is big. So you could define big to say, so the notion of big can be defined as the number of sections grows like a polynomial of degree the dimension of x, or this ends up, this is equivalent to saying that the Kadara dimension of x is equal to the dimension of x. Okay. And so again, let me just remind you that, for instance, That for instance, if x is canonically polarized, this is an example of a variety of general type. So, here's some classic example. So, for curves, for instance, so for curves, we see that genus of C greater than or equal to 2 is equivalent to being general type. Another good example is something like a high-degree hypersurface. And you could just use the adjunction formula to see this sort of property. See this sort of property. Or you could generalize it to say complete intersection. So there's lots of nice examples of varieties of general type. And again, the conjecture of length says that if you have a variety of general type, then the expectation is that the rational points are not so risky tense. And this conjecture of Lange, as was pointed out in Arian's talk, is only known for curves or for sub-varieties of abelian varieties. So that's, again, a result of faultings. And then there's some related cases again when. And then there's some related cases again when you have, you can relate the variety that you care about to some ambelian variety in some way. And actually, we'll see something about that in a bit. But again, I don't want to necessarily focus on Lang's conjecture. The question I want to ask is, well, since we cannot necessarily solve Lang's conjecture right now, what happens if we say add more assumptions? And so just to give an idea of what kind of assumption we're going to add, I want to go. What kind of assumption we're going to add? I want to go back to this theorem that discusses equivalent notions of hyperbolicity. And I want to point out that for curves, we don't necessarily gain anything new by assuming instead that the cotangent bundle here is ample, right? Since the cotangent bundle for a curve is the same thing as the canonical bundle. But in higher dimensions, if I assume some positivity of the cotangent bundle, then this is assuming something much stronger. And so the question I want to ask for now is what happens. The question I want to ask for now is: what happens if we assume some positivity of the cotangent bundle instead of just assuming some positivity of the canonical bundle? And so, I mean, one thing I need to do is, since the cotangent bundle is a vector bundle, I need to say what I mean by positivity of a vector bundle. But before I get there, I want to state a conjecture that will motivate the. The next section of this talk. So, this conjecture is going to be the conjectural analog of the theorem stating that various notions of hyperbolicity are equivalent. Okay, so now X is just a smooth projective variety, not necessarily a curve. So, X is more delicious. So, again, this means So again, this means some finiteness property of rational points. X is Brody hyperbolic, so this again means that holomorphic maps from C are constant. And then finally, I'm going to add a new one that did not appear before. All positive dimensional subvarieties of X Of X, our general type. So this condition is new. This did not appear in the statement for curves. And essentially what it says is not only, sorry, what it says is that all the sub-values of X have some sort of positivity. And another thing I do want to point out is you'll note that there's no sort of intrinsic geometric condition here anymore. So in the theorem we had for curves, we also had this. We had for curves, we also had this geometric condition that classified these notions of hyperbolicity, namely that the genus was at least two or that the canonical bundle was ample. We don't have that anymore in this conjecture. And perhaps that's so this conjecture is also wide open. And maybe perhaps part of the problem is that we don't have this intrinsic geometric condition that we understand, which relates exactly to all of these notions of hyperbolicity. But what I do want to point out, as we'll But what I do want to point out, as we'll see in the next section, is that actually positivity of the cotangent bundle will imply various notions of hyperbolicity. And so I think it's natural to start looking at positivity of the cotangent bundle, seeing what we could prove, and then perhaps trying to remove some positivity little by little until we could hopefully obtain an if and only of. So to get there, I want to just review what I mean by positivity of vector bundles since Vector bundles since the cotan bundle is a sheaf is not a line bundle. Okay, so let E be a vector bundle on x. So again, x is just a smooth projective variety. Let H be any ample line bundle. Line bundle. Okay, and so I want to define now what I mean by ample or what I mean by big for a vector bundle. So the first thing I'm going to do is say that E is globally generated if there is a surjection. From some power of the structure sheaf onto E for some positive A. Okay, so there's globally generated. And now I'm going to use global generation to define ampleness. So E is ample if I look at the symmetric power of A. I look at the symmetric power of A, sorry, of E, so the eighth symmetric power of E, and I tensor with the inverse of this ample, it's still globally generated. Sorry, so there exists an A so that when I do this, it's globally generated. So the point is that the negativity coming from the inverse of H is, I mean, E is ample enough that as long as I take a high enough symmetric power, the negativity coming from H inverse is not enough to remove that positivity of. To remove that positivity of e. And then I can make a similar definition for big, where now instead I just ask for, okay, so this should be for some A, sorry. And then big is just if I have generic global generation. Okay. Okay, so again, he's globally generated. There's this rejection. He is globally generated. There's this rejection from some power of the structure sheaf. Ample, if I take symmetric power and I tensor by the inverse of ample, it's globally generated, then big is just generically globally generated. But there's some remarks in here to make this easier to follow. So first, let me just point out that this is independent of the choice of H. The choice of ample line bundle doesn't matter. So there's, I mean, if I have a vector bundle, I could take. I mean, if I have a vector bundle, I could take the projectivization of the vector bundle. And so another option would be to look at O of one on the projectivization. And so now I have a line bundle. I understand very well what it means for this line bundle to be ample. And you could ask if this is equivalent to E being ample as I defined above, and it turns out that this is true. So if you prefer to think about ampleness in this way, that is perfectly okay. So unfortunately, this is no longer true for big. So if I look at the projectivization of E and I ask O1 to be big, And I ask O1 to be big. This is actually not the same as asking that E as big as I defined above. And so this is why I went through making the definitions this way, because it'll be important towards the end of the talk that I require that of some vector bundles big, and we're going to be using this notion here, not this notion. Okay, maybe one more remark here is that if I have an ample vector bundle and I take a quotient or Ample vector bundle, and I take a quotient or a restriction that is also ample. Okay, so now that I have some notions of positivity of the cotangent bundle, I want to ask what happens if I assume some positivity of the cotangent bundle, what can I say about the geometric or arithmetic properties of Or arithmetic properties of this projective variety x. So the first theorem I want to mention is due to Kobayashi. And so this theorem says if the cotangent bundle of X is ample, then X is Brody hyperbolic. And so I should mention that there's another notion of There's another notion of, okay, there's many notions of hyperbolicity. Another notion of hyperbolicity is Kobayashi hyperbolicity. But when X is compact, Kobayashi hyperbolicity and Brody hyperbolicity coincide. So I could have stated this theorem saying X is Kobayashi hyperbolic, but so since I've already defined Brody hyperbolic, I'm going to state it in this way. Okay, so if the cotangent bundle is ample, then I get Brody hyperblucid. So now we want to ask. Getty hyperbolicity. So now we want to ask if we also get other notions of hyperbolicity. And so the next result I want to state is that if omega 1x is ample, then all positive dimensional subvarieties are of general type. And let me sketch a proof of this statement because it'll be. It'll be useful for later. So, why is this true? So, well, just take any sub-variety of dimension D, and now take a resolution of singularities. And now, through this resolution of singularities, I could pull back the dth power of omega. So, remember, I assumed omega. Omega. So remember, I assumed omega 1x is ample. So this also has positivity. And now I have a generically surjective morphism to the d power of the cotangent bundle of y. But this is precisely the canonical of y. And so the canonical of y is big. And so therefore, y naught is of general type. Okay, so So now we see if omega one is ample, then also all positive dimensional sub varieties are general type. Okay. Those powers are exterior power. Omega to the D? Yes. Wedge-wedge product. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So now, so there were three. Now, so there were three notions of hyperbolicity that I mentioned. So, two of them I've addressed. And the last one is the arithmetic, the Mordellic property that was discussed yesterday. And so, one thing that was alluded to in yesterday's talk by Arian is that if you could somehow relate your variety to abelian variety, then you can try to understand, you could try to prove some arithmetic hyperbolicity statement once you correlate your. probability statement once you can relate your variety to a Belian variety because then you could apply Falting's theorem. And so I want to make this statement precise now. So this is a theorem of Moriwaki. And so if omega 1x is ample and globally generated, then XK Xk is finite. So, okay, so we don't we here we assume also global generation, but if we assume this positivity of the cotangent bundle, then actually we get this Mordelic property that there's finitely many points. And so the idea behind this proof is that we use the properties that we assumed of the cotangent bundle to relate X to its Albanese. And then once we have related X to the Sabelian variety, we can then apply Faulting's theorem. Faulting's theorem to obtain that the number of points is the set of points is actually finite. Okay, so now I've hopefully convinced you that positivity of the canonical bundle is a useful tool in trying to understand hyperbolicity of algebraic varieties. But somehow there's maybe two natural questions that arise from this. One namely, are there examples of varieties with ample cotangent bundle? Varieties with ampal cotangent bundle, and second, you know, I've told you implications, but what happens if we try to go the other direction? So, let me let me address those two questions now. So the first thing I want to do is address this question of, are there examples of varieties with ample cotangent bundle? And so, this is also a very active area of research to find varieties with ample cotangent bundle. So, let me just point out a few examples. out a few examples. So Kadira fibrations. So these are non-isotrivial families of curves, smooth non-isotrivial families of curves of genus at least three over a genus at least two base. So as long as the fibers are hygieneous, the base is hygieneous, this gives me a variety with ample cotangent bundle. And now sort of the second extended class of examples all follow in the same sort of principle. Sort of principle. And I guess this is arising in work of Bogomolov and Miyajoka, where you take a sufficiently general complete intersection of positive divisors inside a product of positive varieties. So Polgomolov, and so what happens is you take sufficiently general complete Complete intersection of positive divisors inside a product. And so then this idea was pushed further by Debar, who studied complete intersections of sufficiently ample general divisors in abelian varieties. And then DeBarr conjectured that a similar statement was true if I take a complete intersection of enough high-degree hypersurfaces inside sorry, a complete intersection inside a high-degree hypersurface in projector space. And this is now a theorem. So, oops. So, this is the Barr's conjecture, which is a theorem. Which is a theorem. So due to broke back, Darndo and independently Xia. And then this was pushed further by Ya Deng and then Hushkin and Riedel in obtaining like effective bounds of what the complete intersection actually has to be to obtain a variety with ample cotangent functions. A variety with ample cotangent bundle. Okay, so there are now lots of examples, at least in principle, of varieties with ample cotangent bundle. So now let me address the second question of whether or not this is necessarily the right condition to be looking for. And so there is a sort of a class of examples you can construct that are hyperbolic but do not have ample cotangent bundles. So it is at least ample cotangent bundle itself is not necessarily the Bundle itself is not necessarily the right condition. So let me, let's see. So if I take, so C is C is a curve of genus at least two. And so this is sort of a standard way to construct higher dimensional hyperbolic varieties or higher dimensional general type varieties. You simply take products of lower dimensional ones. So if I take a curve which is hyperbolic and I take the product with itself, and this satisfies hyperbolicity, but omega one is. But omega 1 is not ample. So omega 1 of cross c is not ample. And the point is that I can consider the restriction of this vector bundle to cross a point. And that will have a trivial quotient. And so that so then omega 1 cannot be ample because all restrictions and quotients would have to be ample. And so somehow for products, this really breaks down. Okay, so this is somehow the end of the story, at least for The story, at least, for projective varieties. So now I want to move on to discuss a little bit about the quasi-projective case. Okay, so now let's suppose Y is a quasi-projective variety. So instead of viewing Y as a quasi-projective variety, what I want to do is consider smooth projective compactification. Rectification, which I'll call X. And such that if I look at the complement of Y inside X, this is D, which is a simple normal crossings divisor. And so now from this point of view, instead of thinking about Y the quasi-projective variety, I want to study properties of the pair X, D, where X is this projective variety and D is the divisive. This projective variety and D is the divisor, which is the complement of this compactification. So instead of thinking about this quasi-projective variety Y, I really want to think about this pair X, D. This is very sort of natural and convenient from the viewpoint of geometry, and especially, say, the middleware model program in higher dimensional geometry. And so the arithmetic viewpoint I want to take, so if you're familiar with this, I need to introduce a notion of integral points since I'm no longer talking about rational points. I'm no longer talking about rational points. And so, just to give sort of a very quick idea of what's happening here. So, what I need to do, so let me just say sort of arithmetic viewpoint here. So, I need to choose a model of this pair over spec of the ring of integers in the number field. And perhaps I want to throw away some set of primes. And so once I do that, And so once I do that, I could define integral points to be sections from spec of this ring of integers and number field to this to this model here. So the model is just a family over the spec OKS such that the generic fiber is this X D that I started with. Okay, so now, oh, so maybe I'll just also point out that if D is empty, then you could use the value chip criterion of properness to recover. Criterion of properness to recover the notion of rational points. So, this is the sort of the right way to generalize this notion from rational points to integral points. And so, for the sake of completeness, let me motivate the remainder of this talk by mentioning a conjecture, which is maybe the generalization of the weak Lang conjecture that I mentioned from before. So, let me associate this to Lang Voigte. And so, what this conjecture says. And so what this conjecture says is that if x, d, so this is one of these pairs that I introduce above, is a pair of log general type. So this is the natural generalization of general type for this case of pairs. And I'll, okay, I'll make a comment or two about what this log general type notion means in a moment. Then the set of integral points. is not so risky task. Okay, so this is the generalization of the line conjecture to the setting. So we replace general type with this notion of log general type and we replace the rational points with integral points. Okay, so let me say a little bit about this notion here of log general type just by way of giving sort of an example. So right, so Right, so I sort of brushed under the rug the point that the general type can be defined as omega x being big. So if we use that point of view, then you can define log general type as saying that omega x twisted by this divisor d here is big. So I want to think about this as saying that omega x twisted by d is big. And so concretely, let me just give you two examples. So if I look at p1, p1 is not of general type, right? It's a canonical bundle is like O of minus 2. However, if I add at least three points, However, if I add at least three points to my divisor d, then this gives me a pair of log journal type because now I compute the canonical bundle of p1 twisted by at least three points, and now I have something which is ample. And so let me give you a higher dimensional example. So a standard example is like P2 and a smooth quartic curve. Here's a pair which is log general. And so these are the types of geometric cases that we're interested in. Cases that we're interested in for a conjecture like this. And so, this conjecture, this Langvoid conjecture, is just like the Lang conjecture, essentially wide open, except for the case of curves, which is Siegel's theorem, or sub-varieties of semi-abelian varieties. So this is Voita's generalization of the result of faultings from abelian varieties to semi-abelian varieties. And so, just like I had a conjecture that various notions of hyperbolicity coincided. Notions of hyperbolicity coincided for projective varieties. I can go ahead and make this conjecture for quasi-projective varieties. So the following are equivalent. So again, so there are finitely many integral points. So we can view this as like Mordelic, Brody hyperplicity, and then finally, all positive dimensional sub-varieties are of log general type. Okay, so this is the natural generalization of the conjecture above to the case for Above to the case for quasi-projective varieties. And so naturally, what we'd want to do is consider the analog of the cotangent bundle. And so the analog of the cotangent bundle will be the log cotangent sheaf. So now we want to consider, instead of omega 1x, we want to consider omega 1x log d. And so let me give a quick definition and intuition behind how you should think of omega 1x log d so okay again with So again, let's just suppose X is smooth projective. And now let's suppose that D is simple. Let's just assume it's normal crossings. So reduced normal crossings. So sum of di. Then we could define the log cotangent sheaf, omega 1x log d. So this is the sheaf of differential forms. With log poles along V. So just sort of how you should think about this. So suppose U inside X is open. Suppose X is dimension N. And suppose that D on the side, when restricted to this open set, is defined by the product Z1 up to Zk equals zero. Then the sections Then the sections on U are just, so for one up to k, I have the logarithmic differentials, dz1 over z1, dzk over zk. And then for the indices above that, I have just the standard differentials. So this is what the sections look like. This is how you should think about this log. How you should think about this Lach cotangent sheaf. Okay, so naturally, I want to assume some positivity of the Lach cotangent sheaf and then try to prove some hyperbolicity results. But unfortunately, we have the following problem, which is that omega 1x log d is never ample. And so the idea is the following. So I have an exact sequence, I always have the following. They always have the following exact sequence. And now I can consider the restriction along D. And the point is, if this here is ample, then the restriction, we learned that the restriction of ample vector bundles ample. So let's just call this A. And so now I have this trivial quotient here. And so I can't have this rejection from an ample sheaf in this way. And so the log cotangent bundle. And so the log code tangent bundle cannot be ample. Okay, so somehow this idea at least naively breaks down. But we nevertheless want to fix this problem and still understand hyperbolicity of quasi-projective varieties. So we ask for sort of the next best thing. So instead, we could ask what if omega 1x log d is as ample as possible. Okay. And so one can give a rigorous definition of what I'm going to give and what follows using the stable base locus and the augmented base locus. But let me just sort of give it in words at this point. So we say omega 1x log d is almost ample. If one omega one x log dot is big, right, so we can assume ample, but we could assume sort of the as the next best thing we can, which is big. And you'll notice from this exact sequence argument that somehow the place where the ampleness is failing is really contained in the support of the divisor D. So, what we could do is essentially ask that the divisor. Essentially, ask that this sheaf is ample away from D. So, in particular, the non-ample locus is contained in the support of D. And so I will point out that so in our work, we are actually interested in other questions like uniformity questions, and we needed to understand these sheaves actually on very single. The sheaves actually on very singular varieties, so varieties with SLC singularities coming from the minimal model program. And so, actually, the definition we give is maybe slightly more general than what I'm saying here, but at least in the smooth projective case, if you're disinterested from the sake of hyperbolicity, this suffices. And I want to point out that a similar definition is given in work by Brodbeck and Deng. So, okay, so now. So, okay, so now that we have this definition, there's a few questions to ask. One is: does it still give us the hyperbolicity results that we want? And second, is this a meaningful definition in the sense that are there actually examples that are satisfying this notion here? And so let me state a theorem of Brokebeck and Dang. Okay, so this theorem says if x is smooth, Smooth, then there exists a divisor D so that omega 1x log D is almost ample. So in general, it's sort of hard to say what D has to be. D usually needs to have many components, but at least from an existence point of view, we know that if X is smooth, there always exists. We know that if x is smooth, there always exists a divisor d. And I believe the example that is known due to Naguchi is that I could take six lines in general position in P2, and that will give me cotangent bundle, which is almost dample. Okay, so we know that there exists varieties that satisfy this property. So now let me finish by mentioning the results one can prove with regards to hyperbolicity for varieties with almost sample log coteneous. Almost ample log cotangent. So the first theorem I want to point out is that if omega 1x log d is almost ample, then X D is Brody hyperbolic. And so this was not sort of This was not sort of stated this way, but was implicit in, at least as far as I know, work of Demai using language coming from jet bundles. But if you trace out what this notion of almost sample means, you could find in papers of his that actually you have Brody hyperbolicity. Okay, now for a pair to be Brody hyperbolic. Okay, so I guess what I should write here is not x, d, but instead x minus d is that better for. Is that better? Yeah, thanks. Okay, so now let me finish by stating our theorem. So, this is joint with Kristen de Fleming and Amos Turquette. So, the first thing is if we assume almost ample, if omega 1x log d is almost ample, then Is almost ample, then all um sub-varieties. Okay, so I'm just going to state it in words. I mean, in principle, you have to be careful, like the sub-varieties can't be contained in D, but all sub-varieties are of log general type. And so, again, I should state that we prove this more generally than I'm stating here. We prove this for single. That I'm stating here, we proved this for singular varieties, and you have to be more careful in that case because now you have to be extending differential forms on singular spaces. But in the smooth case, the key input to proving this result, so maybe I should just say that a key input here is a result of compana and pong, which states that if omega 1 y log e 1y log e contains a big subsheaf, then the pair y, e is of log general type. And so with this in mind, to prove log general type of any sub variety, what you need to do is show that the cotangent bundle of each subvariety contains a big subsheaf. And so this is the same result of component point that was used to That was used to generate results in the proof of the Vivek conjecture in work of Campanapon and then Popa-Schnell. I have a question. Sorry. Yeah. So when you say sub-variety is a row, general pie, so you are choosing boundary using like a junction or something? Yeah, yeah. So you take a sub-variety of Y and then you take the X and then you take the intersection with D and you take the reduced. And you take the reduced. Oh, I just, I see. I see. Okay. So you don't need to take like a normal C who sub variety or like a you just distribution. Yeah, yeah. I see section and then take the reduced part of it. Yeah. I see. Okay, thank you. Yep. And okay, so let me, there's one more theorem I want to state then. So, okay, so we've shown that if omega one is almost ample, then we have Brody hyperbolic. Almost ample, then we have Brody hyperbolicity. We have this algebraic geometric notion of hyperbolicity that all sub-varieties are of log general type. And now, finally, we have this arithmetic statement. So now you could ask, what if I can relate this quasi-projective variety to a semi-abelian variety? Can I perhaps apply Voigta's theorem in the same way that Moriwaki applies Falting's theorem? And so we do that. So this is again. Do that. So, this is again with Chris and the Fleming almost turquette. If omega 1x log d is almost ample and globally generated, then this pair here is more delicate. So there's finitely many integral points. So, there's finitely many integral points. And again, the way you would prove this statement is you use these properties of the cotangent to relate this quasi-projective variety to its quasi-Albanese. So this is the semi-abelian analog of the Albanese variety. Then use Voigt's theorem for semi-abelian varieties to actually obtain finiteness. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to stop there. Thank you. Thank you for a great talk. So, is there any question? I have a question. You asked about reverse implications. What kinds of positivity of the cotangent bundle can you get from these hyperbolicity assumptions? Is Kampana's viewpoint? Is Kampana's viewpoint of special manifolds? Is that the right way to think about sort of the verse implications? So I guess I'm not sure I know enough about Company's viewpoint to really comment, but maybe Amos is here or someone else in the audience who does want to chime in. Well, I don't know if I want to answer, but I guess that's close enough. I guess Frédéric Campanard's conjecture are usually the more useful at the moment to characterize the opposite condition. So, when the points are potentially dense, and there is something in the middle between like I think it's a difficult question. We have some thought about what the description exceptional set should be, and that's closely related to this, but it's still very much conjecture. I don't think we have any real way to grasp what hypermoralicity, in that sense of what Kenny talked about, can be characterized in an if and only. In an if and only if way, just using geometry, at least that's what I know. Yeah, okay. Is there any question? Yeah, I had a question. You talked about those two notions of big. Does one of them imply the other? Are they just like totally different? Oh, yeah, one of them implies the other. So, okay, so let me think what the example is. So, I think if you take I want to say if you take O of one on P1 and you take the direct sum with O of P1, then that will be will not be big in the way that I define it, but will be big in the way of O of the projectivization, O1 of the projectivization as big. Got it. Let me think, is that the right example? So I think that's the right example because the point is that you'll never. Right example because the point is that you'll never be able to. Um, since you have the O component, whenever you tensor with the inverse of an ample, you'll never be able to get that the global generation, but you will be able to get by, I mean, I think you could just compute sections of the projectivization of that vector bundle, and you can show that O of one is big. Got it. Got it. I think I see. Thank you. Okay. So we have some. So, we have some lecture notes on this, and I know the example was written down in the lecture notes. So, worst case, you could check the lecture notes to make sure I gave you the right example. It's on your website? Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. Is there any question? I guess, yeah, I had a question. So, if you just assume that the cotangent bundle is big, like what is the best possible hyperbolicity kind of thing that you get? That you get? Oh, that's a good question. I don't know offhand. So I think, yeah, I'm not sure offhand, but at least our proof certainly needs this. At least for the proof of the subvarieties being of log general type. Subvarieties being of log general type, I think we certainly use the non-AMPL locus container support of D in a crucial way, but I'm not sure if there's maybe another proof that can get around it somehow. Okay, thanks. Yeah, yeah. Right. Is there any question? Okay, then let's thank the Kenny again. And then if you like the chat. And then if you like chat, you can go to Garatan. And then, yeah. So we will start at Satya again. I think 10 minutes later. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much.
