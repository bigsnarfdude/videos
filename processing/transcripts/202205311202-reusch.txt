Every day, who need many of the tools that you guys have talked about? And so, in order to make my point, I have stolen a few of the slides from this morning to make my points. So, don't be nervous. I'm not going to take your data anywhere. I just thought it was a good way to integrate what Dave gave me as a topic, which was policy. You know, it was a very specific topic, and I think I'll cover it all today. So, just to start. So, just to start with, we've heard a lot this morning about diabetes and all of the challenges that are implicit in trying to take care of somebody with diabetes, trying to predict how they'll do in the hospital, trying to predict how they'll do at home, trying to predict anything, whether they'll develop diabetes. And so diabetes is rife with a number of engines, et cetera. Number of engines, etc., that are trying to predict things, and one of the most compelling engines that is failing miserably is the prediction of who is going to develop diabetes. So, in 2000, it was predicted that by 2030, there would be 450 million people living with diabetes. And actually, in 2021, there were 453 million people with diabetes. So, this is a huge problem. And we're very appreciative of all the work everybody in this room. Work everybody in this room and on this call are doing to help us understand and unravel this. So, when we think about the individual, as you've heard earlier today, the individual with diabetes wakes up and usually their sugar has gone down. And before they even eat breakfast, their sugar begins to go up a little bit. Then, in response to breakfast, particularly American breakfast, which is very high in carbohydrates, the sugar goes up, then it comes back down, it goes up, it comes down, it goes up. It goes up, it comes down, it goes up, it comes down. And if we have just four data points, one before each meal, we could think that one thing was happening. And if we have continuous glucose monitoring, we could think that something quite else was happening. And so for the person with diabetes, regardless of exactly what data that they have, they are trying to make a decision about their behavior in order to first keep themselves safe and second, themselves safe and second decrease complications related to their diabetes so it is the individual that needs to take care of the diabetes so we've got all these fancy search engines but even an individual who happens to have outstanding access to care perhaps four hours of care a year that is just an infinitesimal amount of their entire life and so what we're really having to rely on is the reality that On is the reality that the individual is in charge, so we need diabetes literacy, diabetes numeracy, engagement, and access to data. So earlier, I heard the question of trying to get to chaos, and trying to get to chaos in my book is just life with diabetes. It is absolute chaos because an individual will tell you they are eating one same meal every day, doing the same amount of exercise and getting a different result. Exercise and getting a different result. So, I am all in on these fancy numbers because I would love to be able to help my patients minimize the variability in their glucose and the risk of hypoglycemia. But even if I really knew how to predict that, and even if I was going with a trusted model that told me about insulin and interstitial insulin and glucose, I'm not sure at all. I'm not sure at all what this would be, you know, whether or not the patient or the doctor would know what to do with it. And as a matter of fact, even when we try to give CGM data to primary care docs, they say it totally stops their clinic cold. They can't possibly review this data. We just need to tell them what to do with it. So, what does all of this have to do with policy? Well, we have one of the most common diseases in the world, and we have Diseases in the world. And we have, this is me when I was president of the American Diabetes Association a few years ago. And every year, we and many other groups go to Congress to talk about the need for healthcare access, insulin affordability, research funding, just to name a few, because I wanted to pull out just a few for this discussion today. So the first is, and what Artie Is and what Artie was talking about earlier is the idea that if we could predict diabetes onset, that would be great. Let's do it at pre-diabetes. And the thing is, is that the cost of diabetes has increased so outrageously from 2012 to 2017, it increased from $245 billion to $327 billion, direct and indirect costs, one in four healthcare dollars. So it is actually quite So, it is actually quite fiscally irresponsible not to prevent diabetes. And yet, the interval of time between the time we knew that we could prevent progression to diabetes and the institution of the diabetes prevention program took 12 years from the sort of seminal publication to getting this even covered by insurance, let alone it's now only affecting three. Now, only affecting 3% of the entire population who would benefit from diabetes prevention interventions. So, there's also the idea that diabetes is complicated. So, if somebody happens to have insurance, they could either be a baby, they could be a grown-up, they could be willing to exercise and manage their diet, they could have food insecurity and housing insecurity, they could be needlephobic or they could have an allergic reaction. Be have an allergic reaction to or some other clinical reaction to some of the medications. So there are so many factors that when you're trying to do the modeling that you were just talking about, you're not really sure where to start. So the policy issue that comes up here is access to resources, access for patients and providers for the tools for data acquisition, and then communication from the provider. Communication from the provider to the patient and the patient back to the provider about the information they have and what to do with it. And then there is insulin affordability. Diabetes is costing one in four health care dollars. And since diabetes is costing one in four health care dollars, we're looking at the life-saving medication that is insulin. And so insulin has gone up from $5 a bottle to $300. From five dollars a bottle to $300 a bottle, and this is allowing some people just to die because they don't have access to insulin. But even if I had that bottle of insulin, I would need needles, I would need strips, I would need a CGM, I would need a lot more to actually manage my diabetes. And so, another policy issue is access to medications. And access to one management tool, for example, insulin, does not really support all. Does not really support all aspects of diabetes management. The final thing that I'm going to mention in terms of policy is that investment leads to transformative science. So when we look at diabetes, and here we're going to move from diabetes at 30 million when I was president just six years ago, to 37 million people living with diabetes. And we look at the burden of diabetes nationally. Of diabetes nationally, and then we look at the NIH funding for diabetes, and then the NIH funding per individual living with diabetes. So diabetes research is alarmingly underfunding. And where does modeling fit in? Well, the policy issue is that science can change the landscape of disease. So, research to support the day-to-day lives of people living with diabetes and transformation of our understanding of pathophysiology can. Understanding of pathophysiology can change the overall landscape of diabetes management. Now, I wanted to switch, and now for something completely different in the last couple minutes to a little bit of what brought me here with this really august group today. And I'm very humbled because I don't know half of what you're saying. And that is how I came to be here today. Well, when it comes to diabetes, and I've got something in my way, just so. In my way, just so uh, uh, uh, we have a working we have a working model for our understanding of what it is about type 2 diabetes that leads to an impairment in functional exercise capacity. So, people with type 2 diabetes, otherwise uncomplicated, have minor cardiac dysfunction and minor muscle dysfunction. And you guys have talked about all the different components of the glucose model within people with diabetes, and this is the cardiovascular. With diabetes, and this is the cardiorespiratory model within people with diabetes. But we've added one more twist in our research, and that is: I don't know why my slides aren't going forward, so I'm just going to try and figure out why my slides aren't going forward. I'm going to have to escape and start again. I don't know why they would. And that is perfusion. So to talk about this a little bit, let me tell you why I care. Let me talk, tell you why I care. This is Judy Regensteiner, my main partner in my research agenda. And she and I identified in the late 1990s that people with diabetes had decreased cardiorespiratory fitness. And even after exercise training, they still maintained a decreased cardiorespiratory fitness. And the reason we care about that is because this is the number one predictor of cardiac and all-cause mortality. All cause more mortality. What is going on with my screen here? And so if I measure your cardiorespiratory fitness here and I follow you out a few years, if you have high cardiorespiratory fitness here, you're more likely to be alive than if you have low cardiorespiratory fitness. And so we've been trying to figure out what that is. And that's a combination of breathing in oxygen, getting the heart to pump it around, and looking at the skeletal muscle. And looking at the skeletal muscle. And we tried to come up with one more model. And our model goes to look at cardiac dysfunction with exercise. So these are people with a right heart catheter placed. And these are people who we've had a right heart cath placed in the cath lab. We've placed them on an exercise bike up in the clinical research center and we measure their cardiopulmonary wedge pressure. So I know that Tal knows what that means, but I'm Tell knows what that means, but I'm not sure how many of the rest of you know. But this is an invasive procedure. And with just 100 watts of exercise, we're seeing a very increased pressure in the hearts of people with diabetes. Now, when I increase the workload on a muscle, I should increase the blood flow to the muscle. But these people with otherwise uncomplicated diabetes and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease had no increase in perfusion with that increased workload, which With that increased workload, which is aligned with the defect being in the blood flow, not necessarily in the cardiac muscle itself. And this was associated with some systemic vascular resistance. So then we went, okay, you need the heart and you need the muscle. We went to the muscle and we looked at perfusion to the muscle, blood flow in the large vessels, as well as mitochondrial function way down at the Way down at the muscle biopsy itself. And in Players You've Met Earlier Today, with Melanie Cree Green and Kristen Nadeau, along with adult clinicians, Amy Hipsman and Irene Schauer, we used MR spectroscopy to measure mitochondrial function in vivo. What did we do? We depleted the high-energy phosphates, you can see phosphocreatin here, and then we allowed that muscle to relax and we Muscle to relax, and we looked at oxidative flux across the muscle. And what we saw was that people with diabetes had decreased phosphocreatin production, as well as it taking them longer time to turn over their ATP and lower oxidative phosphorylation. And this didn't seem to align with how well these people were in their mitochondrial function. So we created. So we created another model wherein our prediction was that oxygen could possibly be limiting. This was not part of any model beyond heart failure or COPD, never considered in people with diabetes. And so we added oxygen and we increased their oxygen tension in their skeletal muscle. And what we saw was only in the people. Was only in the people with diabetes did we improve their in vivo oxidative flux? This gave us a whole different model, all right? And then we looked at that a little bit further using near-infrared spectroscopy, which tells us oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. So you start to exercise, your hemoglobin goes up in the muscle, your oxygenation goes down in the muscle, your deoxyhemoglobin accumulates in the muscle, and this should be a And this should be a perfect relationship, and yet, in uncomplicated diabetes, this relationship was not perfect. So, this created for us another model, okay? A model wherein the cardiac dysfunction and skeletal muscle dysfunction are in part explained by perfusion heterogeneity. And we coined a new, we made a new model where we said that there was vascular inflexibility that was contributing to the metabolic inflexibility. Contributing to the metabolic inflexibility in diabetes. So here we are, just like you, taking different pieces of the puzzle to try to create a model. But I'm just telling, I only included these data because I wanted to tell you that in your delay paradigm, there may be one more factor, which is this vascular inflexibility. And so I'll close here. And oh, wait, I wanted to just share my. Oh, wait, I wanted to just share my partners in crime. Sorry, sorry, sorry. My partners in crime. I didn't need to close that, and my silly slide thing isn't going forward. But there should be a fabulous, ah, there it is, a fabulous slide showing you all the people it took to do this work, as well as my new collaborative team, which includes a few of you in the room. Thank you so much. Excellent, Jane. That was awesome. I have no idea if that's what you wanted, but that's what policy meant to me. That was perfect. Do you see any impact on people's ability on the thought for fusion? Do you see any impact? Uh, for so, blood flow. Do you see any impact on people's? Do you see any impact in people's lungs, like the damage in their lungs or their ability to get blood into the or oxygen? So it doesn't appear that there is a perfusion mismatch, but heterogeneity may not show up that early because, as any pulmonologist will tell you, there's a lot of flow reserve in the heart. Lot of flow reserve in the heart and in the skeletal muscle, but the lung is amazing in that you're only using a very little bit of the lung and the surface area in the lung for day-to-day life, even when you're exercising relatively intensively. So if there is some perfusion heterogeneity in the lung as well, then that could be contributing, but I don't know about that. But I don't know about that. I have a question. So, some people have suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction is related to insulin resistance. I'm wondering if the perfusion defect is either a cause of insulin resistance or a consequence of insulin resistance before it even leads to diabetes. Even leads to diabetes? Yes, so absolutely. So one of our current R01s is studying just that question. So it turns out that even in people with metabolic syndrome, the ability for insulin, so insulin, for those of you who may or may not have heard about this, has the ability, in addition to lowering blood glucose, it stimulates nitric oxide synthase. So if you think of sublingual nitroglycerin, which opens up all your blood vessels. opens up all your blood vessels. So insulin will stimulate nitric oxide production and it opens up the blood vessels to the heart, the brain, the skeletal muscle. So insulin resistance both in the microvasculature and resistance in the capacity to get insulin to the target organ of the skeletal muscle or the heart or wherever it needs to go. Those, so I would just say yes, and I think very much so in your model, Artie. Very much so in your model, Artie, that this blood flow parameter and why I became so interested in this work very early in working with Judy was because that moment when you're exercising, when you need your heart rate and your lung capacity to increase so you can exercise more, that first two minutes when you're taking a run and you're exquisitely uncomfortable, that is slowed by about 50%. That is slowed by about 50% in people who have diabetes. So, in people living with diabetes, there's that aversive, you know, increased perceived resistance to perceived exertion. And so I definitely think that this is one of the very earliest steps. And that's what we're trying to parse out because there's a very tight relationship between VOT. Very tight relationship between VO2 peak and insulin sensitivity. All right, we're going to break. We'll come back in about an hour. Jane, that was awesome. Thank you so much. Turns licenses again? Yeah, probably on list it. All right. We'll be back here about 1:25. We'll be back here about 1:20.
