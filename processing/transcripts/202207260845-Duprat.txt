So, I want to talk to you today about liquid morphologies on arrays of soft fibers. You have a picture here where you see very beautiful patterns or things what happens when you have liquids on fibrous material. You see drops, you see fibers sticking together, and that's the kind of thing that I want to talk to you about today. And marginally, there's a very interesting pattern that happens when you wet fibrous materials. And the first one you can see is just wetting a woven or knitted. See, it's just wearing a woven or knitted textile, and generally, you will see this kind of pattern that just tells you that the liquid imbibes faster in the wool than in the weft or in the loop. I'm not so sure with knitting in English. And that's just because as you, even though it's the same yarn, the same material, the weaving of the woven process has puts more tension into one direction than the other. And that changes in the yarn's distance between the fibers and it changes away or the speed at which it imbibes. Also, the speed at which it imbibes with exactly and uh yeah, makes your bars for me. Um, so you have interesting things that happen when you have one single job on a complicated text size, or you can have things interesting when you have several jobs on fibers. I will talk more about that in my talk. And those liquids, they can exert forces between the fibers and they can actually deform them, which is what happens when you have a wet brush. And I think if you've done any sewing that will stay with the textile steam, you've experienced that because you've. Steam, you experience that because you tend to moisten the end of your thread in order to keep all the bristles together and have something which is stiffer so you can thread the needle. And so you're doing it elasticly when you're doing that. And this kind of forces actually happens a lot when you dry something because you have a lot of liquid air interfaces that happen during evaporation. And typically, you have a shrinkage of people's material when you dry them. And one also, again, common example where you see that if you dry your clothes on the line, there will be much. Close in on the line, they will be much more stiffer than if you dry them with a tumble dryer, where you've actually broken all of this in capillary ratio. This is the process which is behind paper making, because capillary forces bring the fibers in close contact and allows them to form all the bonds that give the strength to a piece of paper. But the paper is a little more complicated material. And if you try to just wet a piece of paper, it will generally deform it. And that's because the paper's sealed. Because the fibers, the cellulosic fibers, they swell with one, and so drager told us a little bit about swelling. In the case of paper, it's a little complex because the fibers themselves swell, it also changes the bonds between the fibers, it releases some of the stresses that were included during manufacturing. You can have very large deformation of your material. And so, that's the kind of idea that I want to talk to you about. But I want to start with something very simple, just looking at what is the difference when you wet a fiber compared to a flat surface. And it's already interesting. Face. And it's already interesting because even in perfectly wetting situations, you will not spread very much on the fiber due to the curvature of the fiber. So if you take a drop of silicon oil, let's say on glass, it will spread completely. But on the fiber, because you have this curvature, it will stay as a minimal drop. And that will have consequences because this local shape will have consequences. If you have two fibers, you can actually spread the liquid between the fibers. So if the fibers are far. So, if the fibers are far apart, you will still form a drop. But if you're able to bring them close enough together, then your drop will spread in between the fibers. And so, as a result, if you now, let's say, spray water on a random, a non-woven material made of glass fibers, you will start seeing different kinds of morphology. You will have droplets coalescing, some of them is disappearing, it's actually just being invited between two fibers. And in the end, you have very interesting patterns where you have to be able to do it. Have very interesting patterns where you have single drops, you have fibers which are stuck together by liquids, and you have sometimes complex shapes. And so my goal today is a little ambitious, so I think I have to go to skip some of this thing that I've prepared, but I want to talk to you a little bit about how the ploughs grow on the single fibers, what happens when you have several fibers, when they're able to deform, and what happens when you add swelling to all of this. When you add swelling to all of this, so yeah, it's a little ambitious. We'll see. So, the way we're going to look at the distribution of liquid of drops growing on the fiber is really using these kind of spray experiments. And that's a system which is extremely well known because it's used a lot to filtrate aerosols. So if you want to filtrate an aerosol, we've all used face masks over the past few years, so we know it. You use a fibrous material. It's a good way to have something which remains perfectly porous, but has lots of obstacles to. Perfectly porous, but has lots of obstacles to catch the droplets which are going through. And so it's both permeable and efficient as a filter. And that's been used in industry, but also to measure, to passively collect fog for meteorological measurements or even for freshwater harvesting. And the principle is simple: that you have, let's say, an array of fibers, you have thought that goes through the fibers, and some of the droplet that it contains will impact. Contains will impact the wires, will be collected on the wires, will grow, coalesce, and form this large drop that will then fall down. This is still a little too complicated for me. So the system that we looked at is just simply vertical fibers. And in those vertical fibers, you will just have growth and the liquid will be able to drain efficiently and never clog the system like we've seen before. And so we've looked at system of vertical fibers of different sizes with various Different sizes with various different parameters, the geometrical parameter of the nets. But I won't go into too much details about the nets themselves. We'll just look at one fiber, I think, for today. And the way we have to produce fog is we use an environmental wind tunnel that was built in the lab by Romain Lab√©, where we have basically a wind tunnel in which we have a bass with ultrasonic piezoelectric activators, which by vibration will produce tiny droplets. Produce tiny droplets, which are remarkably distributed with a very narrow distribution of radius. So they're between three and five microns, and on average, we take them at 3.9 microns. So we've measured that with a diffraction, laser diffraction methods and also optical methods. So we produce very well-controlled size of droplets, and then we can flow them at a given speed. We can laminarize the flow, and we can have a very well-controlled pub flow. Pub flow with a constant water production and very well controlled drop sites. And so we're going to place our fibers within that fog and you're going to start seeing droplets which are growing on the wires. And so they're growing. They're growing by coalescing smaller droplets that arrive on them. They form larger drops and then eventually they're too big to be held and gravity makes them fall down and then the process repeats itself. And then the process repeats itself. So the chamber is not a flow. So there is a flow. So basically, it's a wind tunnel. So we create a fog and we push it with the given velocity. So the fibers are at the exit of a wind tunnel. So it's really a laminar flow of fog coming through. And here I show you an example where the fibers are very far apart and there's no aerodynamics issues. And it's just like a. I want to tell you a little bit about the mechanism so that's. Tell you a little bit about the mechanism so that we can know more about the liquid distribution itself. The main mechanism for collection in the case that I'm studying is inertial impacts. That means that droplets will normally tend to follow the streamlines and go around the obstacle, which is what most droplets do. This is a top view of one single fibre of 300 microns diameter, and we're looking at the top going around. So it's a little unclear on the screen, but you have profits coming. But you have droplets coming going around, and some of them are being captured. It's very blurry on the screen. Maybe you see it better also. And so part of the droplets will just go around the fibers, and some of them will have just too much inertia to actually leave that, and they will keep that trajectory and will go and hit the fiber. And so you can estimate how much droppets will just follow that trajectory by looking at the TOX number, which tells you. At the Stocks number, which tells you basically the difference between the time to be slowed down by viscous effects, so to follow the streamline, and the time it takes you to go around the obstacle. And so, if stop number is large, then you don't have, you can't follow the streamlines and it will just impact the fiber. So, this is a problem which was solved in 1945 by Langmuir and Blodgett. And so, you can, if you assume a potential flow around the fiber like I've drawn, you can directly get the efficiency of. You can directly get the efficiency of collection as a function of the Stokes number. And for us, it today is interesting because this will depend on the surface of collection, which will depend on the liquid distribution. And it depends on the size of the obstacle. So the size, again, the liquid distribution. So by plotting the efficiency as a function of stokes number, we'll get some information about the way the liquid is distributed. Yes. Yeah, so there's no electrostatic charges here. No, there's no. And since we're using liquid. No, there's no, and since we're using liquid aerosols, actually, electrostatic charges tend to, even if they were, they tend to decay very quickly, it's all going to be white very soon. But yeah, you can add electrostatic charges or other forces here. It's really just inertial impacts. That's what dominates. And so the first thing that we can look at is how the liquid grows on the fibrous. And so we've seen this movie before, we see that we have these droplets appearing, and we can actually model it very simple. Can actually model it very simple. We can do a very simple numerical model where we have small droplets arriving randomly or uniformly along the fiber. When two drops touch, they coalesce and so on and so forth. And when they're too big, they fall, which is what you see here. So you start with a lot of small droplets, then they grow. And when one is too big, it will fall down. And I don't know if you've noticed, but we'll see it with numbers afterward. Numbers afterwards grow and eventually close down and it starts again. And I don't know if you've seen how uniform the pattern look, but you can plot. So here I plot the number of droplets as a function of time and here's the size of the droplets. If you look at the number of droplets, you start with a lot, then very quickly you drop down because you start coalescing. And for a long time, actually, you have the same number of droplets on the fiber. That's on the fiber, and they just slightly grow. So you start with a lot of them, but then you have a constant number that's just like slowly grow because every job impacting will merge with the previous one. And if you look at a distribution of numbers, you really have like one given number, yes. I'm wondering, with these dynamics that you're showing here, whether you think Oswald rightening is relevant? Yeah, it's not really. So, here, basically, all the jobs. So, here basically, all the jobs since they're basically the same size, I think there's no favorite, there's no communications between the jobs, it's just that one hits, it will go to the next one. So it's more reminiscent of breath patterns with condensation than other openings, but I'm not so sure. Because I think in other openings, it's because you have like difference of pressures and you have, and I'm not sure if it's here. I would say that as soon as it touches, it'll coalesce, whatever, because the drops on the fibers are always bigger. Because the drops on the papers are always bigger than the one that comes. I don't know. Well, I'm just looking at the small ones in between the large ones and they rapidly just move towards the line. Yeah, so yeah, the small one they will move by the end of the yeah, it's true, by the means of the other one coming and connecting them. So the stress is basically you have a curvature and a film that's sort of connecting the two that you're not resolving here or something. There's always droplets coming everywhere. So is it just small, too small to see, but at all times there's a droplet impacting. Job is impacting everywhere. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I guess so the neighbors communicate with each other through maybe a wedding layer on the fiber? Well, here we're not perfectly wedding, and I think it's really the night, but there is always wet. But since there's a constant influx of droplets, that's why I say. That's why I say I think that there's immediate coalescence whenever one comes. I'm not so sure that they're not so sure it's so long, long range, or it doesn't need to be so long range because it's always be this 1991 work was based on just point particles of how they did it. So these 1991 works with somehow everyone the same year, I don't know why. They worked on more, it was more like a condensation of breath. More, it was more like a condensation of breath patterns, and they also come up. They also see the same effect that eventually you tend to saturate, so you have jobs growing, and with the same process of drops and coalescence, of growth and coalescence, you will end up with the same number of droplets on your uniform pattern of droplets. So that's why, yeah, it's very reminiscent of this mechanism. The one difference, though, which I think in our case is interesting, that in our case, since we have gravity, we can only go. We have gravity, we can only grow up to a certain size, and then when we're too big, we go down and then we clean everything and it starts again. And so, if you look at the size of the droplets, it always seems like even on average, you always have the same size of droplets in your flow, which is something completely different from this case. And it's just because you have this kind of cleaning. And if you look, well, it was just another view, but we'll see one phone. So, here you see a little bit better maybe the coalescence. So, you have some growth. The coalescence. So you have some growing in between. And but you have always incoming joblets, it's a little fuzzy because there's always new jobs coming. And these joblets just go from one to the other, but then gravity also moves you down. And so it seems like you can say that since you have this maximum size, which you can, it's given by a balance between gravity that one makes you fall and superstention that holds you there. Holds you there. It's like you will have a uniform number of uniform patterns with a constant number of droplets which all have the same size on average. And the size was mostly dependent on the radius of the fiber, even though it's still, it depends actually weakly on the number of fibers. So it's basically the capillary length, like set this size. And so we can naively assume that we always have the same number of droplets with. Always have the same number of droplets with the same size all the time in our system, even though it's an evolving pattern. And that's actually pretty good because if we look at the efficiency as a function of Stop's number, if we mainly just take the surface of the fiber and the size of the fibers, well, we're completely off with the experimental data. But if we replay the collection surface and the size of the obstacle by just a uniform distribution of droplets, then the results are pretty good. So on average, you're really collecting on n. Collecting on n droplets of a given radius. I don't know if that's convincing for you, but for me, it's quite convincing. The other thing that you can see is that you actually had a lower efficiency than what you will have with bare fibers, because having droplets is not a very efficient way because you minimize kind of the wet surface, so the collection surface, and you maximize the size of the obstacle. And so you lose a lot of your efficiency. And so one thing that we want to is can we suppress the We want to is how can we suppress the growth of droplets? And there is a somehow easy way that I've shown you in the introduction: is to replace each fiber by a pair of fibers. And then in that case, when the liquid will grow, you see that you have very quickly, or actually you could see that there's a little bit of job, but very quickly, everything collapses. And here, even though there's still coming, you don't. You don't see anything growing anymore because now you have a liquid column and every job just coalesces with this liquid column. I think here's a view that's a film I will show you later again and then you have you really see that you have this liquid film that is now draining all the water that is impacting it. Each fiber is two fibers? Yeah, each fiber is actually two fibers close to one another. So this is a zoom. Close to one another. So, this is a zoom. You will see that there's actually a little bit of spacing between them. Um, but here it's hard to see, and they're very close together. And actually, the fact that you don't have job growth on two fibers is something that was recently studied, where people studied the relevato instability on a pair of fibers and see that it didn't grow for exactly the same reason. And if you take two fibers and coat them with liquid, then liquid will spread between the fibers and will not. Liquid will spread between the fibers and will not form droplets. And so they claim that it has some maybe relevance into seed protein which are covered with wax. Yeah. Could you make the same effect by creating a more complex fiber surface structure? Yeah, so you could make your fiber with a groove or something to have that. I think the nice idea about this is that it's very low cost. You just take any wire. Low cost. You just take any wire and you place them two to you, you thread them by two, and you can use any type. It's completely independent also of the wetting properties of the fibers. It's just a geometry. So it's very low cost effective. But you could do the same if you were to create a, let's say, a fiber with a groove. Yeah, so the thing is, you also want drainage. So if you start to have too many, like if you also have a yam, I'm afraid that it will maybe not drain as efficiently. I'm not so sure. I'm not so sure actually. And so I'm going to try to be quick with that. So this transition between drops and columns is something that we've studied in detail with my colleague Susie for the past 10 years. And I'm actually not going to go too much into detail, but just to let you know that if you want to have inhibition between If you want to have inhibition between two fibers, you need to bring them to a certain distance. And that's because the shape that the liquid takes between two fibers is a minimization of the surface will depend on the distance. And this was studied by Princeton a long time ago. Here you have a cross-sectional shape of this column. And as you change the distance between the fibers, you will change both the angle at which the liquid spreads around the fiber and the curvature of the column. And you will go from And you will go from convex, or yeah, depends what you look at, but convex shape in between two fibers to something which is more round and concave and completely around the two fibers. And that means that if you want to have inhibition, since you need to have a difference of pressure, if you start with a bass, you will only imbib if you're in the case where you have this negative curvature. Have this negative curvature, so you will only abide below a certain distance, which you can calculate is exactly 0.57 or pi over 2 minus 1 times the radius of the fiber. So purely geometry, it's a beautiful paper. And for example, this is an experiment done by Pierre-Louis Martin in 2015, where he edicts two fibers at an angle from a bus, and you see that the liquid imbibes up until it reaches exactly this distance. Because here now you start having a Here now, you start having a difference of pressure in the wrong direction. There is another critical distance which is square root of two times the radius, above which you will never be able to form this column shape, and you will actually always form droplets. So, what you will expect, well, I can skip the movies, which are really well, but is that actually if you start from a job, you will start invading between the fibers before you reach this. Before you reach this 0.57, but below this square root of 2. And this is a region. So, here is the distance at which we go from the job to a column. This is this line here. And you see that this is always much higher than this 0.57, but also smaller than this square root of 2, and that you have hysteresis with a region where you have both states, which are metal stable. And the reason for that is that. And the reason between that for that is that here now we're not imbibing from a liquid bus but from a droplet which has a given LaPass pressure. So the only thing you need is the difference of LaPass pressure between the drop and the edges. And so you will for a given drop volume, this will give you the distance at which you can start imbibing. And so yes, it will depend on the radius of curvature of your drop, which is hemisphere. Which is hemisphere, and the radius of curvature of the column, which evolved in this interesting way, but can be negative, or so the difference can be negative even higher than the zero point. Okay, so I'm not going to go too much into that, but we can just go back to our fog experiments. So now we have no more growth of fibers and we only find droplets and we only have liquid in between the fibers. And we have, so we have a colour. And we have so we have a column, we know its size. We know that the size of the obstacle is just the size of the fibers. The surface of collection is just the surface of the liquid column in between them. And so if we plug it into our experiments, that give us the right collection. And we indeed verify that the droplets on columns are on the columns are always better, more efficient at collecting the liquid little droplets. Liquid and the droplets. So I'm gonna skip the aerodynamics. I'm sorry about that, but I can come back to it later if he wants, just for the interest of time. So we built, we have a fog collector which we installed in 2019. And so we just published the results of two campaigns of 2018 and 19 and 2021. I have to say, this is a perfect pandemic experiment because it's instrumental. They make experiments because it's instrumental and you can control it from your home. You can see the results that you're doing in experiments without being deaf. And since I live close to it, I could see when there was fog and I could just connect and see the cool. And so we measure the fog in the mag that is draining into the fog gauge that we have. And so we can measure how much we collect. And we saw something that the efficiency we got was a little off. And actually, so this fog collector is one meter high by two meters. And so it's quite hard to keep the Pfizer. And so it's quite hard to keep the fibers under tension. And as you can see here, actually, you have pairs of fibers, but the pairs of fibers actually stick together. And so we don't really have pairs of fibers, but now we have pairs of pairs of fibers. And so the liquid surface is a little different than just the sum of two fibers. And so that cannot modify a little bit the efficiency, but we're able to rationalize it by saying that we have now four fibers and not two. And that is a good transition. And that is a good transition to what's happening when we have not rigid but flexible fibers. So it still not paired the fibers, but it's about the same IT. So we have the droplets are growing on the fibers, and very quickly they're going to start bridging the fibers quite quickly. This movie is already accelerated about 200 times per. And so as you see, wind helps you a little bit. There's a bit of tension, but it's meant for it. So you form a little bridge, well nothing much happened, but eventually you will form another one, and those will be enough to collapse the fibers and create these liquid columns. I think this one is soon gonna be the end. Is soon going to be the end. And so, if you look at a larger scale, then you will see that very quickly you will form these columns. You can also have pairs of pairs that we've seen before. And you see it's a little shiny, so you really have liquid columns in between. This is also a cheaper way, actually, to form pairs of fibers, just using flexible ones. And so, to understand a bit more what's happening, we can look at what are the capillary force which. At what are the capillary forces which are generated when there's a drop on fibers? So, this is an experiment we've done with SUSY where we did the, we attached the top fiber to a force sensor and we're actually measuring the force and we're changing the distance between the fibers. And those fibers are elastomeric fibers, so they're soft. They're under pre-stress, and that's how we control their deformation. As we bring the fibers together, you see you have the collapse of the liquid and different things, which one of the things that you can. Different things, but one of the things that you can do is measure the force. And you can actually measure it for rigid fibers to start with. And if you measure the force as a function of the distance between the fibers, you have something which at the beginning is pretty flat. And then you have a rapid increases, which corresponds to this moment where you spread as a large column. And in the case of the column, you can exactly, you know, the shape that I've told you Princeton wrote. So you know exactly what the force is. It's a combination of wetting at the line and. At the line, and mostly pressure within the column. So, the spreads of curvature of the column here. So, you have this rapid increase. The drop shape is still not, we don't have an analytical solution for the shape of the drop on two fibers. But you see, it doesn't really change as a change in distance, it remains close to a sphere. And if you plot the force as a function of the lengths of liquid, you will see that the force is always roughly equal to proportional to the length of liquids. Proportional to the length of liquid times the surface tension. Interestingly, for drops, the force decreases when you increase the volume because you change the shape, but this is not still very clear why or very clear to me. So you apply a force which is roughly gamma times an x with a few factors that depend on the volume. So you have your fibers. We'll assume that there's no bending in our case, that most of the deformation. That most of the deformation comes from stretching the fibers, which is not entirely true. But so our fibers are under pre-strain, there's a certain tension between them. We're pulling at the center with a force gamma times the length. And as we do so, so this is what you see here. The pipes will start to deform, the jerk will start to spread a little bit. And then at one point, the spreading will accelerate. The spreading will accelerate and the fiber will dip onto one another. And this dipping actually occurs when the distance between the fibers equals this 0.6. I told you where you want to really quickly spread. And so you can, with a very simple argument, you can say, okay, now I will dip my fiber as soon as I'm applying sufficient force to bring them to that critical distance. And I will depend on the initial length of the droplets. And so you can have an argument that... And so you can have an argument that brings you a capillary stretching number, which compares the tension within the fiber, so E times epsilon, the prestraint, and the force that is applied and the capillary force. So gamma R and E epsilon R square. And this is going to be important when we have swelling because one of the main effects of swelling is to reduce the tension within the fiber. And so here what this shows you is that you can have a control on the liquid morphology by controlling the tension within the fiber. So if I Tension within the fiber. So if I take a droplet on two fibers and I reduce the tension, then the drop will spread as a liquid column. And if now I pull again on the fibers, it will go back as a drop. So you have a control of the shape with the tension. Okay, before going into the swelling, I just wanted to show you what happens at the bottom of the fibers. And it's moving, I really want to show you completely. And this movie, I really want to show you completely, but I'm going to just accelerate a little bit. But this is a traveling done with a fast camera, so you have to pretty smooth. And this is actually a movie that was done with Anari Wakovich, which is an artist from Montreal, which was visiting the lab. And this video that we've done together is actually also part of the first article that we did together, which is called Through the Looking Mists, because we're now plating, we're projecting this movie onto a very large building and we And we're placing people at the scale of a single job. So we're changing both the length scale and the time scale. And so, yeah, so the looking needs a reference to Alice in Wonderland, which can adapt her size. And so what we see here at the bottom of the fiber is somehow entering. Well, the liquid is falling down. You can maybe see from the image that it's kind of a tin film between the fibers and it gets like a larger drop at the tip. Larger drop at the tip, then it will eventually there's a lot of tension. But yeah, this channel is very, there's a lot of suspense, but also lots of when you see that when the joclet actually pearl battles, the fibers separated, so they were really pulled down by the scattering forces. And Roman in the lab did an experiment which we found was fairly simple and was actually rich. Fairly simple and was actually rich. And we haven't done much about this, but if you, you know, if you have ideas, we can, I should maybe do something with these experiments. Because the experiment we were doing was just injecting in between two fibers at a constant flow rate. And the fibers are held under tension. If they're perfectly rigid, the liquid will just fall down. You form this film and this job. And as soon as gravity is too strong, the job is too big, then it will fall down. And you will have this, you're injecting a constant rate. So it there's no. At constant rate, so it does not, it's just a regular periodic pattern. Now you can add a little bit of elasticity in a system, and you will see the same thing, except that the fibers kind of come together due to the capillary force, it breaks down, it opens, but it's also very regular. You can add a lot of elasticity, which is this last movie. So here the fibers are actually touching and zipped over a long distance, and the oscillation just occurs here at the bottom, but it's also very periodic. But it's also very periodic. You see a little bit of Crady Plateau, but it's not dramatic. And then we have the intermediate case where the droplet falls down. Here there are zips. Here, the one after there are not really. And you sometimes see, like here, it stops. I'm still injecting at constant speed. If you look at like a chronophotography, or if you look at the position of the tip with time, we see that sometimes. Of the tip with time, we see that sometimes it just like stays there for a very long time, even though we're still, I don't say, injecting at constant speed, which for us was a little intriguing. And one way to understand that is that we have so we have two possible states. Either the fibers are slightly deformed or they are stuck together at a certain distance and then they're deformed. And there's actually a region where these two states exist and the system keeps on switching from one to The system keeps on switching from one to the other, and it's very dynamic because we're probing different initial conditions at each oscillation. But somehow it's interesting that it gets there, then it changes shape, and it falls down. And I'm not sure I fully understand what's happening here, but there is a region where we see this kind of interesting oscillating patterns between two states. And it's not the first time that people see different states in this elastocapillary system. I myself saw some when I looked at the capillary. So, some when I looked at the capillary rights between two plates, where there was a region where both the states where the end of the plate touches or the end of the plates are open, those two can exist for the same values of the parameters. And it was also observed by Michaeleta, Roni and Dominique Veda for the same kind of system, but now it's imbibing, let's say, from the clamped ends. And also the states where the ends were open and closed were happening. Closed were happening for the same parameters. So there is something to understand, but which one we choose and this dynamic, I think, has maybe interesting. That was just my points. I think I have very few time, but I want to talk to you about swelling. So the swelling that we, the material that we look to look at swelling is those elastomeric fibers, so either PDMS like drager or VPS, which is the same kind of silicone elastomer. Of silicone in estomen, and we swell them in very low-viscosity oil, so for us, more like two to five centistopes. And we have a swelling, which is what Jaga already described, so it's good I don't have to spend too much time on it. Interestingly, our diffusion coefficients are always small, and if we try to change it by changing the polymer, we actually never really change it because this diffusion coefficient is a depends, it's a porrelactic material, so it depends both on the young modulus and on the permeability. And if I change the distance between. And if I change the distance between my cross links, for example, I make everything softer, but I also make it more permeable. And so the ratio A times K is always the same. So you can't really vary it. So your aging situation is probably very smart. So I have noted because we had a hard time like changing. We mostly change the swelling coefficient by just the swelling time by changing the viscosity of the oil. And so that's easier. And typically, the oil that we use are very low viscosity oils. So if you were to place a drop on the So, if you were to place a drop on the flat substrate, it will be absorbed within a minute. So, we thought that the experiment that Pierre was going to do were nice and easy. So, he took a drop of oil, placed it on the fiber, the same material as a piece of an ester that you've seen before, and he looked at the swelling. So, here, because the job doesn't spread, you have this kind of local swelling, you see that below the job, you reach. Swelling, you see that below the drop fuel reaches your maximum swelling ratio, which is about 1.5, and then you will slowly diffuse to completely fill the material. So, this experiment lasts about 15 hours. So, it's a real different time scale, and that's because you have this local saturation of liquid. So, you can't, once you've swollen behind you, the only way you can swollen is by diffusion, and that's super slow. And that also means that you have a swollen region that will stay there for a long time before everything. There for a long time before everything is able to diffuse within the material, and that's important. It also means that it's very sensitive to the volume. If you start with a small volume, you just are able to absorb in within a few milliseconds. And if you have just a slightly larger volume, then you end up being in that saturated regime. And then suddenly it takes several hours with just a slight range of volume. Okay, but so that's one of the ingredients which is important. You can have these local saturations when you have drops and fibers. When you have jobs and fibers. The other important thing to note is that we have a poor elastic material, which means that how much the material can absorb depends on the tension within the material. So here, the more tension you have, the more you are able to absorb liquid, which means that your equilibrium concentration or swimming ratio depends on the tension. So if I do, if I did the experiments where he pulled on the fiber, dip it, let it swirl completely. Dip it, let it swell completely, take it out, remove the oil on it, and now quickly change the distance between the two tips. You'll start seeing deswelling. So the liquid wants to get away outside of the fiber because the tension is reduced. That's the second, for me, it was not so obvious as an experiment. That's an important notion. And the other thing that is important is that you can actually have degrees of tension just by You can actually have degrees of tension just by swelling. So, if I have one drop on an isomeric fiber, since the drop will swell, it will change the length, and so that will reduce the overall tension within the material. So, now the experiments that we did was just to take one fiber and place two drops on it. And so, what you so we have these two drops are just absorbing. You see the fiber is swelling. So, this is accelerated as about So, this is accelerated as about 20 times, I think. So, everyone is absorbing now. It's very slow because it's saturating. And you see that one starts to twitch and gets to the other one. So, Pierre did a lot of experiments to try to understand that, but one that gives us a big clue is the one that is below. So, the time, yeah, the assertion time is like 60 hours. The assertion time is like 60 hours because there's only one single job there, and everything is saturated, so it really takes forever. Um, so these experiments here you have the five drops that are just slightly more apart. So, you see this well, and then the swollen region are kind of going to meet at the center. And then you start seeing that there is a droplet actually exiting the fiber at the center. So, there's like a deswelling here. And in the first movie, this is probably what bridges the two fiber. Movie, this is probably what bridges the two fibers and induces their coalescence. So, what's happening? So, we started from an initial state where we had a given tension, so one I imposed to start with. I play the two jobs. Those jobs swell everything. And so you reach saturation at the center between the two jobs, but now your tension is a little slower. It's T1. And the job keeps on being absorbed. So the tension keeps on decreasing. And so eventually you reach a tension. And so eventually you reach a tension which is lower where the liquid at the center is out of equilibrium, it doesn't want to stay there. And it has two things to he could do. He could just travel all along and exit through the end wheel diffusion, which is very slow, or he could possibly deswell. And it seems from our experiments that this deswelling is what is happening. And so then these jobs can induce coalescence and other things. And so here is the jobs are both. Is the jobs are both reducing the tension, which creates some kind of compression, I mean, yeah, which induces the deswelling. So we can model this a little more efficiently. We work with Vinyl Dervo, which is an excellent theoretician that was able to model this system. And I'm not going to get into too much detail here, but the good thing that we can try to get more information with the model about what's happening within the fiber. And so as we Fiber and so as we start swelling, we can look at the radius of the fiber at the center, I indicated here, as a function of time. And we can also directly know the tension within the fibers and extract what is the maximum authorized radius. So what is the equilibrium radius? And this will slowly decrease with time because the tension is slowly decreased. And so if we start with fibers which are with droplets which are far from each other, then the center will never really get saturated. The center will never really get saturated, and nothing will happen. Well, the jobs will be absorbed. But if we get into that experiment, at one point the center will be saturated and will somehow overshoot the maximum radius. So in the model, we don't have deswelling, so it just keeps on going. But what we see experimentally is that the job actually appears at the center. And so we continually modify the liquid distribution. modifies a liquid distribution with this motion. And I mean at this we can actually, oh well, so we can put it into a phase diagram, which tells us that this is a good mechanism because the region in which numerically we see this overshoot, so this T star that I wrote, how much volume is left in the job at the overshoot time, if we plot it against our data, we see that this is the region where thiswelling occurs. So thiswelling is really this extra leak. So, this one is really this extra liquid that has to go somewhere. One of the interesting things is that those interactions don't need to be close to where we are. So, here is an experiment. Again, with spare time, you have the time on the site in probably minutes or hours. This is very stable. This will stay there like 60 hours. Those droplets are saturated, but they won't really interact much more. But what we can do is What we can do is, so it did the experiment again to show that nothing happened. And at one point, it will add droplets far away from those two ones. So center is saturated. The fact to add droplets will just be decreasing the tension in the silence. So you place droplets somewhere else, and that reduces the tension, and the two droplets at the center coalesce. So you have just because you've changed a local tension. So you can really change a liquid distribution. So, you can really change a liquid distribution from even far away in a network. Um, I don't know if I'm probably a little out of time, but these effects will be important for when you have two fibers, especially well, mostly I want to show you the last movie, where we have a drop. So it's slowly swelling, which reduces the tension, so it induces zipping time, which actually reduces by a lot of time to absorb a drop. So, that's a good. A job. So that's a good experiment. And I'm not gonna give you too much detail about that. I think I'm actually gonna stop here with maybe just images of our initial question, which is still hard to understand, like what happens when you spray a complex material, what are the shapes that you have, how fast do things coalesce. And that's the series of Hassan Red Krop, who just started in my life. Well, not started a year and a half ago. Yeah. We have time for a few questions, so we'll forego a little coffee for questions. I have to ask you about the art thing. Tell us about that. Yes, and I have, I can show you the other art part that we did. It's interesting because it's an unmodified movie that you put on the wall of the building. Yeah, well, we filmed the movie together. So the movie, so it's a movie so it's a it's a there's a little bit of sequences choices in the movie right so there is there is one part where the movie is the experiment but we choose how you know the order of sequences that we show to tell the story but it is just a movie from the fast camera in the lab even though i had never done a traveling with a fast camera before so it was different so this is scientific folk art made public the movie is not modified at all the movie is not modified Modified at all. The movie is not modified, but we took the movie together and we tell a story with the image. Yeah. So they're beautiful experiments. And of course, as a theorist, I start thinking about what would be the right tool to model them. Now, there's a huge literature on thin liquid films on surfaces using lubrication theory type models. I guess there must be a literature like that on fibers too, though I don't know. It's going on. It's going off on what okay, and and uh and and you know, in in most of those in many of those models, there is built in some hypothesis about the wetting layer in between. The wetting layer that somehow the region between the bubbles is still wet in some way, right? Yeah, so you know, I guess one needs to know something about or to model that wetting layer because That wetting layer because for sure the bubbles are communicating through it. Well, yeah. And in the last experiment with elastometh, actually, it's a liquid wetting it's like itself, right? So for me, it's like there's really zero contact angle. It's not even a precursor because it's the same molecule, it's the same thing on the same thing. But for the initial one, yeah, there is always liquid there that helps the coalescence for sure. But for the last one, I'm not so sure. For the last one, I'm not so sure, it's not easy to understand what's happening there. We tried to see if there were liquids on the surface, um, but it's hard to see. And you know, so we've tried with ink, with stuff, with everything, it's not easy to see. But I feel like anyway, our elastomer is not perfectly cured, so there should be a layer of like free chain, which are the same as the one that we put on front of it. So, yeah, everything is completely pre-wetted. Um, and so, yeah, in And so, yeah, in theory, it's not so easy, but the models of the kind of ad hoc model of tenor's law with cutoff parameters is pretty good in general. Yeah, something like that. There was some question about Ostwald ripening, and the wedding layer produces something like that, except your droplets are moving, right? This would be Oswald ripening with movement with motion of droplets, probably. Yeah, well, and the film left behind the droplet. Well, and the film left behind the drop depends on how fast they move because there's uh Lando effects. So it's a bit um many interesting questions. Sorry, on a different topic, on the swelling topic, can I just clarify why the diffusion coefficient you can get the diffusion coefficient to change? Just I know you explained it, but I didn't. So basically the diffusion coefficient, that's the way we define it is uh so it's pseudo-diffusive coefficient now. It's a poorelasting. Diffusive coefficient. It's a poor estimate. It's lower. Yeah, so it's absolutely diffusive coefficient. But so we measure it by measuring the swelling behavior. And so if you were to look at the porolessic literature, you will know that this swelling time will be, well, this diffusing coefficient will be the Young modulus times the permeability divided by the viscosity. And as I say, when we change the lastomer, we change both E and K. Both E and K, and in general, and actually, it's also true for fiber suspensions, which we've learned recently. If you want to make something with softer, you will tend to make it actually also more permeable. And so you will always, if you decrease one, you will increase the other one and the opposite. Even PDMS, which is much stiffer, is actually also much less permeable. And so it all compensates. Is it okay if I ask a question from the online audience? Ask a question from the online audience. Can I just finish? Maybe we finish Anne's question. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Which sort of mixing is this dochiometrically mixed this PDMS? So do you know where it's dochiometry? We use the PDMS, the Silgiard 184 with 1 to 10 ratio. And then we use this VPS of different initial oligomer lengths to change the cross-linking time. You haven't gone to 1 to 4 difference yet? No, we didn't want to get to. We didn't want to get too much of pre-chain and 3D stuff in there. We do not. It's really a rough experiment. So we have one value. But yeah, probably if we were to be more careful, we could change the diffusion coefficients. But with what we had, we were not able to change it, at least not significantly enough. And the effect of the radius, which is square, is much larger. So it was probably easier just to do that. Also, see, the experiments are already like 60 or 70 hours. 60 of 70 hours, and you got to do lots of experiments in parallel then to keep. Yeah, so you have like lots of different experiments running at the same time, but you have to make sure that no one so big the initial coalescence were like maybe you know there's an effect of flow or people working around the experiments and then so you have to kind of build a defense around it for like ages um but so they were not because they're very robust okay carry um if we want property we have to go now because ccs More coffee, we have to go now because CCS. Maybe, Carrie. Oh, yeah, you can ask me the question and I can answer it later. Yes, sure, if there's time. I mean, it's a very quick question. What I did not understand is where does the twitching come from, the actual rocking back and forth? We're not really sure either. So, what we know is that we're creating these droplets at the center, and maybe this droplet is coalescing with the other one, which creates. Coalescing with the other one, which creates a little bit of motion of the center of mass. And then there's more disordering. And yeah, we're not really sure, but it was consistent. Well, you don't see them all the time, the oscillations. And they're actually slow oscillations. So this movie does one image every 10 every minute. So it's not like it's not very fast oscillations, but they are coming and we're not sure why. And it's sometimes coming. And maybe, yeah, as soon as you coalesce, you will move a little bit to center of mass, but I may be connected to. Center of mass, but I may be connected to this lubricating film also that makes them extremely mobile, these droplets, because they're like on a lubricated layer. I'm not so sure. If you have good ideas, I'll be we try to see to image it more, but it's not that easy. Great, thank you so much. And beautiful, beautiful experiments. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, let's thank our speaker and head for coffee.
