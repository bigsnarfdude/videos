Thank you for introducing me. I would like to thank all the organizers for invitation. It's a pleasure to be here. Well, it would be better if we can meet in Banofin in person, but I hope it will be still interesting enough. I will be concentrating on the second order problems that embrace Pilaplace equations. Embrace P Laplace equation or Laplace equation with measured data. And I will mention the results that I obtained with Flavia Janetti and Anja Zatorska-Gorstein for Scalar equation. And then I will speak about the vectorial problem that I did with Anya Zatorska-Gorstein and the young Korean, say, postdoc, Yehun Yoon. Please have a look on the equation. On the equation, I mean, we all know that there will be some problems with the well-poseness of this equation, and of course, we will employ some special notion of solution. So, in particular, these solutions can be unbounded, but if we have the proper meaning of this solution, we still can control it by a certain potential. And if the measure is nice enough, we will be able to infer some kind of Able to infer some kind of local properties like continuity of or helder continuity of these solutions. Let me give a flavor to everybody who is more familiar with pillar place case. So, of course, we know that if the measured datum is just a direct delta, we deal with We deal with so-called fundamental solution, and it does not belong to the reasonable energy space. Actually, it does not have for P close to one, it does not even have a properly integrable weak gradient. But still, we want to have a theory that captures this kind of solutions that are not too much wild. And there are a lot of kinds of very weak solutions obtained by. Obtained by some kinds of approximate procedures like SOLA, solutions obtained as limit of approximations. Those where we restrict the family of test functions like renormalization entropy solutions, or we describe them by the comparison principle, like A superharmonic functions. And it is known that for P growth case, whenever they are well defined, then they coincide. This is not known for more general. This is not known for more general settings, I mean, not in that generality. And we will always have the most problems with p small. I am dealing with equations when the operator, the growth of the operator is described by some function that satisfies delta to Nabla 2 conditions. We could call this function doubling. It is, in particular, it In particular, it implies that this function is trapped between two power type functions, but it is a little bit more restrictive. But anyway, this G would generate all reflexive or lit spaces, these doubling ones. And the typical examples are so-called Sigmund functions that are of this form, p perturbed by a logarithm in some power. Perturbed by a logarithm in some power, but they can be also their multiplications or compositions. In the scalar case, we deal with the set of assumptions of this type. This is a very typical way of describing the overlage growth of the operator. And apart from that, we assume only that A is a monotone and we even can stick to Measurable dependence of A with respect to X. So we really don't need a reasonable behavior, this operator, with respect to the spatial variable. And the way we're describing the growth with the derivative of this capital G is very typical in these reflexive origin spaces. And please remember this small G because it will appear in our potential in a moment. For short, we ask for normal P superharmonic functions, we define this A superharmonic function with respect to this operator A by comparison principle. And we know that such an A superharmonic function will be defined everywhere, will be unbounded, can be unbounded, and it will generate a measure. So this A superharmonic function. So this a superharmonic function we would like to control by a potential and prove its regularity if possible. Okay, this I went a little bit probably too precise for such a nice audience that is specialized in these topics, but let me only say we know that for the heat equation, we have the representation by Green's function and it justifies And it justifies the estimates by the risk potential. In the case of, and we can do it with the local version of this. In the p-growth case, we need to substitute the potential by something more general, more suitable to the growth of the operator. And here we have the potential. And here we have the potential that is usually called Volve potential. It appeared yesterday in some talks, but a very similar potential also appeared in previous papers by the Russian school, in particular in papers by Habin and Mazya. For P equals 2, this potential gives back the risk potential. And this is a great moment to try to Try to give a tribute to Jan Mali, who passed last week, I think, and a wonderful person and a great mathematician. He and Tero Kilpelainen wrote a few very nice papers in early 90s about potential estimates to problems with pilaplasia. And for this a harmonic, sorry, piece. Sorry, P superharmonic functions, they proved double-sided estimates as written here. Next proved by Trudinger and Wank and Kortekussi, I will mention in a moment. First of all, we thought: okay, can we do the same, provide such an estimate from below and from above? From above. And that is what we did. We have the potential that reads this way. This is the small g. Maybe I will show Elvor a little bit here. This is the inverse of t to power p minus one. And here we have small g inverse. So it is just a generalization of this previous result. We have double-sided Double-sided estimate. Here we have infimum. This plus r and minus r doesn't matter because they will not cause any problems for us for inferring the regularity. Let me only mention one more result. It was also proven by Nian Mali in 2003. He did very much similar upper bound for A super minimizers. So we were already provided with the We were already provided with the candidate for being our vault potential, also from below. And please see that we trapped you from below and from above by the same potential. So it cannot be done with a better one. So, in this sense, this potential is sharp. Another thing that is just super directly visible is that we can prove that. We can prove that U is continuous in X0 provided the potential is uniformly small in its neighborhood. And as another consequence, we prove the full characterization of non-negative bounded measures that are in the dual space to the origin space. But this is not all. We can also, okay, this is. Can also, okay, this is this I show only in the special case of Sigmund spaces, and this is the precise version of the fundamental solution. So we can prove what should be the fundamental solution just from these estimates. And moreover, we prove that if so, we just take this estimates and then Just take this estimate and then think: okay, if the measure is nice enough, then what we can prove with the solution. And here, this is indeed a formulation that this data is in the Lorentz space, the natural one in relation to the growth of the operator. In particular, in the p-growth case, this is this one. For Sigmund, you can easily write. For Sigmund, you can easily write it down as well. But okay, this one is not super easy to imagine. The better one is this Mori. Because if the solution is held continuous, then we can prove from one of these estimates that mu actually has to satisfy this density condition. And the other way around as well, if mu is Is satisfies this density condition, then the solution has to be calder continuous. We know this density condition for pillar place problem. This is the same one you will use, for example, to describe removable singularities for Helder continuous solutions. And of course, for Sigmund growth operators, you can easily infer it as well. Easily infer it as well. In the paper with Flavia and Anja, we also provide natural Martin Kiewicz type characterization relating to this one for p-applation that implies that mu actually satisfies this condition density, the Smori condition, and consequently their continuity of a solution. As for methods, we needed to provide a range of generalized A range of generalized harmonic tools. We did it with Anja Zatorska in the framework like right now the Finnish group is working with. I mean, Hasto, Haruleto, and so on, because it didn't matter if it is Orlich or a generalized Orlich from this point of view. And we essentially used the ideas of the book by Bjern and Bjern. Book by Bjern and Bjern. For the proof of wolf potential estimates, we actually in the proof is really based on the ideas that are well presented in the paper by Rika Corte and Tomo Kusi that are somehow based on the paper by Trudinger and Wank. For regularity consequences, I was reading and appreciating a lot the guide to potential T. The guide to potential theory by Tuomo Kusi and Rosario Mingone. Okay, let me go to the systems. When I wrote this color paper, Rosario asked me if I can do it with the systems. So I had a try. And then let me first summarize: I cannot not mention the most important contributions to the existence and regularity to the system that started. Regularity to system that started in 60s, 60s, well, maybe more 70s. Then in the 90s, measured data systems were more and more studied with the most important contributions, I think, by Doltzmann, Hunger, Bühler, and Miller. Of course, we base on all of them. What is still surprising for me, but if you know something, tell me that the uniqueness for measured. That uniqueness for measured data problems is still open and it is known in very, very particular cases. Of course, I know that even for equations, you cannot do for arbitrary data, but for L1 data, even you cannot have a reasonable conditions for measured for L1 data problem to be unique. Okay, and for this problem, we will apply the notion. A notion of solar. So we have the solutions that are obtained as a limit to problems with regular data that converge to our final measure weekly in the sense of measures, weekly star. And we will need this solution to have at least this regularity with small g. Actually, first we should prove, and we did it later, in the paper with June and Zatorska Goldstein, we proved the regularity for general, more or less general systems. They are quasi-diagonal in this sense, like in the papers by Doltzmann, Kunger, Miller, and Miller. But they are just orange. And we showed not only the existence of And we showed not only the existence of a little bit different notion of approximable solutions, but then we didn't need to restrict to fastly growing capital G. If G grows slowly in the sense, P smaller than N, we provide Martinkiewicz regularity for U and U. And if we impose the condition that is more or less saying that Is more or less saying that P is not degenerating to one, then we prove that we have the proper regularity and the fact that U is solar. So we have solas for rather general problems with orange growth. Let me only mention that we needed to use some trick that was recently elaborated by Balgician Dinink and Mazia. So I guess this is to appear this year. Here this year. Then let me go to the potential estimates because we were not able to do it for full generality. We needed to restrict to super quadratic growth and to the separate variable operator. But anyway, we don't need more structural or growth restrictions. We proved the estimate of this formalized Estimate of this form, as I said, the guy that is not very much important is different, but it also shrinks to the value of u of x0 if r is tending to zero. Most important reference for us was the paper by Kusi and Mingjone from GEMS 2018. What we could do, we could prove the criterion On when the solution has vanishing min oscillation, or as previously that continuity can be inferred from the fact that the potential vanishes in the neighborhood. By the way, this was not known for Orlich problems. So, and yes, also we proved that any a harmonic function map is continuous. Map is continuous. Moreover, what resulted from the upper bound in the scalar case we can also have here. So we proved that from Lorenz datum, we have continuous solutions and from Moray data, held their continuous solution. And of course, for this Marchinkiewicz version, we can also have this local harder continuity. Our main tool to prove this estimate. This estimate is controlling the energy somehow of these very weak solutions and approximation of a Sobolev map by an a harmonic map. This is the generalized version of the one that was proven by Kusi and Ninjone. We didn't do so quadratic case and we were not able to Able to go without the separation of variables of the operator. Okay, I am quicker than I thought that I would be. But I have one more off topic that is not I thought that I will not be able to speak about methods more. So I thought that maybe this can be of some interest of some of the participants. Interest of some of the participants. This was a little bit of work last year. So we already sent the proofs, the language proofs for our book with Pyotr Gvies, Dagniškash Vercheska, Vyasda and Agneta Vrubleska-Kaminska of our book on partial differential equations in anisotropic Mushela-Korlich spaces. So it is coming very, very soon with Springer monographs in mathematics. And I'm very proud of that. And I'm very proud of that. Okay, thank you very much for your attention. Please, if you are interested, all the papers are available on my web page, or you can ask me privately. I will be very glad to provide you. Okay, thank you very much, Ivanka, for the nice talk. Are there questions, remarks, appreciation, comments? Ivanka, you wrote in your last but one side that you are not treating the subquadratic growth case. So, what do you mean that you always need to require that the growth is like two, at least two minus one over n or what? Actually, okay, if it is solar, you cannot go below two minus uh uh one over two n, but for pilot russians. But for Pilot Russians. Yes, yes, it di this is definitely the problem of everything. But no, we actually can go a little bit beyond two, but not even to this two minus one over n. It is like there was a problem we couldn't pass and there is some artificial number there that we had to have that the growth. That the growth from below has to be separated from. So the problem was in controlling in the very first step, controlling the energy of the solution. Remember that you were dealing with solutions whose truncations are, vectorial truncations are sore functions. Yeah, but even this was not enough. Still, to control at this very moment, At this very moment, in the very beginning, we had problems with controlling the energy. And I have this artificial number from below that is below two, but nothing special to which this growth from below has to be separated from. I see. So you don't have because Mueller and Coders in their material. Mueller and co-authors in the mathematicians paper, they have this notion of solution whose gradient is in approximate sense. And even if they don't mention it explicitly, but the way they prove the existence of solution is just that approximate by sequences to realize problems. So, but for existence, we didn't have this problem. Maybe, maybe I will show this paper for existence. For existence, we go. Existence for existence, we go with everything in full generality. In the sense, we have these assumptions as Doltzmann, Kunger, Buller, and Miller. And we have all of these assumptions. I wrote them in the sloppy way, but they are very precise. And I think that they are all sharp. This slowly here, I wrote that it is more or less like P is smaller than N, but this is the one that relates to the Sobolef embedding, the optimal one. So the existence you have without restriction. So, the existence you have without restrictions. Yes, and this one is also, I think, sharp. Yes, yes. The problem is for the for this. And for estimates, I'm too stupid. Now, I see, I see, because I had a look at your paper and then they saw that this existence was guaranteed without any. Yes, yes, yes. For existence, we don't need. Now it's clear. Thanks, thanks. Sure. Are there further questions? Ibunka, what about gradient estimates? Okay, I'm thinking if I want to start it, but yes, I'm thinking. I think that it is very complicated and. And I'm still measuring my forces. If I'm, yeah. Rosario, Paolo Baroni had some Aldrich estimates for gradients, didn't he? Paolo Baroni said. And this is Kalkvart 2. So this is done by Paolo Baroni. He didn't have also this X dependence, but Dependence, but super quadratic was covered fully. Okay, so the question is subquadratic for gradient. But I thought Paolo was working on this with somebody, so I didn't want to. No, but Paolo only dealt with the scalar case. Ah, oh, yes, sure. Okay. Now I understand. Yeah, so as for the vectorial case, I'm really afraid, but maybe I. I'm really afraid, but maybe I will try. Are there any questions, comments, remarks? No. Okay, this is not the case apparently. So we thank Ivonka again. And I think we, Ivanka, you took. Ivanka, you took less time, right? I mean, it seems that we have more time and we should resume in 20 minutes. And there, isn't it? I mean, it's should be that's the schedule. It's 7.45 mountain time. So that means 3.35 45 Europe, 20 minutes. 20 minutes for. Okay, so it's Igo, you take care of stopping the recording. All right. If you want, but yeah, there was some.
