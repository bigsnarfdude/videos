So in this work, we use the very classical work of Bovil to prove what we are proving. And as we explain in the introduction, as we see, there are three major steps in the proof. And so one of the major steps. And so, one of the major steps which Bovi uses is the birational equivalence of ILAR characteristics. For Calabiao Free Fault, the USB is a very good idea Not free faults for Kalabibayao varieties. So, of course, if you look at the Eiler characteristic, the classical Eiler characteristic, which is the alternating sum of battery numbers, this is not a birational invariant because if you blow up a variety, it will change the cohomology. And so it's going to change the eigenparametric as well. But the magic which happens, at least from the first time you look at this problem, is that if you First time you look at this problem, is that if you have two collabial varieties, you blow them up and then you blow them down, you get from one collabial variety to another one. It turns out that these changes cancel each other out and you're going to get zero. So the two Euler characteristics are the same. So what we would like to do is to see if this result holds. Is this result true for the characteristics? I don't know how to call them. I like to call it the motivic, but maybe people call it something different. The motivic Eiler characteristic. So this is an invariant which I think has been introduced by people in previous lectures. So it's a homomorphism from the Grotendic group. From the grotendic group of varieties over a field which I assume to be of characteristic zero into the grotendic with ring of the same field. And it's a famous story that the original result which Bobi uses is due to baterio, which uses p-adic integration. This was basically This was basically the inspiration for Koncevic's work on motivic integration, which can be used to show that more refined invariants, for example, Hodge-theoretical refinements of the ILAR characteristic are also birational invariant. So, the problem is, at least for me, maybe because I don't know motivic integration well enough, is that if you try to just simply That if you try to just simply apply the theory to this invariant, you have to basically invert an element in the growth tendic, which basically kills all interesting information. So I don't know how to do this. And there are partial results. For example, there is a result that the discriminant of the motivated ILARP characteristic is by rational invariant for these various DPTs. ISTPTs. But this is basically because it's a shadow of the Galois representation over some finitely generated field, rich enough arithmetic to see informations of this type. And eventually, we basically, just you do a variant of the periodic integration of bacterial. And I personally believe that there must be some sort of a large. Must be some sort of a larger invariant, some sort of a more refined invariant, which will be susceptible to motivic integration. But it's a very interesting challenge, again, at least for me, maybe not for the experts, to find out what this invariant is. But I don't know how to do this yet. I have some hopes. Maybe I can recover the second Striffer-Widny class, the discriminant is the first Striffer-Widni class, or the first cohomological invariant of the quadratic form. The quadratic form. So, what I'm going to talk about instead is still sufficient for the original purposes, which is the birational invariance for hyperkiller varieties. So, I'm going to show my not completely finished paper because probably the Because probably that's more legible. Let's make it bigger so I can start with the definition. So there is the classical notion of being hypercaler, which I call Uybrecht's hypercalor to distinguish it from other notions. So this is a smooth, irreducible, and projective variety such that the global section. The global sections of omega two of X, where X is the variety, has a non-degenerate two form and X is topologically simply connected, assuming that X is defined over C. So the difference here is with Calabial varieties that you don't just simply require the top differential forms to be generated by an over-vanishing global section, but you actually require a symplectic form on. form on the tangent space of the of the variety to exist. So a non-degenerate symplectic form. And this of course implies that you take the determinant of this symplectic form that you have a nover vanishing section of the top differential forms. So every variety with this property is collabial. So there is a natural way to generalize these two Way to generalize this to all fields from C, which is that you replace the condition of being topologically simply connected with eta simply connected. I'm call this weekly hyperkiller. And I basically believe that what I'm going to tell you about today probably could be pushed to these scales, but with a highly non-trivial amount of work, especially if you are interested to do this in positive characteristics. So instead, Instead, I'm going to use a different notion, and it's a bit complicated to define. But the reason I define it this way is that this is the notion which is the most general and for which the proof I'm going to tell you is actually working. So a variety over a field K, where I will assume that K is characteristic zero, is hypercarrier. If it is smooth, irreducible, projective, the space H0X, omega S is spent by everywhere non-degenerative form omega. Everywhere non-degenerated uniform omega. And that is a subfield F of K, a model XF of X over F, and an imbending of F into C, such that the base change to X of F to C is Uybrecht's hypercamer. So I don't require the topological fundamental group to be trivial with respect to all embedded, only just one. And this is very close to being weakly hyperkiner. So, first, except the fundamental group condition, which you need to be defined over a field which is sitting inside of C, all conditions are invariant under base C. So, the only reason why this thing is stated the way it is stated is that we want some sense the variety to be defined over C. Over C or over a subfield of C which sits inside both of our original field of definition and C, and it is hypercalor with respect to the complexity value. And the only reason is that we have this technicality is that by the Riemann existence theorem of broad tendic, we know that the eta fundamental group is the profinite completion of the topological fundamental group in this situation. But it is known that there are smooth projective algebraic varieties where Varieties where the natural map from this topologically, from this finitely presented group, the fundamental group, into its profinite completion is not injected. So I don't know an example of a variety which is etal topologically simply connected, but not simply connected, but it is a possibility. Nevertheless, we don't even have this notion of our positive characteristic fields. So I'm going to introduce the main idea next, which is that I fix a base field K. I take the formal power series in one variable over this field. Let's call it R. I take big K to be its fraction field. And I can talk about formal schemes over the formal spectrum of R. And I can take its generic fiber in the sense of Reynolds, for example. It's a rigid analytic. Of Reynolds, for example. It's a rigid analytic variety over K with respect to the natural discrete valuation on K. This is basically a generalization in formal geometry of the usual notion of a generic fiber in the case when your formal scheme happens to be the formal completion of an actual variety. It also has a special fiber, which is a scheme over the residue field of this valuation ring R, which is K. And so I And so I'm going to call a formal deformation of a smooth projective variety X over K to be a formally smooth proper formal scheme over the formal spectrum of R whose special fiber is isomorphic to X. And I'm going to say that two smooth projecting varieties X and X prime over K are strongly deformation inseparable or as this for short. If there are forward deformation, If there are formal deformations, curly x and curly x prime, of x and x prime, respectively, such there is a k isomorphism between the generic fibers, which are rigid analytic varieties. So again, if you don't know about rigid analytic geometry, just think that I do this with algebraic varieties. There is a reason why I have to do it this way. And there is one more technical definition I have to give you so I can state the theorem correctly. So I say that. Theorem correctly. So I say that two smooth projective varieties x and x prime over are deformation inseparable, or this for short, if basically they are strongly deformation inseparable, if you base change the two varieties to the former power series ring over this field. So, in some sense, it means that you have some sort of a two-dimensional deformation of these two guys, which has the same generic fiber. Note that if I have a field extension, f of k, and I have two varieties which are strong deformation inseparable over the smaller field, then their base changes are also strong deformation inseparable. So this implies that two things are strongly deformation inseparable, then they are deformation inseparable. So the first theorem is the following: let x and x prime be biodiversal. Let x and x prime be birational hypercaler varieties over k, then they are deformation inseparable. This theorem is basically due to Huybrecht's over the complex numbers, but he uses a completely different language. He's an algebraic geometer, so he's using complex analytic deformations, and he shows that basically there are two proper smooth. Proper smooth families of complex analytic varieties over some small disks such that they are isomorphic outside of the fiber over two distinct points. So his methods use highly non-trivial results from differential geometry, or at least, you know, I don't know how to prove those results on my own. The idea of proving this theorem is. Idea of proving this theoretical is that you basically show that his construction, some sense, can be done over a smaller field if the varieties happen to be defined over that smaller field. And the reason why the theorem is stated in the way it is stated is that eventually the idea goes down to the fact that you can select a curve in some deformation space which avoids countably many varieties or it doesn't sit inside of countably many varieties. And if you want to do an argument like And if you want to do an argument like this, you usually need your field to be uncountable. So, even usually, when you do an arithmetic argument, you start with a finitely generated field. The trick here is that at some point, you're going to switch from the field to the formal power series ring over that field. And what is the motivation for proving this result? Of course, is the following theorem, which says that if x and x prime are too smooth, project. Next point are too smooth, projective varieties over K, which are deformation inseparable, then their motivical characteristic is the same. Now, combining this with the previous main results, we get the corollary we want that if we have two birational hyper-K rare varieties over K, then their motivic Eiler characteristic is the same. So, why is this good enough for us? This is basically because the varieties which Bovil applies. Bovil applies Vakiriov's theorem are not just collabial varieties, but they are actually hyperkiller varieties as well. So, one of them is the Hilbert scheme of zero-dimensional sub-schemes of S of length N, and the other one is a compactified Jacobian. And so, the main result is that these are birational hypercalculable varieties. You have to check that actually the argument, which is again, because it's done by hardcore algebraic geometers, is done by. Hardcore algebraic geometers is done over C, actually works over any field. This is a mild technical issue, so let's not worry about this. Anyway, once you get that, you get the corollary, is that if you have a K-free surface over K, then the motivator characteristics of these two attached modular varieties, one of them is a Hilbert skin, the other one is the total space of a generalized Jacobian, have the same motivation characteristics. Characteristics. So, of course, we prove this result, modulosum ideal, which basically loses all kinds of higher invariant information about the quadratic form originally with my paper with Jesse. So, at least this step in the argument doesn't require loss of information anymore. So, as I said, I believe that with some non-trivial work, this thing can be pushed. But, for example, at some point, you have to use the hard result coming from differential geometry. And if you want to do this, you will have to understand the proof and you have to see is that it's enough if the eta fundamental group is trivial and you don't need the topological fundamental group to be trivial. But hopefully, that this is the case. So, first, let me recall quickly why it is a good trick to switch from K to K double bracket T. This is basically because, as you probably all know, but if you don't know, let me recall it. It's not a big loss of information to switch from a field to the former power C, from the former Lorentz series field, one variable, because the natural forgetful map from the Grotend decree. The grotendic ring of the small field to the grotendic ring of the large ring is injecting. So, this is a very classical, well-known proposition. It's written up, for example, in Lum's standard textbook. And you can actually make it even quite explicit. So, for example, if you have something like a unimodular quadratic form over the ring R, the former power series ring, the discrete variation ring. Power series ring, the discrete variation ring sitting inside of the Lorentz series field. Then, if you look at its special fiber, that's a quadratic form over little k. If you look at its generic fiber, it's a quadratic form over big k. And this homomorphism is basically mapping the invariant or the class of the special fiber to the generic fiber, no matter what the unimodular form is. So, if we go back to this theorem, If we go back to this theorem, which tells you the invariance of the Motivi Keiler characteristic over under deformation inseparability, this is already known for algebraic deformations. So probably it might be something which every expert knows, but I certainly found it in a paper, a recently published paper by two young mathematicians whose name I don't know. By two young mathematicians, whose name I don't remember, but Jesse maybe can recall me who they are. So, anyway, okay. So they use the moti-comotopical definition and six functor formalism, etc. Functal formalism, etc., to do this. So I don't feel capable enough to do this in this formal rigid analytic setting. But luckily, by the result of the big theorem of Levin and Reski, we know that the Dura-Mylar characteristic is the same as the Motivic Eyler characteristic. So we can recover this invariant, this quadratic form, by looking at the Durancohomology of the variety. And this thing. Homology of the variety. And this thing you can define for rigid analytic varieties as well. So you can talk about the Durham cohomology of a rigid analytic variety. You have a trace map as well. And using these two things together, you can define a quadratic form. And you have the invariant. By basic standard comparison results in algebraic the rigid analytic. The rigid analytic GAGA. If you have an algebraic variety over a local field, a field, for example, with just complete with respect to a discrete valuation, then the algebraically defined invariant is the same as the rigid analytically defined invariant, basically because the cohomology is invariant on the moving from one geometry to the other one. So the main The main result we have to prove, of course, is the following theorem: is that if you have a formal deformation of a smooth projective variety over X, then the Durham-Meiler characteristic is the way I explained above. It's defined for the genetic vibration. It's a regionality variety, which is a class of a quadratic form over the big K field. It's the same as the image of the Motiv characteristic of the special fiber under the static homomorphism. Under the static homomorphism from the grotendic thing of little k to the grotendic thing of big k. And once you have this result, you have your comparison result because if two things are deformation inseparable, then the generic fibers are isomorphic, so their durable myeline characteristic is isomorphic. So this means that the special fibers have the same myeline characteristic as well because theta is an injective homomorphism. So before I go on, So, before I go on, let me try to explain you in some sense what's the phenomenon here, which is, for me, who is just a simple-minded number theorist, is quite sophisticated birational geometry. If you look at something like the moduli of hyperkiller varieties, if you just define it as a topological space over the complex, it's not separable. So, the phenomenon here is that you'd have two points which are not. Is that you'd have two points which are not separated by the topology, even if it's locally isomorphic to a nice complex space, a disk. And you have a curve like a punctured curve, which you can complete two different ways. And basically, Huybeck's discovery is, is that being inseparable in the moduli space is the same thing as being birationally invariant. So it's a rather, how should I say, sophisticated or deep fancy. Sophisticated or deep phenonema connected to this class of varieties. So the proof actually, which I told you, of course, shows the invariance for strong deformation inseparable varieties, but then you can apply the same trick to get the actual statement for things which are just only deformation inseparable. So they are strongly deformation inseparable over the Roland series field. So we basically use the same basic. So, we basically use the same basic fact of switching from a field to the Lorent series field over it doesn't make any loss of information about the motivical characteristic. It's important to point out to people who come from geometry that this invariant is not deformation invariant in the usual sense. So, if you have just a nice smooth proper family, the invariant is going to vary in the fibers. And this can be seen even for very simple. Be seen even for very simple cases, like you take an eta two-fourth cover of GM, for example, the one given by multiplicate the squaring map. Then, the Eiler characteristic is basically going to depend on the class of the element, modulo squares in the field. And they are only going to be the same if, oh, so this says k star, but if and only if they are actually, the potion is a square. So the fact that So, the fact that we are looking at formal deformations and we use this more refined notion of deformable, like some sense inseparable by, from the deformation theoretical point of view, is crucial for the statement to be true. Otherwise, it's false, very, very far from being true. So, the reason, as I said, is that we have to work with rigid analytic varieties, is that Huybert's construction not just uses complex analysis. Is not just uses complex analytical methods, but the actual deformation he constructs is not algebraic. In fact, the whole idea based on the fact is that you're going to construct one family, which is going to be projected if you remove the special fiber. But if you glue it in, you get something which is not algebraic anymore. And so there is no way you can do this in an arithmetic setting unless you use formal geometry, original geometry. So what are the So, what are the basic facts you need to know about the complex analytic deformations of hippophilia varieties to at least understand a little bit of the argument? So, it's a very developed subject and it's highly analogous, of course, to the theory of K-free surfaces, which are basically a low-dimensional special. Sorry, can I ask quickly, Amos? Yes? So, I missed something, so but I thought the microwash deformation that he uses in his proof. Defirmation that he uses in his proof is algebraic, or is that true? One of them is algebraic, the other isn't. Ah, I see. So I don't want to run ahead, but he has a line bundle, which is going to be projective on one family, but it's not projective on the other family. Oh, I see. Okay. Maybe I misunderstood it, but. No, no, okay. Okay, but that's the difficulty, is one of the families is not algebraic. ideas one of the values is not algebraic yeah okay so uh so so going back so so going back to uh to complex analytical deformations the theory is quite analogous to to k-free surfaces and one of the reasons for this is that you can put a quadratic form on the second homology of these varieties which is something like the intersection form in the theory of k-pre-surfaces which allows you to talk about things like torality theorem You to talk about things like totality theorems. And the local totality theorem is true, the global totality theorem is false. In fact, if you have birational hyperkiller varieties, then this invariant is the same for them. But the turin feels, the naive version of the turin feels even more strongly because it's only basically injective on a Zali ski, no, not even a Zali ski open, a very generic. Not even a Zari ski open, but a very generic skill. So you have to count throw out countably many sub-varieties. And actually, the proof is quite deep. So what do we mean by a deformation of a complex manifold? So the thing to note here is that you can also define a complex manifold to be hypertilar, basically mimicking the definition I already told you. Because all of these things make sense. You can also add the condition. You can also add the condition to be K lar, which for anybody who doesn't know about this subject, it's just some condition which makes the theory work. So the formation of a compact complex manifold is a smooth proper holomorphic frac x to s, where s is a germ of an analytic space around a distinguished point, and the fiber over z is isomorphic to x. So that's the complex analytical counterpart of formal deformations. And we say that such a deformation is universal if it has. Deformation is universal, and it has the usual universal property in the category of germs of complex analytic spaces. And it turns out that for hyperker manipuls, there is such a universal deformation space, and it is smooth of the expected dimension, the H1 of the tangent space. There are other useful facts about the theory for. Other useful facts about the theory, for example, the small deformation of a hypercalor manifold is also hypercaler. You can also talk about the deformation of a manifold with a line bundle L, which is basically the same sort of thing, a deformation of the variety together with a line bundle on the total space of the deformation, such that if you take the fiber of the pair over the distinguished point zero, then it's isomorphic to XL. So again, we can talk about universal depth. So, again, we can talk about universal deformations in the usual way. And it turns out that if x is a hyperkiller manifold, then that x is the universal deformation of the pair. And if the first channel class of the line bundle is non-zero, then the space is actually a smooth hypersurface of the non-marked or the deformation space without the line value with respect to the forgetful map. They also intersect. They also intersect transfers only if the two chain classes are linearly independent. So, at this point, I can try to explain you the main idea of Hui Brexp. So, we have two birational hyperkiller varieties, and we're going to choose a very ample line bonding on one of them. And we're going to deform this. And we're going to deform this in such a way that the generic fiber of the deformation has Picard rank one, which basically means there is no other line bundles on it other than the line bundle which generates it. So the deformation itself of the line bundle will be chosen. So if this line bundle itself happens to be projective, then the family itself is a projective map. It's not going to be a projective map. Is a projective map. It's not going to be a projective variety because it's defined over a small disk, but it is relatively a projective map. So, but I can choose this line bundle in the following way. I have my two hyperkiller varieties and they are birational. And so, there is a birational map from one to the other one. This is going to be defined on a codimension two subset. And so, I can pull back, even if it's not defined everywhere, this very ample line bundle onto the other one. This very ample line bundle onto the other variety. So, what I'm going to get, if it is also ample, actually it turns out that the two variety is isomorphic. But if it is not ample, then the map is not going to be defined everywhere, or it's not going to be an isomorphism in general. And that sums the issue because we also want to deform this line bundle with this variety in such a way that the generic fibers are the same. Generic fibers are the same. And so, what happens is that if you look at the generic fiber of the original family, that if you want to fill it in, the way you can fill it in such that it stays projective is that you keep the original family. The other one is going to contract certain things in it. So, this line bundle itself is not ample because restriction in the other deformation, to the other special fiber, it's not going to. To the other special fiber, it's not going to be ample, and ampleness is something which is you know invariant under rescaling, so it's going to be true for all of its multiples as well. So it has just one line bundle up to rescaling, and that's restricted in the total space, and it's restricted to the special fiber, which happens to be projective. It's not ample, so the family is not projective. At least the map itself is not projective. This is how I understand what happens. What happens? So, how can you guarantee that the Picard rank is one? Well, this is where we use this beautiful statement here, which is that the deformation spaces with line bundles are transversal to each other if the channel classes are linearly independent. Because basically, you just want to make sure there is nothing else other than the Z, which is. Than the Z, which is generated by this line bundle. So you take any other linearly independent line bundle in the cohomology of the special fiber, you look at the corresponding deformation space, and you want the curve not to be lying in there. And that's countably many conditions. So you can find a holomorphic curve which avoids all of them. So, what the rest of the proof is, is some heavy lifting to show that if you have such a curve, then if you And if you apply the linear system, which is given by this line bundle, then it's going to give you the other family. So this requires many, you know, things which probably very standard to algebraic geometers, vanishing theorems, codera vanishing theorem. And, you know, it applies a Riemann of theorem in a special form, which uses this quadratic form q over here, and so on. And so on. So, at this extremely basic level of the argument, what do we really need to do to kind of get something which is defined over a subfield? And it is meaningful? Well, the first thing to observe is that not just for algebraic varieties or families of algebraic varieties, but for also families of complex analytic varieties. Complex analytic varieties, you have a notion of formal completion. So, if you have a deformation, if a distinguished point, then you can take infinitesimal neighborhoods of the special fiber. And if the special fiber is algebraic, then these infinitesimal neighborhoods are actually going to be schemes, basically by Gaga. So, this implies that if you take the formal deformation around the zero of the deformation space, you get an actual mapping to the former deformation space of the other. Forward deformation space of the algebraic variety as defined usually. So, there is a parallel theory. In fact, algebraic geometers pretend that these things are exactly the same. So, in some proofs of these results, which I quoted about the deformation spaces of hypercolor varieties, some proofs. Yes? Just to clarify, you said one of the families is algebraic and one of them isn't. Is that already the case now, or is it both algebraic? Yeah, this is how I understand it. So, again, you have a family. It. So, again, you have a family where you have a very ample line bundle. You can even assume it to be very ample. And what you do is that you. So how should I say? You have a very ample line bundle on like X prime. You pull it back to X under the birational method. You get another line bundle, which is not ample anymore. You deform this in such a way that outside. In such a way that outside of the special fiber, in the very generic point in the deformation, it is ample, which means that you have an associated linear system. He also proves that actually the H0s are constant. So you really have a map. And so this is going to be an isomorphism in almost all the fibers or which family is non-algebraic? The starting. The second one is not algebraic. No, the one which you are starting with. So the ones which you get using the deformation theory. Not algebraic. But it's a projector, it has a very ample bundle on it. But it's still not algebraic. No, no. The bundle in the special fiber is not very ample. After you pull it off. Okay, thanks. But because their picard rank is zero, that's basically the only bundle you will have on the family. Basically, the only bundle you will have on the family. But the construction guarantees is that if you throw out the special fiber, then the map is at least generically, like throwing out maybe countably many points, is projective. And you apply the linear system, it's going to apply the birational map to the special fiber. And that's how you get the other family, which is just going to be a deformation of the original very ample line bundle you started with on the second Geis expand. On the second guy's expanse. Okay, got it. Thanks. I hope that we both got it because you know, I myself was thinking a lot about this, about this delicate issue. Got it. I don't understand it completely, but I think I'm getting that. Okay, right. So is it the twister family, the family coming from the hypertail structure? I would be very happy to answer this question. I would be very happy to answer this question if I knew what a twister family is. Why? I'm not an algebraic geometer. I'm a lonely number theorist. So I read some of these papers and I saw the word twister in it. And it was something to do with a Lie algebra acting on something. I don't know what it is yet. I still learn it. It's just that you have a triple, like an I, J, and K of complex structures that form a projective space of complex structures on the same underlying. Complex structures on the same underlying Iber-Kahler manifold. And those are all different, you know, that's that family of different algebraic, sorry, different complex manifolds is not an algebraic. Topologically, all of these things are the same. And the complex analytic and the algebraic thing is also the same by Goga. So I know some similar phenonemium, but this might be just a metaphor and not really explaining what happens. But in higher dimensional higher phenomena, But in higher dimensional family, these sorts of things happen. Like you have very nice pre-pause in smooth proper families, and then you do a flip in a special fiber and you get the same sort of family, but fiber has changed and it's only birationally isomorphic to the other thing. This seems to be some sort of a similar phenomenon, but it's more analytical. Anyway, so let me tell you. Let me tell you, you know, it would be a great simplification for me if this thing was completely algebraic, because then I wouldn't have to do the original version of the comparison result. It's how you can compute from the special fiber, the Durham Eila characteristic of the generic fiber. So, what's the idea of trying to make this into something more number theoretical? So, you have a notion of four. Theoretical. So, you have a notion of formal deformation spaces. This is also written somewhere. Okay, it's not written in this version. So I'll just... Maybe it's written here. Yeah. So you have a forward deformation space. So this is basically just something you apply the classical Schlesinger criterion. The classical Schlesinger criterion to it. So you look at a functor from Artinier local algebras over k and it's pro-representable a formal scheme. And it turns out that the same argument which shows the statement for the analytical case shows you that it's smooth and you have formal deformation spaces for families with line mandals as well. The advantage of this notion is that, of course, it's defined for everything, not just for C. And there is a basic comparison. And there is a basic comparison result, which is that the formal completion of the analytic deformation space is the formal deformation space. So, some sense the picture which starts to arise here is that I have a field, which is say finitely generated. It sits inside of your original field of definition, K, but it also sits in some other way inside of C. And you have a complex analytic deformation space here, it has a formal definition. Deformation space here, it has a formal deformation. It's the base change of the formal deformation space down in big F, which is, if you base change this to little K, gives you the formal deformation space here. So the idea is, is to find an analytical curve who's actually, if you take its formal deformation off, which is defined over C, it's actually defined over the subfield F. Now, because we have to choose a curve which avoids countably many conditions, this does. Countably many conditions. This doesn't work if f is countable, but if it works, if you take the Lorentz series field over F, which is you take F double bracket 3. So what is the actual tree? I call it the bare property. So if you have a subfield of C, K, we say that it has the bare property. If for every countable union of Zalisky closed subsets, proper Zariski closed subsets of Cn, there is a point in Kn such that V is not in the union of. V is not in the union of these varieties. And then basically, this property holds if and only if the theory is uncountable. And this is a pretty simple argument, which probably already been written down in the literature. Now, the next thing you want to do is that if you take the formal completion of the affine space at zero, and you have countably many formal proper sub-schemes. In this formal space, you want to find a curve which does not lie in all of them. And this is possible because first, you can replace every former sub-scheme by a hypersurface, and then it has a Laoist term. And it's enough when you plug in the curve, you get something non-zero. And that's a polynomial equation. If you restrict it to any finite. Any finite-dimensional subspace of all formal curves going through zero. And so the space I'm going to choose are going to be something which is defined over k. Its map onto the tangent space is surjective. That's the condition which guarantees this little algebraic trick here, is that if you plug in the curve into the polynomial, then the lowest term only depends on the derivatives. And you also And you also want these curves to be actually holomorphic if you base change them to C. So you want to know that when you go to C, suddenly the curves are holomorphic. And this can be also guaranteed because first you choose, if the space is n-dimensional, n-holomorphic curves whose first derivative is in k. And then you keep on adding holomorphic functions to them such that you make all the higher derivatives to be in k as well. And this is possible. So you're going to get. So, you're going to get a k vector space of dimension n, which are formally, if you take their formal completion, is defined over k, but actually all the curves are monomorphic. And then you choose this curve and you apply Huybert's argument to it. Now, what's the rest of the proof is basically Bayes change theorems, which says that whatever Huybert's proof, if you take the formal completion, you're going to have it over the formal. You go into have it over the formal completion as well. And then you need another base change theorem: is that if you go down to the field K, you will see exactly the same picture, which is much more standard. And then you have the proof. So basically, this is the idea. And you need a few more technical lemmas. So, for example, if you look at carefully the definition I gave you, you know that there is a subfield over one of the varieties. One of the varieties is already defined, and this field has an embedding into the big field into C, such that it's Fullberg's hyperkiller. And then you extend this field such that the other one is also defined over it. You can do this by a finitely generated extension. So you can still assume that the field is finitely generated over Q. And you can also assume with an additional extension is that the birational map between them is already defined. But then you use that the topological fundamental group. You use that the topological fundamental group over C is birational invariant, you can guarantee that you have a countable subfield which is actually both of the varieties are defined, they are birational, and this field has an embedding into C such that both of them are Hubert cycle K line. And then you have to extend this embedding from the field into its former power series ring. Series ring. And that is also possible basically using standard set theoretical arguments, using the fact that C has continuum cardinality. And so if K was countable, K double bracket T also has this cardinality. And you do a slightly more careful transfinite induction to push this field into C. And now K double bracket T sits inside of C. Everything is defined over it. And with respect It and with respect to the base change to see everything is hyper-kRAM. So you have the setup which you want it to have for the argument to go through. And everything boils down to these GAGA type theorems moving from one type of geometry to the other one. And I don't know if I want to say anything else. Was that the conclusion that you don't want to say anything else?
