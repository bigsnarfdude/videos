By a large functional which depends on four degrees of freedom. So, namely, two degrees of freedom for lateral displacement, here you can see as V and W, one for angular displacement and one for axial displacement. So, in our model we are gonna discuss today, we will just consider one of these degrees of freedoms, namely we will just focus on one lateral displacement. Lateral displacement so that we will get a planar graph such that it's Hamiltonian, it's scalar value. Okay, so we want to get a model on a graph. So that means in order to get a quantum graph, we are going to need energy functional. So then corresponding vertex condition on the quadratic form, then form than other vertex condition to obtain seismic joint operator. So the energy functional in our setting will appear as follows. It will include the second derivative. And here VE means the function defined on some edge. And here we mean summation on edges on the graph. And here capital V just denotes set of vertices. Okay, so for this energy functional key, Khrosov and Usman in 2015 showed that the corresponding quadratic form can be obtained with this given vertex condition. Note that the first vertex condition means that if we consider a model of one joint vertex on which three edges met, the first condition just means The first condition just means that the continuity of the functions at the joint vertex, which is denoted by C in our case. And when we consider derivatives by just considering local coordinates on each edge, so here we see each edge as line segments, so that we introduce local coordinates. So then we can talk about derivative, but the second condition. The second condition will guarantee to the fact that still we have a planar model. So that means still at the vertex our model is planar. And after this two vertex condition, if one considers the coming operator, which is the fourth order derivative with some coefficient, so the other two were taken. Other two vertex conditions should be as follows, so that we can get a self-adjoint operator. And here, let me note that if we consider these four vertex conditions together, in two of them, the angles are also presented. So that means the geometry of the beam is also appearing in the vertex condition, not on the operator itself, but on the vertex condition. Itself, but on the vertex conditions. And our model will be motivated by this work. And we will consider a periodic model on the so-called graphene structure. Here, we consider the infinite hexagonal lattice, which is locally exactly like this model. But with the specific case, there's all these three angles. specific case there's all these three angles lambda one two three they are identical so two pi over three okay so this will be the local picture of our model since we are going to discuss a periodic model our fundamental domain will be this compact graph but we will discuss this in more detail so our model will be the fourth order operator and we will not only consider free operator but also Consider free operator but also operator with a potential, but again, in the model, we need fourth order derivative, and we will get the same vertex condition. And note that since now the angles are identical, they disappear from the vertex condition so that we get this four vertex conditions. And here it's also critical to make an additional symmetry assumption. Symmetry assumption. So on each edge, our potential function will be assumed to be even. Again, let me recall that here Q0 is locally defined for each edge. So locally, we see any edge as an interval from 0 to 1. So that at each edge, our potential will be symmetric with respect to the midpoint. So, and our main focus will be just studying some spectral properties of this sci-fi joint operator on the Graphene lattice we just discussed. And at the end of the talk, we will answer the following questions. Which of these properties still hold if we just change the angles? For instance, if we consider something like this. And we are going to address this problem by just perturbing the angles. Just perturbing the angles, the angles between these three edges. Okay, but since we will consider a periodic operator, it will be useful for us first to consider the periodic corresponding periodic equation on the real line. So here, h per just represents the periodic fourth order operator with the potential function. Operator with the potential function. This is the same potential function defined on the interval 0, 1. So it will be real one periodic potential. And let us first recall their fundamental solutions because they will appear in the dispersion relation on the graphene setting. So the fundamental solutions are the solutions of this. Of this same operator with this given boundary conditions. So, namely, if you just consider this Boolean matrix and if you evaluate all these functions not at one, but on the other end point zero, this matrix just become identity matrix. And we know that when we consider them at one, we call them monodrimetrics. And because of the definition of fundamental solutions, monodromyometrics just shifts. Monodrome metrics just shifts by period along to solutions. And it is known that the monodrome matrix with respect to the eigenparameter is real and entire on lambda. So here a real means m lambda is a function of complex variable lambda. It is entire, but it maps real line to real line on its domain. And if we denote by the characteristic polynomial of this 4x4 monodrome matrix, then the following two sets will have their own importance. So here, if we just let tau to be plus and minus one, and then if we denote them by the plus and minus, the zeros of these two. The zeros of these two polynomials are eigenvalues of so-called periodic and anti-periodic problem, respectively, if we just consider the same operator on the interval 0, 1. So these two spectra will be discrete sets on the real line, and they will be important for us because of the following property they satisfy. They become the end points of the spectral bands. Spectral bands and spectral gaps of the periodic proto. And here the first set of lambdas denotes d plus, the second one is d minus. And here we have a strange way of notation, but let me explain why. Because when we consider the spectral bands of the periodic problem, these two give us the endpoints of each band. Of each band in the following sense. So each gap are denoted by the corresponding sub-index. So that means first gap has left endpoint lambda 1 minus, second endpoint lambda 1 plus. And for each band, we have lambda 0 plus, lambda 1 minus, but then draws switched. Draws switched and then the left endpoint comes from the anti-periodic spectrum, so we have lambda one plus and lambda two minus, and this continues in that way. And sorry. And as I said, these two sets will give us endpoints of the bands of the spectrum. But for the fourth-order operator, which is different than the second-order case, this happened except finally. This happened except finitely many cases, which I'm gonna explain, but let me just put that remark. Okay, so then if we want to work out the characteristic polynomial for any tau, then we can see that it can be factorized nicely in this form, so that actually this characteristic polynomial depends on the two functions, which we denote by T1 and T2. One and T2. So this is how they defined. And here delta one and delta two are just defined as follows. So delta one is T1 plus root T2 and delta two is T1 minus root T2. And if we recall the second order Schrodinger case, then you know that the determinant seems like only the first factor and the middle term it's called the discriminant and that's. It's called the discriminant, and that's why again we use delta notation here. But the discriminant appears something just like T1. So there is no T2, and actually T1 is just trace of the monodrome matrix. So that means in the second order case, this middle term is entire because we know T1 function is entire. In our case, again, T1 and T2 are entire because, but now they Because, but now they appear in the root. So that means there is a possibility that we may have negative values in the root. So that means delta 1 and delta 2 may not be entire. So therefore, the zeros of T2 will be important for us. So they will be called ramification point. And this is exactly when we lose the property that the eigenvalue. The eigenvalues coming from periodic and anti-periodic spectra may not be the endpoints of the spectral band. For instance, in this structure, you see the first band of the spectrum of the periodic case. And here, the left-hand point comes from not the periodic spectra, but the ramification point. But this happens only for finite. But this happens only for finitely many cases. And if we return back to the entireness of delta one and delta two, they can be considered as two sheets of the Lyapunov function, which becomes entire if it is defined on a two-sheeted Riemann surface. So, in order to get an entire Lyapunov function, we need to work on Riemann surfaces. And specifically, delta 1 and delta 2 will be important for us because they will also appear in our quantum graph models. But let me recall a few spectral properties of periodic operator on the line. These are work with Baden and Korotiev. So they show that the spectrum is purely absolutely continuous and has bandcaped structure. They also show that eigenvalues can be characterized. That eigenvalues can be characterized by the values of delta k function. So if at least one of them is between negative one and one, then lambda is in the spectrum. And as we just discussed, eventually the endpoints of the spectral band and gaps are determined by, remember these two antiperiodic and periodic spectrum. And periodic spectra. And finally, the dispersion relation is given by actually this delta one 2 function. Remember, delta 1 is T1 plus root T2, delta 2 is T1 minus root T2. And this is the dispersion relation. And here in the picture below, on the left, you see the case when we have three operators and the potential is identical. Operator and the potential is identically zero. So, here what happens is actually here, delta two is just cosine of fourth root of lambda. Delta one is cosine hyperbolic. So, we know delta one cosine hyperbolic is never between negative one and one. So in other words, it has no contribution to the spectrum. So, all the spectrum contribution comes from the second delta function, delta two. And again, in this case, And again, in this case, as we have in the second order Schrodinger, the gaps disappear. And here we have just spectral bands. But in the second picture, you have a geometric example for a small potential. So here we can see in the first band, there are contributions from both delta functions, delta 1 and delta 2. And that is the reason on the left-hand point, we don't have an eigenvalue from periodic. An eigenvalue from periodic spectra, but instead we have a ramification part, and as I said, this happens only finite in many cases. And okay, if we return back to our quantum graph model, we will again use the classical flow-key block theory, but this time quasi-momento momentum will appear as Momentum will appear as two angles. So, our blow Hamiltonians will act in the fundamental domain in the first period and so on as follows. So, we will consider theta one and theta two. And this will be our, this W will be our fundamental domain, which consists of three edges connected at one vertex and another vertex. And another vertex of one of the endpoints of edge. So the fundamental domain consists of three edges and two vertices. And in this case, if we consider these two vectors b1 and b2, this is how the flow cable of conditions appear. And so that means our below Hamiltonians H theta will satisfy the usual vertex conditions our operator satisfy, which we Satisfy, which we discussed. In addition, we will have cyclic conditions. So, therefore, again, just considering the union of the spectra for each theta on the bird and so on will give us the full spectrum of the periodic operator. And so, let us start the spectral properties. The first property is existent. property is existence of eigenvalues. So if we consider on interval 0, 1 our same operator, fourth order derivative plus potential, with the following boundary conditions, let us call the sigma d. And as you can see, this just motivated from the Driftler spectra because in the second order case, you can just consider first and third condition, which are the Driftler conditions. Condition, which are the Drift conditions. So if we call the spectrum sigma d, then for any lambda in sigma d, actually this lambda becomes an eigenvalue of the periodic operator. And it is an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity because the corresponding eigenspace is generated by simple loop states. So that means the following. That means the following. So any eigam function appears like something like this on one hexagon and zero everywhere else. And that's why we have infinite multiplicity. So we always come up with this type of eigenfunctions. So we never have something like this. We don't have any non-compact state. Have any non-compact state. And in the next result, we characterize the spectrum. We show that the singular continuous spectrum is empty. And the absolute continuous spectrum, again, has bandcap structure. And again, it can be characterized by delta k functions. So these are the same delta functions. Delta functions we discussed with the periodic real line case, this delta one and delta two, coming from the monodrome metrics and fundamental solutions. So again, the absolute continuous spectrum characterized whenever, at least for one of the delta one or delta two, it is between negative one and one. And the pure point spectrum coincides exactly. spectrum coincides exactly with sigma d and also the eigenvalues i didn't write here but eigenvalues are embedded into the absorptive continuous spectrum and eventually they just start to appear at the end points of the bands and the next result is And the next result is the dispersion relation to periodic operator. So the dispersion relation consists of, of course, flat branches whenever we have an eigenvalue. And for all the other part, it is given by this equation. So here, again, this depends on delta 1 and delta 2 functions. And we have a C rotator function, which is simply 1 plus e to the 1 plus e to the negative first quasi momentum plus e to the minus i, second quasi momentum. And this is the dispersion relation. Here on the left, you see plots of this S 0 theta modulus function. And here on the level curves, if you consider the centers of Consider the centers of the dark parts, it gives you the minimum zero of this S rotor function, so therefore the conical singularities of its modulus. So these are exactly the points where we have so-called dirac points or conical singularities. And again, from also the dispersion relation, we can see the fact that this equation is zero whenever at least one of delta one. Whenever at least one of delta one or delta two is between negative one and one, because S rotator in modulus has minimum zero and maximum three. And here the picture on the right is the first two band, first two surfaces of the dispersion relation for the zero potential. And here you can see six conical singularities. And let me note that here. And let me note that here the surface is sumoed. We don't have a singularity here, but we have singularities over there. And here we can explicitly see where these conical singularities live. The direct points of the dispersion relation we have if and only if the t2 function, remember delta k. Remember, delta k is T1 plus minus root T2. T2 is non-negative, and we have this property. And again, as we just discussed, these are the conical singularities. And on the second picture, you can see the level surfaces of the first band. And here And here we see in this picture six direct points, but let us note that the domain of this picture is bigger than the Beryllian zone. So the Beryllian zone is just this square. So that means in the Beryllian zone, actually, we have just two conical singularities. And on the third picture, you see the same level surfaces after a change of coordinates. And with this change of coordinates, you can With this change of coordinates, you can make your Brilliance on from the square to this parallelogram. But this will make your dispersion relation also symmetric with respect to the rotation. So maybe the second one is in some sense better than using the Cartesian coordinates for the quasi-momenta. And let me also note that, remember, we discussed the effect of having contribution from just one delta function or both of them. So in this band, we had contribution from both delta one and delta two functions. And if we have such a case, then locally the That the Dirac points look like a connection of two different two-sided conical singularity. So here in the circles, you see just schematically the dispersion relation. So what we have on the first circle is exactly what is happening here, for instance. Just two surfaces touch, and at the touch, we have quite. And at the touch, we have conical singularity. But when we have and on the first picture, sorry, for instance, as you can see, this solid line is just delta 2. There is no contribution to the disband from delta 1. And then this is what happens to the dispersion surface. But in the second picture, we have with the dotted line, we have delta 1, solid line, delta 2. We have contribution from both of them. From ball of them. So then here you can see the corresponding picture on the dispersion surface. And again, let me recall that this happens only for finitely many cases. So eventually the picture becomes like the first case, which also agrees with the case with the second Laudo Schrödinger. And okay, so in a few minutes, let me. So, in a few minutes, let me return back to Perthur case. Remember, the second question we addressed was which of the spectral properties still holds if we change the angles? Like if we have something like in the second page, we work this problem by considering perturbations of the angles. So, we just perturb some of the angles. And then, what happens is in our vertex condition, we have some change because, remember, in the vertex. Some change because remember in the vertex condition now the angles will start to appear because now delta one, delta two, delta three they will be different. So in this setting, we will have the same operator and Hamiltonian we are going to call h epsilon. Okay, so I will not go into details of how we introduce that. But as I said, the main difference is in the middle one we see graphene, on the other two we On the other two, we have another hexagonal lattices, but with some slight change on the angle. And in this case, we observe the following. So still, one can observe direct points. So still we have direct points of the hexagonal lattice under angle perturbed Hamiltonian. And secondly, and the second one is valid actually for any angle, not only on the perturbed case, the eigenvalues disappear. eigenvalues disappear. So that means existence of the pure point spectrum is something special to the graphene structure whenever angles are identical. But when we even if it slightly changed the angles, the eigenvalues disappear. So that means we left with purely absorptive to continuous spectrum which has still has band cap structure. So these were the main two differences and similarities we have observed with the graphene case. Have observed with the graphene case. Actually, we have also obtained the dispersion relation, but not explicitly, but up to an error of epsilon square. But still, it helps us to observe these properties. And I think I can stop here. Thank you. Are there any questions? I have it's very nice work. Thank you very much. I wanted to add a little bit about the history. History here. Way before Badanin and Karachayev's work, Vasily Spopanikolo has done complete forward and even inverse spectral theory for Euler-Bin-Bernoulli beam equation. So it's not Vadanin and Karateev, but way before the first paper by Papay. First paper by Papanikolo was in 1995, and the most the latest about the inverse spectral theory was in 2004. So this is. And another is that for the second order operators, another study, which is definitely much simpler than yours, was done in our paper with Olaf Post 15 years ago about. Years ago, about, but certainly force order is trickier. For instance, one can have reducible Fermi surfaces like Vasilis Popanicolo showed, and it's much more complicated. So, again, it's actually nice work. Yeah, thank you for the contribution. Yeah, of course. Second order was done by you and POS. And actually, I can also mention quick, we have also worked far. Meshing quickly, we have also worked for my surface. I just removed it to save some time. And actually, what happened is exactly if we have contribution from both delta one and delta two, as we have in this second case, then the corresponding Fermi surface is reducible. Yes. But if we have something like on the left, the corresponding surface is irreducible. But it can be reducible even on a line, even without without. Without graphine structure. Okay, thanks. It's nice talk, nice work. Thank you. Are there any other questions? Thank you for your time coffee break, twenty-eight minute coffee break.
