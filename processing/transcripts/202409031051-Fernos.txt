I will be talking about the semi-synchronical theory of its person in Europe. I just want to explain what I mean by a semi-simple object before we get into the talk, because I'm not really going to define it later. I'm not really going to define it later. So, if you, according to Wikipedia, which has a semi-simple page, a semi-simple object is one that can be decomposed. It's a sum of simple objects. And I would add, moreover, that it's well-behaved with respect to inclusions and projections. So the outline of the talk is we're going to talk about very quickly delta hyperbolic spaces in Catzero and try to see them as sort of part of the same framework. Part of the same framework. We're going to introduce our target space for the representations that we're going to be looking at, which is called bot X, fancy X, where X is a product of delta hyperbolic spaces. We're going to talk about a cylindricity and examples, and then we'll discuss the TC alternative for this context, and then we'll talk about product decompositions, that is direct product decompositions, that's where this semi-simplicity. That's where this semi-simplicity comes in. And then we'll talk about what that means for the outer automorphism group of gamma. And this gives a partial resolution to a conjecture that Salah made less on R. Okay, so most of you know what this is. I just want to put it up on one slide. So what does it mean to be delta hyperbolic? It means whenever you have this geodesic triangle and you look at Triangle, and you look at the point that realizes the Gromov product, then these distances here and there, and all of those, this is coming from that, are all less than delta. And of course, we know that when we have a tree, delta equals zero is sufficient. On the other hand, we have over here, this is not quite the cat zero condition. You could ask whether it's Condition, you could ask whether it's equivalent. Maybe it is, maybe it's not. I suspect it kind of is, but nevertheless, I want to show this common kind of idea that we're comparing side links to what's happening basically in a quasi-tree versus in Euclidean space. Of course, the class of cat zero spaces is both inner products, whereas that's not the case for delta hyperbolic spaces. So, what is a non-space space? So, what is a non-positively curved group? We could debate that, but one two types of such groups are delta hyperbolic or catzero groups, and that just means that they admit proper co-compact actions on such a space. So, what is proper? Whoops, what happened? So, proper means that for every point and every radius, you have finitely many translates involved. And co-compact, of course, means. And co-compact, of course, means that the quotient is compact. So, what it means to be a proper co-compact, or rather, a group acting properly co-compactly on such a geometry means that you're a uniform lattice. And of course, these spaces and these groups are non-positively curved. So, what we want to think about here is to expand this universe of non-positive curvature, which we're all here to celebrate. And we're going to look at products of delta hyperbolic spaces. So, as a target group, we're going to allow ourselves to permute isometric factors. We'll look at the semi-direct product of the products of the isometry groups. And something to note is that this is the isometry group with respect to the L1 product on this product. Product. I don't know why I'm seeing myself and not the others. Do you want us to not see yourself? Yes. Like it should be showing. Well, I could just not fit nothing for you. Oh, well, it should be like the projector, right? No, it should be a project. Okay. Whatever. Okay. So note that all Coca-Pac lattices in the same ambient group are quite. Same ambient group are quasi-isometric. So, for example, the Brigham-Moses-Wise groups are quasi-isometric sweep products of three groups. And I'm just saying this because I know lots of people like their quasi-isometries, and I'm just saying maybe quasi-isometry is not always the best thing to consider if you want to retain interesting properties such as those. Um, okay. Okay, so I'm going to be acting by these automorphisms. What does it mean for such an action to be uniformly proper? Well, it just means that when you look at a ball, you have a uniform number of translates in that ball. If you want to say it's just proper, then you're going to drop the uniformity. And then it's non-uniformly proper if you really know that it's non-uniform. That it's non-uniform. On the other hand, on this right-hand side of the screen, we have a more technical notion of what is called asylumicity. I'm not really going to get too much into it, although I'd be happy to talk to you about it, and I'm sure there are many people present that are also experts in that. So, asylumicity should be thought of as a parallel to uniform properness, and then ambiguous uniform. And then ambiguous uniformity, eccentricity of ambiguous uniformity, should be thought of as a generalization of properness where it may or may not be uniform, I don't care. And then finally, non-uniformity is non-uniformity. Okay? So the philosophy here is that asylum is a generalization of being a copompact lattice. There's many reasons for this philosophy. This philosophy. And so a UA cylindricity is the generalization of just being a lattice. And we have the uniform or the non-uniform situation depending on whether you're in the sunset or in the ocean part of that diagram. I'll just note that if you really want an asylum action that is not actually proper, you need to be in the non-motivated compact universe. On really compact universe. The time is my talk end. So, thank you. Oh, perfect. Thank you for checking. It feels like it's just me. Okay, so what are some examples of groups that admit such actions? Okay, well, we have gamma, a finitely generated subgroup of esylon q bar. Now this is. SLNQ bar. Now, this is for non-positively curved spaces, not necessarily products of delta hyperbolic spaces. Maybe I'll just add if n equals 2, then we get an action on such an x. We also get rags and coxeter groups. For this, we have x, a product of the hybrid spaces. And a corollary to, I just realized. I just realized, oh well, it's too late. A corollary to Duba is that if you have a finitely generated subgroup in SU2 cross SU2 or whatever number of factors you would like, then it acts properly on a product of delta hyperbolic spaces. In fact, they are hyperbolic planes, hyperbolic three spaces, and trees. And trees. And so it is, those admit AU asynchronous actions. Of course, if we take just one factor, this is containing asynchronously hyperbolic groups, which is itself a very vast class, many argon groups, mapping class groups, relatively hyperbolic groups. The free product of any group would Z. I'm insisting here that G is not trivial. That G is not trivial because if it is, then I'll get an elementary action, and later I'm going to not want such elementary actions. By a result of petitensprianum, all HHGs, hierarchically hyperbolic groups, okay, again, I'm not thinking of products of abelian groups, but many, this class of groups contains many, if not all, Many, if not all, published groups, that's an open question. Many isylindrically hyperbolic groups again, and by result of Margolis, groups that are quasi-isometric to such a product of double hyperbolic spaces, limit groups, it's a vast class. Another source of examples are groups with property QT, and I think this is a good place to highlight that this is really. That this is really something that you should think of from a representation theoretic point of view because, oh, groups with property QT, that means that you act on a product of quasi-trees, and the action gives you quasi-isometrically embedded orbits. So, I think this is a good place to discuss the fact that while mapping class groups are asymmetrically hyperbolic and therefore act the Hyperbolic and therefore act asylum on one hyperbolic space. They also act AU asylum on a product of some finite number of quasi-trees, in fact, but delta hyperbolic spaces, and that these are two interesting properties about the group. And so rather than thinking about best representations or best actions, we want to sort of be inclusive and think of all of them. Of them. We also have subdirect products. Good source of examples there: our BRG Stallings and Bastina Brady.kernels. So this class is closed under finite extensions, it's closed under direct products, and it's closed under subgroups. And it's worth noting here that while F2 has finitely countably many subgroups, Countably many subgroups, which are actually all free. The product of F2 with F2 has uncountably many subgroups. So the complexity is really higher. So it's a really vast class. Who does not admit these actions? Right? Well, we have these really round groups like Grigor Tooth groups, burnside groups, etc. These are groups that have what is called hereditary property NI. Is called Hereditary Property NL, which is some work that my collaborator did with other people. And the upshot here is that all of these groups only admit elliptic and parabolic actions. So if this class of groups is so large, what can we really say about it? Well, we're not going to be able to say anything without restricting the action. Of course, every group acts trivially on a point. Every group acts trivially on a point. I actually think that's interesting. Okay, you can say it's not, but whatever, that's your taste, that's mine. And also, every countable group need not be finitely generated, acts properly by this horrible construction, which many of you might know already, but I have a nice picture, so I kept the slide. So I have a counselable group. So, I have a countable group. It acts on a graph properly. And then I'm going to create this kind of construction where I'm going to take my graph, I'm going to take its product with n, the natural numbers, and then I have two possible models here. Either I'm going to connect things that are further and further away as I move up, these points are all the same point at infinity, or I can rescale those levels exponentially and get this. And get this disk call model. It's worth noting here that this only has one point at infinity, as does that. Everybody else is in the space. Okay, so because all groups admit a elliptic action or a parabolic action, those are sort of trivial in a sense. So we want to exclude those. Exclude, we're going to be considering really. We're going to be considering really where the factor actions are general type. Let's talk now about the TS alternative. So, classical is the TS alternative for linear groups, which is from 1972. And it says for any linear group, either it contains a free group or, up to conjugation, it's upper triangular. And I really think this is a beautiful proof. If you're not familiar with it, I encourage you to. If you're not familiar with it, I encourage you to look at it. It has a lot of really nice math in it. So it's such a beautiful and important theorem that since then there have been many, many, many, many TETS alternatives, including by many people in this group and this audience. So we contribute to the TETS alternative narrative in this context for a cylinder. For a cylindrical actions. So no longer is it ambiguous uniformity. This is really the uniform, the actual uniformity, which is asylumricity. So we're going to assume the action is not elliptic, because again, if every group acts on a point, that would tell me nothing. So I have an asylumrical action that's not elliptic. Then either it contains a copy of F2, or of F2, or it's virtually z to the k where the bound of k is between 0 and z. And I guess 0 isn't achievable there since I assumed the action was monolithic. So here's a sketch of the proof. So in step one, we're going to apply the classification of actions for delta hyperbolic spaces since we're basically looking at the product of Basically, looking at the product up to finite index, we're looking at the product of disometry groups. We can project to each factor, and there we can ask what those actions are. So we show that for acylindricity, the elliptic and parabolic factors don't contribute to the acylindricity. So you can essentially ignore them or quotient them out while retaining acylindricity. Step two, if you don't have an F2, If you don't have an F2, of course, then you will have no general type factor. If you did have a general type factor, then you would get a copy of F2 that's essentially equivalent. So in step three, we show, well, what do we have left if we have no elliptic actions, no parabolic actions, and no general type actions for the factors? There's only two things left: there's lineal and quasi-parabolic. Quasi-parabolic. Quasi-parabolic implies, in particular, that there's a single fixed point at infinity. So we want to say if we have one fixed point at infinity, then we actually have another one, and therefore it's lineal. And that's exactly what we show, namely, if you fix one point at infinity, then you have an opposite. Yes. Oh, you're done. So now we have all the factors are lineal, so we can assume that they're quasi-line. So, we can assume that they're quasilines. Now, we have an asymmetrical action on a product of quasi-lines. We show that this is amenable by showing that every finitely generated subgroup has polynomial growth. This is a good place to highlight that I'm not assuming that the groups are finitely generated. So, it's amenable. We have fixed points at infinity in each factor. Therefore, we have the Boozman pseudo-character. The Boozman pseudo character, but actually it's amenable, so it's actually a character, namely it's a homomorphism into R. We then show that A cylindricity is preserved when you actually act on R to the D, and now you have an A cylindrical action on a locally compact space. That actually means it's proper, and you get your Z to the K. Let's move on to internal. To internal product decompositions. So I have a group gamma, and I'm looking at an internal direct product, right? So you might remember from algebra, there's a slight difference between internal and external direct products. We're going to say that this is a canonical product decomposition. If whenever I have another one, then I have the same number, and up to permutation, they're equal. They're equal. Or is it? They're actually equal. Not isomorphic, but equal. That's the difference between the internal versus the external. And it's strongly canonical if the same holds up to finite index, namely, if I look at a finite index subgroup and it has a product decomposition, then again, up to permutation, they're the same number, and it's actually the intersection. And again, here we have the quality number. And again, here we have the quality, not isomorphism. A good counterexample to where you don't have such a canonical product decomposition is given by this rag. And so here, I could exhibit it as a direct product of A would be C, but I can also exhibit it as a direct product of A with B and A C. Do you have an example of a canonical? Yes, F2. Well, and everything that I Well, and everything that I, F2 cross F2, for example. Yeah. And that's basically the theorem, so just one second. Okay, so non-example, and then for the example is like a rich box. So before I wasn't assuming it was finitely generated, now I am. That's important. So I have an AU asymmetrical action with general type factors. So all of the list of groups that I gave earlier, all of those. Subgroups that I gave earlier, all of those. And therefore, like under this hypothesis, there exists a characteristic subgroup A and gamma1, such that A is finite, and the index of gamma and gamma1, I think I wrote that backwards, gamma1 and gamma is finite. And modulo this A and passing to this finite index subgroup, which you can show is a necessary step. Which you can show is a necessary step, this admits a strongly canonical product decomposition. So the upshot here is that A is the amenable radical. Radical means that it's normal. So what I said earlier would apply for the T's alternative. If I have a normal subgroup that is a flat and it's preserving points at infinity, then the group also has to preserve those points, so it can't be general type. So it has to be finite. has to be finite. And then d is the number of factors in the product. That gives you a bound on the complexity and that's where you get the finite product decomposition. Okay, so what do we have from, let me come back here. So this canonical product decomposition is what I meant. Decomposition is what I meant earlier by semi-simple. This semi-simplicity descends to the outer automorphism group. So gamma is finitely generated again. It's acting AU acylindrically. That just means either it's uniform or non-uniform. I don't care. And it has general type factors. That's important. Then either, sorry, then gamma is virtually isomorphic to gamma prime. Isomorphic to gamma prime. This is what I gave in the previous slide: finite index, finite kernel. Again, those are necessary steps you can show, such that the outer automorphism group of gamma prime is virtually up to finite index because you may be able to permute isometric factors or isomorphic factors, is the product of the outer automorphism groups of that cadonical product dependition. So, as a corollary, we give a partial resolution to a conjecture by Salon. I'm not going to go into his hypotheses, but I will just say that they are nice and this is on the archive, so happy to discuss it with you, or you can look it up on the paper. We'll look it up in your paper, not in Salt's paper. Thank you. Yes, that's true. That's actually, yeah, so it's in our paper with Sahana Balasubramani. In our paper with Sahana Balasubramania, my collaborator. So, if gamma is quote unquote a nice HHG, then the outer automorphism group of it is virtually having the structure of what it would look like if it was a one-ended hyperbolic group. And what does that mean? It means that it fits into this kind of central, well, it is central, but a short exact sequence where you have this abelian kernel, and then it maps onto. And then it maps onto this finite product of pure mapping class groups. So, similar here is that we may fail this onto part of the exact sequence, but he's looking for an abelian kernel so that you inject, modulo that kernel, you inject in something like this. So, what's our partial resolution? Our partial resolution? Well, an HHG, none of whose maximal unbounded domains, I haven't defined HHG, it's a type of non-positively curved group. It has domains associated to them, and they are nested, some of them are nested within each other. There's a notion of a maximal unbounded domain, and there's finitely many of these. So, an HHG where none of those are quasi-lines, they're all Lines, they're all delta hyperlic spaces, so they're just general type spaces. So, none of whose domains are, maximal embedded domains are quasi-lines, satisfies Salat's conjecture if and only if the irreducible factors in its canonical product decomposition do. Moreover, what does it mean to be nice? Well, it implies we don't Implies we don't need quite all of his conditions of niceness, but it does imply that the group in question, again, under additional hypothesis of not having maximal unbounded domains being quasilines, under this additional hypothesis, we can show that the group in fact is a subdirect product in D many asymmetrically hyperbolic groups. D here is the number of Eries, which is what Is the number of Eries, which is what Petict and Spriano call the maximal unbounded domains. And if you're a Game of Thrones fan, that might make sense to you. Okay, moreover, the action of this HHG on that product of acyl nuclear hyperbolic groups is co-bounded. We weren't really sure how to implement this co-bounded thing, so maybe my first question to you is. To you is whether gamma is virtually a product here, up to finite index, finite kernel. Is it actually a product? And then I have some questions. Actually, there's a lot of open questions to be had here. So, one that came directly out of this work is: under what conditions is a subdirect product in a Is a subdirect product in a product of asymmetrically hyperbolic groups, for example, of finite index. So I'm a subdirect product. That means that I map, I'm contained in a subgroup, excuse me, I'm contained as a subgroup in a product, and I map onto all of those factors. When is it, up to finite index, actually a product? Because that would answer Silas's conjecture. Serves the last conjecture. So there's work of these authors listed here that say, well, if you look at all finite index subgroups and these rational homologies are finite dimensional, then that actually tells you you're virtually a product. So that's one question. And then in a separate direction, which groups, because it was such a vast Because it was such a vast group, a vast collection of groups that admit these actions, which groups admit an interesting action on a non-positively curved space, but don't admit a non-elementary action, non-elementary AUA syndrome action, on a non-positively curved space. So you might say, what does it mean to be non-elementary if you're just being really hand-wavy about what you mean by non-positively curved? That's for you to decide. So it's kind of a very You to decide. So it's kind of a very fuzzy question. In another direction, if you have examples, excuse me, if you have theorems and your theorems apply to certain types of groups, what happens when you look at products? What happens when you look at subgroups? Then, are there interesting properties that extend asylumricity or AU acylity? Aceylindricity or AU asylndricity. Because that was such a vast collection of groups, we'd really need some examples to be keeping in mind when we're looking at this question. So turning our attention to mapping class groups, in a work in progress, it seems that the mapping class group of a product of general, of hyperbolic surfaces is virtually the product of the mapping. Virtually the product of the mapping class groups, that's effectively because the mapping class groups are the outer automorphism groups of the finite index. So since the complexity of products and particularly their subgroups, is much larger, what can you say about the products of, excuse me, the subgroups of products of mapping class groups? Also, if gamma is not If gamma is not asylumrically hyperbolic, meaning it does not admit an asylum action on a single hyperbolic space, but it does admit a asylum action on a product. Can its outer automorphism group be infinite? We only know, well, not we only know. Maybe Elia has an answer to this question. But we do know that groups. But we do know that groups such as the Berger-Monchomosis Weiss groups, which are irreducible lattices in products of trees, have many nice or interesting properties. And among them is that the automorphism group is finite. And then finally is a technical question that was left over from our paper. And it has to do with commensuration of subgroups. Demonstration of subgroups and the types of actions that can happen in the factors. I'd love to discuss it with you. I couldn't fit it on the slide, but it is in the paper. So a resolution to this question would infer by work of butter from England sour, which was the whole reason we were looking at this commensuration, that for such a gamma, if it admits a A non-discrete lattice embedding, then more or less this ambient group G is either an S-arithmetic semi-simple group with rank one factors, actually, or, so that's a lot of information, or you have very little information in that it's a totally disconnected locally compact group. Well, I went a little faster than I intended, but thank you very much. Here's our Thank you very much. There is our classification. What did you mean by a non-discrete lattice and v? Oh, that it's just like you get any discrete countable group is a lattice in itself or another finite index of a group. Other questions? Like Elson came out now for groups. Well, so the immutable radical is finite. Oh, it's finite. When you have general type factors. Type factors. So, yes. So, the next step, there's sort of different directions here. So, first, with Riley Lyman, we are considering the case of actually, what do you get? So, I had to, sorry. So, here, I had to pass through this finite index slash finite kernel situation. So, we're answering the question of what happens if we don't do that. And then, And then there's also a separate question of what about the lineal factors and combining those. And so that's a good question that we haven't. Thank you. Now we have lunch and Now we have lunch and we resume at one.
