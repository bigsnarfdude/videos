So today I want to talk about certain correspondence of FW algebras and W super algebras based on several joint works with Thomas Krutik, Nauke General, Andrew Rinshaw, and Rio Sattle. Some post-it and some ongoing. So let me start with some background of this story, which is a certain trial phenomena of several vertex algebra. Of several vertex algebras. The prominent one is the toriality of principal super W algebra of type A, which enjoys a Feynman-Frank duality here with the famous duality relation together with GKO concept type construction generalizing the minimal model slays representation of a Virazoro. Representation of Virasoro, which enjoys this growing conditions. Some vertex algebras appear at the boundary of higher-dimensional QFTs with several boundary conditions. The most famous one, I think, is the universal affine vertex algebra at irrational levels appearing at the boundary of three-dimensional Chinese Simon theory. A guy-labjack physicist explained this duality as. This duality as certain duality, certain symmetries of boundary conditions for certain for the four-dimensional young-mill theory, Foot's diagram is depicted like this, which contains a three gauge group over four-dimensional space. We satisfied with three-dimensional hyperplanes. A hyperplanes together with three boundary conditions, which is called half a BPS interface of whose general parameter is P1 over Z, together with topological twist parameter P sine. And around these boundaries, we have two chance elements theories here, which speak at the corner here. Corner here with a third boundary conditions. Then we get the certain affine cosets of W super algebras at this corner, that's the name of vertex algebra at the corner. And these boundary conditions enjoy the action of PSO2Z, which contains in particular other three elements which rotate. Which rotates these three boundaries. Under this action, the physics conjecture that the vertex algebra appearing at the corner will be preserved. And this triality is a case of a zero, zero, and n case. And this triality phenomena is recently proven by inverse generality by Thomas Krutik and Andrew. Thomas Krotik and Andrew Rinscho. And I want to start with the second easiest example, which is conjectured files by Fagin and Semikadov, which is 0, 1, and n plus 1 case. In this case, the duality means that we consider the sub-regular W algebra of type A, which contains Heisenberg vertex algebras. Vertex algebras. Take it the Heisenberg coset. Then it is isomorphic to the Heisenberg coset of principal W super algebras of this type. And the duality relation is always the same as the Franken-Frank duality, and we exclude one level, whereas Heisenberg vertex algebra degenerates to a commutative vertex algebra. The very beginning case of this series is n equal to Of this series is n equal to one case, which is actually implied by the Kazama-Suzuki-Coset construction of n equal to super-conformal algebra, which is as a name of principal W super algebra here, which is weakly generated by two odd primary fields, G plus and G minus, of conformable C over 2, which is embedded into the tensor product of alpha SO2. So, how to prove this duality? One is the characterization of these W algebras, which I will talk about later. But at this moment, I want to talk about it in terms of refidializations and screen charges. These two double algebras are embedded into two affine vertex algebras, which is grading zero subalgebra in the good grading for these two W super algebras, which is called the mirror map. Then we can use the Wakimoto representation, which embeds a fine vertex algebra in terms of a certain In terms of certain differential operators, in this case, affine SL2 embeds into a beta gamma system times Lanc1 Heisenberg Verdex algebra. And G011 case is embedding into the BC system times Lanc1 Heisenberg-Verdex algebra. But this gives us certain free figurializations, but we cannot compare them directly because they use A day uses a different free field algebra. So we use another further embedding which embeds a bit lamp system into a certain lattice vertex algebra, which gives us embedding of a sub-regular W algebra into the certain lattice vertex algebra times a Heisenberg vertex algebra. And I think it coincides with D1. Coincides with the one Zachary talked about two days ago, I think. For the principal W super algebra, a BG system is identified with lattice vertex algebra of Z, so we have a similar free field realizations. By taking the Heisenberg cosets, we can exclude all the momentum other than one. So the Heisenberg coset of these W algebras are embedded into Heisenberg. Are embedded into Heisenberg values algebra. And all these steps at the image is described by screwing charges, so we can use the argument of Fay and Frank. Let us describe this Heisenberg-Burdox algebra together with screen charges in terms of weighted linking diagrams. And the sub-regular And the sub-regular SLN plus one has a thinking diagram of this kind. And the good grading corresponding to this sub-regular W algebra has a grading 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2. The nodes corresponding to 2 give us screening charges for the mirror map here. And the node corresponds to the The node corresponding to zero corresponding to the Wakimoto representations. And a similar thing happens to the principle of SL1 slash n plus one. But at this moment, we don't have any identification of these thinking diagrams. But by using the embedding of beta-grammar system into the lattice fart X algebra, we have a Satisfied X algebra, we have still another fermionic screening here. Then, after that, we have a correspondence of weighted thinking diagrams. So, we can just apply the Fagin-Frankl's argument to prove the Feynman semi-cut of duality. This argument is quite nice because the previous Kazama Suzuki concept construction. The Sama Suzuki coset construction can be generalized to this setting by using this lattice vertex algebra, which resembles this one. So I want to talk about how this coset construction can be used to deduce certain correspondence for their module categories. First, let us consider the algebra case where Case where the Langman-Heising-Berg vertex algebra decomposes these W super algebras into certain bunch of fork modules. And C plus and C minus means multiplicity space with that is the space of highest weight vectors inside it. Inside it. The coset construction implies that these multiplicity space are isomorphic as a module of the Feynman semi-cut of algebra. So one natural question is can we interchange these two Fokker modules more directly so that we can transform sub-regular W algebra to the principal W super algebra by changing this. Algebra by changing this one to this one? The answer is yes, and given by the relative semi-infinite cohomology. In this case, we take the cohomology for GL1. Let me explain this results of so a large H means non-digit Heisenberg fields and square root of minus one. square root of minus one of h means that the op e is just a minus of the h and we take the two fourth modules whose highest weight is a and b then we have a diagonal action of current algebra of gl1 and and we consider the relative semi-ficient cohomology of this loop algebra in terms of gl1 then the cohomology almost Then the cohomology almost vanishes except for a zero. And in that case, the zero cohomology is non-zero only for A plus B is going to be a zero. And in that case, the only non-trivial cohomology class is a tensor product of highest rate vectors. So we can use this result so that we just kill this POC module by this. Module by this opposite one and pair it with the other side of it, a fork module. So that we can convert the sub-regular W algebra to the principal W super algebras at the level of module of Heisenberg coset times Heisenberg vertex algebra. And we can also use the same thing for from the super algebra to the non-superalgebra. What's surprising is What's surprising is that this bunch of Fock module has a structure of vertex algebra, which is indeed lattice VOA times Heisenberg vertex algebra, which actually appeared in the Kazama-Suzuki coset construction. So we can compare the vertex algebra structure at the level for the relative semi-cohomology, and one can show that they are isomorphic. This construction is quite This construction is quite nice because we can use the same strategy for all the modules by replacing the Heisenberg vertex algebra by its Fock modules. And a precise categorical setting for the module is those ones which decompose into a Fock module as a module of Heisenberg-Vadex algebra. module of Heisenberg vertex algebra, which decomposes into direct summaries of a moment of smaller subcategories whose weight lambda runs through C over Z. Z corresponding to the eigenvalues of H for the sub-regular W algebra itself. Then one can show that using the same Can show that using the same argument for the data semi-homology, we can show that there is a categorical equivalence for each component. And moreover, by using the fork intertwiners between these two fork modules, you can construct intertwining operators. Intertwining operators from the other ones. And indeed, this is a functory isomorphism between the space of intertwining operators. So this means that the fusion rules, even for the irrational setting, will be isomorphic. That is weight-wisely equivalent. So let us compare these two categories at the level of rational case so that we can compute the fusion ranks more explicitly. And the main ingredient here is a level bank duality between sub-regular W algebra and principal W algebra, which is proven by Crutik and Lyncho generally. Critic and Laurential generalizing the level rank duality of paraphernalia vertex algebra and principal W algebra. That is, we take the exception sub-regular W algebra at the level of exceptional level and take the Heisenberg coset. Then it is isomorphic to the principal W algebra whose length are parameterized level here, whose level are parameterized. Food level are parameterized length Q. And this principle W algebra is quite nice because its grotendic ring of module category is isomorphic to the original affine vertex algebra. Then we can decompose the sub-regular and principal W super algebras in terms of this principal W algebra times Heisenberg vertex algebra. And indeed, Heisenberg vertex algebra grows up. Vertex algebra grows up to a certain lattice view appearing here. And moreover, the modules of principal W algebra appearing in the branch are all simple currents. So in this rational case, we can use a general theory of simple current extension by lattice to get the fusion rings of sub-regular and principal W super chip class. Algebras. First, we start with the extension from principal W algebra to the sub-regular W algebra, which describes, which is written in terms of affine fusion and lattice fusions. And by using the level rank duality for the fusion link of affine vertex algebras, we find that the Grotantic link of That the Grotantic ring of this sub-regular W algebra is indeed isomorphic to the affine fusion ring here. And this result is proven by Arakawa and Fan Akelam when n is even integers by using the Fairing formula of UGH. Secondly, we use the Kazama-Suzuki coset construction here and its inverse to get the relation of fusion rings. Relation of fusion rings between sub-regular W algebra and principal W algebras. And this isomorphism is indeed obtained in that way. Let me explain a bit about this isomorphism. So a sub-regular W algebra is embedded in the tensor product of a principal W super algebras times a negative different vertices whose branching rule is. Whose branching rule is certain simple current extensions of sub-regular W algebra times lattice fat X algebra. This Arbian group is the order of lattice fat X algebra there. And the tensor product is taken over this smaller Abian group, which parameterize the simple current extensions. Then, but the simple The simple by using a simple current extensions, simple modules are identified. That's why we take the tensor product of this grouping. And this parameterizes all the twisted module for the tensor product. So we can take the invariant ones so that we take the local module for the subgregate average algebra and vice versa. And vice versa. That's why we have there is a common grouping here, and the smaller grouping has a dual relation inside this algebra, this aberrant group. That's one way of seeing the duality of module categories at the level of Groton degree ring. Let me generalize. Let me generalize this picture to all the Foucault-type W super algebras. Here we have five families of Foucault type W algebra. The Faky semi-cutoff case fits into the first line with M is equal to one. Let me explain this logo. This W algebra is type SLN plus M. The first N And the first n, which parameterize SLN, corresponding to the choice of an important element, which is the principal important element of SLN. And then we obtain the W algebra, which contains a fine vertex algebra for GLN inside it. And then we have the affine cosets of these two algebras. Causes of these two algebras, which are isomorphic. That is a Gaiot, a duality of Gaiot-Lapchak proven by Crutik and Linshaw. And we have a similar foot type, similar duality for the also sympathetic cases for C C and B D D. A C and D is a maximum affine subversion inside it. And we have a B case and O case here. A B case and O case here, a Fourier's isomorphism is crossed in this way. All this Fouri-type W super algebra has a very simple structure because of the simple decomposition of the original Lie algebra in terms of these two mutual commuting Lie sub algebra. That is, aside from Lie sub algebras, the only branch The only branch coming from the natural representations. Accordingly, the principal of the corresponding W algebra decomposes into a tensor product of the affine coset times affine plus certain white modules corresponding to this natural representation and its dual. And indeed, this W algebra decomposed as Algebra decomposed as decomposed into a dike sum of while modules here whose highest weight runs all the irreducible finite dimensional representations. For the super algebra side, we have a very similar decomposition rules here, except for the change. Except for the change of parity here. And accordingly, we have a very similar decomposition rules here, except for the parity reversing phenomena. From here side, the Gaiotrapture duality implies that these machines space are all isomorphic as a module of the comma affine cosets. Affine cosets and only the only difference is the parity of viral modules. So we can consider the same thing as the Fagin semiconductor setting. So that the gluing object is again the dual of the original one, which is type A plus here. And to get the A minus, we take the We take the we pair it with a while module appearing is appearing in A minus. Then one can ask whether the W super algebra is isomorphic to the derivative semi-fit homology of the other side of W algebra times the growing object. And one can also ask the same question from super algebra to the non-superalgebras. The non-super algebras. So we get the two gluing objects here. It turns out that these two objects have a common shape that is the extensions of two copies of a wire module for GLM. And in this, by using the decomposition of GLM into SLM and the diagonal GL1, it decomposes into this way. Into this way. A first growing condition is like this. Looking at the lowest conformal weight subspace here, here, and here, we find that very similar thing appears in the classical setting. That is the Peter-Wyrlm of the function space of GLM. And indeed, one can consider the CQ. Can consider the C equal to the zero case, which is corresponding to a certain degenerate lattice vertex algebra. And indeed, that coincides with the chiral differential operators of GLM. Therefore, the remaining case, which is C is not equal to zero, it should be related to the quantum coordinate ring of GLM. And Moriwaki is working. Is working on this construction. Let me give you one example, which is C is equal to one and M is equal to two. In that case, we have a very explicit construction given by one of the exceptionally super algebra called D21 alpha, which contains three copies of SL2 here, here, and here. Extended by the tensor three tensor product of natural representations. So we have the same decomposition rule here. So I can see that the growing object in that case is d to alpha. This algebra also decomposes into the OSP1 slash two and SO3. That gives us a growing object for the B and O case. And all case. So one can ask the same question and get a result, which is work in progress now, which means that the W super algebra can be constructed from non-super W algebras paired with certain grouping objects and vice versa. Then one can take some fine courses. Then one can take a fine coset to get the duality of the original fagging, sorry, a guide to abstract duality. Technically, at the moment, we need to take the digital for the BO and CC and OB case because of the difference of V group O N and S O N. But we can remove the detail before there and This orbital there and get the desired duality. Let me finish with a remark on how these Kanye algebra should be think of. That is, for example, BOK's Kanye algebra should be related to the quotient of coordinate link of home space for the natural representations, which decompose as a multiplicity free representation. Multiplicity free representations. In general, associative algebra, which has an action of two super algebra G1 and G2, are decomposing into multiple T3 representations. Then, we see that these algebra serve as gluing objects between Taser categories for quantum groups and vertic superalgebras. The candidates can be found in the classical setting of The classical setting of Howard duality and pit-evalues or its generalizations. So we have a bunch of agreeing objects between affine vertex superalgebras or quantum supergroups so that we can take certain correspondence phenomena between several W superalgebras. Thank you very much.
