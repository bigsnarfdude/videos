Okay, but when you think wrong and then scrolling. So, good morning. Can the people in the virtual world hear us or hear me? Carlos? Well, good morning, everybody. Ah, good, good. Thank you for answering. I don't know who will answer, but thank you. Hi now. Hi now. Ah, Peter. Oh, so good morning, everybody. My name is Bernard Oribe, and let me first do this. So the organizer of this workshop mainly started by Carlos Segovia and Eric, who's taking a long time shorting, but Eric and Carlos were the ones somehow taking this initiative to make this Congress happen. They started in 2021, if I'm not mistaken. 2021, if I'm not mistaken, they did the application. And of course, they have had the help of many others, Colleen and Rolando, myself. But I would like to thank the locals, Rita Rolando Kitche, I believe, is here. Are you here in Oaxaca? Yeah, because I'm sure they helped. But most importantly, Carlos Egoia has been the ones now doing the difficult job of making this thing happening. You know, if you organize a conference, you know that behind the scenes, there's a lot of work. So, Carlos is the. There's a lot of work, so Carlos is the one that's been doing the work, and Carlos is a local, so he lives in Oaxaca. So he can show us around hopefully someday. One day, good. So Carlos put me as the first speaker, so I somehow started thinking, what should I talk? And what I will try to do is to give some sort of glimpse of an idea of what has been around since many years in Since many years, in equivariant Bordism or equivariant generalized cohomology theories, but with a specific aim to understand manifolds with actions, manifolds with actions, or varieties with actions. So at the beginning, I will talk about our joint work really quick with Eric and Carlos. By the way, here is Eric Samperson, another one of the organizers. And Colleen, who is there, also one of the organizers. And then I will try to. I will try to tell you some short story about something that were done some years ago in other cohomology theories, and then I'll shift the gears towards algebraic geometry. And what I want you to see is that there is a lot of relations going around in between topology and algebraic geometry that I believe and many of us believe they deserve to be studied and they deserve to be thought of. So, but I'll start quick for the people that don't somehow. Don't somehow know much about this borderism. All through all my talks, I will be talking about groups that are compact. Most of them will be finite groups. And I will most of the times concentrate on manifolds with a unitary structure, which by that I mean a manifold that if you stabilize the tangent bundle, oh, I need to point, you stabilize the tangent bundle, then you may endow it with an almost complex structure. Then you may endow it with an almost complex structure. So, this is somehow why do we do this? Because this gives us a very nice, perhaps simpler topological structure to study rather than just having a manifold by itself, which is very difficult. So, we put some restrictions on the manifold that we study, and they will be of this type on which we could bring a lot of the complex geometry to us. We will put some cooler relations on manifolds that are going to be compact and oriented and whatnot. And the Coulomb's relation will be. And the covalence relatio will be this one that I put in here: namely, two manifolds will be coordinate if you can somehow embed them as the boundary of a manifold with one dimension extra. Somehow the little drawing explains more, the little drawing is, you've seen it, M1 in the left, M2 on the right, and you put some one-dimensional manifold, a manifold with one dimension extra in between. And we can, of course, study those sorts of borders. Study those sorts of bordisms also in a universe, no, in a space X. So, what we will study, what we will try to study, and will appear in different disguises, is this equivalently the Bordism ring. So, what we do is we take manifolds of dimension n with an action of a group. Again, think of it as a finite group, and we will just get the set of equivalence classes given by this body. Classes given by this Bordism relation. This is a set. Then we just put the disjoint union and we make them into a group. And then we put them all together, all dimensions, and we make this graded group. And this graded group, you can also do the cross product of manifolds, and it becomes a graded ring. And now you like it as algae as you like algebra, you may think of it as some algebraic gadget. But if you want to think geometrically, these are the these are. These are manifolds up to borders and what appears in here. So you can also think geometrically. Now, the point is that to study this object here, which again, in my point of view, I'm thinking of it as manifolds up to the Bordeaux relation. This is what I'm thinking in my head all the time, but nevertheless, I'm going to use an algebraic language to describe it. It is a And it is a module over the over the board is a ring without any decoration in it. Namely, these are the unitary manifolds, no group on it. And of course, you can take a manifold without any action and do the product with a manifold with an action. And then you have an extra manifold with an action. And then you have a module structure from one to the other. And the idea is to somehow understand these gadgets. There is one way to study it is simply to try to get your Study it is simply to try to get your manifolds by themselves and try to see whether a manifold bounds at a manifold with one dimension extra or not, doing it with your preferred tools of geometry. But there is another way to do it, which is using these spaces, spectrum. But the idea nevertheless is completely geometrical behind it. It's completely geometrical. It's very nice. So it turns out that to understand these manifolds up to the border. These manifolds after the Bourdesian relation, you could just translate this question to a homotopy theoretic question, which is to calculate the homotopy groups of specific spaces. These spaces are the TOM spaces or TOM spectrum, which you simply calculate or define the classifying space or the Rasmannian of n-planes in an infinite space. You take the associated vector bundle in here, and what you do is you do the one-point compactification. You get the disk bundle. Compactification to get you get the disk bundle, and then you take the sphere bundle and compactify it in one point. And these spaces very nicely fit into some spectrum. But the point is that if you do some very nice transversal intersection, when you have a sphere mapping to one of these spaces with a very nice transversal intersection with a zero section, you get a manifold. And these are the manifolds that appear on the left-hand side. So the idea here is somehow we're dealing with a geometrical problem. We're dealing with a geometrical problem, but somehow there is a homotopic theoretic way to try to solve it. This ring, that is the unitary Bordesian ring, was shown by Milner and Novikov to be, as an algebra, to be a polynomial algebra generated by even-dimensional generators. Whenever you tensor with the rationals, you may take the projective spaces as the generators. So, the way to think this is that, of course, this is. To think this is that, of course, these spaces don't bound, and there are generators, and there is no way to make them bound, even if you put many copies of them. But because of the nice structure of this ring, it somehow gives an idea that there's something special because this ring is very nice, it's a nice polynomial algebra. Now, the point is that since we can define these gadgets here with a little g and it's a Gadgets you with a little g and it's a module over this algebra. Then, then one question that one can ask: well, what is the structure of the equivariant one with respect to the non-equivariant one since you have a very nice algebra? Now, in the geometrical sense, the question itself is again as in the beginnings, namely that you have a manifold and you want to see whether it bounds or not, but you could also try to see whether you can solve this question homotopically. And this is an idea. Homotopically. And this is an idea that was put forward by Tom Dick. And again, if I'm saying something wrong, Paul, tell me, let me know. It was an idea by Tom Dick, which is somehow to mimic the construction constructed by Tom, but now putting a declaration. And the decoration is that you need to keep the action of the group. So you do a universal principle UN bundle, but you allow all the group actions to be inside. So this is some sort of a universal principle UN. Of a universal principle UN bundle on which you allow all group actions to be there. Yeah, Kitsi. I didn't do with the reference space. Well, you just simply, since this is geometrical, you simply have manifolds lying in X and G acts on X also. So you want your borders to be somehow embedded in X, everything embedded in X. So I didn't define it, but it was somehow in the first. So, I didn't define it, but it was somehow in the first picture. But you should simply imagine that whatever you have here, an X is that whatever your bordisms are, they need to be swimming in the swimming pool of X. And good. So there is a homotopical version. They put a lot of letters, but these letters may not do anything if you somehow not go inside to it. But you do exactly the same as Tom construction if you have a specific universal space. The universal space is the same idea. Of space is the same idea. You just simply take all possible irreducible representations of your group, you put infinitely many of them, you take the Grasmanian, and that's exactly this space here. And then you have an associated bundle, and you do the same construction of doing the one-point compactification. And then you just put them in some specific gadget, and you can take this limit where what it says here is that you do a limit of all irreducible. Do a limit of all irreducible representations, of all representations if you want. And this is just the sphere bundle of the representation. I mean, you take the representation and you just compactifying one point, it's a sphere. And of course, you do everything equivariantly. And whatever this is, this is what is called the homotopic equivariant unitary Bordism groups. It may look complicated, you haven't seen it the first time, but somehow it's a stabilization. It's the right object to start to stabilize the. Object to start to stabilize the question. But you need not only to stabilize in trivial representation, as I said at the beginning, you need to stabilize on all possible representations. So it's a stable version. And this is an equivariant homotopy homology theory. And the point is that, of course, we have the same map that we have before, that Tom used to show what are the borders and groups of manifolds. But the point is that if we take But the point is that if you take the G out, this gives us an isomorphism of cohomology theories. But if you put the G in, somehow the geometrical one will not be equivalent to the homotopical one. And this is interesting in some sense. It's already interesting that the two sides are different. So somehow there are... What is that one would expect? One would expect that the geometrical objects map injectively into the homotopical ones. One would expect that. But so far, that's. Would expect that, but so far that hasn't been proven. Why this way hasn't it been proven in some sense in generality? Because the left-hand side is difficult to calculate, the right-hand side is difficult to calculate, so we don't know exactly what are either side. We know some cases, specific cases specifically for abelian groups, but in general, it's not well known what happens on the left nor what happens on the right. On the right, there are objects of negative degree, which are the Euler classes of the representations. One can simply One can simply take a representation, the sphere bundle, one take a point, and somehow this gives an object with negative degrees. And somehow, in the right-hand side, we have much more somehow a structure that in the left-hand side we don't have. So in some sense, we know that we have this map, but this map is part of the question that I would like to put forward today: that is, you have manifolds with the G-action, you send them to this homotopical version, and we don't know exactly. To this homotopical version, and we don't know exactly what happens only in specific cases. But as I said, we don't know what is the left, we don't know what is the right. And thinking the left, think of dimension four, for example. What are the manifolds that are unitary with a g-action that do not bound? Well, we don't know exactly. So what somehow has been, it was put forward, this is many years ago, this is like 40, 50 years ago, was Was that by calculations, by just simply calculating these rings, that whenever you put an abelian group as the group you want to study, then the objects that you get, so the Aquium Bordism ring, it turns out to be a free module over the unitary Bordism ring, or the unitary polynomial algebra that I just said, and moreover, concentrated only on even-dimensional generation. Concentrated only on even-dimensional generators. So, this means that all dimensional manifolds, whenever they have an action and is unitary, they bound. So, many things you can obtain out of these results already, out of geometrical statements. But the way somehow this is done is somehow case by case. You go, you take a cyclic group, then you take the product of cyclic groups, and so on. And it's somehow difficult, of course, any procedure that is just somehow. Of course, any procedure that is just somehow trying to get all possible finite groups by going by classes. But in these somehow simple classes, then this is what happens. And I put here but because of course we did something and Sophie did something that I will tell in a second that somehow derailed somehow some specific idea. And so this led me, and this was six years ago, and I just simply did, took some sentences on papers that were there. Papers that were there, and because we were thinking about these questions, and I thought, why is this not written in such a nice way that everybody can notice what is this question? And I simply put forward this question, which was already there in the air, but tomorrow was like 30 years ago, was written or 40 years ago, was forgotten perhaps by many people. And I simply put it up again, which is to put a conjecture that it was calculated specifically. That it was calculated in a specific group, which is the conjecture that this equivalent Borders and ring is a free module over the Bordesian ring on even-dimensional generators. Based on what? Based on the calculations that were done before. So far, all the cases were positive in that sense. And I just simply put it like this. And of course, one can change here and one can put the homotopic theoretical one. It's the same question applied, say, same questions apply. And I just bring. And I just bring back what are these sentences embedded in papers? And it was in 1980, because of specific calculations. In 1980, it says that it was already an old question, that it was forgotten, that why doesn't this happen? Then in 1996, in this nice book of Peter May, also appeared the question that it should be, but already it starts going downwards, no? Because at the beginning was a nice positive question. Beginning was a nice oppositive question, then it starts going downwards. That is perhaps not so optimistic. Um, and then in Greenleas, I may, when they show the localization principle, that it goes even further down, then maybe not. Nevertheless, there was no way to disprove it at the time, although now there's ways to disprove it. So he has a nice way to disprove it. But curiously so, at the time, nobody realized how to disprove it. And of course, Peter Lanverio, who perhaps is talking here, is such a Lambero, who perhaps is talking, he's such a positive energy. He's always positive. So he tells me, congratulations in bringing anyway. And so, what is some sort of the things that are the principle guiding here? So, you can always localize at fixed points. And everything here is geometrical. If you localize at fixed points, you take a manifold. All these things are letters. But you take a manifold, take a look at the fixed point set of a specific group, and take at the normal bundle. And that information tells you a lot. So much that if So much that if you just do that for every subgroup or a conjugacy class of subgroup, you obtain an isomorphism. Namely, if you only want the non-torsion invariance of the Borism ring, well, you can just detect them out of the information on the normal structure. So some of you might think I'm done. This is it, because this I know how to calculate, because these are just Bordison groups of Grasmanians. And the Bordison group of Grassmannians, I know how to calculate. Just churn classes, appropriate chain classes and whatnot. Chain classes, appropriate chain classes, and whatnot. So, problem done if we don't want about torsion class. I remember I was a student of Alejandro many years ago, and he told me once, we only care about torsion classes. Okay. So, if the evenness conjecture were true, already this would be an injected map, if it were true, because it would be if it's a free module, or if it's a free module, then this directly is already injected. module then this directly is already injective and if it's injective then one might think and then take okay take all possible manifolds with a free action here is the manifolds with a free action up to free bordism and of course you can just simply send them to the manifolds on which you don't really care so much about whether they have fixed points or not and most of these classes are torsion there are a lot of classes here that are torsion but since this is free they must all bound and so if the evenness conjecture is true a simple and small concept True, a simple and small consequence is all three actions bound in some sense, in a specific sense. And so that was somehow a question that I put Carlos some years ago that just, well, this should be working already at the level of surfaces. Surfaces with three actions, if the conjecture is true, they almost bound. Anyway, so these events conjecture were done for many cases, but then it was Eric who came with a very nice. Eric, who came with a very nice geometrical construction some years ago, and Sophie with a very nice homotopical construction that somehow derailed the conjecture. So some years ago, I came to Oaxaca, Carlos asked me, what do I do in my surfaces? And ask him, why don't you ask these questions yourself? And so he started asking the question whether a surface with a free action of an abelian or symmetric ordahedral group bound. And he showed in a very geometrical sense how they bound. How they bound in a very combinatorical way, very, very smart. And then he put some paper in the web, and then Eric read it. I suppose that's the story. And Eric noticed, oh, but I know how to solve this problem in general because of what he was doing in low-dimensional topology. And this is how I got to know Eric. And he had a very nice construction. And so, this is the idea of Eric. I'm not going to tell you the idea of Eric. Eric will tell you the idea. I tell you the result of Eric. So the idea is you take. So the idea is if you take, if you put here manifolds, now I change the little decoration, and it's just oriented manifolds. So these are manifolds with a free action up to the Borism relation in the free world. And you want to see here what are the three-dimensional manifolds whose boundary has a free action, but we don't care what happens in the inner part. It may have fixed points in the inner. And of course, these are the manifolds whose boundary is a free action. If you take the kernel, these are the manifolds with the free action that simply can. With a free action that simply cannot bound. And so, what Eric showed in a very nice geometrical way is that this object here can be taken to be the second homology of the group, which is isomorphic to this one. Mod out the toral classes, namely classes that come from a torus. You simply take all the possible torus that live in VG, and then you mod out those classes, and whatever is left, that's what the co-kernel is. Namely, any class that is not here, it doesn't bound. And Eric also noted that this group is what. And Eric also noted that this group is what is called the Bogomolo multiplier. This is a homological version. And of course, brings up as ideas: what's the relation between that and this? Then I just simply put it into the machine that I had built or I had thought of. And if you put it in the machine, all these constructions of Veric, then one sees that the torsion part of the Bordism group at the level two is all this product of Mogomolovs. And these Mogomolovs are take all the subgroups and simply take these quotients, these Weyl groups. And if you have. These quotients, these while groups, and if you have Bogomolovs there, then you have all this torsion. Good. So, in some sense, it disproves this conjecture. Well, I'm just putting a group. So, you want to see a group that already does this, that Carlos will mention later. This is the smallest group and all the isoclinic class. Then you just not focus so much on the group itself. Nevertheless, you just calculate the torsion part of this borderism group on Z2, and there is a specific surface that cannot bound in this equivarian setup. Good. Setup. Good. So this evening conjecture is false, but of course, you may restate the question: is what types of group do does Tomau, which groups have no torsion in their Bordism groups? Which are the groups? But of course, you can make the question in several disguises. You can just, what is exactly this ring? What is exactly this group? What is exactly this ring? What is the homotopical one? Many, many questions that we don't know how to answer. Questions that we don't know how to answer yet, but that have specific geometrical conclusions. So, let me just go forward to other cohomology theories. And this is not my work. This is again old, old, nice classical work. So, let's about complex-oriented cohomology theories. These are homology theories that have a specific class that should just think of it as the first-gen class in some sense, which is homology theories that have specific objects that generates this second homology. This second homology of the projective space. This is the Fertian class. Think of it. Which are these theories? Many. But among them, I'm going to mention these four: MU, which is the homotopical Bordism, the Brown-Peterson, which is some sort of localization of this one, and the Moravaki theory, which is a further, further refinement or localization of the Brown-Peterson homology. Why am I going there? Because again, some questions were stated at some point about these theories. So the Brown-Peterson homology. The brown peter cohomology you localize at the prime p, this the mu, and it gives us again a very nice polynomial algebra again. But you need to somehow look at the degree of the generators. It's of course related to the degree p. This is coming from a very nice, beautiful idea of Quillen. The point is that if you localize at the prime p, the unitary borism, you might just concentrate on the Brown-Peterson cohability theory. Again, so it's just this polynomial algebra, again, with some. This polynomial algebra again with some generators. So, if you want to do p-local calculations, then this is the place to do it. And Peter Land Bever showed that there is a specific Cunet isomorphism for abelian groups, and he showed that the brown-protected homology of any abelian group splits, and somehow you can just get this very nice statement. There are many things under the rock, but this is just a formal series, and I'm using his formal group law associated to it. The formal group law associated to the cohomology theory. But what I'm trying to say is that in this universe, the cohomology of a group is not complicated. And I put in quotes because, of course, it's complicated, but it's not as cohomology of an abelian group. If you just calculate the cohomology of two copies of a cyclic group, it's difficult already. It goes like this, and you don't know exactly what the things are. But if you go and look in here, no, it's quite simple. It's just a tensor probe. So what it's telling us that this cohomology. So what it's telling us that these cohomology theories are better for understanding groups than just cohomology, because it's very nice splitting in some sense. Of course, you need to understand this part and whatnot, but somehow you can just have a very nice coordinate isomorphism. Then there is the Morava-K theory, which is a further refinement of reviews of the previous one. So let me go backwards. You see, there are infinitely many variables in bound-putramic homology. You just take one, just one of these variables, and somehow get rid of the rest. And there is a way to construct a spectrum that Molava. Construct a spectrum that Morava somehow did it, just simply localize at one of those ones and you invert it. And it's a simpler, smaller homology theory, but of course, it has the flavor, it has the border. It's a little part of bordism. Nice thing is that, of course, it has Kudith. And because of that, then you can calculate easily. And then one can see what is exactly the formal group law associated to the class, and in this case, Associated to the class, and in this case, it's quite nice to calculate it, which is this class. And again, if you take a bunch of copies of the acyclic groups again using this, then you get similar somehow structures before, but of course, a lot simpler because there is just one variable and it's inverse. It's a lot simpler because now it's a polynomial algebra-divided sum generator. Again, what is the message here? These cohomology theories are better for groups rather than cohomology. Now, so one could Now, so one could of course say the evenness conjecture also applies for these cohomology theories. And so for the homotopic albordism, is the cohomology oh am I saying this correct Sophie here has to correct my first sentence here. If I'm not, I'm not sure whether it does it or not, because I'm putting MU of BG. of BG and this second sentence I'm not so sure but but if you if you put mu upper g not not not mu of b g but the equivalent one not the not the cohomology of bg then it is indeed a free module in certain cases but and that's sophistic perhaps that we should tell us about it there is specific group of this uh group that somehow destroys the the idea Destroys the idea. So there are some classes there that somehow don't behave as nicely as you might think. And in the Brown-Peter homology, of course, highly related to a mu, it was calculated by all these groups that again, the Brown-Peter homology of the classifying space of these groups is all in even dimensions. And again, in K-theory, and this is related to the work of Hopkins-Kunt-Ravenel, the questions they put was more on the side of let us see whether the more Let us see whether the Moravaque theory of the classifying spaces is only concentrated in even degrees. It's even, it's less somehow difficult to see that rather than that it's a free module. And it turns out that they said they constructed some class of groups with a specific definition that they called them good groups. And if the group was good, then the Moravake theory of that group was concentrated in even dimensions. And these groups consisted in several, and there are some others that. And several, and there are some others that are on this list. But the thing is, Igor Chris in 1991, from the time, constructed a group again, subgroup of this Chevrolet group, that destroyed this conjecture, namely that there is some odd classes in the Moravake theory of these groups. What is appearing again is some sort of difficulty, or one could put it positively. There are nice things of these groups. There are some things of these groups that somehow. There are some things of these groups that somehow is not appearing, it's not detected by the abelian part. But let me tell you somehow what's going on in this idea of whenever we're calculating the cohomology of a finite group. So we might take only the abelian subgroups and we might localize or localize, restrict. We take the orco-homology theory of the quivarian space and we may restrict to all possible abelian subgroups. Groups. And if one is lucky, then this map is injective. But if one is not lucky, then some things are missing here. Nevertheless, if we just divide by the degree of the group, we get an isomorphism. Namely, again, if you don't want somehow to know about specific torsion invariants, then you're fine by calculating what's happening at the abelian part. But if you want the whole thing, you need to take care of things that are non-abelian in some sense. Good. Good. So at the time, this is 1990s, 1980s, what Hopkins, Kuhn, and Ravel wanted to do, they wanted to calculate what is some sort of Euler characteristic of these Morava-K theories applied to some finite groups to see what's exactly the answer. And they got a very nice construction that they call it the generalized topples, the generalized characters. And this is where I was somehow telling Bernardo that perhaps there's something here that he might see. So all of these, of course, I haven't said it, but all. All of these, of course, I haven't said it, but all the Moravaki theories are always localized at some prime. Oh, and the prime here is, oh, I went backwards. The prime here is prime p. So there's always a p behind it. And so you take all the commuting tuples of elements of g, but whose order of each of these g's is a power of p. So it's not only commuting toples, but of power of p. And the result of Hawkins-Cohen-Ranovan is that this Euler characteristic is precisely the size of the orbit of this commuting topples divided by. Orbits of these commuting topples divided by g. So you simply count all these tuples up to conjugation, diagonal conjugation, whatever the size is, they showed that this is the case. And of course, in some sense, since many examples only were living in the even part, many cases didn't have any odd part. So that's why somehow they thought, well, this might be the case that this odd part is not existing. And so this Euler characteristic only detecting this somehow rank. But the point is, there are groups on which. But the point is, there are groups on which there is odd dimensions in here that complicates the statement. The idea is they called an element in the Moravaque theory good if it's coming from transfer map, from the transfer map in the Moravaque theory sense. And if this and if again, and if a group is good, if it's spanned by these good elements, and they showed if. Wood elements, and they showed if that's the case for a group, then the Moravaki theory of the classifying space of the group is concentrated in even dimensions. And they started to specifically say which groups are good. And in some sense, similar again to what is being done in the Bordism case. So, good groups, which is quite interesting. Well, many of the ones you might think of, it's like close to a billion, but there is a very interesting one, this Chevalier group. So, somehow this made. These Chevalier groups, so some of these matrix groups, they are good groups, namely the more avocados concentrated in even degrees. And what is very interesting is that this contra example of Igor that Sophie used very smartly is a subgroup here. So it's somehow awkward that is inside there is a group with bad properties, inside a group with good properties. We don't know whether these groups somehow satisfy the evening's conjectures in Boardism. What we know is that they only have even-dimensional immorality. Have even dimension in more avocado theory. Perhaps it will follow. I don't know. So the thing is, of course, the conjecture of Hopkins-Conrovanel 1990s is all groups are good. It was shown by Igor Krees and generalized by Igor and Lee that that's not the case. And there are infinitely many examples on which this does not happen of this type. I don't know whether if there are other groups. Sophie and Paul might know, but these are the ones that we know so far that destroys this conjecture. Good. So one could also. So, one could also ask the conjecture for the homotopical borders. Is it a free module in VIN damage generators? No, and this is, Sophie will tell us about it. I'm not telling you how she did it. I'm just telling you that she just showed that it's not a flat MU module, and she will tell us something about it. So, again, all these conjectures in some sense are false, but we should not think that there are false. We should think that there is something interesting behind it that we need to somehow understand. As I said, know that the speed that was constructed is not good, but it lives in a good group. Is not good, but it lives in a good group. Now, let me change gears a little bit so that because there are experts here in the Schneider uncle, because I believe there is also something there that we don't know and we don't know what's going on. So, the cotton paste groups, and I just put it in one slide because there would be people here explaining it, is that you define some sort of relation on manifolds on which you say that two real two manifolds are. On which you say that two real two manifolds are going to be equivalent, if you can somehow cut it appropriately and glue it differently to construct the other one. So when I say cut it and glue it separately, it means that you have two manifolds n and m prime with boundary, n and m prime, but then you glue the boundary differently with different functions. And then you can construct two different manifolds with the same pieces, but glued different. Up with the same pieces but glued differently. If you do that, and many, many more things, then you construct the Schneider and Claven relation, the cut and paste relation. And one way is simple. I'm just putting many things on the rock. This is not the general definition because it has a bar. You may take the manifolds up to oriented bordism and divide by this relation. And this gives you some sort of reduced Schneider and Claving groups. There are more, but just keep in mind these ones, because it was shown in the 70s, 80s. 70s, 80s, that if you calculate the second group associated to any finite group, again, the same Bogomol of multiply appears. It wasn't called Bogomol of multiply at the time because it was simply second homology divided torrent classes, exactly as somehow Eric defined it. But of course, this opens many questions again, like what happens if I put a four? Well, let's put a four. And if I put a four, whatever it is, what does it say about the other ones? And for And for since there are people here that are expert in font dimensions, this is perhaps easy questions for you guys. For us, it's difficult. We want to know what happens if you put a four. Four or a three? A three. But a three, maybe zero, just because of we, but a four. Or yeah, you're right. Three or four. We're happy with three and four. Because whatever it says here, this is somehow, in some sense, a smaller homology. In some sense, smaller homology theory, that doesn't mean it's simpler. And perhaps because it's smaller, perhaps we get some part, some part of the Bordism information, some part of it. So I'm saying this because since there are people here that works tonight on Cleven, we perhaps could talk and work together or see we can do something. But now let me change gears towards algebraic geometry so that we can also see that there is some very nice relation going on that we need to somehow exploit. That we need to somehow exploit and understand. So, this Bogomolov multiplier is called Bogomolov because it was Bogomolov, the one who calculated the unramified Brouwer group of this variety. So, you take a representation of the group G, faithful representation, to take the algebraic variety associated to it, then there is a specific construction that is called the Brouwer onramified Brouwer group, some sort of gerbs associated with it. And what the way it's done is somehow is calculating with a specific. So now it's calculating with a specific resolution, smooth proper resolution, and then you calculate the torsion part of the third homology. And what Bogomolo did was explicitly say what it is, which is the Schur multiplier, the classes of the Schur multiplier that vanish on all abelian groups and the sense of homology. So somehow, why is this somehow very important? Among many other things, the on-ramified Brouwer group is a birational invariant of a variety. So if this is not zero, So, if this is not zero, then it cannot be rational, among many other things. And if it's not the same, then of course, then the varieties will not be birational. So, it's telling us some sort of simple classification of birationality in algebraic geometry. And of course, these are somehow simple varieties. I put it in quotes because, of course, they're not simple, but are simple to define. Of course, one sees here that there must be some credituality going on. Must be some concrete duality going on, that there must be some sort of very specific relation. If we think of this variety as an algebraic space, anyway. Now, let me go to the Konsevich-Motidi Green, because I'm going to Ekedal's invariance in algebraic geometry. So, Konsevich constructed many years ago the Grotendi group of varieties, of algebraic varieties, which is you take the isomorphism classes of algebraic varieties. Algebraic varieties and then you divide by a very nice relation, which is this one. Whenever you have a closed sub-variety, whenever you have a closed sub-variety, you simply say that X splits as a sum of the sub-variety and the complement of the sub-variety. You just put this relation on this gigantic object of the isomorphism classes of all varieties. I don't know exactly what it is, but it is an object that is well defined. It is an ongeop that is well defined, it has a product structure. And if you put this relation, the one will be a point, the affine lines will be denoted by this letter L. And if you take the projective space, then it splits as a sum of these affine lines. So it's a very nice algebraic gadget. Now, it was proven that this rotten group is generated by smooth proper varieties. Smooth proper varieties, namely, you can always take only smooth proper varieties, but you need to put this specific relation whenever you blow up, whatever it is that you're blowing up, your singularities or whatever. So in the sense that if you have a variety here and you have a sub-variety, and then you blow up along this sub-variety, and this is the exceptional divisor, then it turns out that you can put the sum of these diagonals, the sum of these anti-diagonals in some sense. So in this way, you can just change any variety that you have by Change any variety that you have by smooth proper ones. That's the whole point of these structures. You can just always think that you have, even though you have a singular variety inside, you may change them, you just need resolution of singularities to smooth proper ones. The thing is that conservation motivated ring is not that one. You first need to invert the often line and then you need to do a completion, a filtration on a specific filtration that I didn't write. But but there is a filtration going on, dimension filtration, and then you just did the completion. And this is conservation multiv green. This is Conservation Multivigring. But you may think that these are somehow the pieces that build it. So, in the end of the 2010s, Ekedal, who was a professor in Sweden, if I'm not mistaken, he constructed something that is called nowadays Ecedal's invariance of algebraic varieties. And the Ecedal's invariance is a very nice idea on which you On which you take this L0 up, which is just simply take a billion groups, that's what it is, and you take your specific variety and you change it by a smooth proper one, and you calculate its cohomologies, and you somehow bundle up very intelligently using a shift here by this, and you put it at T just to remember where you're lying. And it turns out that this is a very well, it's a well-defined map. That's not trivial to show in the sense, whatever you. In the sense, whatever you put in here, change it by the appropriate smooth proper resolution and apply that. You might change the smooth proper resolution, but it turns out that it's well defined. So it's a very nice map in this motiving of varieties. And then you might think of what happens with this stack. Well, I'm now going to stacks, but anyway, if you want to see the image of this stack, or what is the stack, then the stack will be this inverse limit of varieties. Inverse limit of varieties. You simply take your faithful representation, copy it several times, stabilize it, take the smooth proper resolution of it, and simply put it in here. And this will be the image of our BG. BG is not existing there, but you might think that it's this, it's some limit of objects. Of course, we're inverting this line so that we can do this type of tricks in some sense. And then, of course, if there is some stabilization procedure, if M is large enough, then If m is large enough, then these cohomologies of these objects in the motivic ring will simply be the cohomologies of the appropriate resolution of singularities, of the appropriate smooth resolution. Good. Having said that, then, of course, then we can define what is nowadays called Ecedal's invariance for finite groups. And Ecedal's invariance for finite groups is again, you take your group, you take an M sufficiently large, because this stabilizes, take the resolution of singularities, take. Stabilizes, take the resolution of singularities, take this smooth proper map, and simply calculate the cohomology of this is the biggest part. And of course, there are some exceptional divisors around here. And you calculate the cohomology of those, all those smooth proper varieties. Whatever it is, is an invariant of the group, whatever it is. And again, where you replace this limit by the appropriate resolution of singularity. You need to do this is, of course, not trivial. This is, of course, what is in Bogomolov's results. What is in Bogomolo's results? You need to change this by that, and once you need to control this to understand what's going on. And then Equedal himself showed that these invariants are trivial for all negative degrees, the integers, because it's just saying that is the hierarchical homology of this smooth profile variety, which is the integers, zero for one, because some specific structure of these varieties, no fundamental group around. Important is the Important is that the second echetal invariant is precisely the dual of the Bogomolo multiplier. So already appears as the first somehow, and I'm not going to call it obstruction, but it's the first invariant that appears in the lowest degree, this object. As you can see, there is nothing else known for the rest, because you need to calculate the fork cohomology of the smooth proper resolution of a specific object and also taking care the And also taking care of the exceptional divisors. Whenever you're doing this second one, you don't need to care about exceptional divisors because of dimension properties. You just need to take care of the biggest dimension object. And so, of course, if somehow if you detect this information for a finite group, then you already see that you have some obstruction for the rationality of this algebraic variety. Of course, any more things that appear here will also be obstructions. Also, be obstructions for rationality for varieties. But what I want you to see is: of course, this is just an idea that there we know about Bogomolovs in the geometrical Bordism. In the homotopical one, we know these conterexamples very smartly constructed by Igor and used by Sophie. And then in the algebraic setup, we know the same little thing in the same small dimension. And again, Dimension and again, nothing known is nothing known here on the top, is nothing known on the other. And it looks awkward or interesting that we are stuck at the same place. That's why I said if we calculate something at dimension four, for sure this will pop up here in dimension four. For sure, for sure. Because you just took an algebraic variety that has the same somehow of structure. So again, of course, there is this idea to again classify groups. To again classify groups, groups whose echetal invariants are trivial. And the way somehow they do it is instead of calculating the invariance, let's try to see which groups are just a point in the motivic ring. Because if it's just a point, well, all invariants are trivial. And the groups are, interestingly so, the symmetric group. Again, groups of GLN1, there is this small classification. Perhaps there are some more. Perhaps there are some more, but this is what I found. But this is what I found, and as you can see, it's not gigantic, whatever is there that whose echetal invariants are trivial. Of course, every group with a Bokomolov multiplier, then of course the echetal invariants are not trivial, but there might be more. There might be more around. And I wasn't aware, and if somebody knows more about this, when you look at the paper of Ekedal, these papers are not published, are in 2003 or 2004. Or 2004, beginning of this century. And I asked around why are they not published? Oh, because he died afterwards, like of cancer. He was 50, a professor in Sweden. So he has two papers, very nice papers, one defining some of the invariants in general, and another one doing it for finite groups. These papers are in the archive. They are not published. They're beautiful. He had They're beautiful. He had two students, if I believe, and the students are the ones now somehow using this theory, but not that many people, not that many people, which is somehow interesting because it's a nice construction, it's a nice idea, it's a nice way to put up with information. But somehow, if you ask around, not that many people know about it. Nevertheless, look at the papers and then you see that the ideas are beautiful. This is a stabilization procedure, as you've seen it. A stabilization procedure, as you've seen it, because now that Rita is here, we can tell her that she needs to help us how to do these stabilizations and then to try to calculate some things. Let me see, what else do I have? So I'm early, but I can now take some time. So as you can see, I didn't want somehow to talk so much about my work, more about what is common in many of the talks that are. Common in many of the talks that are around in this conference, and there are some common ground. And the common ground is that we are trying to find something about group actions on things that they were not done before, either algebraically, either topologically, either in the four-manifold world, because the question is somehow different, which is how do I keep track of the group in some sense in these manifolds? The group, in some sense, in these manifolds that I have, or in this topological universe. Nevertheless, we have some tools. Perhaps the tools are there in some sense, but they haven't been somehow exploited. I was thinking why in the 70s or 80s people stopped thinking about these questions. And my conclusion is not that they didn't want to study this, but somehow they got a little bit disappointed, but what the conjectures they constructed or the idea. Conjectures they constructed or the ideas they imagined. And if one has an idea, one imagines, I don't know, the tree will grow and grow round and starts growing like this, then perhaps one cuts the tree, no? Sorry, one this tree, I want it to go like this, not round. And so perhaps that's that was going on. They had these ideas what should happen, and they didn't happen. So then they said, let's do something else. But I believe now that we But I believe now that we have some sort of more information from the sites that is telling us that there is something inside that we don't know and that we should somehow exploit and we should try to see, for example, how do we use these manifolds, whatever they are, how do we send them to the motivic ring so that in the motivic ring we detect information of them or the vice versa or whatever, but how do we? Or whatever, but how do we take these two-dimensional manifolds that Eric constructed? How do we make them appear as some Poincaré dual of some line bundle in a specific algebraic variety? So that exactly somehow is sent to the appropriate generator of the Bogomolov. The way we have it is some sort of, we're not doing somehow still the Poincaré duality procedure, but we need to do it somehow so that we can know how to go from one to the other. And as I said, The other. And as I said, this structure should also be this structure should be also calculable. This and I don't claim because, as I said, I'm not saying it's trivial. I'm saying it's very geometrical. And perhaps we can say something specifically with what we know about four dimensions and three dimensions. I put this last sentence so that I would very much like, not me, but all of us, that we somehow throw ideas because we've seen that there is appearing many things. We've seen that there is appearing many things and several different objects. There are people that are good in low-dimensional manifolds, there are people that are good in algebraic topology, there are people that are good in algebraic geometry. Whatever we learn from the other is good. And in specific, this type of classification of groups, as you've seen, like there are groups for the Evenness conjecture, there are groups that are good for the Moravake theory, there are groups that are good for echinal invariants. Of course, they look very similar. Of course, they look very similar to one another, and perhaps one could try to see what is what is cop what you can copy from one to the other. And I ended up early because I started a little early. I thank you very much for listening. We can ask questions. Uh do we want to start with the questions of the tool? Peter and Carl? Oh, yes, Peter. If there are any questions on Zoom, just simply ask because we don't see. Okay. Peter, we finished. So if you have any question, this is the time. That was a beautiful talk, covering a lot of nice new ground. And I don't have any questions, however. However, I really like the way you presented the material. The result was very nice. Do you have anything to add that you at this point that you think is interesting? Hello, can you hear us? Can you hear us? I hear you. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Yes. Good, Peter. So he said, there's a question here. So, yeah, the question is: you have this invariant from finite groups to K-hat of varieties. Yeah, this motivic ring. And is there maybe And is there maybe any more structure that's going on here? Like, is there maybe a map from the Bordism ring of G to the K-theory of varieties? I don't know. That sounds like asking for a lot, but yeah, maybe there's more structures. That's the point, Eric. I don't know. I don't know. It's just, of course, that is one natural question to ask. How do one go from one to the other? No, how do for that? For that, one has to expect, perhaps over-optimistically, that all the generators of the equivalent Vortism ring are algebraic. But if we somehow cross our fingers, that's the case in the standard Vortism ring. They're all algebraic. So one could expect that they're all algebraic. And once they're algebraic, you simply send them and expect that they do something. Something. But when you say, are there more structures? So the idea on which these things are constructed is using the resolution of singularities. And so once you have your resolution, of course, you might have another resolution. But the point is that these algebraic geometers have already found a way to make it not depending on the resolution you choose. That's the key point. And as long as it says it's not depending on how you resolve it, but there is some. On how you resolve it, but there is some invariance behind it, either by jets or by some other information that is detected in the blow-ups. But so you see the structure is a little different, although might be similar. It's just, but I don't know. I don't know. And I just brought it because, of course, the Bogomolo multiplier, it is an invariant, but if one sees it as a specific part of a gigantic tower of invariants, then Of invariants, then the idea boils more into ah, we need to see how do we fit these towers together, not just as a simple one invariant that lies around. If it's in a tower of invariant, then one might think how to construct it. And if one constructs it, then one can deduce things from one or the other. But you see, what is behind is the classic story in algebraic geometry. You blow up, just take a smooth proper object, and then you calculate on top. Calculate on top. Is there another question? I have a question. Well, we know that what we proved is that the event conjecture, the interior event conjecture, is not true about the freedness part. And Sophie proved that it's not the conterexamples are not even. Yeah. But. Yeah, but uh, well, my question is: how to produce oddness conterexamples in the in the geometric part? The thing, Carlos, is that the the the the duality here in some sense. The duality here, in some sense, in bordism, is complicated. It was also, it was written many years ago by Peter Landver. It is, it might be easier to calculate the bordism ring of the classifying, the cohomological one of the classifying space of a group because of this algebraic structure that is very rich. It is more difficult to know what is the homological one. So, because you're asking me how to change from one to the other to the homolog. Change from one to the other to the homological to the homological. But you're right. So we still need to know exactly what is the class that is somehow destroying everything, where it's appearing, what is the degree, what is that it's destroying, and once we know more about it, then we might say something. Sophie for sure might be able to track down to a specific class. But I, yeah, don't know. No. There is another question. No, not. Thank you very much.
