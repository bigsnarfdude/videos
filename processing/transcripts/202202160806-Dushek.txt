All right, our first speaker is Omer Dushek. Omer, take it away. Just confirm everyone can see my screen. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay, great. Okay. Stop me if there's a bug. Okay, so yeah. So thanks for inviting me to speak at this lovely conference. And thank you for those who woke up super early in Vanf to come listen. And so what I want to do is tell you about the work that we've been doing. Want to do is tell you about the work that we've been doing basically trying to quantify very precisely the discriminatory power of the T-cell receptor and, in fact, other receptors, and trying to get a handle on the underlying mechanism, basically kinetic proofreading. So we all know that T cells have to continuously scan nearly all cells in our body for antigen, and that they normally ignore normal cells that express only Normal cells that express only self-peptide MAC. These are MAC molecules where the peptide is arrived from our own self-proteins. But they have to initiate adaptive immune responses when they recognize these very same cells, even though they express minute quantities of a foreign antigen. For example, a peptide derives from a viral protein. And this ability to discriminate between self and non-self is difficult for us to understand because these peptides can be quite short, as short as eight amino acids, and therefore. Eight amino acids. And therefore, the difference between a self and a foreign peptide can be quite subtle at the level of sequence and hence at the level of the structure that it might form with a T cell receptor. So a solution to this problem was thought to have been produced in the 1990s, where three independent labs provided the same results. And so one lab provided the results with the OT1 T cell receptor. This is from a transgenic mouse where all the T cells have the same material. Mouse, well, all the T cells have the same receptor, or T1, which recognizes a short peptide from albumin. And this is a graph from Gregoire's paper, which I like, showing a few years later that if you measure T-cell activation by phosphorylation of ERK, you could, of course, detect it if you give, if you pulse on the antigen-presenting cells the wild-type infecal peptide from a valbumin, shown here in red. However, if you now introduce point mutations to that peptide, you could find some peptides that completely abolish. You could find some peptides that completely abolish the T cell response. So, for example, in blue here is the E1 peptide infecal, which you could see doesn't activate T cells, even at extremely high concentrations. And this result was reproduced by other labs using the 2B4 TCR or by Paul Allen using the 3L2 TCR, where they could identify point mutants that completely abolish the T cell response, shown here. It's kind of a flat line along the x-axis. And so, of course, this wouldn't have been surprising if these point mutants. Of course, this wouldn't have been surprising if these point mutants abolished binding between the peptin-AC ligand and the T-cell receptor. But the surprising result was that if you make these as purified proteins and measured affinities using surface plasmone resonance, what you found is that these non-activating peptides still bound quite strongly with the T-cell receptor. For example, in the OT1 example, the difference between the activating synfecal and the non-activating n-fecal was thought to be just threefold. This is a threefold lower affinity or threefold larger. Lower affinity or threefold larger Kd. And so the idea was that T cells basically can be quite discriminatory to the T cell receptive peptin received binding kinetics. And the way that they achieve self-non-self discrimination is based on these binding affinities or kinetics, so that the self-peptides, which could look quite similar to the foreign peptides, they bind with a slightly lower affinity, but that's enough to pass this threshold so that you don't get activation. And this was termed per. And this was termed perfect or absolute discrimination because the ligand concentration cannot compensate for affinity. And this is kind of what Anton spoke about yesterday. And this was actually the problem that I was given as a grad student to try to solve, because this is obviously a nice mathematical problem, because if you write down a simple mass action occupancy model, then if you lower the affinity of a ligand by threefold, the predicted dose response would just shift to the right by threefold, right? You just need to have threefold higher ligand concentration. You should recover the same response. Ligand concentration, you should recover the same response. But that's clearly not the case. You can't fool T cells. And we now know that, of course, the occupancy model cannot explain this kind of data where the T cell might respond simply to the total amount of its receptor that are bound because in that model, if you lower the affinity by, for example, twofold, you just have to increase the ligand concentration by twofold. So we could reject this model as a plausible model of antigen discrimination. And in 1995, Timothy McKeithen proposed that, in fact, kinetic proofreading can probably explain this kind of data. Explain this kind of data. And in this model, there's simply a delay between initial TCR binding and signaling. And that delay is sufficient to kind of fan out these curves. So there's a non-linear amplification here so that small changes in affinity can be translated into larger changes in the concentration of ligand that's required to activate T cells. But this model still can't explain the data that I showed you on the previous slide if you also stipulate that you have to have high antigen sensitivity. And so as a result, And so, as a result, me and many other people have been trying to kind of augment kinetic proofreading with what I call mechanism X. So, trying to amplify discrimination and keep sensitivity in this model. And so, we proposed this induced rebinding model in 2014, and other people have proposed other mechanisms. But being in Oxford and studying TCR practically binding kinetics and using surface plasma on resonance with some sort of local experts, I finally got some confidence to go back and revisit some of these early measures. And revisit some of these early measurements, in particular the SPR data that underlies these small fold changes in affinities that were produced in the late 1990s. And it turns out that if you look at that data and you scrutinize it, you sort of realize that there's sort of hallmarks of artifacts basically in all three data sets, unfortunately. And this is simply, I think, a result of SPR being a new technology into time, and people weren't aware of some of these pitfalls. So, for example, in OT1, the data that underlied this threefold change, for example, very clear hallmarks of protein aggregation, meaning that you're not Aggregation, meaning that you're not measuring monovalent affinities here. And so this prompted us to try to see whether we could reproduce some of these results using modern SPR at 37 degrees and also to use human T cells. And so today what I'll do is, well, what I've already done is told you about this original murine data, and I'll tell you about our new human TCR data. I'll then show you how we apply that analysis to published data and then to other receptors, so non-T cell receptors, just conventional receptors, and then I'll talk about mechanisms. And then I'll talk about mechanism. Okay. And so this work was done by a fabulous team of students and postdocs, including Johannes, Enas, Anna, Dan, as well as our excellent protein biochemist, Misha, and they were supervised by local collaborators as well as some international ones. And so I'm going to actually skip this first part about how we measure Daffinities using SPR. Okay, it's quite technical, but if anyone's interested, I'll just summarize by saying. I'll just summarize by saying that we now have a new protocol basically to accurately measure affinities at 37 degrees that go into what I would call the ultra-low affinity regime. So in the past, you can measure affinities accurately for TCR peptides interactions of around 100 micromolar. And now we can measure affinities that are much lower. And so we took a human T-cell receptor called 1G4. It recognizes a peptide antigen from a cancer protein called NYSO1. And the affinity here. One and the affinity here is eight micromolar, and then we introduce point mutations to lower the affinity. With the lowest affinity that we measured for this receptor being 1300 micromolar. And the idea is that these lower affinity interactions are meant to represent, for example, self-antigens. We also use the A60 cell receptor, which recognizes a viral peptide from HTLV. And that panel is shown here. I'm going to talk less about this receptor. And so the idea was to take these antigens and just give it to human T cells. Give it to human T cells and see how well they discriminate between them. And of course, there is no transgenic human that has the 1G4 TCR, so we have to take human T cells and modify them. And the way we do that is we isolate naive or memory CD8 T cells from blood. We then electroporate mRNA that encodes for our T cell receptor. So we have a population now of cells that all express the 1G4 T cell receptor, for example. From the same donor, we take monocytes and we have this kind of express differentiation. And we have this kind of express differentiation protocol to make mature dendritic cells. We then load those cells with different concentrations of each of these peptides, co-culture them for 24 hours, and then measure T cell activation. So here, for example, I'm measuring CD69. It's a measure of T cell activation on the Y axis. On the X axis is the concentration of the peptide. And they're arranged in order from highest affinity to lowest affinity. And you can see that there's a gradual loss of the response as you lower the affinity. And that's true for naive in memory. And that's true for naive and memory cells. So we don't see this sharp affinity threshold that was previously described. And we also repeated this with what we call T cell blasts. These are in vitro activated and proliferating T cells, and they're kind of a model for in vivo effector T cells. And these are the kind of cells that people often infuse back into patients in adoptive cell therapy. And so again, the 1G4 blasts or the A6 blasts, again, show this gradual loss of the T cell response. Gradual loss of the T cell response. And so, because there wasn't a threshold, we wanted to kind of put a number to quantify the level of discrimination that these T cells have. And to do that, we took those data sets, we drew a horizontal line at 15% activation above background, and then calculated the concentration of each peptide that was required to achieve that level of activation. And we chose 15% instead of 50% because we wanted to capture some of these low-affinity interactions in our plots. And so, here on the y-axis, And so here on the y-axis is that measure of ligand potency, P15, over the affinity. And in all cases, we found a really good correlation between the potency from the functional experiments and the KD measured with purified proteins and SPR. And what we found was that if you lower the affinity by 164-fold, that's the full difference between the highest affinity and the lowest affinity, you have to increase the concentration of the ligand not by 164-fold. That would be kind of the Fold, that would be kind of the null model, but rather by tens of thousands of fold. So, a much larger fold increase. Okay, and so there's a big non-linearity here, suggestive of enhanced discrimination. And so, because you get, you know, it's not a perfect straight line, but you get an approximate straight line in this log-log plot. It basically suggests a power-log relationship between the affinity and the potency, where the power alpha is simply the slope of this line. Okay, and the idea. The slope of this line. Okay, and the idea is that if the slope is very steep, you have very good discrimination because a small fold change in affinity means you have to have a very large fold increase in the concentration of the ligand to compensate. And if the slope is very shallow, you have poor discrimination. And what we found was that the slope was always about two for all these different T cell types and for this other receptor. In fact, when we pooled all the data together, it was exactly 2.0. And so that value. And so that value of 2.0 is larger than one. So one again would be the normal hypothesis, where 164-fold lower affinity means that you would have to have 164-fold higher concentration. And so we're getting a value that's above one. So there's some kind of enhanced discrimination. I'm not going to talk about sensitivity, but I'll just say that we found that the T-cell blasts had about a tenfold higher sensitivity than naive and memory cells, which is kind of known that effective cells have slightly higher sensitivity. So because we were going to. So, because we were getting this discrimination, we wanted to know what was the value of this alpha parameter, the discrimination power, for those original murine studies. And so, we went back to those data and, you know, looking at the graphs, we sort of digitized them and we just estimated the potency from them. And that's blotted here on the y-axis over the KD. And indeed, when you do that, you find that the slopes or the discrimination powers are much larger in these original studies. It's about 9.0. And again, we think that the reason for that. Again, we think that the reason for that was because of issues with the binding data. So the x-axis on all these plots, we think there's some artifacts in that. And so what we did is we sort of realized that all three of these murine transgenics actually continue to be used since the 90s to study all aspects of adaptive immunity. And there's actually some additional binding data that has been produced over the years, but hasn't directly been used to inform on discrimination. And so what we did is we went back and combined the original potency measurements, but with new affinity data. Measurements, but with new affinity data. So, for example, for the 3L2 TCR, in 2015, there was a publication with new measurements for the four peptides. And so we took those new measurements, and now the discrimination power dropped from 6.7 to about, sorry, from 6.8 to about 3.2. In the case of OT1, there was a paper in 2006 that reported some different peptides. And in 2014, the affinities for those peptides were measured. So we combined the two data when we calculated. Data, when we calculated the discrimination power again, it was about two. And so, altogether, we get discrimination powers that are more consistent with our human data. And we also realized, of course, that people have been producing lots of different T-cell receptors that bind the same antigen with different affinities, or different antigens that bind the TCR with different affinities, largely to try to optimize affinity for therapies. And we basically scoured the literature and made potency over affinity plots. And made potency over affinity plots for all those studies. In total, we made about 70 of these potency affinity plots. And in all of them, we found that the discrimination power, again, was a lot smaller than we previously previously believed. And in fact, when we combined all of this other data, although the distribution was quite wide, the mean was very similar to what we were finding. Well, it was exactly the same as what we were finding in our human data. So it was 2.0. And so just to kind of And so just to kind of cross, you know, the dot the I and cross the T, we decided that we better just directly measure the affinities at 37 degrees for one of these transgenics. And we picked the OT1 because that one is the most heavily used murine TCR. And so we basically produced purified peptide-MAT for every single peptide that we found in studies. And we thought this could be useful to the community. And we used our new SPR protocol to measure all these affinities. SPR protocol to measure all these affinities. And so, for example, OVA we found has a much lower affinity than was previously reported. And this E1 variant, which you recall previously was thought to have a three-fold difference in affinity, it has, I would say, well, you can see here, it's about maybe 30-fold, at least 30-fold higher, at least 30-fold lower affinity. And when we plotted the revised KD measurements over the potencies that we pulled out. Measurements over the potencies that we pulled out from the literature, they're all normalized to the ova peptide, because that's usually what was also included in all these studies. We find a slope or a discrimination power, again, that's more consistent with what we're seeing with our human T cells, about 3.2 for OT1. You can see here at the end that there's kind of like, you know, the higher affinities look like they fall on a straight line, and then these ones up here that look a bit higher. And we think the reason for that is that the affinities for these very low affinity ones, the ones that are hovering about. Very low affinity ones, the ones that are hovering about a thousand micromolars, probably lower than what we measure in our assay. And what I mean by that is that our assay at the moment, for some of these very low affinity ones, we don't see any binding that's above background. So all of these ones out here, you can see they're all kind of converging on similar affinities. And we are trying at the moment to have some additional controls to see if we see any binding above background. And we think it's particularly interesting. Background, and we think it's particularly interesting because for the OT1 TCR, to my knowledge, it's the only TCR where there are bona fide self-peptides that have been identified. These are positively selecting peptides. And so we're really keen to see if we could detect binding affinities for these here. So yeah, I was hoping to be able to present more on this, but we're still stuck at this debugging stage. And we decided to kind of hold off on publishing this because we don't want to put erroneous. Erroneous KD sort of values out there. But hopefully, we'll sort this out in the next few months. And I hope it'll be useful to some people. And so given this lower or more modest discriminatory power for the T cell receptor, it also started making us wonder whether the T cell receptor is special at all. Maybe all receptors have discriminatory powers that are around 2.0. And so although cytokine receptors, we Although cytokine receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and G-protein coupled receptors don't have to discriminate between ligands or a large number of ligands that bind with different affinities in their day-to-day jobs. People have been making synthetic ligands that bind to them with different affinities. So for example, for IL-13 receptor, Ignacio Moraga, who I think is in the audience today, generated this really lovely panel of ligands and measured their affinities accurately using SPR. And so we pulled out the And so we pulled out the potency values from his paper, we plotted them against KD, we found a really fantastic correlation, but a discrimination power there was quite small. Okay, it was 0.44 in this example. And the same story was for our receptor tyrosine kinase. It was less than one. And also for a G-protein coupled receptor. And I should mention that for GPCRs, we only looked at data where the ligands bound to the same pocket of the GPCR, right? So that you're not comparing ligands that might induce different conformational changes. Induce different conformational changes in the receptor. And so, overall, all these other receptors had discrimination powers that were at or below one, meaning that if you lower their affinity, for example, by 164-fold, you just need to increase the concentration of the ligand by 164-fold, and you could fool that receptor into thinking that it's binding the same ligand. It won't know the difference. So, this was a bit of a relief because it told us that indeed the T-cell receptor is special after all. It has some enhanced discrimination. It's about two-fold higher than these more conventional. Higher than these more conventional receptors. We found only one study for the B-cell receptor that had the kind of data needed to quantify discrimination. That is, ligands that bind with different affinities and a detailed dose response curve. It was a paper from the 90s from Facundo Batista. And in that paper, the discrimination power of the BCR was kind of intermediate between the TCR and these other receptors. But certainly more data is needed to really pin this down. And I'm hoping people might be. And I'm hoping people might be interested in trying to do these kinds of experiments for the BCR. And so, what I want to do now is just kind of take a pause and just say, what does this discrimination power of two actually mean? So the way that I want to, I want to go through an example. And that example is basically to ask: what fold increase in antigen concentration and peptide concentration do we need to recover a T-cell response if you drop the affinity by about 50-fold? Okay, and I drop, I. 50-fold. Okay. And I draw, I used a 50-fold difference in affinity because that's roughly the difference between a foreign and a self-antigen. That, or at least that's the value that's out there. I think no one knows for sure exactly, but I sort of decided to use this. So if you have a baseline discrimination of one, of course, you just need to increase your ligand concentration by 50-fold. This is not how the TCR works. If you have perfect discrimination and alpha is equal to nine, as was originally believed, then you have to increase the concentration of the ligand by 50 to the power of nine. By 50 to the power of 9, right? And that gives you 10 to the 15. So that's obviously an anatomical increase in the concentration of the ligand because the number of MHC molecules on an APC is about 100,000, 10 to the 5. So that's 10 to the 5 is probably the maximum that you could increase the concentration of the ligand. And this is why it was initially believed that you have perfect discrimination. But now with a discrimination power of 2, what this means is that a self-antigen with a 50-fold lower affinity can activate T-cell. Fold lower affinity can activate T cells if it's expressed at about 2500-fold higher concentration. And so we call this level of discrimination imperfect. So it's enhanced discrimination above baseline, but it's certainly imperfect relative to what was previously believed. And we think that's kind of interesting because for a long time, people thought of T cell mediated autoimmunity as a defect on the T cell side. For example, a defect in thyroid. Cell side, for example, a defect in thymic selection that allowed this highly autoreactive T cell to escape negative selection. But in fact, what this suggests is that autoimmunity can be mediated not because of an issue on T cells, but simply an upregulation of a self-antigen on a target cell. And that's really kind of interesting because there were a couple of papers in 2021 or 2020, I should say, that basically showed this. There was one paper in cells, which I really liked that showed. Cell, which I really like, that showed that in multiple sclerosis, this is an autoimmune condition. What they find is that 50%, almost 50% of the MHC on a given APC expresses the same self-peptide. And that self-peptide, turns out, comes from an HLA molecule. So that's where you have the association, but it's certainly an overexpressed self-peptide, and that is linked to T-cell activation. There was also a really nice paper by Uri Alone in the late By Uri Alone and the late Nir Friedman, that argued that this process might be an immune surveillance mechanism where T cells actually look for overexpressed self-antigens. And that might be particularly important for surveillance in endocrine organs. And I really like this paper. So if you haven't read it, I really recommend it. And I think both of these studies are consistent now with this rather imperfect discriminatory power of the T cell receptor that we're now reporting. That we're now reporting. So, I'm going to skip this part and I'll just tell you now about some mechanisms. So, I started the talk by talking about kinetic proofreading. And what we wondered was whether kinetic proofreading can explain the data that we now generated. And so, the first thing we did was to take this ODE model of kinetic proofreading and simply fit it to our potency over affinity data. So, we simply solved kinetic proofreading, we generated a Doris response curve, we calculated potencies, and we fitted. And we fit it directly to our data. So, here's an example fit in the solid line to the data. And the fit had about five parameters, three of which were not identifiable, identifiable, but two were, the two important ones, namely the number of steps and the rate of each step. And roughly speaking, the slope out here at low affinities is proportional to the number of steps. And the inflection point where you get saturation is proportional to Kp, the rate of each step. The rate of each step. And so, what we found when we fit all our data simultaneously was that the number of steps was about 2.67. Okay, it's a fractional number, which is kind of interesting, but it's quite modest, a lot smaller than I actually expected. And the rate of each step was about one per second. And if you take the number of steps and divided it by the rate of each step, you could get the total time it takes from initial binding to signaling. And that total time was 2.8 seconds. Was 2.8 seconds, which is consistent with other experiments that have looked at how long it takes to signal from the T-cell receptor to, for example, activation of LAT. So that was reported by Morgan Hughes when he was with Mark Davis. And it was about, I think it was about four seconds. And so the next thing we did is to ask, well, this is explaining discrimination, but can we also explain antigen sensitivity with these parameters? Sensitivity with these parameters. And so, what we did is a kind of a heat map where we simply varied the number of steps on the y-axis. We varied the proofreading time on the x-axis. And then we simply looked, for each of these two parameters, looked where the discrimination is achieved and where sensitivity is achieved. And we did that for, for example, when you had perfect discrimination. And I should mention that the dots are from The dots are from stochastic simulations using Gillespie, and then the solid color is from the deterministic solution of the proofreading model. And like people reported before, if you're trying to explain perfect discrimination, you can't simultaneously explain that and antigen sensitivity. But if you're after a more modest discrimination where alpha is just equal to two, then we do find a region in parameter space that where both discrimination and sensitivity can There, both discrimination and sensitivity can be achieved. And the star here is the two parameters that we found by fitting this data. And you can see that the parameters that we find are kind of, it's almost like the minimum number of steps that the T cell needs to achieve sensitivity and discrimination simultaneously. So the T cell is not doing anything extra. It's sort of doing the minimum to achieve sensitivity to one antigen and a discrimination power of about two. Discrimination power of about two. Okay, and so that's basically everything I wanted to say. So I'll just summarize by saying that the T cell receptor seems to exhibit enhanced discrimination above baseline, but it's imperfect. And the discrimination power, we think, is about two. It's higher than other surface receptors that have discrimination powers at or below one. And so the T-cell receptor, I think, is special. It has a kinetic proofreading time delay of about A kinetic proofreading time delay of about 2.8 seconds, which it achieves with a fractional number or effective fractional number of steps of about 2.67. What I haven't shown you is that this higher level, this enhanced discrimination turns out to depend on extrinsic accessory receptors, namely CD2 and LFA1. So we find that if we don't ligate these receptors, the discrimination power seems to drop to about one. And we're currently actively looking at the mechanism of why that. Looking at the mechanism of why that might be the case, and we think we have some ideas that are dependent on molecular forces on the T cell receptor. And one thing that we did find is that T cells can respond to very low affinity ligands, ultra-low affinity ligands with KDs in this high 1000 micromolar range, but they have to be expressed at ultra-high concentration, right? So a foreign antigen or most peptides that are expressed on an APC are unlikely. That are expressed on an APC are unlikely to be expressed at these ultra-high concentrations, unless maybe there's something that's dysregulated about that APC. And the implications of that are that T cell-mediated autoimmunity may actually be a result of recognition of cells that have high levels of peptidem HC. And therefore, it might put the kind of onus on autoimmunity, not necessarily on T cells, but rather a defect on the APC, which I think is kind of interesting to think about. interesting to think about. And as others suggested, this might mean that T cells have a role in surveillance of abnormal cells abnormally expressing high levels of peptidemiate C. And lastly, and the thing that we're working on at the moment is now that we know that the discrimination power of the TCR is more modest than we previously thought, and we've thought a lot about why originally it might have high discrimination, we have a lot of ideas on how to enhance the discrimination power. And so what we're doing now is trying to synthetically generate T-cell receptors. Generate T cell receptors and, in fact, other receptors with enhanced discrimination powers, which we think can be quite useful for therapies. So, I've already thanked everyone that did the work and just to acknowledge my local and non-local collaborators and our funding. So, and thank you for listening. Thanks, Olmer.
