Sing and singularity formation. So we're excited to hear from just take it away. Thank you, Jacob. And it's always a pleasure to participate in a talk in Benf, particularly during the summer, particularly when it's possible to be there in person. So this is my second summer workshop in Banff in a row that I have to attend virtually. That I have to attend virtually. So I hope this won't be a tradition. So, anyway, so I'll talk about other equations in two dimensions today. And the results I'll present are joint work with Christophe Lacoff. And another paper is joint work with a student of mine, Zhong Win Han. And so, the older equations, of course, we all know. The Euler equations, of course, we all know those. So, this is written in general dimension with the no flux boundary condition on some domain D. And in two dimensions, of course, we can write them in terms of vorticity, and we just get a transport equation for a vorticity with the velocity field U being the transporting, the advecting field. And of course, U can be found from the vorticity with the Bios-Avar law, where the inverse Laplacian of omega. Inverse Laplacian of omega is the string function, and this is the Dirichlet Laplacian because we want to have the no flux boundary condition. Okay, and so the questions I'm interested in are on two dimensional domains. Of course, we know that if we have vorticity in L infinity and the domain is nice smooth, then there is no problem with well-posedness. But if the domain is singular, But if the domain is singular or somewhat singular, then the question is not so clear. Okay, and so sort of the main question is: how about a uniqueness of solutions on such domains? And then very closely related to that, what happens to particle trajectories and specifically, can they reach the boundary of the domain in finite time? And so, just a little overview of some earlier results. So, as I said, if So, as I said, if the domain is smooth, the boundary of the domain is smooth, there is no problem with so-called Judovich solutions. So, if we have initial vorticity bounded, then you can show, this goes back to 1930s, so 90 years ago, results of Volibner and Hilder, that the solution is log-lip shift, and that's good enough for showing well-posedness. Okay, in fact, as far as In fact, as far as existence is concerned, then that's no problem even more in more singular situations. So, weak solutions are known to exist for even LP or even measure-valued vorticity. So, for example, work of deeper Namaida, and also in very rough domains. So, this is from work of Gerard Vare and Lacafe. So, existence is generally no problem in reasonable spaces. Spaces and but uniqueness is a different issue, and in fact, a result of Vishick who constructed non-uniqueness or solutions that exhibit non-uniqueness with omega vorticity in Lp and also some forcing. And this is even without boundaries. So, those that result tells us that maybe we should stick to bounded vorticities if we want to get uniqueness. Okay, so that's the situation I'll be. Okay, so that's the situation I'll be considering here. And as far as that situation, so uniqueness is known only in sort of in general, only in very limited types of domains. So besides obviously smooth domains, there are results of Lacavmio and Wang and Diplinio and Hemam, which apply in domains which are either C2 alpha or C11 everywhere except finite. Everywhere, except a finite number of corners, and those corners have to be acute corners. And in fact, in these papers, it's been even assumed that they are exact sectors. So neighborhood of the corner is an exact sector in the plane. And of course, the neighborhood inside the domain. And so again, these results use log-Lipschitzness of your, some moral Log Lipschitzness of you, to obtain uniqueness. To obtain uniqueness. So, when we don't have that, then basically this question is open. And so, in general, singular domains, we do not have that. Even if you have, for example, an obtuse corner, then the velocity is typically only Helger continuous. So, it's not Log Lipschitz. And if you have a corner with angle greater than pi, then the velocity is even unbounded in general at that corner. So, definitely far from Log Lipschitz. So, that's. So that's a big limitation to proving uniqueness. And so, as I said, I'll be interested in this question. What can we do about it? And so, I'll consider weak solutions in the Judovich cause, which is basically bounded vorticity. And what turns out to matter is particle trajectories. So, what happens to particles, especially near the singular. Especially near the singular fluid particles near a singular part of the boundary, can they hit the boundary in finite time? Because, as it turns out, that could, for example, create, in principle, it might has the potential to create vorticity, new vorticity. And even if not, that also near those boundaries, because we don't have a log-Lipschitzness of the velocity, that has a potential for creating non-uniqueness, even if new vorticity is not created. Okay, so the particle trajectories, obviously, we start. Particle trajectories, obviously, we start at any point x inside a domain, and x0 is equal to x, and then x satisfies the ODE, where u is the velocity u. So it's the usual thing. And of course, because vorticity satisfies this transport equation, so we should expect vorticity to be transported by the velocity. And these are weak solutions, so that in principle needn't be the case. So I'll call solutions Lagrangian. So I'll call solutions Lagrangian if this is the case. So specifically, if for almost all points, the trajectory starting from that point never leaves the domain, so never reaches the boundary in finite time, and the vorticity is transported by these trajectories at all times. So if we have solutions that are Lagrangian, so remember that general weak solutions might in principle not be Lagrangian, but Principle not be Lagrangian. But so if we have Lagrangian solutions, then it's a little bit better situation. And with Lacare, we proved this is not a very difficult dilemma to show, that Lagrangian solutions are unique as long as the vorticity stays constant near the bad part of the boundary. And what's the bad part of the boundary? Well, you pick an alpha and you look where the domain is not. So the boundary is not C2 alpha, call it gamma alpha. Gamma alpha. And as long as in the neighborhood of gamma alpha, the solution stays constant. So, for example, vorticity is zero in the bad part of the boundary, near the bad part of the boundary, then there is uniqueness of Lagrangian solutions. Okay, and so this is proved using the Markier-Poul-Vierenti argument, using the fact that u, the velocity, is lobble-sheets away from the bad part of the boundary, which you just need some kind of basic Green's function estimates for. And so, what you do. And so, what you do, you have that Loglipschitz estimate where this phi is r log r. So, phi is applied to the argument which is the distance of two points, and this is the difference of velocities at those two points, and there is some constant in front. And so, what you do, you take, let's say the vorticity is zero near the bad part of the boundary. So, take the support of the vorticity and then integrate over the support. So, take all points x from that support and look at the points X from that support and look at the, if you have two solutions, look at the particle trajectory for one solution, for the other solution, and look how far they are at time t. And call this eta t if you integrate over the whole support. Okay, so you care where the particle trajectories go, but you care only those that start where the solution is not zero. Because where the solution is zero, then that just transports zero. So you don't really care which point transports to which point if they both transport just zero. That's basically the idea. And so then you just write. The idea. And so then you just write this as integral in time of the difference of velocities, and then you hack it out a little bit. And you have to be careful because there is a part of the boundary that's bad, but it's doable. So basically, this is how you prove that Lagrangian solutions are unique as long as you stay constant, vorticity stays constant near the bad part of the boundary. If the vorticity is not constant or becomes not constant near the bad part of the boundary, Becomes not constant near the bed part of the boundary. So, for example, imagine you have an obtuse corner and vorticity is initially, let's say, zero near that corner. But then you might have a particle trajectory that goes along the boundary and reaches that corner, because remember, I told you that the velocity is only Hilder near obtuse corner. So that could reach that corner in finite time, and then you have a problem. Okay, so without this hypothesis, this is a completely open question, except in the situation. Question, except in the situation when you only have acute corners, that's the papers that I mentioned before. And then there is one nice recent paper by Agarwal and Ahmot, who proved local uniqueness for a very special case, which is initial vorticity is greater or equal zero. The domain has a single obtuse corner, and the vorticity is supported on sort of one half of that angle or of that. Of that angle or of that corner. So you take the bisector of the corner, and the vorticity needs to be supported on that half that will actually go away from the corner. So if you have a sign of the vorticity, the vorticity forces the velocity to circulate in one direction around the domain. And so you want it to circulate so that it takes the non-zero initial support away from the corner. And so in that case, you have local uniqueness basically at the zero time. But of course, if later the vorticity managed to come back, Later, the vorticity managed to come back, then you have a problem. But still, this is a nice result, and it sort of tells you how difficult this problem is. So, if anybody here feels that there are not enough simple to state very difficult problems in fluids, here's another one. So, now, but I won't be able to say anything about that situation. Well, almost I will be able to say something, but about uniqueness, I won't be able to say anything. I won't be able to say anything when it comes to uniqueness when the solution is non-constant near the bad part of the boundary. Okay, so for uniqueness, I want to use this lemma that we proved with Lacarfe. Okay, and therefore, of course, I need to have a situation when the solution stays constant or zero near the bad part of the boundary. But I already told you before that if there is some part of the boundary that's bad, then the solution The solution or the support of the solution could move along the boundary from a good part of the boundary to the bad part. Okay, so in general, I cannot just assume to get sort of sufficiently general results, I cannot assume just that the solution is zero near the bad part of the boundary, but I should really assume that the solution is zero near the whole boundary, right? And then the question becomes: is it possible for particle trajectories to reach the boundary in finite time if they start inside the domain? Okay, and so this. Okay, and so that question is a different question from whether we can reach the bad part of the boundary along the boundary, because that definitely can happen in very general situations. But the question, when can we go from inside of the domain to the boundary infinite, and that's a much more subtle question. Okay, so and of course, once you answer this question, if you can answer that question, then the second question is, well, are these solutions then Lagrangian? Okay. Solutions than Lagrangian, okay? Because you just know something about particle trajectories, but you don't know whether the corresponding weak solutions are Lagrangian or not. Because if they are Lagrangian, then you can use the lemma that we proved with Lacarfe. Okay, and so the first result in this direction was Lacalve's result. He considered piecewise C11 domains with corners, finitely many, but none of them have to be acute. So they can be obtuse, they can be even greater than pi, angle greater than pi. Than pi, angle greater than pi, but um they cannot be acute, and the vorticity had a sign. And so he found an uh a Lyapunov functional for which he used to show that in finite time, so particle trajectories cannot reach the boundary. So basically, the Lyapunov functional was infinite at the boundary, and he showed some kind of Gronwill inequality for the Lyapunov functional on the particle trajectory, showing that it cannot become infinite in finite time. Infinite in finite time. And later with Lacafe, we improved this result. Still piecewise similar domains. Now corners only have to have angle less than pi, so includes acute or obtuse, but not non-convex corners. And the vorticity doesn't have to have a sign, so just general boundary vorticity. And we found a different Lyapunov functional for this result. Okay, so the question is. So, the question is: all right, so how about corners that are greater than pi? So, these non-convex corners. And we constructed an example that shows that actually particle trajectories can reach boundary in finite time for any of these situations when the corner is greater than pi, arbitrarily less greater than pi than you'd like. Less greater than pi than you'd like. Okay, so the construction, so it's a domain with a single corner, and the angle is this theta. And the construction is based on a sort of related or similar construction that we had with Sasha Kisilev. And here's the picture. So this is a stadium domain. It's basically an oval and another oval and they're joined at this common boundary. Joined at this common boundary. And so you have these two cusps here. And the point here is that if you have a symmetric, so odd vorticity, positive here, negative there, so you can really look at the solution as being just on the single state, the single oval here, and then just reflect it. And so if you have a solution that's non-negative here and is equal to one here and maybe zero near this common boundary of the Common boundary of the two ovals, then basically it will rotate things around and eventually this one will come here. Of course, then it will join with this minus one because of the symmetry, and so you'll have this continuous discontinuity in the solution. Okay, so that was a simple example of this phenomenon. And with LaCave, we use this idea to only get a domain with a coordinate that's arbitrarily smaller than pi, the angle. And so then The angle, and so then still you have the symmetry, and then you have a chunk of the solution here that will reach this corner in finite time here, and therefore the particle trajectory that starts on this dividing line will reach that corner in finite time. And that's because here the velocity has a Heler behavior near this point. Here, the velocity actually was just not zero at this point. Here, it has a Hilder behavior, and as long as the corner has an angle. And as long as the corner has an angle greater than pi, you can still do this. Okay, so that was the construction that we found with La Cave. And it tells you that once you have interior angles greater than pi, then you should just forget about it as far as the question is concerned of the particle trajectories reaching the boundary. They can reach it in finite time. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean you have known uniqueness, but this reaching of the boundary. This reaching of the boundary can happen for valid solutions, bounded omega. So, as a result, if you want to ask that question, then it only makes sense to consider domains which have interior corners with angles less than equal pi, or generally at any point of the boundary of the domain, the interior angle is less than equal pi. Okay, so you could have domains which sort of open up smoothly or at least continuously. Least continuously and are non-convex at this point here, but you can't have a corner like that. Okay, now if you have such domains, then they are regulated. So a regulated domain is a domain which at each point of the boundary has a forward and also a backward tangent vector. So what that means is you go around this domain and you're asking, is there a tangent vector? If there is a tangent vector, obviously it's both forward and backward, but then you can. It's both forward and backward, but then you come to this point, and here you don't have a tangent vector, but you have a forward tangent vector. So that means you look at this point and you look, where am I going from there? I'm going in this direction here. So the forward tangent vector is here. Also, at this point, you have a backward tangent vector where they come from. This is the backward tangent vector. Okay, so that's the definition of regulated domain. And it also includes the requirement that these vectors, both forward and backward tangent vector, have one-sided limits, which is the case. Which is the case here, for example, and is also the case in general domains that have interior angles less than or equal to pi. And so, for example, at this point, the forward vector, forward tangent vector goes like that. But at all these points, the forward tangent vector is pointing in this direction. So there's a one-sided limit. And of course, there's a one-sided limit at this point, which is the forward tangent vector at this point. Okay, so of course, the two one-sided limits are not the same. Okay, so. Same. Okay, so these domains are called regulated. And the nice thing is that for a regulated domain, there are some nice formulas for the Riemann mapping of the domain and for the Jacobian and the derivatives of the Riemann mapping if you map the domain onto the unit disk. And we are in two dimensions, so we can use complex analysis here. And that's very nice because from that, from those. Nice because from that, from those nice, precise formulas, one can dig something out and get some nice results. Okay, so let's take that Riemann mapping and let us call beta theta to be the argument of that forward tangent vector at a point which maps onto e to i theta on the unit disk. So the you take e to i theta on the unit disk, take the inverse under the Riemann mapping, look at the argument of the four. Look at the argument of the forward tangent vector at that point, calling beta theta. Now, this forward tangent vector, of course, as you go around the domain, once you do one full turn, you go counterclockwise, it adds 2 pi to it, right? So obviously it satisfies this. You can define it, of course, for theta on the real line. And so you get beta at theta plus 2 pi is beta at theta plus 2 pi. Okay, so anyway, so you have that. I won't care about the backward tangent vector. I won't care about the backward tangent vector, I only need the forward tangent vector, so that will be my beta. Okay, and so now here's a result that we obtain with Han, which is essentially a sharp answer to this question, when can particle trajectories reach the boundary. Okay, and so we do the following: take that forward tangent vector beta, which is a function of theta, and divide it into two functions. Now, you can divide it how you want, but Now, you can divide it how you want, but the idea is this beta plus should include, if possible, all the turns to the left, so where the tangent vector increases, and beta minus should include all the turns to the right. So, for example, if your forward tangent vector is a BV function, then you can absolutely do this. Okay, and so for example, here's a domain. Here you go around the domain and you only turn to the left. Okay, so you just you just put that into beta plus. So, beta plus is equal to beta. That into beta plus. So beta plus is equal to beta and beta minus is zero. But right here, you start turning the opposite direction, you start turning to the right. So then that you have to include into beta minus. So there, beta plus will be constant, for example, and beta minus will be non-constant, will be increase. Let's see, I have a plus beta minus, so I guess it will be decreasing. Okay. And now you don't have to do this. In fact, the only requirement. This. In fact, the only requirement is that beta plus must be non-decreasing. So you can only include encode into beta plus the turns to the right, to the left. But beta minus can be anything. It can include also turns to the left or right. But if you want to get a result, obviously turns to the right are problematic if they are jumps, because that means you have an angle with interior, sorry, you have a corner with interior angle greater than pi, right? So you are not going to get a positive result. So, you are not going to get a positive result if you have a corner like that. And you can't include that jump into beta plus because beta plus only includes turn to the left. So, you can include jump to the left, meaning a corner with angle less than pi. That goes into beta plus and is no problem. But if you have a corner with angle greater than pi, that needs to go into beta minus, and then your beta minus is not going to be continuous, and that is exactly going to be a problem. Okay, so you can only hope for a positive result if the beta minus is going to be continuous, and therefore we will assume also. continuous and therefore we will assume also that beta minus has some modules of continuity m which again we would need to be such that the m at zero is zero right because otherwise if you have non-continuous modules of continuity then you can have a corner with angle greater than pi right so um for instance if you have a convex domain then beta minus can be just it's up to you to pick it so beta minus can be just zero and beta plus can be the tangent angle because in a convex domain you always turn to the left and so then you can take your modulus of continuity to be m. Can take your modulus of continuity to be n. Okay, so that's the setup. So you take your tangent vector, which is forward tangent vector, which is given, and then you split it into two, however you want, as long as this one is non-increasing and this one has some modulus of continuity. Then you take that modulus of continuity, and there will be a condition which will be that sharp condition, and that uses this function qm, which is the following function, s times this exponential. Now, if you have modulus of continuity that If you have modulus continuity, that's for example Hilder, all those moduli are Dini modulus, moduli continuity. Dini means just this integral mr over r is finite. Okay, now if you have that, then this is basically just a constant, right? So there is s here, and this integral goes from s to one. So you can take it even from zero to one, that's a constant. So this whole exponential is just a constant. So this qm is just s, okay? In general, if you have worse modulus of continuity than Dini, then this can. Dini, then this can grow a little bit as s goes to zero. So this will be just s times something a little bit greater than s to than one. So it will be little of s to one minus a little bit. For any epsilon you can take, it's little of s to one minus epsilon. Okay, so but therefore this integral here, one over qm, could be infinite or could be finite. It's infinite when you have a Dini modulus of continuity. It when you have a Dini modulus of continuity, so all the holders, etc., and even a little bit more than Dini, but it could be also finite. And so here's the result. If, oh, by the way, if we have a convex domain, just general convex domain doesn't have to be smooth, then m, of course, can be picked to be zero. So you can pick this to be just s. And so definitely that's the case here. Okay, so here's the positive result. So if this integral is infinite, so you have a Dini modulus, for example, for beta minus, and Minus, and you take any initial condition that's bounded, then first any weak solution is Lagrangian. Okay, so in particular, all particle trajectories that start inside the domain they remain in the domain. Okay, so they remain in the domain, there is no vorticity created, vorticity is just being transported. So that's the first one. So, as a result, the lemma I told you about before with LACAV, that lemma will. Before with LACAV, that lemma will hold for general weak solutions because they are Lagrangian. And then the second result here is that if you start with initial data that's constant near the boundary, so for example, supported inside the domain, then of course particle trajectories cannot reach the boundary in finite time. Therefore, they won't reach the bad part of the boundary in finite time either. And therefore, the solution is unique. Okay, so that's if the domain satisfies this. So if you can split the forward. This is so, if you can split the forward tangent vector into an increasing part and a part that's continuous with a modulus that satisfies that. Now, the second part of the result is the opposite, and that is that if you take any modulus which doesn't satisfy this condition, so the integral here is finite, and the modulus is concave, in principle modulus of continuity does not need to be concave. So, if it's also concave, then there is a domain which has the form. Which has the forward tangent vector that can be split into a non-increasing part and a part that satisfies these modules of continuity, but there is also a weak solution of Euler on the domain that has a particle trajectory that reaches the boundary in finite time. Okay, so that's a counterexample or that's the opposite result to this one. Okay, so this is a sharp condition on how continuous the forward tangent vector. The forward tangent vector needs to be, but only we worry about the turns to the right. So, sort of how continuous the turns to the right need to be. And so, obviously, that means that basically there is going to be some kind of opening here that needs to be continuous, that's going to be sort of a borderline. And if you go past that, if it opens faster than that around this point, opens towards non-convex, then. Opens towards non-convex, then you can have particle trajectories that can reach the boundary in finite time. Okay, so let's see. We also, with Han, so this is a result with my student, and so we also, in the case when the particle trajectories do not reach the boundary in finite time, in that case, we also obtained a optimal. Obtained an optimal sort of up to a constant optimal estimate on how quickly they can reach they can approach the boundary, and so that's this result. So, if we have this integral to be infinite, we'll take the function, which is the inverse function to the inside of this parenthesis. So, inverse function to logarithm integral from y to one, and so it's a function of this ratio, or this one over the reciprocal of the qm, right? And so, this is a function of y. Right, and so this is a function of y. Take the inverse function, call it rho m. And so, in particular, because this integral is infinity, so where y is zero, this is going to be infinity. So, rho m at infinity is zero. So, meaning if the argument becomes infinite, that you are at the boundary, right? So, sorry, rho m will be zero, and so that's a lower bound on how far you are from the boundary, so that you could be at the boundary. Okay, and so the result is the following. So, take this inverse function, which by So, take this inverse function, which by the way, if you have a Dini modulus of continuity, then this Qm is just S. So, this 1 over S integral from Y to 1 will just give you log of Y. So, this is log log Y. The inverse function is going to be double exponential, E2 minus E2Y, right? So, and so here are upper and lower bound. So, first you take any domain, any subdomain inside compactly supported, compactly containing D, and you add. Contain in d and you ask how close can you get at time t to the boundary with trajectories that start inside this d prime here and the lower bound is a constant times time and put that inside this row m so for example if you had any modulus continued to get the usual double exponential or bound okay and the constant is 300 we just decided we want to have some kind of actual constant there Kind of actual constant there. And so we got three, we could get all the way to 300. You can get a little bit better, but then it would require much more work. So anyway, so that's the lower bound. And then there is also an upper bound in the sense that we can construct on domains like this or domains that have this modulus M, whatever the M modulus M is, that satisfies this. Okay, so we can construct stationary solutions, in fact. So the solution is stationary, but of course the So, the solution is stationary, but of course, the particle trajectories are not, they move, they are not stationary. Okay, so constant solution with moving particle trajectories such that a particle trajectory is closer to the boundary than, again, rho m c t, but this is a different constant than this constant here. Okay, so there is a difference in the constant, but you know, for example, for Dini modulus, these are both double exponential, obviously, just with different constants in the exponents. Okay, so as I said, for Dini continuous M, you just get. Dini continuous m, you just get double exponential. In fact, you get double exponential also for something like this. And you can think of this as a borderline case. So constant over logarithm R, that modulus is not Dini, it's just barely not Dini. And if that constant is less than pi over 2, then you approach the boundary double exponentially and no faster. And of course, in this case, the boundary is far from C to alpha in principle. So the solution itself is far from log-Lipshit. The solution itself is far from log-lipsheets near the boundary, but the approach rate to the boundary is the same as if it was Log Lipsheets. Now, the borderline case is when this constant A is equal to pi over 2. So if your modulus is like that, then you get triple exponential approach. So you get lower and upper bound of the same magnitude. And finally, if the constant is greater than pi over 2, then actually you can approach the boundary in finite time. Okay, so you can think. Time. Okay, so you can think of this as a borderline case constant actually pi over two divided by logarithm r. But of course, we can also do we can also tinker more around this spot and we can get you know quadruple exponential and quintuple exponential, et cetera, approaches of the boundary. So you can make it even more precise. Anyway, so those are the main results. Let me tell you a little bit about the proof. Let's see, I have Let's see, I have another 15 minutes, right, or so. So that should be good enough. So here's the Biosavar law, of course. This is the stream function that you can find from the vorticity SD inversal Dirichlet Laplacian. And because we have our Riemann mapping, so we can take the form of the Green's function on the unit disk and then just move it onto our domain. And so this is what you get. Domain, and so this is what you get. Okay, and this is, of course, the vorticity. And now, if you want to know the distance of a trajectory from the boundary, and this is actually the distance on the disk, so you map the trajectory onto the unit disk and then take one minus absolute value of that, right? And you want to know how it changes, then you differentiate it, and you get a complete mess here. Okay, now it turns out it's not such a bad mess because you can cancel some terms or at least remove. Terms, or at least remove some terms. Like, for example, you only care what happens near the boundary. So there, this t is one, right? You are near the boundary of the unit disk here. So this is one, so they can go away. This one minus square is one plus that, which is about two, and one minus that is left, which is d itself. So you get d prime less than or equal to constant times d times something else. If this something else were to be bounded by a constant, of course, you can use Gronwald and you are done. Wall and you are done. Okay, obviously, it's not going to be bounded by a constant, but you can hope that it might be bounded by a log of the distance from the boundary, then you get a double exponential approach. So you try to do what you can do. And so there are other terms here that also can be a little bit simplified. So using that, you get this. And if you look at this thing, you know, it looks annoying, but actually, what is this? So this is just the Jacobian of the Riemann map. The Jacobian of the Riemann mapping, and this is the inverse Jacobian. And this fraction here, you know, it's bounded most of the time. When it explodes is when your Z, you integrate your Z is near the point. So Z is on the unit disk now. So you take this integral over D and you just move it to an integral over unit disk. So you get an extra Jacobian here. Okay, so when Z is near the point, the particle trajectory, then you have a problem here. Trajectory, then you have a problem here, and this is a problem only if z is near the point and the point is near the boundary. Okay, so obviously, that's the crucial issue: how to treat it when your particle trajectory is near the boundary, and specifically when it's near a bad part of the boundary. Okay, and so then, you know, this is a little bit problematic, so you need to look at what these two Jacobians here do. Now, if the part of the boundary that you are near is, for example, a corner with angle less than pi, well, that should be good, right? Well, that should be good, right? Because we know that that's fine. And the reason that's good is because this Jacobian here of the Riemann mapping is very small. So you have angle less than pi. To move it onto unit disk, you need to apply z to power one plus something. That means the Jacobian of that mapping is going to be small. That's going to be cancelled out by this inverse Jacobian or Jacobian of the inverse here, but that's okay because you integrate that around the point. Integrate that around the point. So, you know, near the corner, this is bad. Sorry, this is very good. And this is very bad at the corner, but if you integrate a little around, it's not as bad. And so that's the general idea why this might work. On the other hand, if you are near an obtuse corner, this is actually obviously bad, very bad, let's say. And this is very good at that corner, but if you integrate around, it's not as good. So maybe it won't be making up for how bad. Won't be making up for how bad this is. Okay, so that's the idea why something like this could work. And so, in fact, it does. So, I'll just write the same formula here, but instead of this T of the particle trajectory, I just put a X C there, because in the end, I just need a bound on this. There is no time, need to, no time needs to be involved here, right? So I just need a simple estimate. This is a simple estimate on a unit disk, basically. So I call x, the point of the particle trajectory. Then, of course, as a result, I'll be able to get some bound on this important term. And so this is that term. And I get a bound like this. And again, this is a sort of very long estimate, but let me first say that with Lacafe, we got the same thing, but we got a sort of not such a sharp estimate on this. We just considered the situation. Consider the situation when there are finitely many corners and they could be acute or obtuse. And we got an estimate which looks like this. So instead of this thing here, there was a constant times logarithm of 1 minus c. And remember, that's precisely the situation that gives you double exponential approach because you get d prime is less than or equal to constant times d times log d. Okay, so you get double exponential approach. So you get double exponential approach. So now with Hahn, we got a much sharper estimate. And again, if this M is a Dini modulus of continuity, so including all the Hilder moduli, then this integral is just finite, even if you go all the way from 0 to 1. You integrate from how far you are from the boundary here. So even if you integrate from 0 to 1, you get just a constant. So this whole thing is... You get just a constant. So, this whole thing is just a constant. And then, if you have a Dini modulus, this Qm is just one over S, so you get log 1 minus C. So, what you get here is basically constant times log 1 minus C plus constant. The two constants are slightly different because this constant depends on the domain, on the Riemann mapping, whereas these constants actually here and here, that doesn't depend even on the domain. So, this is the only one that depends on the domain. With LaCar, we got a constant that depends on the domain in front. This is a minor issue. Anyway, so. Minor issue. Anyway, so the point is: if you have a Dini modulus of continuity, this just gives you that log one minus C and therefore double exponential approach. But if you have worse than Dini, you can still get good enough bounds. So you get this bound and then you plug it in and you hack it out and you can find that actually you get an approach rate which is like this. Which is like this, provided that integral is infinite. Okay. So that's the idea of the proof. I'm not going to tell you anything more about the proof of this lemma. It uses the formula that I told you for the Riemann mapping and for its Jacobian in terms of this beta. And you have to split it into, beta is the forward tangent vector. You have to split it into beta plus, beta minus parts. One of them is non-increasing. The other one, and that one is good, the other one is continuous with the modulus. The other one is continuous with the modulus, and then you have to separate the integral, of course, into many regions and get some estimate. And eventually, after 10 pages, it works out. So that's the sort of main lemma in this result. And with that, you can then prove this sharp result on approach of particle trajectories to the boundary. Now, so that gives you the answer to that question, but then there is a second question. But then there is a second question. Okay, so now those solutions, which I know now the particle trajectories will not approach the boundary, regardless of whether the solution is supported initially inside the domain or not. So any boundary vorticity. Now, which of those solutions can I guarantee to be Lagrangian? Okay, and so with Lacafe, we considered the solutions that are constant near the boundary initially. And then we showed that because And then we showed that because particle trajectories don't reach the boundary, obviously the support of the solution or the non-constant part of the solution doesn't reach the boundary. And then we showed that indeed those solutions have to be Lagrangian. And we did it by extending the vorticity to the whole plane by just zero and then extending velocity accordingly and then applying de Pernalion's theory. But for this, we needed some regularity of the domain. Of the domain away from those finitely many corners because this extended velocity needed to have a certain regularity. And so, with Hahn, we found a different way to do this, which does not require extension of the vorticity and the velocity beyond the domain, and therefore doesn't require information about or some kind of doesn't require some kind of regularity of the boundary. So, here's another theorem that Another theorem that corresponds to this. And so you take a weak solution on any bounded open domain. You don't need any information about the regularity of the boundary. And for every point x in the domain, you take the particle trajectory and you record the first time when it reaches the boundary, which of course might be infinity. And then the result says that if you take any time greater than zero, Time greater than zero, and you take all the points which did not yet reach the boundary, then the vorticity is transported on that set of points. So if there are some points that reach the boundary, if there is a positive measure of those points, then obviously those could transport vorticity out of the domain and so that vorticity could disappear. But because of measure, because of incompressibility, Measure because of incompressibility, you also then have a positive measure of points where particles enter the domain from the boundary. And those could bring some vorticity into the domain. So then the solution would not be Lagrange, obviously. But the theorem doesn't, that's not a problem for the theorem. It just says if you only look at those points which did not leave the domain yet, did not reach the boundary in finite time, then the vorticity has to be. Or infinite time, then the vorticity has to be transported by them. Okay, and so this can be done actually by looking at just the linear PD, the transport PD, where U is considered just as an advecting velocity field that doesn't need to be necessarily related to omega. Of course, it is. And that's because the weak formulation of both the transport PD and the Euler PD is the same. They have the same weak formulation. It's just that for the Euler PD, you also require. It's just the Fourier Ole predict, you also require that U is the velocity that corresponds to the vorticity. Okay, and so there are some results of Bonnie, Katagusev, and Boyer that we could use to show that as long as the velocity field is locally Lipschitz inside the domain, but doesn't have to be locally Lipschitz globally on the domain. Sorry, it doesn't have to be globally Lipschitz on the domain. So as long as we have the situation, which of course we have, then the solution to the transported PD is unique. And then if it's unique, it also Then, if it's unique, it also there is also a solution to a transport PD that is Lagrangian, so the unique solution must be Lagrangian, and therefore, every weak solution to the Euler PD, which is also a weak solution to transport PD, must be Lagrangian. So it must transport the vorticity. But of course, that doesn't mean we have uniqueness for Euler, because that would require also uniqueness for Lagrangian solutions of Euler, and that, of course, is not the same statement. But in any case, But in any case, this shows that in particular, weak solutions to Euler are Lagrangian if and only if, for almost all points, the trajectory stays inside the domain forever. Doesn't have to stay for all points. So, for example, on this picture here, the trajectories, or even here, for example, the trajectories of points that start here, if I have a symmetric odd solution, those trajectories will leave the boundary. Trajectories will leave the boundary. So it will leave the domain, will reach the boundary in fine time. But that is just a measure zero set of trajectories. So that doesn't say that solution, there are non-Lagrangian solutions on a domain like that or domain like that. Okay? But so it only says, the result only says that a weak solution is Lagrangian if and only if full measure of trajectories remain inside the domain forever. Okay, and of course, if we Of course, if we have these domains that we considered in the previous result, then they satisfy that. In fact, all the trajectories stay inside, but there again might be other domains where this might still be true. So there's obviously a natural question then, and this is an open question, can actually this happen in some domains that there is a positive measure of trajectories that reach the boundary in finite time? Obviously, they have to reach the boundary at some singular points of the At some singular points of the boundary. And the question is: can you have enough singular points so that you can reach the boundary in finite time for bounded vorticity solutions? And obviously, if you can, then you wouldn't, you are unlikely to have uniqueness because then you would have also a bunch of points, a bunch of vorticity that enters boundary from somewhere else. Because if something leaves, something has to enter because of incompressibility. So you shouldn't expect uniqueness in that case. But if you do have this situation, If you do have this situation, you do not have this situation, so solutions are always such that the positive full measure of trajectories stay inside the domain, and that means solutions are always Lagrangian, then it's still a question whether those Lagrangian solutions are unique. And we don't know that either, except in the situation that I told you when the initial vorticity is constant near the boundary and the domain satisfies that. Domain satisfies that condition that I presented here. So let me just close with these two open questions. Thank you. Okay, great. Thanks, Andre.
