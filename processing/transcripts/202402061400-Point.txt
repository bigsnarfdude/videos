Ideals and shall exacts. Thank you. So I would like to thank Adri for the invitation. And so she suggested that we talk on a part of Metalieron thesis of English. So, this result is not one. I mean, and I understood that it would be in somewhat predicted by Jusie. And I I'm going to say some word about the first part of the TC. First part of the thesis and went by Anterju. So the main topic of the thesis was about what is called exponential topological fields with a generic derivation. with a generic derivation. So derivation, which just means that it behaves in the correct way with respect to the exponential function. So generic means two things for me that you you look at existentially closed classes of such fields. So Of such fields, so and you don't have a topology, but you don't ask a priori any interaction between the topology of your field and the derivation. So, it's in some sense orthogonal to what was described by Mikael about RD fields. So, in some sense, this you talk Sometimes you don't try to describe models of to describe certain classes of fields. The game is to take a well-behaved class of exponential topological fields and to add on top of it a derivation and ask yourself: do I have is the class of existential class models elementary? Can give an And can give an axiomatization. So, in this case, my question is description, some sort of description of these models. And it will be, I mean, one, so we, of course, we put some conditions on this class of topological fields. So, but it will be your One of the applications will be if you take T a theory of reals with the exponential function, so the version one or if you take let's say we have QP with so this was described. Um so this was described by um Florence Darm√ºllen at the short talk, P D X. So of course here the I mentioned this because you don't necessarily assume that the exponential function is defined everywhere. So here will be defined on the valuation. Or you can take a CP So Cp is just you take the algebraic closure of Qp and then you complete and then you show it's algebraically closed. So this is a model of a series of PRTP additive close fields and this is a model of ACT algebraic. So, algebraic transval field of characteristic and residual character TP. So, here the residue field is just the algebraic feature of FP. So, this has been shown to be model complete by with P. So, here both of these cases have also modeled completeness and it was a result of better than Barnum. Of Better Very Bangladesh. So, a student, a KG student of Alex. So, these theories are well behaved, and then you show that in this case, you do have a positive answer to this question. And to say that, I mean, it's really different from what happens in artificial. what happens in the RD fields or field of trans theories, because here the field of constants will be dense in the field. Will be a different, completely different situation. Okay, so what is a possible connection between this part and the other part? So a possible connect uh a connection is that um A connection is that in the talk of Kirby, he recalled what is the algebraic closure, a notion of algebraic closure in this setting of exponential fields. So ECL was defined using avansky systems. And I want to show that this closure operation gives you a good notion of dimension. You need a good notion of dimension. So, the better satisfies the exchange property is to show that it's equal to another closure operation defined using E-derivation. So, in this case, it was not defined. So, if for every E-derivation which Which is zero on D, it is zero on T. So it's like in the algebraic case. Okay, so now let me let me go really to the base topic of my This is a best topic of my talk. So, what I plan to do, of course I mean, so my plan is just first to recall, to give a quick recall of the classical functional results. Just to point out what are the difficulties in this setting of exponential fields, then since I use in the proof to recall the construction of e polymer ring. So So let me uh this before the talk K will be an exponential field possibly uh E will be possibly partially different, so the characteristic of K is zero. Characteristic of K is zero, just because characteristic P case will have depot elements, it's not a good idea. And so on. I may say this at least will be denoted this, and it will be a union. Well, I suppose. Well, I suppose some of you know this construction of blueprints. And then I will state. And I suppose in between I want to stress that you cannot expect a result which is a little bit confused. But just to tell you what what we what we x the number of so x is will be always x1 x9. Okay. So what is the classical model and that so you So you take, so in just current, so you take an ideal I, you look at the set of zeros of I. So I didn't assume that k was algebraically closed, so we just take so no, k is just an ordinary thing. So you look at the set of zeros in an algebraic closure of K, and then you look at the set of polynomials which annihilates, which are zeros on this subset. This is used as a subset of k-diagram. And you look the control. And you look for condition uh so you look for like a membership uh uh an ideal membership condition. So I'm sure that is equivalent to saying that F belongs to the prime ideal of R. This is the prime ideal. So this is the intersection of prime ideals containing R. Continue I class continues set up. So sample of F belongs to I. Okay, so a proof, so this is an old theorem, but a proof which I think is due to the risky, the following. Also, maybe, okay, no, I will do this. So it's easily seen that first of all I is included in I give I so the radical of I is also included in this set, in this ideal, in this ideal. So the difficulty is just to go the other way. So a way to prove this is the following. To prove this is the following. So you prove the proof is by induction on N, the proof is by induction on N. And you show that proof of what, so you show that if M is a maximal ideal, then this quotient Then this question is an algebraic extension, as a kid. Don't you have to stick to algebraic closure? I mean, I think also in the ring. Yeah, I would definitely... No, I'm not working. Sorry? Don't you need to work on algebraic closure? No, I mean I'll prove this. I mean, I don't suppose that k is algebraic from k. So in case if n equals 1, this is good. So now what we are going to use is that this polynomial name, this is fine, is what is This is fine, is what is called a new button. Just because this this you are old. So what is this definition? R, sorry I should here. So R, should R be a commutative ring? So R is a real button. If every maximum, if every prime ideal is an intersection of maximal ideal is an intersection of maximum function. So, in particular, this one here. In particular, it's why here you just look enough to look at what happens when you take a portion by maximum. And what we also use that is so, okay, so this is the definition. So the property that we will use is that So if R is an input ring then R of X has the same property. So here X is just one tab and to be To be um a nepertrain, so R is a neighbor twin if only if m is a maximum ideal of all x when strays on all Trace on R is oxymaximolecular. Okay, so the first thing is just to show that this polynomial is depth, and then you will use this property to proceed by induction. So, um not totally organized, but so the continuation of the proof is that so um let R B k is extra x and minus 1 so night So now I take so I take m a maximal idea of k of x1 xn. So m intersection intersection with r is also maximal. So r over m q is algebra equal to q is algebra equal to q And when you reduce yourself to the one variable case, so you consider the ideal M0 R of Xn and sorry, and it's just commuted by Japan. When you show that R over M zero R over m zero x n so okay, so this is uh over M B I should over R over M C and so since And so, since being algebraic is transitive, you get your results. Yeah, I'm still confused about the convention algebraic clause. Where is it used? It's not used anymore. I don't want to use it. Because in the exponential case no metanik, the Mushtensax holds all for algebraic equals to Only some algebraically constant. Okay, I have a proof I present this force. No, but I mean here I consider the set of zeros in the algebraic closure. Why I avoid it to take k from the start to be algebraically closed. What I show is that this thing is algebraically closed. So this thing is algebraic of the key. And now from this, I don't want to from this is really, I am not cheating, it's easy to see that we have the other direction, meaning that if F belongs to this ideal, then it belongs to the radical. Because you show that this belongs to the idea. Because you show that this belongs to every maximal ideal containing R. So, of course, this intersection of maximal ideal is just the jack of some radical, but we use that. I mean, in the proof, we also use that this ring, this polynomial ring, was a delta train. So, intersection of maximal ideal of a Jecherson radical is equal to the prime radical. So I wanted to, I spent some time doing this, maybe this is a mistake, but the first obstruction is that the ring of e polynomial, the dentist on this quite yet, is not an invertible. It doesn't have this property. On the other hand, I mean, from this remark I remark I on the fact that about ECL, but I recall we do have a good notion of algebraic closure, of E-Ageb. And okay, so this is one of the so in some sense I well I've used several times this property. This property, but otherwise I didn't use a lot. And so before the remark of Selma, which was a bit this is true when you think about non-channel sets, you think about multiple complete theories. And there are non-channel sets for not for um So um differenti uh rings of differential polynomials are rings of different polynomials and every time if you take a field of practical T0, you have one of complete service like DCF0 or ECFL. But it can happen and so nu Genza is a normal. That is an old theorem, but from time to time you see recent papers about effectivity considerations. The recent paper, or it's not there, of Jean Freytak and Charsenches about Munchences in differential in differential polynomials. But you can ask, so this F belongs to the radical, so some power of F. To the radical, so some power of F belongs to I, so you can ask, can you bond with F? Or if I is given by a finite number of polynomials, some case of the reality, you can ask, is this, I mean, first, can I detect if this is true? And then, if I have this property, what is the component? What is the complexity? So, for instance, of the coefficients of the generators of I in terms of F? Is there a relationship between the complexity of F and the complexity of generators of I and the coefficient which takes these into witnesses. Witnesses. And also, this bore of F, can I bond this bore of F in terms of data, open data. Okay, but and the last thing I want to say is that there was a rather recent work of Stanlan, Togridin, and of Shinnikov about an ultralances for ring of sequences, say, okay. With a shift. So a different swing. And in this case, strangely enough, the theory of these different swings with a shift is not undecidable. So it's not completely true. I mean, it's not always true, but you do get solution that only the case when you have model complete zeros. Okay, so so. Okay, so sorry for this long introduction. And maybe a general thing, maybe I will say something by the end of my talk. You can of course look at exponential adult fields, other classes of fields. Odd case you can say maybe I have a theory of R exponent. I have a theory of Rx which is well yes maybe I have better chance to have a better lived theorem a result okay so the second part is the description of exploring of exponential polynomials so this will be used by Lucy in a talk on the first day Also, it's as I said, it's a union of grouping. And the description that I've taken from a paper of Rand in Greece, an old paper of Rand in Greece, who showed that let me set notation, so R. Rotation, so r is an exponent, it's a domain. So E is always the exponential function characteristic zero. Then this subject, the domain discovered, is a given domain and he identifies the invertible elements. Uh huh and you and you belongs to the un of R F Some extra maturity. So as I said, it's a union of groups. So you start a union of group prince. So first of all, so let me mention an opinion book and the cycle will be always. And in fact, it will be always torsion-free. Not necessary, but and so either way, I can take it away, doesn't matter. So a group ring is just a set of all finite sums. When you take the perfect, so these elements are in R and the G R's are in G. The G i's are in G. So, how do you multiply it? So, these i's are in G. So, you don't have any issue of sports. And to multiply, so to add is just formal, and to multiply, you just use the fact that r is the same. And so the construction, at the first step, you start with M then second step you take the ordinary polynomial X and string. When strings come begin begin to happen since stage one, okay. So you decompose this as R, that's so you decompose this as a group, maybe the group. So let me so what is H0 is the set of polynomials with no with no constant term. And then you proceed. Or less as a field case, so you take a multiplicative cooking of this amino group. And you define, okay, and then you form R1 to be equal to L0. So this is a group, so you use this group print construction to A0. Then you decompose this as when you can guess what happens as you direct sum of R1 So the formal definition of R1 is the free R1 oh this is I shouldn't have said that so A1 is the free R1 magnetic file of T A of A in is to minus analog of polynomials we can so and you define so you want to extend your exponential function on Your exponential function on R, which might be partially defined, it's important. So define a lab that I'm going to call from L0 to R1. So we send L0 plus D0 to R. To B equals so this this is an element of R minus one, this is an element of K0 and you do this at every level so by induction you suppose RK is Suppose IKEA has been as being constructed composes as Ik minus 1 plus double sum AK and then you form a multiplicative copy of AK and so RK plus 1. So Rk plus one Rk T of Ak and Ek R K I K plus one sending R plus so use this decomposition so this belongs to IP so use sorry what issue Sorry, I already shoot this and give a map of RK so it's sent to E k minus one of R E for k okay. And I hope I did not mess up with my princes. So now this range of exponential polynomials, which is defined as the student of the k with this map and it's an exponential. So it's an exponential way with E of A or E of A and A belongs to this union. So it belongs at some level. Yeah, okay. Just to show that uh what I stated here, but if you have a domain and you still have a nice running. And this construction also, even though I will not use it, what I'm going to say, gives you a natural notion of the complexity of an element. So if you You unravel the construction, you can write any element of your ring. So A belongs to IK. A can be written as A0 plus A1 plus AK where, so this is belonging. Where uh so this is belongs this is polynomial and the other ones belongs to A1 AP. So the complexity of A will be described by this ordinal. So it will be so omega i the rank of Ai that is not Of AI, so what is the rank? So if you are a polynomial, it's just the degree, or the total degree, some sense. And if you appear here, you can be written as a formal sum. We call that A1 was the three R. The free R1 module generated by TA, so these elements are a finite sum of things like this with coefficient R1, and you count the length of a set. And if P equals if and then so um okay, so let me just I think this is enough. Why I'm mentioning this is that to work in this polynomial ring, as if you work with polynomials, you can work by induction on this complexity. And an observation is that if you don't have any polynomial part, you can put out an exponential and An exponential and drop this number. And if you have a polynomial part, if you take the derivative, you will drop a degree. Okay, so it's a way to do things by induction. So I went over this construction because, on the one hand, It will explain. I needed to state the result, our result. And also, I mean, it's a way to show that you lose this property of being E ring K F X E. K of x e. So now like K of field KField of characteristics is zero but an inverse point. So the a prime ideal is not necessarily like perfection, but maximal ideal and this is due to uh And this is due to um well maybe okay I I will I will put this but um can find so it's a consequence of the result on some of the proposition of a question so that G is on good wings, so that G be Group wings, so they a Labelian group, a torsion free labeling group of infinite. So if you have a Tausian Fabian group, by taking the tonsor product with Q rationals, you can view it as Q vector space and so you can calculate it. Can calculate the dimension of this q vector space, the dimension of this q vector space of infinite infinite rank, which is equal. So, the definition is a dimension of this vector space. So, you consider the So you consider the blue, so I is a ring. So you consider the blue queen, I G and we give a necessary condition, a necessary and sufficient condition for Ig to be equal. And one of the conditions is that, so I will not state the first, I will not state the condition, but one of them which fails in this case is that all one, I mean it's two conditions, all homomorphic images Of R as cardinality. So in fact, it was, I suppose, well, it was necessarily sufficient, but I mean the predecessor of this result was done by Hooling. On book ring performance. On who praying upper from age? Um that's uh what is alpha? Oh, sorry, is that J? Okay, thank you. So if you take k of cardinality alpha, so this what so we see that So we see that we saw that this was say K and then T A0 divided some A1. I didn't really show this, but at this finite level we saw it. So if you calculate the torsion free rank of this thing, those case controls are the same. Both case countable polynomials with non-constant terms. So you will get countable rank here, and k is countable. So this condition will not be satisfied. Okay. So now I should, before my talk is over, maybe I should at least state the thing. So another So another um okay, no no, so uh this in the ordinary case we have ideals, so as usual when you have um a differential or a different or an automorphism or some operators in your VK, you should change the notion of ideas. The notion of ideals, in order to get the property, if you take the here the ring of exponential represent out by an ideal, you do get an exponential ring. So there is a notion of E ideal. So it's just an ideal with the additional property that, so any ideal of k of xt. Um I so i is an idea plus if uh f belongs to i, then uh f minus n belongs to i. So then you can define, if this is the case, if you take f plus i, you can define this exponential on piece. Exponential on this quotient on this class as Pf plus White positive. F minus F prime minus I will PF minus F prime minus I minus I, so that images. And we have minus f prime minus the number. Okay, so you have and contrary to what will happen in the talk of Juzy, so for me E idl prime E idl or maximum E ideal would just be E idl which is Which is prime, which is a prime ideal respectively, a maximum ideal. And so the colours that you obtain foiling So you have F1 is M and G you have to k of X E when you look at Then you look at the mini, so we call that k of x e, if I use the same notation that I did before. So you start with the order, so k0 is the orderly polynomial ring, and then you do this construction of blueprints, taking each time a middle disc of a part of what you have. So suppose that, so let L be minimum such that every f1, fn of g belongs to fn. Okay, yes. And suppose there is a maximal ideal. M of F N containing f minus m and satisfying K L no? Agree with you, agree with you, sorry, thank you. Yes, I changed my notification. And satisfying his extension condition xn which is what? So you ask that when you look at your ideal in the previous levels. Then, and you take the exponential, you do have the condition that it's a ne ideal. So, of course, if this is not satisfied, you don't have any a priori. So, the idea is just to extend, using this construction, this inductive construction of bookings, to extend your ideal into an ideal. Your ideal into an ideal which is a Ni ideal. Axima D ideal. And so, in some sense, this condition is necessary. You are not going to be able to modify your ideal below Ki. So, under this condition, and so you suppose that you assume that G vanishes. At each command zero of F1 Fn, so where? Okay, in any partial exponential field containing KE. Uh containing uh KE and she belongs to K. So the result is that, okay, so maybe I know that my time is almost over, but I will state, so in case, so it is constr construce construe contrived, it's not Totally nice, okay? So I work with maximal ideals. In some sense, I cannot go to prime ideals because of this training of exponential polynomial not being antrain. And so, why do we need partial here? It's just because, so s in. So, as in the usual thing, you prove a weak notch and Z and then you use the Rabinovich trick. And in this trick, so this Rabinovich trick consists in adding a new variable, y, and we have to consider a polynomial ring which is of a form Kxt. Of a form kxd turns a product with an ordinary polynomial rule. And so, in the thing, even though we will quotient out by a maximal ideal, the exponential function will not be everywhere defined. And so, of the case l equals 1, then we don't need this condition. So, if l1 just over here, we use the here we use the fact that let I the idea generated by F1 Fm suppose it's a property okay so this is just for exponential polynomial with one iteration of the exponential function and then in this case you do have the same Do have the same conclusion. So G belongs to the Jacobson radical of intersection of maximal radio with point A. So while here we don't need this condition, This condition is, I mean, in this case, we use the fact that the ring of polynomials is not terminal. So it allows us to not to need this condition. And I want to end my talk by a remark. If you want to do this in C Exp, C exp. So there was a nice example by Paula, Juzi, and Togio. So even with one iteration of the exponential function, they exhibit the polynomials of Cx. So the two the we take EZ, so Ex minus C and E X E I X. Ix minus one. So you show, and you should use a trick by twit, that this is a proper idea. But you know you cannot never have, so okay. And C does not belong to Ei of the exponential function 2 pi D. So a 0 of this is just something of a function. This is just something of a form, of this form, and C does not belong to this. So you can. So this is for difficult, like you have to show its proper. But so this ideal will never, this two polynomials will never have if you insist in keeping the kernel of exponential function. But an exponential function fixed will even for you as a proper ideal never find in any extension common zero. So this shows the limitation of what one can do, and I'm sorry to have come over time. Thank you. Well we do have coffee breaks so I think we have some time for questions. Time for questions. Maybe you mentioned already, but do you know if it's still true without the partial? In the proof, we need partial. But I don't know. It's a good question. I feel that these conditions are reasonable, able to extend. Also, what I should Also, what I should have mentioned is that this condition comes from what is known as augmentation ideas in group points. So it's a way to construct, if you have a grouppring RG, you have an ideal of R, and then you want to extend it to an ideal of a group ring, and you use this map sending the formal sum, sum of Listen. So we, for technical thing, use this what is called. So this is in R genes and this is in R. But you use this map to get, so from an ideal here, you want just an ideal in the next level. So you look at and find you can just So you have an ideal in here and take a kernel of this map and get an idea here and you figure that this kernel will have how you extend an idea from level L to level L plus one how you use this condition. So but about your question, I mean answer is I don't know, okay. I just one more about the clarification of the statement. So what you mean is that this holds for every maximal ideal as a collision? No, I mean here I did work with I mean I stated with one maximal item. But I mean you said suppose there is a maximal item. You're saying suppose there is a maximal ideal for this, then you can point out, but in fact, this falls whenever the maximal ideal satisfies this. So it's whenever there is a max, whenever the maximal ideal satisfies this, then you have this test. Yes, because it's a member of the shared test. Yeah, and and and the reason is that the Reason is that the idea is that if you do have such idea using the inductive construction of group rings or this ring of e-polynomials, I can extend this n to any ideal, which is messy. So how how uh do you check that like if you are given F one and F M how do you find out whether there is such an M? Whether there is such a map. This is the kind of effectivity condition or effectivity issues that you can ask. No, I mean this is I mean this I think it has room for improvements. Yes. I want to ask why you say here maximal iridia, you mean I think ideal you mean at this maximum s ideal correct sorry when you write when you say maximal exponential ideal yes you mean an exponential ideal which is a maximal test okay so push is a feature yeah yeah yeah okay it's interesting the second there is also a global version of this result right there is also a global version of this Global version of this result, right? Instead of looking at Kno, you look at the world K R C, right? I mean, you take maximum idea not in Kn, you can take it also a different if you want, but in a response to the exponential Boeing or exponential Boeing organs have a similar result, but in which case? In which case? I mean, a version of this result where you don't look at KL, that you want directly in R week C. Yes, it's what, I mean, our issue was to find a knee ideal, to extend an ideal to a knee ideal. This was the issue. The question is that you have an idea. The question is that you have an an ideal and how when how wh wh when can it be extended to any ideal without losing this construction improvement okay let's thank Francois again Now we have a coffee break until 3:30.
