First of all, thanks very much to the organizers for the invitation. It's great to be here. What I'm going to talk about is part of a larger project where I am trying to extend basically definitions of fluoro homology and Foucault categories to certain instances in generalized complex geometry. And so, basically, in contrast to what Francis talked about, I'm interested by I'm interested primarily in cases where one can do this directly without a priori going to the groupoid. But then, hopefully, in the discussion session, I'll tell you a little bit about what the groupoid picture would look like in the case that I'm discussing and how one can maybe use these as complementary approaches to basically gather evidence for the validity of either one. Okay, so what I'm really interested in. Okay, so what I'm really interested in first is to define Lagrangian intersection floor homology and the Pukai category for the stable generalized complex manifolds that Aldo told us about yesterday. However, that's not what I'm going to do today. So whenever one works with fluorocomology and related concepts, it is easiest to do this on real surfaces because a lot of the complicated analysis does. Complicated analysis doesn't appear in low dimensions. However, there are no interesting stable generalized complex structures on real surfaces. So real surfaces admit either complex structures or symplectic, but there cannot be type change loci. So instead, what I'm going to do as a toy model for basically stable generalized complex core manifolds is to study log-symplectic surfaces and namely oriented. Namely, oriented log symplectic surfaces. So I want to fix a surface which I'm calling M. And so omega 0 here, that's the volume form. So we fixed an orientation. So I guess I'm going to recall the definition of a log symptomic surface. So 1m here, n is the surface. So is a Poisson structure, which of course in the case of a real surface just means any bivector pi that intersects zero transversely. So what does this mean? Zero transversity. So, what this means is that pi vanishes transversally on a collection of disjoint embedded circles, which I'm going to call Z. So Z is this disjoint union of circles, so each Z I is simply an embedded circle. Okay, and what I want to do is to define for you For you, yeah, Lagrangian intersection floor homology for Lagrangians in such a thing. So, of course, in a surface, a Lagrangian is simply a one-dimensional submanifold. So, what I want to consider are embedded compact Lagrangians, so embedded circles that intersect this Z transversely, and I'll motivate why we want the transverse intersection to begin with. Intersection to begin with. I'll motivate that a bit later. But first, that would be a quick revision or reminder of what Lagrangian intersection flow chromology is in symphactic geometry. So a lot of the things I'm going to say now are just for general, well, not general symphactic manifolds, but some nice compact symplectic. So I have a nice compact symplexic manifold. So the idea is to take a pair of Lagrangians and to assign to it the voltage complex. So that'll be a differential, the flow differential. And so usually these should be compact. Usually these should be compact, probably oriented. And we want this to have certain properties. So first of all, if we take the homology, then this should be invariant under Hamiltonian isotropy or potentially certain Hamiltonian isotropy, i.e., we might not take all possible Hamiltonians only a certain subclass. Subclass, so there is an isomorphism to alpha, and then phi h of beta, where phi h denotes the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field associated to h. And we also want to make sure that we have a lot of different That if we take the third homology of a Lagrangian with itself, which usually means that the second instance of the Lagrangian, the one that is have perturbed by a Hamiltonian isotopy, that this is actually the same thing as just the cohomology. And so in general dimensions, So in general dimensions, so higher than two, the definition has a choice of compatible or potentially tame, almost complex structure for the symplectic structure. And we need the whole, so we need the homology in the end to also not depend on that choice. So what does one roughly do? So I'm going to sweep under the rug a bunch of well fine points or technicalities that one has to play That one has to pay attention to in doing this, mostly because these will not arise in the case that I actually want to talk about. But what is this roughly? Roughly, this whole channel complex is generated by the intersection points of the two Lagrangians. I'm going to do I'm going to do that over just simply over Z2. And of course, in order for this to make sense, ideally we want a finite number, or at the very least, a discrete set of intersection points. So we need the Lagrangians to intersect transversely. Now, so if they don't, then of course usually we can fix this by subscribing with a Hamiltonian isotopy. Showing with a Hamiltonian isotopy. So that is usually something you need to do. And then the differential looks like this. So we're summing over, we take the differential of an intersection point P, we sum over other intersection points of the same Lagrangians, and then we also sum over certain momentical classes of disks. Of disks that have a boundary in the Lagrangians and they need to have a certain index. So I'm not going to define the index or muscle of index. I'm not going to define that because I don't really need it for what I'm going to do. But okay, that's basically a certain degree of a map. And so then we sum over these points and the coefficient. These points and the coefficient here is the size of the moduli space of pseudo-holomorphic strips from P to Q. So I'm going to illustrate here what that is. So here are the two Lagrangians. They have two intersection points, P, Q. Then a pseudoholomorphic strip is a map from basically R cross unit interval into the manifold so that the ends of the strip, so as we go to plus or minus infinity, go to P and Q and the upper and lower boundary of the strip lie in either two Lagrangians. So the image of U will be in here. And pseudo-monomorphic means that they Holomorphic means that they satisfy the third equation, which is basically a perturbation of the Cauchy-Riemann equation where we allow perturbation by Hamiltonian isotopy. So that looks like this. So now of course in general there is a lot of work to be done making sure that this moduli space has the right dimension first of all so that it makes sense to count elements in it and a bunch of analysis issues. However, if you do this on a symplectic surface, so real surface, then well basically this all goes away and whatever you're left Basically, this all goes away, and what you're left with is pictures of actual lines sitting inside a two-dimensional thing. And what you count is actual shapes that look like this, more or less. And so these are then referred to as music loans because of their half-moon shape. Now, in general, it's not at all obvious that the differential defined in this way will actually be differential, a.e. squared is equal. And also, I mean, in general, it's not true. So, you need to make sure that certain properties for your symplectic manifold, as well as the Lagrangians, are satisfied. Question? Yes. The age that appears in the equation is that? Which age is that? Sorry, the age that appears in the equation is a Hamiltonian. Is that because alpha and beta are not transparent? Because alpha and beta are not transverse, or yeah, potentially not transverse. So, for example, conditions on a compact symplectic manifold that would ensure that this works are that whenever you take a class in the second format of In the second format of the M and pair it with the symplectic form. This is zeros, so these are so-called symplectically ispherical manifolds. And then you also need to ensure that whenever you pair the symplectic form with basically a disk, whose boundary is in one, so in any one Lagrangian, that this is zero. So you want to, I guess, restrict yourself to a class of Lagrangians where this is true. Of Lagrangian square, this is true. But then again, when you go to two dimensions, this isn't really a problem anymore. So, all this second condition is in that case, is to say that you should only use non-contractible Lagrangians, right? Because if a Lagrangian is contractible, you can fill it in with the disk. And then this basically says Basically, it says do not use the two space. Yeah, and so in general, you might have to define this differential a bit differently, namely by also including for each different disc u. This u, a term that involves the symplectic area of u, but for the simple context that I'm going to talk about, this works out fine. Where then this is just the thing in Z2. Okay. So, how to do this for oriented north symplectic surfaces? So, as a reminder, what does a log symplectic surface look like? So, as an example, I'm going to draw a torus with two vanishing circles of the torus. Vanishing circles of the Poisson structure. So, in general, the surface will always be such that Z, the collection of vanishing circles of the Poisson bivector, divides the surface into a number of symplectic components. So, away from Z, the Poisson structure is non-vanishing. So, this is in particular symplectic. And then you can assign a sign to each To each of the syntactic components by comparing the orientation it gives to the global orientation, which remember we fixed. So basically, in this case, one of these will be plus and the other will be minus, depending on whether the orientation agrees or disagrees. Okay, and then in a neighborhood of each of the z i, so we can find nice coordinates. So we can find nice coordinates xi and theta i so that the Poisson structure takes this form and the modular vector field restricted to zi. So of course usually there's only a modular class and not one modular vector field, but when you restrict to z all the possible That all the possible modular vector fields are the same, so this makes sense to talk about the modular vector field along each component that I and so the coordinates are chosen so that this looks like this. And of course, because the modular vector field, so it's tangent to each that I and provides you with an yeah, an orientation. So pi automatically orients each circle. Orients each circle. In this case, like this. So, what are the differences in this scenario to the purely symplectic surface? So, first of all, it will only be different from the symplectic case if we consider Lagrangians that actually do it exact Z. So, that's what I'm going to do. So, I want alpha and beta to be always such that Always such that the intersection with that is non-trivial. But I want to restrict myself to Lagrangians that intersect that transversely. So now we are in Poisson geometry and no longer in symptomic geometry. So Hamiltonian isotope. So, Hamiltonian isotopes will be more restrictive. So, any Hamiltonian vector field is of this form, and of course, pi vanishes along z. So, what this means is that any Hamiltonian isotopy restricts to the identity on Z. In particular, that means that if I perturb a Lagrangian by Hamiltonian isomorphism, Lagrangian by Hamiltonian isotopy, I can never change its intersection points with z. Those are fixed. So basically, Lagrangians can be distinguished by the intersection with the vanishing locus z. And also, if a Lagrangian starts out intersecting Z non-transversely, then I would be able to fix that with Hamiltonian isotopy, which is why I'm assuming it from the beginning.  So now for every Lagrangian, what we have is the Lagrangian itself with a distinguished hyper surface, i.e. in this case, just a collection of points, namely the intersection points with Z. And this has a natural associated homology that we already know about, namely the law of the Rand homology with respect to the intersection. Back to the intersection. And so, when we now construct verb homology, what I would like to get is that the result for a single Lagrangian restricts to this and no longer smooth the round homology. So, yeah, and then we would also still. And then we would also still like to keep the property that the floor homology that we're going to design is invariant at least under a certain class of Hamiltonian isotopes. So it turns out that we can't take any smooth function, but we have to restrict ourselves to certain Hamiltonians. So that's not a unique phenomenon. Basically, for every notion of flow homology that involves non-compact symplectic manifolds. Non-compact symplectic manifolds and non-compact Lagrangians, this is something you do. You only consider self-hominians with a particular behavior towards infinity, and basically what happens here is exactly that. So a natural question that arises immediately is what about disks through or to Or two or from Z here are two Lagrangians with intersection points. First question, is this kind of disk allowed? And perhaps unsurprisingly, the answer is no, these are not allowed. And you can see this basically by studying By studying the analog of what the flow equation would be for this scenario with the degeneracy locus, and you find that whenever the image lands inside Z, the partial derivatives need to be zero. And so in particular, there cannot be an extended interval of intersecting Z. So that stuff simply doesn't appear. Secondly, so this is again Z. So, this is again Z. And these are two Lagrangians. We have this kind of situation and ask ourselves: should we consider these disks? Now, here the situation is different. Namely, if we look at the generalization of the flow equation and study disks that nearly end in Z but not intercepted in any larger set. Larger set, that's fine. So these are fine. And they also have finite symplectic area, even though the symplectic form goes up on Z. But I don't want to include them, so I'm not going to. And the reason is that if I include these, the resulting theory somehow does not know about the degeneracy locus anymore. It basically Anymore. It basically, just for a single Lagrangian, we reduce back to just the round homology of the Lagrangian. And so I don't think this is the theory we want for this context. So who not include these? But um Okay, well I guess I'm going to say some consequences of just what I said here first, and then I'm going to show you another class of interesting disk that is included. Could you say what the pseudohomorphic map equation that you're using? Yeah, something like this. comes out as something like this. So basically there's an algorithm of I mean so basically I guess what this says is that these are these so these are holomorphic functions basically. It's what this what the equation Is what this what the equation is. So, first some consequences of just the things I said here. So if the two Lagmannians have intersection points that all lie outside of Z, then basically the different symplectic components of the surface will not interact with each other. So all disks will be between intersection points in the same symplectic component. However, okay, well, and secondly, if we do have such intersection points that lie inside Z, then at least the points that are in Z In Z do not interact with points outside. But in this case, the different, in the second case, the different symplectic components do interact with each other by virtue of what I'm calling. By virtue of what I'm calling uh crossing or crossing disks, if you want, and these look as follows So here's two Lagrangians. Lagrangians alpha beta that intersect in z and then they also have intersection points on each side of z. Then what I'm going to do is consider this whole thing as one rule from P to Q, or one disk from P to Q. So here are the signs of the symplectic components that's important. And so basically, And so basically, when you look at this as a map, so instead of mapping a strip into M, I'm now mapping this upper half circle into M. And then what this amounts to is saying that basically the map should be holomorphic on each half. So if we take out the imaginary axis, so it should be holomorphic on each of these halves. These halves. And well, then actually, there's a certain condition for pushing forward the canonical log tangent vector along here. So that needs to push forward to the log tangent vector along here. And be an immersion on the rest of the map. So that's basically what these crossing nodes look like. Look like. And it makes sense that somehow they turn around on the other side of Z because remember the symplectic structure that comes from the law of croissant bivector, that changes orientation when you go through Z. So consequently, what a holomorphic, or like what the map should look like, and what a holomorphic map is also changes fine. So that's exactly why it looks like this. I guess in summary, whenever we have an intersection point of the two Lagrangians that lies inside Z, then this intersection point can then this intersection point can basically mediate it is like mediate interactions between inter uh between intersection points in different symplectic okay now um admissible homotonian isotopes we've already said that we need to restrict ourselves to a certain class of Hamiltonians in order to make Class of Hamiltonians, in order to make A the complex well-defined and B the homology invariant until these. And so to show you why we can't use all Hamiltonians, I'm going to consider this simple situation, which is the log-symplectic disk, or if you want the upper hemisphere of a log-symplectic sphere, so sphere where the equator is the Vanisher log. Where the equator is the vanishing locus. So here the boundary is the vanishing locus of the bivector. I'm going to look at these two Lagausians. Then if I allow myself all Hamiltonian isotopes, I can certainly find a Hamiltonian isotopy that perturbs B beta to this picture. So here we have no intersection points inside the disc. Points inside the disk, and here we have one. And from that, it's immediately clear that the resulting homology is not the same. So these pictures somehow need to be distinguished. And how to fix this is to set the flow complex for alpha and beta. To the third complex of alpha with beta perturbed by a certain Hamiltonian isotopy. And so H is now an admissible Hamiltonian. And what this means is that in these nice coordinates around each zi that I mentioned and have now wiped away, H should look like this. So maybe I'm going to draw this again. So here's z, and then we have these nice coordinates where x is the coordinate that goes away from z, and theta was the coordinate along z. And I should be able to write h like this, such that f is bigger than zero on some neighborhood of z. So what this amounts to is that I said here's Z, here's alpha. If I perturb alpha, then in a neighborhood, it will always look roughly like this. So here, these are the signs of the symplectic component. Well, I mean, if you want to, you can even have X depend on theta. Like, if I like, this is fine. This is fine as long as this is true. And so what I mean when I say this is that we need to have flowed long enough with this Hamiltonian flow so that we've moved beta past alpha in this direction. So of course there's a way of like phrasing this more precisely, but yeah. So in this case, it means But yeah, so in this case, it means flow beta far enough so that in a neighborhood of the intersection point in Z, it looks like this. So, in this example, that's what I'm going to draw next. So if we want to consider the F from alpha and beta, so beta is the second Lagarian, so we need to cut out that with an admissible Habatronian isotopy. So that would look like Like this, if this is the orientation of the boundary, and the other way around, for Cf of beta alpha, we now need to perturb alpha. So like this. Or potentially, we could go further. And do this. But these two are equivalent and they will result in isomorphic cohomology. So that's fine. Yeah, so then you can show that with the definition of the complex like this. Of the complex like this, and the differential I wrote down earlier, what you do, so you do obtain a well-defined homology theory that is invariant under admissible Hamiltonian isotopy. So that's what I claim the appropriate notion of Lagrangian intersection flow homology for Lagrangians in oriented log symplectic surfaces is. So So, what I'm now going to do is basically do the proof that this reduces to something isomorphic to Love-De-Ram homology for the Lagrangian. So first of all, I'm going to define the definition a little bit by including degrees. So big orientations for alpha and beta. For alpha and beta, so I guess now alpha and or beta with its two different orientations are considered distinct Lagrangians. And then we can assign a degree to intersection points as follows. I guess I can squeeze this. You will get here. So this is for intersection points that lie outside Z. Points that lie outside Z. So these are essentially the two possible configurations for the oriented Sagrangian sphere in intersection point P. Here in intersection point P. And so we're going to assign degrees as follows. If we're in a positive symplectic component, so symplectic component where the orientation given by the log symplectic structure agrees with our global orientation we've chosen, then we're going to call this degree one and this degree zero. And if we're in a negative symplectic component, it's the other way around. The component is the other way around. And for u, an intersection point inside z, we're always going to assign degree one. So these agree with the subjective case, so that's exactly where we're looking there. And for the detection points inside Z, I mean, at this point, we're basically free to do whatever we want. So in general, where maybe, you know, if one would want to repeat this for higher dimensions, then what I think happens is that the degree of intersection points in Intersection points inside the degeneracy locus, some more needs to be shifted by one in some regards with respect to the ones outside. But I don't know how to make that precise yet. So proposition for a lag margin that intersects Z transversely. So here we are considering the case without boundaries. So M. Boundary, so M and alpha are both compact. No boundary. But this works also for log surfaces with boundary and the corresponding Lagrangian's whose boundary sits inside the big boundary. So there are intervals. So it works just the same way, just for the way I'm writing it. It's more convenient to just do one of the cases.  So here I'm just writing down what the log commodity of such a thing looks like, log around. So in zeroth degree, since it's a connected thing, it's just R. In degree 1, it's R for the first chromology class of a circle. And R to the K for the number of intersection points with Z. Z. And so now the claim is that we find the same thing for the block homology that I defined. So hf of alpha. Alpha in degree 0 is just z2 and hf f1 alpha alpha is z2. Let me write it the same way. Z2 plus Z2 plus Z2 is okay. And I guess I went pretty fast, so I didn't have time to beat it. So, what we want to do is use the tubular neighborhood theorem for local abradients. So here's the Lagardian and that continues. Obviously it's a circle, I'm drawing a straight line on the board and then it has a number of intersections with Z all of these are some connected components with Z Component with z, and since if we're in the case of the circle inside a compact log symplectic surface, then of course there will be an even number of these. So I'm going to call, well let's say this intersection point qi qi plus one, qi plus two, qi plus three, and so forth. Plus three and so forth. And so now, in order to define the floor homology of this with itself, I need to perturb it with an admissible Lagrangian. Okay, I guess I need to do a bit more decoration of this drawing. So these are the signs of the symplectic components. These are the little coordinate systems that we have. Systems that we have and so on for the other components. This is the orientation I'm choosing for alpha and the perturbed Lagrangian will then look like this. And so in my actual proof where I've written this up, I am giving a function, like a precise function that will do this, but now I'm not going to write all of that down. But I mean, this is basically what I showed you before: that this is the way the admissible Hamiltonians evolve. And so And so, okay, what we already said was that intersection points that are inside Z never have any looms either going out or coming in. So we always have del Qi equals 0 over I. But in this situation, we have crossing moons. So if this is Pi, this is Pi plus 1, Pi 2, then of course Then, okay, the way that I've numbered these here with where the plus components are and where the minus components are, it comes out that for odd i, del of p i is p i minus 1 plus p i plus 1. So um basically which one should I use the most? I guess I haven't drawn it that great. But so if this one is an odd PI, then there will be a loop here going to the next intersection point here, and then there's a loop here going to this one. And for even i, the LPI is zero. And so, oh yeah, I guess I should also write down the degrees so that we have that. So the Qi, as I said, they're all degree one. And the the odd Pi are degree zero and the even Pi are degree one. With the eye, I degree one. You can just see from the drawing. So now what we get is that kernel of the differential is precisely all the qi, all the pi where i is even, and the sum of all pj where j is odd. And these are all degree one elements. This is a degree zero element. Whereas the image of the differential is just these kind of elements, so p i minus one plus i plus one comma i. I does one Yeah And then these are all degree one and so from this you get the homology H is zero alpha alpha is just generated by this thing so z2 So Z2 with the class this and HF1 is first of all the k elements that are the intersection points with z plus z2 with Z2 with the class that comes from any even p and so indeed what we find is z2 to the k plus z2 which reflects the degree of the log derived homology. And so in that sense this is the log version of log homology. Homology. So finally, let me just say a few things. I said at the start that what I'm actually ultimately interested in is to do this for stable GC manifolds, in particular first of all for GC4 manifolds, and also first of all for the case where the type jump locus is smooth. And I guess I want to say a little bit about one lesson. I guess I want to say a little bit about what lessons we can draw from this toy model for that higher dimensional case. And so what we will still have is that in the stable to C manifold, Lagrangians will be distinguished by the intersection with the degeneracy locus to some degree. So in higher dimensions, you can have Hamiltonian isotopes that move the intersection. That move the intersection points with the degeneracy locus. However, not for the GC4 manifold. So, for the GC4 manifold, the same thing should be true: that they are really distinguished by the intersection points with the degeneracy locus. And then, further, there should again be no disks that connect intersection points inside and outside the degeneracy locus, but of course, in higher dimensions, we may, so what will appear. So, what will appear are certain disks that go between points in the degeneracy locus. So, in that case, the structure of the degeneracy locus itself will become more complicated. And of course, in stable GC geometry, the degeneracy locus is codimension too. And in particular, it doesn't separate the manifold into components. But okay, then, well, well, we. Okay, then, well, we don't get this thing where we somehow differ symplectic components of different signs. What I do still expect to happen is that whenever we have intersection points of Lagrangians with the type jump locus, that there should be these types of crossing units that go from points outside the Need General C locus, but pass through a point inside the Need Generosy locus. And for those of you who were present, For those of you who were present for my talk in Rio, I guess now two and a half years ago, I proved that whenever you have pseudobolomorphic disks outside the degeneracy locus of a stable GC structure, then these disks do somehow not escape into the degeneracy locus. This was a maximum principle argument, and that basically ensures that is one thing that is necessary for the theory to remain well defined. For the theory to remain well-defined even in that higher dimension. And so, yeah, that's basically one of the next things I want to do and maybe present to you the next time, who knows. Okay, thanks very much for your attention. Thank you. So, we have some time for questions. Yes. The flow equation involves a change. The floor equation involves a choice of almost complex structure. Yes. Is that an almost complex structure on the tangent bubble on the low tangent bubble? Yes. So in this case, I think that the right thing to do is an almost complex structure on the low tangent bundle. And that will result in this equation that I had written down earlier where the real part of the disk appeared with a log in front. And it should then be compatible with the. And it should have been compatible with your logs and tracking structure in the usual setting. Yes. Yeah. Have you thought about defining compositions between solar homology groups? Yes. These are like the higher products for the Foucaire category. And so, in principle, I expect similar things to happen. So, first of all, the intersection points that lie First of all, the intersection points that lie inside Z, they should not have any direct interaction with these sorts of things. But again, there should, for example, be things like this. Now I need to draw this right. So I think that this kind of triangle needs to be a triangle. So basically this So basically, this crossing business where it goes through an intersection point in Z, that needs to go on in the higher operations. And then I am, so this is not something I've completed doing, but I'm pretty confident that that's what you should do. Of course then, so there are issues of because whenever you have three or more Lagrangians involved and you're patting them with Hamiltonian isolated. With Hamiltonian isotopes, in order to define the complex, what will then happen is that suddenly you have homomorphisms where both Lagrangians were perturbed and one was maybe perturbed twice as much. And then so identifying these home spaces, I guess that's a technical issue one needs to solve. And I mean, I would expect it to work, but I can't claim that I know. Are there questions online maybe? I mean, otherwise we do have the discussion session now, right? So if anybody wants to open the discussion session with a question, that would work. Well, I would propose to take three minutes. Okay, three minutes break. Yeah. That's maybe the best. Yeah. That's maybe the game show up. Oh yeah, I need to start the recording.
