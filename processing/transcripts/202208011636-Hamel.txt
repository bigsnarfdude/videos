Over to you, Francois. Thank you very much, Yong. And so I'm very happy to see you, as well as all other participants on site and online. And I very much thank the organizers for inviting me to this nice workshop. And I'm sorry for not being able to be on site for family reasons. So today the talk is Today, the talk is based on a joint work with Luca Rossi. And Luca Rossi talked about some other aspects this morning. So, sorry. Sorry, I cannot. Okay, it's okay. So, but the talk is concerned with the main reaction diffusion equation in the whole space Rn. whole space Rn. So du over d2 t equals Laplace of U plus F of U. We are interested in the Cauchy problem for a function f which is given of plus C1 and which vanishes at 0 and 1. And all solutions will be between 0 and 1. And we are mainly concerned with the influence of the initial condition U0, as Luca explained this morning. Explained this morning. And for simplicity reasons, we will concentrate on initial conditions, which are indicator functions of a set capital U. So the function u0 is equal to one sorry is equal to one is equal to one in u and zero outside. We can consider other initial conditions, but for simplicity, we let me just focus on that. Let me just focus on that. And the initial set capital U, which I'm going to call initial support with a slight abuse of notation of terminology. So this capital set U is typically unbounded and the complement has a positive measure. So the solution U from the strong maximum principle is strictly between zero and one at each positive time. Each positive time. So, this is from the strong Maxion principle, but we are interested in the more precise information about the location of the regions where U is close to zero or close to one at last time. So, more precisely, can we say that for any given direction E in the unit sphere, there is a unit sphere there is a spreading speed w of e positive such that u converges to one if one moves in the direction e with a speed gamma less than w of e and on the other hand u converges to zero if one moves in the direction e at a speed structure larger than w of e so w of e is a spreading speed between uh the point between the Between the values one and zero, in some sense. And can one derive a formula for W of E in terms of E, of course, and also in terms of the initial support, capital U. So it is possible that W of E is infinite, and we will see that this happens in the directions around which U is unbounded. I will explain what it means. I will explain what it means more precisely later. And so, also, we would like also to describe the asymptotic global shape of the label sets of U, of the, let's say, the upper level sets of U, and the spreading speeds, the spreading speeds and spreading sets allow to have a more precise description. So, somehow these questions are related to the global shift. Are related to the global shape of the solutions in contrast with what Luca explained this morning about the local asymptotic shape of the level sets around the level sets. And the question is about the last question is about the memory of the initial support capital U. Okay, so after this brief introduction, so there will be three remaining parts in the talk. Parts in the talk. So the second part will be, I will explain the main hypothesis and some preliminary results. And the third part is the main part on the main results on spreading speeds and spreading sets. And if I have time, I will explain some, I will list some counter examples. So the main hypothesis is related to the existence. Related to the existence of a traveling front connecting the states zero and one. So remember that zero and one are steady states because f of zero is equal to f of one equals zero. And we assume the existence of a front connecting one to zero. So that means there exists, let's say in dimension one, there is a one-dimensional front, phi of x minus ct for the one-dimensional version of the equation. One-dimensional version of the equation. So, with a profile phi, which connects one and zero, so in this way. So, phi is between zero and one and is equal to one at minus infinity and zero at plus infinity. So, this front, we have seen several examples of such fronts in the previous talks. So, this front moves with constant speed C to the right and the profile is invariant in the moving frame with speed C. In the moving frame with speed C. So equivalently, there are planar, we assume that there are planar tolling fronts in the whole space Rn in any direction each of the unit sphere. Okay, so this is so this assumption and we assume that the speed C is positive. So somehow this means that zero and one do not play the same role. So in some sense, one is more attractive than zero. Than zero. So there are many well-known classes of examples of functions F fulfilling this assumption. So I list four of them. So Luca listed, actually listed them this morning. So the KPP case, the first case, KPP case is when F is, let's say, positive between 0 and 1 and less than its slope at the origin. And the second one is more general than the previous one. We just assume that f is positive between 0 and 1 in the open interval 0, 1. And the third case is when f is bistable, so like in the picture, with positive integral. So in that case, there is a unique traveling speed. Traveling speed and which is positive. And the last case is the ignition case when f is like that, so vanishes between zero and theta, and then positive between theta and one. But more general multi-stable functions f with multiple oscillations in 0, 1 are possible. So, and this comes from, for instance, from the well-known paper of Aronson and Weindager. And Weinberger. Okay, so now, so some preliminary results. If one assumes that this assumption is satisfied, then there is a traveling front with minimal speed C star, which is positive, and C star is positive. So minimal speed means that there is no front with speeds less than C star, and there is a front with a speed C star connecting. With a speed system connecting zero to one. Furthermore, we have the following invasion property, meaning that if we consider initial conditions, which may not be characteristic functions now, but initial conditions which are still less than one and larger than some alpha times the characteristic function of a ball of radius row for some row large enough and for some alpha. row large enough and for some alpha between zero and one which exists then then under this condition then u converges to one locally uniformly in space when time goes to infinity so so such initial conditions even if they are only locally uh compactly supported give rise to um uh in to solutions which converge to one at large times so one invades zero so this is the So, this is the indexing property for large enough, in some sense, initial conditions. And furthermore, in this case, for these spreading solutions, we can say that C star is actually the spreading speed in the sense that if one moves at a speed less than C star in all directions, then the solution u converges to one when t goes to infinity. To infinity. On the other hand, if one moves also outside spheres of radius gamma t for gamma larger than c star, if u0 is compactly supported, then u converges to zero outside these moving balls. So which means that c star is a spreading speed in all directions. So meaning that there is a spreading speed, w of e, which is equal to c star. W of E, which is equal to C star, if let's say U0 is completely supported. So, this preliminary result holds under the signal assumption of the existence of a front, and it can be viewed as an extension of the well-known results of Aronsanda and Derger, which were given for more specified functions f. Okay, so okay, sorry. Okay, sorry. Let me also point out that this invasion property, which I just mentioned, is actually satisfied if and only if the two simultaneous conditions on F are satisfied. So f is positive in a left neighborhood of one and the integral of f between t and one is positive for all t between zero and one. Between 0 and 1. And alpha can be the same as in the statement of the invasion property. So, this equivalence between the invasion property and these properties on F follows from some papers by Peter Polaczik and Yhong Du and Peter Polacyk, who are in the room. And it's very nice because this equivalence is quite simple to state in terms of F. It's quite simple to state in terms of f so, and it we can also say that it doesn't depend on the dimension n so and and so so it follows that the inversion property holds in particular if f is non-negative and positive in a left neighborhood of one and is independent on the dimension f. Let me also point out that the converse implication is not true, that meaning that the invasion property does The invasion property does not imply the hypothesis Tf in general, in the sense that there are examples of functions f with multiple oscillations and for which the solutions can develop into terraces of expanding fronts. So, and this was already from the paper of Fife MacLeod, and many authors worked on that, especially people in the room. So, and all people are in the room, as a matter of fact. So, and also, let me also point out that the invasion property implies that even without the hypothesis Tf implies that U converges to one in balls of Regis delta T for some delta positive before the inventing solutions. Okay, so let me also mention some. And Etki also mentioned some references on the case of comparative support in initial conditions or initial conditions converging to zero at infinity. There are many results, many nice results about the thresholds between extinction and evasion for monotone families, for continuous monotone families of initial conditions. And there are further results on the location shape of the level sets for evaluating solutions, including Solutions, including the results of Jones, which I mentioned in the talk of Luca this morning. There's also general results on the local conversions to steady states by Yihongdu and Hiroshima, and further results on the local conversions and quasi-convergence, more general quasi-convergence for such infra conditions. Okay, so now we'd like to go to the Now we'd like to go to the main part of the talk, so the third part about spreading speeds and spreading sets and Freudling-Gertner type formulas for the spreading speeds. So we assume the existence of a front connecting one to zero, and we assume that U is a karatexic function of a set capital U containing a ball of Freudius rho. So rho was associated to the inverse. rho was associated to the inversion property so if uh if u is like that then little u converges to one uh at infinity in balls of freedom t for any gamma less than c star from the previous result but but the question now is to give more precise description of the invasion of the set zero by the set one so are there spreading speeds in any So are there spreading speeds in any direction E? Can one say more about spreading sets? And can one describe the upper level sets of U, which are defined as like that, the set of points where U is larger than a given value lambda between zero and one. So these questions are related, as a matter of fact. We will see that. So, but to give the results, I have to. To give the results, I have to introduce some important definitions which are related to the initial support capital U. So, more precisely, we define two sets. So, the first one is the set of directions around which capital U is unbounded. So, this set capital U of U is the set of directions in the unit sphere such that the points The points tog C, so in the direction C, are close to U in the sense that the distance between tog C and capital U is little O of toe when toe goes to infinity. And this set of unbounded directions is closed in the unit sphere. We can also introduce a set of directions around which U is bounded. So, this is this definition, it corresponds to the definition it corresponds to the set of points such that to the set of directions such that in the there exists a positive cone around the direction c with uh with um which does not intersect capital u up to a bounded set so this is the this b of u which is open uh in the unit sphere and which is disjoint from from uh from the set of From the set of unbounded directions. And B of U is equal to the unit sphere if and only if U is bounded. Okay, so consider, for instance, just to give an example, the set capital U, which is the blue set. And so in dimension two, so in the unit cycle, so we have two parts. So the set, the green set. So, the green set of bounded directions and the red set of unbounded directions. Okay, so and let me also introduce the notion of positive distance interior of U. So for any row, so this is a set of points in U such that the ball centered at X with radius 4 is included in U. So this is this set. Okay. This is this set, okay. So, which is included in capital U. Okay, so now the first pen result is the following. So, we assume we assume this property one, which says that the unit sphere is covered by the union of the bounded directions and the unbounded directions of the raw interior of capital U. Then, Then, in any direction E, there is a spreading speed, W of E, which is in the closed interval C star plus infinity, such that we have the property which I stated at the beginning. So if one moves at a speed gamma less than W of E in the direction E, then the solution converges to one. And on the other hand, at a speed larger than W of E, speed larger than w of e the solution converges to zero and furthermore w of e is given by the variational formula which is if you look at the second this this formula here so w of e is the ratio between c star and the distance between e and the positive cone generated by the unbounded directions of capital U. tell you okay and um so which is also the the sinus the the sign sorry of um so the minimum between pi over two and the sine of um of the angle between e and the positive and the um and the unbounded directions of u. So this formula is a very rational formula for the spring speed in terms of C star and capital U and E. U and E. So, why do we call it a Frederick-Geertner type formula? Because Fredin and Geertner were the first ones to give a formula for the spreading space of solutions of periodic KPP equations with compactly supported usual conditions. So, in that case, so if we consider periodic KPP equations, so periodic in space, then they derive the Then they derived a formula which was not written exactly like that, but which can be written like that from later results of Weinberger and myself with Ori Barci and Gregoire Nadon. So this formula for W of E, so W of E is given as before, but has the same meaning as before, but the formula is slightly different. So this is the infimum of a ratio between C star of C, which is Between c star of xi, which is the minimal speed of pulsating fronts in the direction xi, divided by xi dot e. So it's so it has the same speed, but it is different. And this formula holds also for more general reactions from a result by Lucas. And okay, so we have to keep in mind this formula, this right formula. And let me also say that the main result does not hold without the hypothesis. not hold without the hypothesis Tf in the sense that there are functions f with multiple oscillations and which give rise to terraces of expanding fronts. So there is not a single in general a single spreading speed in any direction E. Let me also say that a sufficient condition for this geometric assumption to be satisfied is the fact that the host The fact that the Hausdorff distance between U and Euro is finite, and when capital U is star-shaped. Okay, so model conditions can be given. This one is the simplest one. Okay, so now once we have the spreading speeds, we can, let's say, answer, address the following question, which is sort of uniformity with respect to the speed E. So we assume the same. So we assume the same hypothesis one and we introduce now the envelope set the envelope set capital W of sorry of the spreading speeds sorry of the spreading speeds W of E. So this so which is given by this formula and this set capital W can be also written equivalently as the sum of the positive cone Sum of the positive cone generated by the unbounded directions of U plus the ball of Freud's C star centered at the origin. So if we consider the following two examples as in the picture, so the first one, the left one, is when u is, let's say, like that. So for instance, in dimension two, u is a subgraph of the function minus absolute value of x1. Absolute value of x1. Then w is like that. It is as Luca explained this morning. So has a rounded top. It is like that. So w is exactly like that. On the other hand, if we consider on the right picture capital U, which is the subgraph, for instance, of the function absolute value of x1 in dimension two, then w is the subgraph of the shifted function. Of the shifted function to the top. So, w is the subgraph of the green lines. So, if we introduce this set capital W, then we can say that for any, so we can say that W is a spreading set in the sense that if we consider any compact set C included into W, then the solution converges into one in the deleted sets. Sets T C. And on the other hand, if we consider a set C outside the closure of W, then the solution converges to zero in the deleted sets. So W is a spanning set. And okay, so it is an open set which is either unbounded if and only if. If and only if the set of unbounded directions is not empty or equal to B C star. So, why do we call it W? Because it is somehow it has some similarities in the definition with the Wolf, with the set Wish, with a spreading set of solutions of KPP. KPP periodic reaction effusion equations with compactive support in initial conditions. So W for the Freudian-Gerter formula was associated to the set W and W bar is in that case the wolf shape of the envelope set of the minimal speeds sister of Xi. And in that case, W is a compact convex set. But in our case, in the blue case, in our case, W bar is neither convex nor convex. U bar is neither convex nor bounded in general. So, okay, I think I have to speed up. So, the third result is somehow the, which was actually, no, sorry, sorry. The third result is about the upper level sets of U. So, with the same assumptions, we can say that somehow we can see that the upper level sets, sorry, we can see that the upper level sets converge locally. Sets converge locally. If we divide them by tag t, they converge with a spreading set W in this sense. So locally in this sense, in the sense of Hausdorff distance. But so somehow W gives a global picture of the upper level sets, sorry, an asymptotic picture of the risked upper level sets locally. So, and but in general, in general, there is not a global conversion to the rescaled upper-level sets to W. And the last main result is mentioned in Lucas talks on slide six this morning, which is to say that the now if we assume that U is closed to its rho interior, so it's a completely different assumption. So, it's a completely different assumption. Then the upper-level sets of U look like capital U plus V C star T, so the second capital U up to little O of T as time goes to infinity. So the assumption one and two cannot be compared in general, and there are counterexamples with one of them is not satisfied. With one of them is not satisfied, but I think if you have questions about that, I can answer more precisely. But I think I have to stop it and thank you for your attention. Any questions as well as from the Zoom? So first of all, I have a question. So here you will only consider some special type of non-linearity like KPP or? No, no, no, no, no, no. This so the the main assumption So, the the main assumption on f is this one, is this one? I see. This is the main assumption. I see. So, and this assumption connecting. Yes, so this assumption is satisfied in particular in these four cases. So, but one is a subcase, first one is a subcase of the second one. And sister, so sister which Which plays an important role. So, C star, which was given in the formula for the spreading speed. So, C star is the minimal speed associated to F, which always exists from this result. So, this actually is very, very general. You could have F oscillating around zero any time. Yes, yes, there can be multiple oscillations, some sufficient condition for the. some sufficient condition for for the existence of uh of a of a profile connecting zero to one were given for instance in the in in in the seminal paper by faife and maclaudam thank you thank you thank you hong for your question any other questions oh people on the zoo So, if no thing, thank Francois Gain.
