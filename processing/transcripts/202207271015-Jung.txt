So, yes, I'm Sonny Jong from Cornell. So, today I will talk about the vortex pattern from the fluttering elastic leaf. The video playing in this slide is the wheat plant, which is you can see the wheat head, a spike on the background. And this is a wheat leaf. So, you are looking from the angled view from the side. And you can see a lot of the spores or pollens are ejected from. Are ejected from the leaf at the moment of the raindrop impact. So you can see nice vortex rings are shedded from down and up. So those are things I want to talk about today. So this is most of work has been done. My student, Jizuan Wu, he has done a lot of work and also it's a collaborative work with the psychopath Xiu at South South Dakota State University and my postdoc, Sun-Ho. And my postdoc, Sun-Ho, and then Mark Sorell is the under professor, Cornell, and Javi the Francisco Baron Vera is the professor at University of Miami. All right, so why plant spores are important? So plant spores are the infectious disease to the plant or most of grains we are eating. So this is sort of the COVID. So this is like sort of the COVID to human the COVID like the disease to the plant. So there is a lot of the plant got disease by this spores. So this healthy plant, wind leaf shows a lot of the green stuff here. But once it's infected, then you're going to see like sort of the orange color, the spot appears on the wheat leaf here. And if you zoom in more, then there might be like a hundred micron size of Like a hundred micron size of the patches of the orange spot, and if you look at more details, so those spots are emerging from the epidermal skin of the plant. So each spore is about 10 micrometer in radius, and this spore by itself can reduce the crop yield by 20% by blocking sunlight on the leaf. And also, these spores are getting the nutrient from the plant. From the plant by making little tentacles inside the plant. So, this force can go up to the atmosphere up to three kilometers high, and this spores can transport it across the continent. So, like some of the spores in North America can travel to Europe or Asia. So, they can a lot of the transportation happens across the continent. The one of things we are The one of the things we are very interested in this problem is that there are a lot of the dry spores ejected after rainfall. So, this is something was very interesting. And there's another evidence showing that whenever rainfalls, there's a strong spike in the signal for the bioparticles, bioparticles, including the spores and pollens, everything. But you're going to see a lot of the bioparticles get up in the air when. Up in the air when rain falls on the ground. So, this is a little bit counter-intuitive because people thought that when rain comes down, then you will wash everything in the air. But what people find out whenever the rain comes down, in the beginning of the rain, you're going to smell the ground, which is a lot of the bioparticles get up in the air. Um, up in the air. So, the first topic we studied before was the about the effect of the vortex ring shape to levitate or liberate this kind of spores from the plant leaf. So, this is the bottom is a leaf infected by the spores. So, you can see a lot of spores that are sticking on the surface. And you're going to see a lot of the dry spores get up in the air. So, how this dry So, how this dry spores get up in the air such a high height is due to the vortex ring. I will show you more on this kind of vortex ring. So, again, this is a vortex ring, which is this part of the vortex is connected to the other side. So, we did some of the experiment. First, we count how many spores are ejected from a single raindrop impact. So, this is infected leaf, and we release the drop, and we count the number. And we count the number of spores on the ground. And it turns out it can spread about like a thousand of the spores spread from the infected leaf. And also we look at the more on the trajectory of these spores. So first of all, we find that the trajectory is not trivial because you can see the white trajectory here. See the white trajectory here is the real spores. So, real spores are going like swirling motion like this. But if you simulate like a ballistic kind of the motion of the spores, you will shoot it up and then you will just fall down to the gravity. So it's quite different from the ballistic model, which is we are missing something here. And also the overall distance of this kind of the swallowing actual spore travel distance is much higher. Distance is much higher than what we predict from the ballistic model. So, this is something we try to understand. So, and then also this kind of mechanism help for spores to travel in the longer distance in the horizontal direction. By the way, if you have any questions, please interrupt me in the middle. I will just open up the box here. Okay. All right. So, as I briefly mentioned, the I briefly mentioned the main mechanism of this kind of swelling motion of the spores is due to the vortex ring, as I briefly mentioned. The vortex ring has been observed by Ibn Gard and other people before. So when the raindrop impact on the surface, this raindrop will carry some air flow with it, air with it. And then once they stop on the ground, this air will keep moving around or just Around or just moving on the side, and then you create the vortex string on the side. So we characterize this vortex string and then we try to simulate how the particles can be transported. So we use a simple force balance. The inertia term is balanced with the viscous drag with the gravity. And the air vortex term, as the air flow term, how are we going to do it? So we just find out the surface. So we just find out the circulation of the vortex due to the raindrop impact, which is written in terms of the air Reynolds number and drops Reynolds number and then the raindrop speed and then size of raindrop. So then, oops, I'm going backward. And then we put the image vortex on the other side of the substrate and we run the simulation in 2D at this moment. In 2D at this moment. And then we just say we calculate what is the velocity or we calculate the complex potential of the flow due to those two, the vertices, like this. And the gamma is given in this form. And then we can simulate this. What is the flow look like in the background? And then we can get this air velocity from this simple 2D comp. To the model from the complex potential, and then we can simulate how this force will be moved in the air. So, from there, what we can do is the black line or the solid lines are from simulation, and then the dots are from the experiment. So, we can capture many of the particles' motion quite well. And again, this kind of swirling motion is due to the vortex formed by the raindrop impacting. Raindrop impacting on the substrate. So, this is a published work. And then I will move to the topic I want to talk today. So, which is the vortex string shadowed by the elastic lip. Anyone has any question before I move to the next topic? There is one question, Suni. I'm just bringing over the microphone. Yeah. On the previous slide, could you just tell us what the different colors for those different us what the the different colors for those different trajectories are oh so those are the we choose the uh four different um the spores so those are the four different spores so out of this image so these are the one we can identify for longer distance travel so those are the four different spores and this yeah oh sorry go ahead yeah i was just gonna ask is it are these kind of trajectories pretty Are these kinds of trajectories pretty robust based on how far away from the droplet impact they are? Oh, okay. So, the okay, first of all, simulation: we use the initial velocity, what we measure from the experiment, and we run the simulation. So, the ejecting velocity is also a function of the distance from the location of the raindrop impact, which is we haven't really taken into account in the simulation, but we saw that. Count in the simulation, but we saw that there's a decay of the ejecting velocity as a function of the distance from the impact location. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Hello. Can I maybe ask a second short question? Just quickly mentioned that you were counting the spores when they fell down. I was just curious, how do you count the spores? Thank you. I hire undergraduate students to count, literally count all. Students to count, literally count all the scores. But actually, what we do, we have a petri dish and then we make like a grid pattern. And then we put the numbers on each grid. And then we take a picture. And then we use image processing. And then we confirm by undergraduate students to check whether if there's a like sport like this, which is maybe image processing, say like it's one sport, but is there two? One sport, but is there two? So the undergrad students spend like hours and hours to check everything. Wonderful. Thank you. All right. So yes, I'll move on to the next topic, which is the elastic leaf. So what we studied previously was the fixed, the fixed leaf. Okay, so leaf was fixed on the ground. Was fixed on the ground, but we never really let the leaf is fluttering up and down. So now we are trying to understand the effect of the fluttering leaf. So first of all, we try to understand the flow induced by the fluttering leaf. So most of the experiment we have done is with the plastic beam instead of the actual leaf. We did some experiment with the actual leaf. Did some experiment with the actual leaf, but the most of the quantitative measurement we done with the plastic kind of beam. So, plastic beam is a hold on the back side of here. And then we are looking from the front. So, you are seeing the beam is fluttering up and down, and you are looking from the front side of the beam. And you can see the drops are sticking on the plastic beam like this. Plastic beam like this. And then we put the smoke in the chamber and then we shine the laser sheet and we're going to look at the flow patterns around this elastic beam. So in this specific case, the velocity is 2.8 meters per second, and also width of the beam is only 2 centimeters, and the length is 6 centimeters, and thickness is 0.25 millimeter. And you can see a nice vortex. And you can see nice vortices shaded from the tip of the beam here. So you can see the vortices are shaded from the edge, actually, both edges. So we didn't show the left side of beam, but the right side you can see the vortices are shaded from the beam, tip of the beam. And then you can see sign of vortices is kept keep changing. So when they're going downward on the right. Going downward on the right side, there is the counterclockwise, the red vertex is shaded. And then when it reverse its motion, it's a previous shaded counterclockwise vertices will be sitting on top. And then they're going to generate the clockwise vortices blue here. And then that's why they're going to shed this kind of vortex dipole over time like this. So this is more the 3D version. The 3D version. So, left side, the vortices is connected to the right side of the vortices because through this beam, it's all connected. So, they're going to make the vortex tube is connected to the front side of the beam like this. So, first, we want to quantify what is the circulation, what is the vorticity this beam can generate. So, we look at the 2D We look at the 2D version of this beam, which is like a beam segment here. This beam is moving up and down, and then y-axis is along the beam direction or transverse direction, the beam direction. And then Z is the up direct, the vertically up direction. So then if this kind of the beam, finite beam is moving up and down, there's an analytical solution in 2D. So 2D velocity. So, 2D velocity potential is given in this form. This one has been studied by the Wagner and also von Karman studied this one, and also a lot of other papers using this potential model to describe the flow field around it. And here's again, Z is the vertical direction, and Y is the beam width, the core length of this beam, and the B is the width of, sorry, The width of uh sorry, it should be 2B. Sorry, this is not B, 2B. The B is a half-width of the beam. So, also, we know the displacement of the beam from the momentum balance. This one has been studied by our group, also by David Carrey in France. So, this is simply based on the momentum balance: how much momentum this raindrop carries, and it's balanced. And it's balanced with how much the beam will vibrate up and down. So, this is given in this form. By using this form for Z, you can calculate what is the total circulation generated by this beam, which is going to be a simple form, 2 times V times DZ over DT. So, this is a final answer for circulation. We check with the experiment there. So, red curve is a theoretical, the The line of this 2D potential model, and dots are from the experiment. So there's a little delay because we cannot measure any vorticity or circulation right on the beam. So it should be shedded or it should be get off from the beam a little bit. So that's why little delay of our measurement compared to theory, but it's pretty much good. It's a good estimation for in terms of total circulation. In terms of total circulation, okay. Okay, so now we add particles on top of this beam. So we speckle a lot of the particles on top, and then we try to understand how these particles are move along with these vertices. Still, we put the smoke particles on the background because the smoke particles are small, so we assume smoke particles. So we assume small particles will represent the airflow. But the particles we put on top of the beam is a 10 micrometer size of particle, which is relatively bigger compared to small particles. So these particles will represent the spores or the pollens in the real system. So you can see a lot of the particles are ejected from this beam, and you can see the particles are still. And you can see the particles stay on the edge of the vortex wings quite well. So, this is something we try to understand in this talk here. So, this is a particles we tested. So, smoke is less than two micrometer and Stokes number is way, way small. So, smaller Stokes number means this particle will follow the flow, the medium flow very well. If you have a higher Stokes number, then it will deviate. Stokes number, then it will deviate from the airflow in the background. So we tested with the solid glass particle, hollow glass particles, and pollen. So we have all this experiment done with this system. So I will skip this one, but this is showing how these particles are staying on the edge of this vortex ring. So this is something we try to understand in this talk. So method we're going to So, the method we're going to use is relatively well developed. It's a finite time Lyapunov exponent. So, probably you already know the Lyapunov exponent, which is how far the neighboring particles are separating over time. We're going to use the backward, the finite time Lyapunov exponent. I can explain later why we use the backward instead of the forward. So, backward is better for the unstable. Better for the unsteady flow case. So that's why I put the minus sign here. So if lambda is positive, then the particles will converge. When the lambda is negative, then particles will diverge. So this is a little different from what conventionally we use the Lyapunov exponent. So where this kind of analysis used Lagrangian coherent structure, people use in biological system too. So when jellyfish. Same tube. So, when jellyfish feed on the particles in the flow, using this analysis, they can see what is the region of the fluid they're going to, this jellyfish will withdraw toward the body. And another interesting study, recent study is about the rescue or search and rescue mission. So, if you know the coherent structure in the ocean, and if you Ocean, and if you lose a person in the ocean, in this case, mannequin, if you lose a mannequin in the ocean, then you can predict where these mannequins will move around in the ocean. So this kind of the analysis people use to understand the particle motion in the flow. So that's a general term. So our system, we have a vortex dipole will be shed from Be shed from the vibrating leaf, and you're going to see a nice vortex shape like this. And what we're going to look at is the two structures. One is called the elliptic Lagrangian coherent structure, which is nothing but a coherent vortex is the detecting like this. And the other structure is a hyperbolic LCS, which is a Lagrange-Point structure, which is the contour of the large FTLE, the Lyapunov. Large FTLE, the Lyapunov fixed point. So large FTLE means the, again, this is a negative sign. Large FTLE means where the particles will converge. So this is also the unstable manifold in the set point. So where the particles are converging toward. So for example, let's say there are two particles separate this much distance, and then if they go around and if they merge. Around and if they merge, then in this case, the lambda will be positive again in our analysis. Okay, so I will show you the result of the finite time Lyapunov exponents. So again, the red, the dark red is positive value. The positive value shows the contour of unstable manifold, and the unstable manifold is where the particles will be converging. This is what you are seeing here. And also, we also measure another quantity people used in that community, which is the Lagrangian average vorticity deviation. It's nothing but you're going to calculate the vorticity compared to the background vorticity over time. So, in that way, you can identify the coherent structure in the flow as the Structure in the flow as the beam is moving up and down, you can identify the coherent structures, which is typically dipole of the flow. So for the downward stroke, you can see this contour of large high, the Lyapurple exponent, will show the cap or the envelope. Cap or the envelope of this kind of the coherent structures, you're going to see this kind of this mushroom shape with covers this kind of coherent structure. So there's a common feature we're going to see. So once they shed the dipole, at the core of the dipole, they have a elliptic coherent structure, which is a vortex. And on the edge, there's an unstable manifold covering this kind of dipole structures. And this is the obstroke. I will skip this one. And then one thing we notice that these particles are stay on the envelope or the large Lyopov exponent contours. So that's something we try to understand. So this is not our calculation. This is something someone else's calculation, George Havler at MIT. I mean, he's not ETH. He did all the calculations. Did all the calculations. So he measured the flux of flux. If you have any contour, so if you choose any contour, and what is the flux out of this contour? So he do some calculation of the particle dynamics, and this is the final result I want to show you. So this result is complicated, but you can understand quite well because, for example, let's say particle density is higher than the air density. Higher than the air density, then this term will be positive. Okay. And then let's say you have only vorticity, if you have only circulation without any shear component. Then what you expect, if you have a dense particle in the swirling motion, then dense particles will be pushed outward, right? So then you have a positive value here, and you have a positive value omega squared, then you expect the positive outflows. Okay, so this is what they're measuring. Okay, so this is at the core of the vortex, omega squared is positive. So then you're going to push particle out. How about this region, which is unstable manifold? Unstable manifold, along the unstable manifold, this both the shear normal shear component and then shear strain rate and then normal strain rate. Shear a normal strain rate both will be positive value, and maybe there might be the zero vorticity. Then, this term will be negative value because you have minus sign in front. Then what happened on this unstable manifold? The particles will be go inward, which means the particles will accumulate on the unstable manifold. And then particles will be exceeding or escaping from this quantum structure. So they're escaping. They are escaping from the query structure and they are staying on the unstable manifold. That is what we are seeing in our experiment. So, we also quantitatively, we measure. So, we calculate the average FTLE value at particle locations. So, if particle is moving from here to outside to unsettle manifold, then overall the FTLE value should increase over time. So, that is what we are seeing. Over time. So, that is what we are seeing in the experiment, too. So, I will conclude here. So, we try to understand how spores can disperse in the air by the fluttering leaf. And we use the Lagrangian coherent structure analysis to understand how these spores can escape from the coherent vortex and then get into the contour of high Lagrangian. Lagrangian, sorry, high the Lyapur exponent region. So that's what we studied in this in this experiment. So that's all I prepare. Any questions? Thank you so much, Sunny. Questions? Questions for Questions from the virtual people? Not right now, so we have a couple in-house questions. So how important is it what kind of particles you put there? For example, the density difference between the particles and the surrounding flow? Yes, that's a good question. Question. So all the formula here is the density difference between the air and the particles. So this delta term. So if you have more density difference, this flux will be increased in terms of magnitude. And also this tau term here is the Stokes time scale, which is a density term is in there. So also viscous. Term is in there, so also viscosity over here. So it's a matter of the so if you have more density difference, then you will have a much faster motion of the leaking out of this the vortex core. If you have a less density difference, then it will slowly smear out from the current vortex. Yeah. Okay, thank you. So this is in air, so it's hard to have particles that are less dense, correct? But could you inverse the tendency if the flow was water and you had a bubble? The flow was water and you had a bubble? So we haven't done any experiment, but the yeah, I think they in the so this kind of analysis used in the geophysical flow a lot. And then they make a buoy which is lighter than the water. So in that case, they observe the opposite directional motion or flux. Yeah. And here's a list of the particles we tested and also. Particles we tested, and also other pollens or spores. So, all of this is denser than air almost a thousand times. Yes, okay, thank you very much. It's a very beautiful experiment. Thanks.
