Surely if we should or should not record. So, okay, we record. So let me give you the background of what we will be talking about. So case of content for DNA that I don't need to elaborate on. And then the object we will be dealing with is the LPF and surface area, which for P different from minus. For p different from minus n is defined as, well, I'll denote it like so, and then it's defined as the integral over the boundary of the convex body k. And we integrate the Gauss curvature and take it to the power p over n plus p. And then we divide by, so we'll take a point x on the boundary and its outer normal nx. We'll take the inner product and raise that to the power np minus 1 over n plus p. Over n plus p, and we integrate with respect to the usual surface area measure. And that is the p F surface area of a condensed water. Now that is a very nice quantity. It has very nice properties. It is affine in the case when p is equal to 1 and otherwise linear invariant. There is an affine isoparimetric inequality associated with it. And, well, it kind of Well, it kind of measures or gives you information about the boundary behavior of a convex body. And the other property that it has, it is upper, respectively lower semi-continuous, depending on the range of P. So one of our motivations for the work that I'm going to present now is that we were asking ourselves: can we find a quantity that is actually We find a quantity that is actually not only upper, respectively, lower, semi-continuous, but indeed in fact continuous. So the question, can we get continuous invariants that have still the same nice properties as this PFN surface area? And yes, we can. So I'll give the definition. We call them the inner and outer are them the inner and outer P maximal affine surface areas. So let me give you the maximal ones first, the inner and outer maximal ones first. So the P range is as before between minus infinity and infinity and again P is different from minus N. Then the inner maximum P F n surface area is given as follows. We'll take the soup overall P f n P-affine surface areas of C, where C is a convex body contained in K. And likewise, the outer maximal affine surface area. Now we'll take the super overall convex body C that contain K. So those are the outer ones and the inner ones, the inner and outer minimal affine surface areas are defined in the same fashion. So the inner So um the inner minimum affine surface area, for instance, is the infimum overall C contained in K and we'll take the P affine surface area of such C's and analog for the outer minimum affine surface area. So the first thing that we observe after having given that definition is that not all, so those quantities are not relevant for all P. So what do I mean by this? For instance, mean by this. For instance, if we look at the inner P minimal affine surface area, we observe that this is zero for all k and for all p. So that's not interesting. So why is this? Well I'll write again the definition of p as on surface area so it's so that we have it and understand this. So it's the integral over the boundary of k and then we integrate the Gaussian. The Gauss curvature of a boundary point, and then we had this inner product of a point on the boundary with its outer number in the bottom, so n t minus 1 over n plus t. So that was the expression for the p-affine surface area. And now we observe that, so here we'll take, if we look at the inner minimal affine surface area, then we'll take the infimum over Take the infimum over the affine surface area of all convex bodies that are contained in K. So, in particular, this expression is smaller if we will take the infimum over all polytops that are contained in K and its affine surface area. And if P ranges between zero and infinity, or between minus infinity and minus n, then we will see that the exponent of the Gauss curvature is Of the Gauss curvature is positive, and for a polytope, Gauss curvature is zero almost everywhere on the boundary, so we'll get zero here. So that is for this p range, we'll get zero. And for the other p range, that is the one that was missing, p between minus n and zero, we'll observe that, okay, the inner minimal affine surface area will be smaller than taking the p-fine surface area of an epsilon. Surface area of an epsilon Euclidean ball contained in the body. K, and then using the homogeneity of the P f and surface area, the epsilon comes out with this factor. And if we will take now, well, we do take infimum overall epsilon, so we will get zero also in this case. So this inner P minimal affine surface area is not interesting. And similarly, one can show that the interesting P range Show that the interesting p-range for the other quantities, for instance, for the inner maximum P-FN surface area is 0n, and for the outer maximum P-FN surface area is N infinity, and for the outer minimal P-FN surface area, it's minus N0. So it's only these P ranges we will be concerned with. Now, I also want to mention that for some P the expressions are Uh the expressions are uh trivial, uh namely if p is equal to zero, then in that case, in that case we'll just get n times the volume of k, and if p is equal to n, then for those two quantities we'll just get n times the volume of the Euclidean ball. Okay, so let me now come briefly to the properties. We still have f and respectively linear invariance. Linear invariance, we still have f and isoparametric inequalities, so these quantities stay the same, or these properties remain the same. But now we have actually the continuity question? Yes, define invariance. Translation is defined translation? No, no, it depends on P. If P is equal to 1, like I said in the previous slide, if P is equal to 1, you have affine invariance, but for other P you are only having linear invariance. It depends on the P, but I have written I find invariance. I should. Do you assume that origin belongs to the water? Um basically we assume that origin, that the center of gravity is at zero. Basically we assume that, yeah. So we have these properties stay the same. The same, and now we'll have the continuity for the relevant p-ranges. So, for instance, the relevant p-range for the inner maximum p-fine surface area is from 0 to n, and then this inner maximum P-Fine surface area is continuous in the Hausdorff metric, and so are the others for their relevant p-ranges. Okay, so the next thing. So the next thing one can remark is that one can show that actually for the relevant p-ranges these suprema are actually maxima and the maxima are attained by upper respectively lower semi-continuity and compactness. One has to do a little bit of work, but one sees that the key inner affine surface area is Surface area is actually attained at a convex body k0 contained in K. And likewise, the outer maximum P-F surface area is also attained at a convex body K0. Well, I have called it K0, but of course the two are not the same. I always call this extremum body for which the supremum is attained. I always call K0. And I've also called it here K0. So again, K0. So again by compactness respectively upper and lower semi-continuity, though it's not completely obvious, one has to do a little bit of work, one sees that this infima and suprema are attained for a specific convex body K0. And so it's a natural question to ask oneself. Well, first of all, this shows the other motivation that brought us to consider these questions. So if we think about the About the Fritz-John theorem, which asks for the existence of the ellipse suite of maximum volume contained in a convex body. So, Fritz-John showed that such a thing exists and is unique. Now, here we ask a similar question. We asked for this convex body, for instance, in a given convex body that has maximal PF and surface area, and it is this K0. So, then a natural question is: what can be said about question is what can be said about this k0 and here I have to go back also and give you some background information namely if the dimension is 2 and p is equal to 1 we can say something about k0. Okay? So n is now 2 and p is equal to 1 and then there is a theorem by Bavani which says that if If we have a convex body k in R2, then there is a unique, so we knew the k0 exists for which this maximum is attained. We will talk just about k equals 1 and the inner maximal affine surface area. We know that such a k0 for which this maximal affine surface area is attained exists, so the thing the important thing here in the theorem is that this k zero is unique, and that was proved by Varani. Unique, and that was proved by Barani. More can be said about this K0, namely, K0 is related to parabolic art. What do I mean? So if, for instance, we have that the K is the square with side length 2, say here 0, in dimension 2. In dimension 2, then this K0 looks as follows. So it's the parabolic arc that has tangent line at that point, touches the square and has tangent line equal to this edge of the square. And then it's this parabolic arc. I'm just drawing in this picture by symmetry. We'll have it in the other quadrants as well. So the boundary is described by the parabolic wall in the first quadrant, by this. In the first quadrant, by this parabolic arm. So that is the boundary of the K0 for the square. Okay? This K0 has other nice geometric properties and to explain those I'll need to introduce more things. Um more things. So um by uh this script capital N of K, um we denote the set of our convex polygons contained in a given convex body K with vertices from the lattice C squared over N. So it looks like so. So we have the lattice so we have the lattice So we have the lattice, so we have this lattice C squared over N. So here are my lattice points. And then we'll take the convex half one. Here is not very convincing object, but looks like so. So that would be such a lattice polygon contained in this convex body. Okay? So all those lattice polygons we take and Take. And then there was a question by Versik who asked if there is a limit shape for such lattice polygons. And the next theorem explains what that's supposed to mean, limit shape. So this question was answered by Barani, the question of Dershik. So Barani proved that for every convex point K in R2 and every epsilon positive, V as the limit. as the limit as capital N, that is, if you do the grid final and final, so as capital N goes to infinity, of what of the cardinality of all those lattice polygons that are at Hausdorff distance epsilon to k0 divided by all lattice polygons is equal to 1. So almost all, for epsilon given, almost all lattice polygons are epsilon. Our epsilon close in Hausdorff distance to this k0, this object that is giving us the maximal inner f and p for p equal 1 in that case f and surface area. So in that sense, this k0 is the limit shape of lattice polygons. So this k0 has nice properties and then we ask ourselves, okay, what can be said if p is different from 1 and what can be said in high. One and what can be said in higher dimensions. And that is work in progress with Han Huang and with Carsten. And so far we've come up with determining the size of these other quantities, that is the maximal P inner affine surface area, respectively the other quantities if n is bigger or equal than three and if p is different. And if p is different from 1. Okay, and what we could do is the next theorem. And to state the next theorem, I need the isotropic constant, so I'm not saying much about it. It has been mentioned in talks before, so I don't need to say too much. So we need the isotropic constant, definition is here, and then we'll have the following theorem, which says that, okay, there is an absolute constant. There is an absolute constant C such that we have. Now, here I've only written the theorem for the P inner maximal affine surface area. The other ones are similar. So, not to clutter too much things, let's concentrate on this P inner maximal affine surface area, for which we know that the relevant P weight is from 0 to N. To n. And what can we say? Okay, we can then we'll see that this inner maximal P-fine surface area is divided by the volume of k to the power m minus p over m plus p, is bounded above by the same quantity for the Euclidean ball, and from below also by this quantity, but then there is this additional factor, 1 over n to the 5 over 6, and then the absolute constant divided by the 0. And then the absolute constant divided by the isotropic constant of the body, and this has to be raised to this power. So that's the theorem. I'll elaborate a bit on it, because it may look a bit much. But let me first tell you the equality conditions. So equality holds trivially in the right-hand side, that is here, if p is equal to 0 or p equal to n, because we have seen that those are the cases. Because we have seen that those are the cases when this maximal inner P-Fine surface area is either n times the volume of K or N times the volume of the Euclidean wall. So then we have trivially inequality on the right-hand side and otherwise equality holds if and only if, it is in the right-hand side inequality, if and only if k is a centered ellipsoid. Okay? I've written the inequality again, so the interesting expression is this ratio. Expression is this ratio between this maximum P in a refine surface area and the volume of K raised to the power. And let's look at the right-hand side, which just involves this ratio for the Euclidean unit ball. So then this is because K in a maximal affinity surface area of the Euclidean unit ball is nothing else but n times the volume of the Euclidean unit ball. So what you'll get is this quantity here, which is just this constant that depends. This constant that depends on n and p, like so. So we can rewrite the theorem. So the inner maximum P-F on surface area, which we know is attained at this body k0, is bounded above by this constant times the volume of the body k raised to this power n minus p over n plus p, and from below by the same quantity with this additional factor of Of dimension to the five over six and the isotropic constant. So, in particular, for p equals one, this constant is just, that is c n1, is just an absolute constant c times n to the one over n. So then the maximal 1 affine surface area, which is the affine surface area of this extremal body K0, is bounded above by. Is bounded above by this quantity. So, in short, what we can say is basically this maximum P inner affine surface area is proportional to a power of the volume of K. Of course, our goal is to say more precise things about this body K0, that's this project on the long run, like things along those lines or even Lines are even things related to lattice structure. Good. Fritten the inequality again. Because I want to say two words about the proof. So the proof of the right-hand side inequality is not difficult at all. That's just the LPF and isoparametric inequality, which Isoparametric inequality, which was proved by Ludwig. Well, the case P equals to 1 is the classical case. For P bigger than 1, it was proved by Ludwig. For P between 0 and 1, it was proved by Hooke. And all other cases were treated by Lespignet and myself. So what does the inequality say? Well, here I've just listed the case that's interesting, the p-range that's interesting for us, which is the p-range between, for p bigger equal than zero. Then it says Equal than zero, then it says that the P-Fine surface area of K is more or equal than the P-Fine surface area of the Euclidean unit ball times the volume of K divided by the volume of the Euclidean unit ball. And both are raised to this power n minus P over n plus P. And equality holds if and only if K is an ellipsoid. And then it's, of course, straightforward to prove the right-hand side because this maximum PF and surface area, here is the definition. Surface area, here is the definition again, is the maximum overall affine surface area of convex bodies C that are contained in K. We apply the LP affine isoparametric inequality and get that. And then we upper bound, of course, this volume of C by the volume of A. So that's that. So that gives us the right-hand side inequality with equality characterizations. So for the left-hand side inequality, For the left-hand side inequality, here is again the inequality, we have to work a little bit more. We have to use a thin-shell theorem due to Paulis and Olivier Guedot and Emmanuel Miman, that was also already mentioned in previous talks. So what does it say? So if we have a convex body that is in isotropic position, it says then the volume that is in a thin shell with radius square root of shell with radius square root of n times the isotropic constant is big. That's what this says. And so what we do to prove the lower bound of our theorem is we where did we go? Here it is. We let me just, as this is here, let me just illustrate things again on the queue. It's an isotropic position. It's an isotopic position, so I guess it is one half now. So, what we do is we look at this fin shell. So, we look at this thin shell and then we consider a convex body that sits in this thin shell. And there we have to choose it carefully. So, that's the convex body. So that's the convex body. So it's in shape, but it should also be a subset of the given convex body k. So it looks... Well, now here I didn't draw it too well, so let's just concentrate on this part. And here it's in. So that is the body that we consider, let's say C. And what we do is then we estimate the, from below, the P-affine surface area of this convex. Surface area of this convex, what we see that's appropriately chosen in the thin shell. And that's a little bit of work, so I don't have time to do that. So I'm finished here with the talk. So thank you very much. I wanted to take your time for one more thing, which For one more thing, which i it lets me open this. Just let me open the file. But it just on this is already open just in the bottom right corner. Down, down, down, down, down. Down. Down? Down. Ah, so it's where does it open? Where is it?
