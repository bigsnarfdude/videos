Um so I want to introduce today's speaker or Lika here. So she is my co-organizer which means without her you wouldn't be here at all. She's the one with the energy. She took a lot of time and sometimes I drop ball and she would be like Anita have you done this? Oh of course not. So yeah I really want to thank you Anu, it's been really lovely working with you. So already has very close collaboration She has very close collaboration with experimentalists, which I really admire. And so she's going to talk to us about fracture healing. Thank you so much, Anita. Yeah, and it was also a pleasure organizing. I'm really happy it's going really well. I'm also having a lot of fun. So, yeah, I kind of want to dive right into the subject. So, today I will be talking about fracture healing. It was something that I was working on before. My group is now working on some other. My group is now working on some other things, but I wanted to highlight this a bit because it also fits very nicely with the project that we're doing. And so, yeah, I think it would be a nice, let's say, starter introduction for then what the team will present tomorrow. So, yeah, I think the world is full of accidents. And I think specifically here, I'm kind of happy actually that I didn't fall yet. I think this is a bit of a dangerous environment. I mean, for me, as a very clumsy person, but you know, you can imagine, of course, that you slip, for example. Of course, that you slip, for example, and unfortunately, in some of these cases, you can actually break, for example, your leg. And so, here you can see in the center a picture of a long bone, and here you can see schematically the different phases that you would typically go through if you, for example, fracture your bone, like your femur. So, you will start at the left top corner, so with an inflammatory phase. So, as you fracture your leg, you will. So, as you fracture your leg, you will also of course rupture your blood vessels to have the formation of a hematoma. There will be a blood clot there. You will get a lot of inflammatory signals that are there, macrophages infiltrating this and so on. And then after a couple of days, you will proceed normally to the soft callous phase, in which you will, in the center, as you can see, form a cartilage. So, this is a kind of template to start stabilizing the fracture. To start stabilizing the fracture, because of course, your bone is also an important structure, it's mechanically loaded, and you want to make sure it's also stable. Otherwise, if the two ends would keep on moving, you would continuously actually disrupt the energy that you are creating. So, you want to have a stable structure so you can actually heal. And on the sides, you will have some direct bone formation. So, you will directly form the bone. Be formed in the bone. And then you will proceed to the heart callous phase, and then you have indirect bone formation. And actually, that actually just means that the cartilage now gets transformed into bone. So that's why it's called indirect because you go through this intermediate cartilage step. And then you'll see that you'll have, let's say, a union. So there's bone across both sides. So you kind of have one hole again, so it's mechanically stable. But typically, you form a bit too much bone, and so then you have the revolving. Much load, and so then you have the remodeling phase so that in the end it gets adapted to your mechanical load again, and that you know the size and the shape is exactly the same as it was before. But that, of course, that final phase can take a couple of months, like this is a long-term process to then fully heal. And so, fractures are kind of special because they're one of the few tissues, or maybe even the only one, I don't dare to make such a dare statement, but that actually can heal scarlessly because of this. Scarlessly, because of this process. Now, unfortunately, in some of the cases, this doesn't go well. So, around 10 to 15 cases, you have what is called a non-union. So, it means that you still have a continuous defect area, so you don't have bridging. And this is, let's say, orthopedically very challenging to solve. So, it really is still a problem that a lot of people are trying to find solutions for. Now, I want to structure actually my talk a bit according to. Structure actually, my talk is a bit according to this slide. So, it's actually a picture of a review because I work in the regenerative medicine area often. And so, what you can see, this is a bit of an overview of the type of computational models that you can make, either more data-driven or mechanistic, really going from the bench to the bedside. So, for all of these stages, if you want to bring something, let's say, to the bedside, you can really make computational models. And so, you can phrase it a tiny bit differently. Phrase it a tiny bit differently, and so this is what I will kind of use to structure my talk. And so, first, I propose that we have a look, let's say, at this cellular scale and some of the modeling efforts that we did there. So, this is very briefly. So, if you look at the cell scale, or let's say intracellularly, the way that cells actually feel their environment and will also use this information from the extracellular matrix in their extracellular environment. Matrix in their extracellular environment to do something is through integrant signaling. So you can see here, so you have these green transmembrane proteins, those are integrins, they're heterodimers, they can cluster together. It's important that they cluster together actually because that allows really for this mechanical sensing, so for sensing of the forces. And they can make a direct link, let's say, via the cytoskeleton with the nucleus, but they also can do a lot of, let's say, biochemical stuff. Can do a lot of, let's say, biochemical signaling, and in this way, they allow actually the cells to sense their exocellular environment. And this was actually a model. Oh, yeah, sorry. And so you actually have many different types of integrins and they also bind to different exostellar matrix proteins. But this is an interesting, let's say, problem also to look at to understand, okay, how does it say the signaling from the exostellar environment influences the integrant signaling? What can we learn from that? The integrant signal, what can we learn from that? Specifically, because there's also competition. So, the same type of ligands, let's say, combined to the same integrants. So, or sorry, different types of ligands can bind to the same integrins. So, this was actually a model made by one of my PhD students. It's actually very simple. So, we just start from an inactive integrin. It can get activated. We have two types of ligands. They can bind and they can cluster. So, if you look at it as a Cluster. So if you look at it, it's actually fairly simple, but we're just trying to understand, okay, which one of these dominates under which conditions, and what can we actually learn from analyzing this system. So we explored this. We tried also many different kinds of combination. And not so surprising, but actually nice that we got it confirmed is that, of course, the affinity really dominates this. Like, if you have a high affinity, then for sure in a steady state, that ligand will be mostly biomedical. That ligand will be mostly biochemistry integrin. But of course, there's let's say a balance also with your initial condition. If you have much more of the ligand available, that can also skew the system a bit. And I think for us, let's say as mathematical biologists, this is not so surprising. But it is interesting, let's say, for some of our collaborators because they're developing, you know, for example, synthetic peptides that target these integrants or particular drugs. And it's important for them to know, like, okay, how can I push this? To know, like, okay, how can I push the system? And that if you're only focusing on one ligand per se, you don't get the outcome that you want because it's in competition with the other ones as well. So, if you have other high-affinity ligands, then that might just be dominating and you just don't see any effect of, let's say, the peptide you're designing. So, moving on now to the tissue level. So, we also developed So, we also developed, or this is actually my PhD, a bone regeneration model. So, this is really a multi-scale model. And so, let me run you through it. So, what you have actually at the tissue level, at the top part, these are partial differential equations. And we use those to actually describe the main effects or the main steps in fracture healing. So, as I mentioned before, you have, let's say, the stem cells. You have, let's say, the stem cells. So, those are on top, they can proliferate, they can migrate because it's a spatial model, they can produce particular growth factors. And so, these stem cells can then differentiate in chondrocytes for this indirect bone formation, but they could also differentiate towards cone cells for the direct bone formation. And this really depends on the local amount of growth factor. So, you have, let's say, cartilage, conversation. Cartilage or chondrocytic chondrogenic growth factors, so that promotes the differentiation towards these cartilage cells, or you have actually growth factors that push more towards the bone-forming cells. And then all of these cells can proliferate, they can move, they can secrete depending on the cell type, different growth factors. And something that was then also added by me, because actually this was building on a model that my supervisor had made. On a model that my supervisor had made, is that we coupled this actually to a description of the blood vessel formation. Again, it's also known in fracture healing. Your blood vessel formation is essential. You break your blood vessels. And in order to heal, of course, all these cells, they're very active. They need to have sufficient oxygen and nutrients, otherwise, it will not work. And so we wanted to explicitly have the blood vessels also in our model. And so what we Model. And so, what we did is that the endothelial cells are, let's say, discretely modeled. So, it's actually every grid cell can represent one endothelial cell. And that's how we couple, let's say, the different grids together. And then every endothelial cell has a tiny intracellular program, which you can see here. These are, let's say, some proteins that determine how the blood vessels, as they grow, will also form branches. So, that's what the idea is. Branches. So that's what the intercellular program does. And all of it is then connected in the sense that the cells will secrete this GV, this angiogenic growth factor, which will feed into this intracellular program that will determine how the blood vessels grow. And then depending on where the blood vessels are, you will have a local amount of oxygen, which actually influences how these stem cells will differentiate to these different cell types. So all of it is connected. It is connected. And so here are some of the results. It goes actually much quicker than on my computer, but that's fine. So, what you see here, so on top, you have, let's say, the schematic of what we're simulating. So, here we have the long bone-like things. You can see, let's say, these yellow areas, that's your bone, and then the red part is, let's say, the fracture zone. And that is what we are modeling here. And so, you can see that the blood vessel is growing from the side, and then you can also see that the bone is forming. Can also see that the bone is forming from the sides towards the center. And so, typically, around 30 days, you have bone everywhere, so you have what we call bridging, so you actually have successful THA. Now, of course, this is very, very symmetric because, of course, I only simulate one quarter and I kind of, you know, mirror, so that's why it's extremely symmetric. So, this actually was kind of nice. But then, of course, we also want to know: okay, does this make sense? To know, okay, does this make sense? So, we actually have indeed some collaborations with people in the hospital that can do experiments, for example, on mice. And they can measure, for example, as a function of time, let's say, different areas. So, periosteal, intercortical, and industrial just are different places, let's say, within the fractured zone. They can measure the types of tissues as a function of time. And so, we were quite happy. So, here you can see the comparison of two different models. Comparison of two different models. So we were quite happy actually that, let's say, the full line matches it qualitatively quite nice. But of course, to be fully honest, there's a lot of parameters in this model. And some of these more interstellar processes, it's very difficult to know the exact rate, right? So it's a bit fitted to get, let's say, this emergent outcome, but yeah, for sure, this can be improved. Now, then, of course. Now, then, of course, we wanted to use this to get a bit more understanding: like, why is it that in certain cases things do not heal? So, then we actually started applying the model to different kinds of applications. And yeah, I won't have time to go through all of them today, but I'll just pick two, which I think are just nice. I very illustrate, let's say, the potential. So, one of them is, let's say, large segmental defects. And so, it's known that if you have a It's known that if you have a very big gap, that it doesn't heal. So that's what they call a critical size defect. It actually represents a bit, let's say, our own regeneration capacity. So in humans, it's around one centimeter. If it's bigger than that, it will not heal from itself. You'll need other solutions. And this can be a problem, you know, if you have, for example, like a tumor resection or something and they need to take out a big piece of bone, it becomes very challenging. Now, of course, computationally, this is very... Now, of course, computationally, this is very easy for us. You know, we can just make the geometry larger, right? So, and but that was, of course, also the question, like, would we get actually a non-healing? Like, would we get that if I would just simply enlarge the area? And we did, so we're quite happy. So, you can see that we do get a bit of bone still surrounding the bone ends, but in the center, there's nothing. And that actually represents quite well the radiographs that you also get from patients with a non-union. So, they have like Patients with a non-union. So they have like this capping of the both of the ends, but nothing in between. And then we actually embarked a bit on an exploration. Like what if we would want to treat these patients with a tissue engineering therapy? Because I'm in a tissue engineering institute. So they're developing all kinds of therapies where they want to, for example, add cells, so stem cells, or add stem cells with growth factors or growth factors. And we're just for fun, saying like. And we're just for fun saying, like, okay, what would be the best timing to do that? So, would it be directly after the fracture, or maybe we need to wait a tiny bit? And this is, of course, a very nice thing you can do computationally, because if you have to do that experiment, it's very, you know, it would require a lot of mice. So, what was very surprising, actually, so what you see here, so the X's are no treatment. So, this is, let's say, your baseline. So, this is 50%. So, don't focus so much on the exact numbers, but this is, let's say, your. So much on the exact numbers, but this is, let's say, a non-union, so you don't have healing. But what was interesting, if we add, let's say, the cells or cells with growth factors, that actually in the beginning you make it worse. So on the x-axis is the days post-fracture. So this is the days post-fracture. So if you start at day zero, it means that right after your fracture, you start with the treatment. And if it's like 14, it means that you wait like 14 days and then you would start with the treatment. Would start with the treatments. So, if you start too early, it seems actually that you form less bone, then if you would do nothing at all, which was very counterintuitive, but I'm going to explain to you later why that is. And then we saw that if you waited a bit longer, then apparently you could push the system and it would be a lot better. And so we were really thinking about like, why do we get these results? Like, why is that? You're adding more cells and it's actually getting worse. But what you're actually doing is that in those early times. That in those early time points, your blood vessels have not been restored yet. So, what you're actually doing is that you're making it worse because you're adding cells that are also consuming a lot of oxygen and there is already little oxygen. So, it's actually better to wait a certain period so that there is already some blood vessel formation, and then you add the stem cells and you can enhance the healing process. Process. So I wouldn't feel comfortable, let's say, like with these exact numbers. This is more qualitative behavior. I wouldn't really say this is the right date. But it was very nice and actually also experimental collaborators started thinking about it in a different way and started thinking of, oh, maybe we should also create like oxygen delivering biomaterials, or maybe we should kind of precondition ourselves to survive better in hypoxia. So it did inspire them also to look into different ways to enhance the survival. To different ways to enhance the survival of the stem cells that you would give in these kinds of stem cell therapies. And then another application that I would like to talk about are NF1 patients. So NF1 patients, this is actually a rare genetic disease. It's actually a pediatric disease. So these patients actually have mutations in their NF1 gene. NF1 gene and they can have all kinds of effects due to that. So it's not per se localized to the bone, so they can have all kinds of effects. But if it's localized to the bone, then what actually happens is that when they're born, they get this progressive bowing of their lower leg, as you can see. And at some point, it fractures naturally, so it can even just fracture while they're learning to walk. Rather, like learning to walk because it's just mechanically, like, yeah, it's not, yeah, it's not the best blow, let's say. And this kind of fracture apparently is orthopedically very, very difficult to treat. So they can add plates, they can mechanically stabilize, but it seems also that these children, because of probably the genetic, let's say, underlying disorder, their cells, let's say their biology is just not able to really regenerate and regenerate. And yeah, regenerate their bone. But it's actually very difficult because so often these children walk around with actually a broken leg for a very long time. And if they can't fix it, let's say the surgeons just amputate the leg. So it's really, it's a rare disease, but it's actually very bad for those children. So we were wondering, like, okay, could we actually capture the phenotype with our model by changing the parameters that have been proposed to be linked to this disease? So here you see some of it. So, here you see some of it. So, there's an effect on the fibroblast, there's an effect on the cartilage cells, and so on. So, we're thinking, okay, can we just change the rates that we have and see if we can mimic this phenotype again? So, yeah, so just also why actually computational models are really nice in this particular case is because it's a pediatric disease and it's a rare disease. So, you can imagine it's very difficult, of course, to do a lot of experiments with this population. And even if you can do experiments, it's a very difficult experience. And even if you can do experiments, it's a very small population, so it's hard to do then, let's say, statistics, there's high variability in treatment. So that's, of course, where computational models can be very nice. And so we actually did that. So we played around with the charometers and we did manage actually to get, let's say, a lot less bone formation and also a lot more fibrous tissue formation, which is really what these patients have. So that was already very encouraging. Already very encouraging. But then, actually, we moved on to try something more, which are then in silico patients. And actually, this is just a very fancy way of doing a sensitivity, right? But sensitivity analysis, but this is how you can sell it very nicely. So what you actually do is that I generate these virtual patients, but what it actually means is that every patient is just a different parameter values, right? But what we did do, so the parameters that, let's say, that we varied was those parameters that were linked, or hypothesized to be linked to this, yeah, let's say these alterations due to the NF1 gene. And we tried to really use the ranges that were also mentioned. So we tried to kind of sample from that. And then we generated 200 patients and we simulated those. And we actually simulated. And we actually simulated so we simulated the patient as is, and we then also simulated the patient with a treatment, because in the literature it was not clear what was the effect of the treatment. So it was very like for some it worked and for others it didn't. So we just wanted to try this out. And so BMP is a growth factor. It's a very potent growth factor actually that is used to stimulate bone formation. So we were just wondering, okay, what would happen if we would also administer that? Administer that. And what you can see here is that, on general, yeah, there's different ways of showing is that if you give the BMP, you have, let's say, more unions. The CI value is, let's say, a bit of a severity, so it's kind of the severity goes down. But you can see as well that, you know, it's not that there's still some patients that have a non-union, so it's not perfect. Now, what we did as well, which I personally find actually really nice, is Find actually really nice is because you have virtual patients, you can actually compare the condition with and without treatment, which you can never do in a real trial because either you got a treatment or not. But here we can. So this is what I plot actually here. So on the x-axis, you have, let's say, let's say without a treatment, and the y-axis is with treatment. And so every dot represents one virtual patient. And so what we can see, so this is just Can see, so this is just the data as is. You know, I didn't do any clustering or whatever. We actually saw these four clusters appearing. And so, if you think about it, so for example, the dark, so the black ones are the respondents because they had a high critical value without treatments, but with the treatments, they have a lower value, so they're responding to the BNP. The blue ones, not at all, because they had a high critical value and they still have it. The green ones are It. The green ones are asymptomatic, so they're not as critical before, but actually, the treatment also doesn't really improve it that much. And then we actually got these red ones, which seemed to be getting worse, which was something that we completely didn't expect actually in our simulations. Like, why are we having actually those patients as well, like those data points? So then we also moved on as well. So we published it in the end to understand a bit like what were the To understand a bit, like what were the underlying parameters that caused this, and also, yeah, in the future, we should actually also try to sample this space a bit more, like just mathematically, and see, can we better understand, can we also link this to some of the experimental work? But it was, I think, really, yeah, it really shows the power, of course, of what simulations can do and try to understand the different stratification in your patient cohort. So, I've talked about actually in all the simulations that I've shown you, I kind of focused on the soft callous phase and the hard callous phase. I didn't really model or showed you something about the inflammatory phase nor the remodeling one. That's also because we didn't include that. So, so far, you know, inflammation is not included. And so, but inflammation obviously is very important, you know, so we know. Is very important, you know. So, we know that in immune-restricted patients, they can have impaired healing. We know that if there's, for example, this macrophages coming into this hematoma, that there's lower healing. If you have chronic inflammation, it's also not good. So, all of this actually is very important. And that also, let's say, loading, because bone, of course, is a low-bearing tissue, actually influences a lot of these inflammatory cells as well. So, this is something actually that Laura is investigating. Actually, that Laura is investigating or will investigate. So, if you're interested in this, feel free to talk to her. It's also something that we're now doing a bit more in the project. So, looking at this inflammatory phase and how it prepares, really, let's say, for the subsequent phases of bone healing. So, this is, yeah, we are building this on the different model. I'm not going to give any, you know, this is just a teaser for tomorrow. So, this is an existing model, but we're Is an existing model, but we're adding the six differences to there. And I also just wanted to point out: so, if you haven't yet, so please talk to Maura, Eduardo, and Peter. So, they're all bone healing experts. Peter, especially, if you want to talk a bit more about the mechanics related to it. So, there's still one day left. Please do that. And also, another thing that I didn't talk about is, of course, these text differences, which we know also exists. So, for example, this is just a paper I explicitly. The paper. I explicitly took this one based on Richard's talk. As you said, like, we should maybe inspire, you know, like show that you can really get in very good journals by looking at sex differences. So here it is. So just to show that indeed, you know, there's more and more evidence pointing towards sex differences in fracture healing. Here I'm focusing on the repair phase again because tomorrow we'll show a bit more the sex differences in the inflammatory phase. But for example, it seems that in For example, it seems that in male patients they have higher estrogen E2 levels, they also have enhanced bone repair. So clearly E2 improves this kind of osteogenic differentiation, but it's really different in male and female cells. It seems that let's say females have less stem cells in their bone marrow, so that for sure also has an effect. And also, what is very interesting, I think, is that. Interesting, I think, is that these extracellular matrix proteins that I was also talking about in the beginning, apparently, actually, their genes actually are located on some of the X and Y chromosomes. So, also there, for sure, there must be an effect on, let's say, the type of exocell matrix proteins that you have, which determines, of course, the mechanical properties of your bone and so on. So, I think for sure there's plenty of things that still need to be researched here, and there's plenty of opportunity. Now, Now, okay, I still have eight minutes. Yes. So, what I just want to very, very briefly touch upon, because I'm not sure whether everybody in the audience is aware of this. If you do, you can just always raise your hand. But if not, I think these are just some interesting side notes. So, is this actually relevant? You know what we're all doing? Like, you know, I think we all enjoy it very much, but ideally, of course, it's also relevant, you know, like not just a fun academic exercise. And so, as you know, of course. Um, and so, as you know, of course, computational models can be very interesting as devices. Of course, if they're nicely validated, there are plenty of examples where you know, models in the broadest sense are used to optimize devices and medical treatments. We also saw it with Zara Waterstock, for example, you know, where algorithms are used for the interpretation of medical images or surgical planning and so on. So, for sure. But what I want to emphasize also here is that. Emphasize also here is that, which I personally find a very interesting development, is that models are more and more used also as regulatory tools. So, before, if you wanted to bring something to the market, be it a kind of new drug or a new device, you had to, for example, provide sufficient in vitro testing, then you had, let's say, animal testing, large clinical trials, because of course you needed to show efficacy, you needed to show that it was safe, and so on. That it was safe and so on. But more and more, the evidence can be also from computer models, which I find actually very exciting. This is a bit of an older slide. I'm not sure whether these parts are true, but so they do envision at the FDA, for example, that let's say these kind of virtual patients or models in general will really play more and more an important role as a regulatory tool. No, are we there yet? I don't think so. Are we there yet? I don't think so. But there's a lot of work ongoing, and that's actually why I wanted to emphasize it, because I think it might be interesting for you just to be aware of, is that there's a lot of people in the community working on, let's say, documentation, because of course, if you want to give this to the FDA, you need to properly describe what we're doing. Also on VVUQ, so this is, let's say, a framework that describes how you properly verify, validate. Verify, validate, and quantify, let's say, the uncertainty in your models, which I think is also interesting. Like, there's some proper, let's say, flowcharts and procedures available that you can use to really show, hey, this is, let's say, yeah, my model, and this is, I verified it in this way. And of course, as a community, we also need to think about standardization. So, there's some ongoing efforts. So, there are actually computational modeling working groups at the FDA and the EMA. So, they're really closely included. So, they're really closely in contact, let's say, with these regulatory bodies to discuss what are, let's say, the new developments in the field and what kind of evidence and so to kind of come up with these guidelines. I don't know whether it's known in the US as much, but in Europe you have the VPH Institute, so it's the Virtual Physiological Human, which actually is doing a lot of efforts in developing this. And Avi Tena Alliance is focusing a bit more on these encyclical clinical trials. So, if you're interested in this, please. So, if you're interested in this, please have a look. They have like very nice roadmaps as well of how they envision that this should be like, yeah, what are the next steps as a community, but also involving, of course, clinicians, like how do we move forward here? And yeah, there's a lot of course policy makers also involved, like, okay, how do we realize this? And so, these are some of the documents. You can actually also find them online. So, for example, there are these documents, for example, at the FDA. For example, at the FDA, that describes: okay, how do you assess the credibility of your computational models? For example, if you want to submit, let's say, a new medical device. And it's interesting to look at because it really has these flow charts and it really describes like what you should do and what are, let's say, the criteria and so on. So it's an interesting, yeah, depending, of course, on what your research is about, but I think it's an interesting document. And also, this, for example, so if you would actually submit. So, if you would actually submit, let's say, some computational evidence for a device, they have actually a guide on what the report should contain, which again is very interesting for us as well, because so it's actually a bit what we should also have in our materials and methods for a paper, right? So, I also told my students a couple of times that we could actually, you know, you could take this as a checklist if you want to see, like, did I mention everything? Because this is everything that you would need to reproduce. That you would need to reproduce, right, and to show that your model is doing what you're telling it is doing. So, again, it's just some screenshots, but you can find these documents all online, sorry. And they really describe like, okay, what you know, you should, for example, describe your considerable equations, you should describe, you know, the geometry, the initial conditions, all stuff that we know, but like they really detail it. And so it's really nice, actually. Yeah, that's just a, it's very helpful. And I think this will also help us again as a field to. This will also help us again as a field to standardize. And so you can see here in the appendices that they kind of made it specific for different kinds of, let's say, focus fields like fluid dynamics and mass transport and so on. And so this is just an example of a success story. So at Medtronic, apparently, they were redesigning one of their base makers because the downside of a basemaker typically, if you have one, is that you cannot have an MRI scan. Have one is that you cannot have an MRI scan, but the population that has a base maker, typically an older population, they kind of sometimes need an MRI scan. So, what they did is that they redesigned it entirely in silico. So, they redesigned, let's say, the beads, and I don't know exactly what, but they had another look, let's say. And then they actually created, let's say, a virtual MRI, and then they tested their new design in this virtual MRI. And as you can see here, it's 2.5. And as you can see here, it's 2.3 million scanning scenarios. And based on that, actually, they got approval to bring this, let's say, newly designed base maker on the market. So there was actually zero animal or clinical trials in this. It was purely computational, which I think is a really nice or exciting example. So with that, I'm going to wrap up. So as I mentioned, so you have in silicone models for all silicon models. Silicon models for all steps from the bench to the bedsides. And so, yeah, this can be very helpful to better understand fracture healing and to help design new treatments. The models that we have, it's always a bit of a bold statement, right? But we feel that it captures the most important mechanisms, but for sure they can be also improved. And I think, indeed, as we're doing here, and as the work will also continue, for example, with Laura, is that we need to focus more now on inflammation and More now on inflammation and including these six differences. And as I mentioned, so I think it's also very exciting that these kinds of models, I mean, not only ours, of course, but everybody's here in the audience, can really also have a lot of impact potentially via, let's say, regulatory tools. Now, just very briefly, because I talked about my board, which was a bit old work, we're also doing a lot of other work with the group. I think this links to my ORCID, but I think this links to my orchids, but anyway, come talk to me. We've also worked on kidney, a bit on cyclic AMP signaling, a lot of integrant and biomaterial interaction. That's really something that we're focusing on. And I've also done a bit of, let's say, machine learning because in the Institute RAM, we also do a lot of high-throughput screening of biomaterials. So just as a FYI, feel free to come and talk to me. And then I'm also going to make use of this opportunity to say that we're hiring. To say that we're hiring because this is kind of a nice crowd, of course. So, um, I see that the first two positions are closed, but I'm still going through the application. So, if you really are interested, you know, just drop me an email, it's fine. And then the other one, actually, the last one is a post-op position on modeling drep toxin interactions in the kidney. It's not open yet, but if you're interested, again, feel free to contact me because it's a bit flexible timing-wise. And so, with that, yeah, these are the collaborators. Yeah, these are, let's say, the collaborators mostly on the bone work. And with that, I would like to thank you for your attention, and I'm happy to take any questions.
