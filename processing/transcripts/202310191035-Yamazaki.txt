So, today what I'm going to talk about is the 4D Chance Legion theory, which is one of the topics which I have been working on for some time. And the 4D transmission theory cannot explain what it is, but it's a useful quantum field theory. It's some four-dimensional, as the name suggests, some quantum field theory. And the reason that it's good is that it's useful for understanding Who are understanding many different aspects of integrable models? So, for example, there are integrable lattice models, integrable lattice model, or in a somewhat more representation ways, there is a representation of gamma-youngs, coordinable fines, elliptic algebras, etc. So, this is one topic in the integral models. And somewhat relatedly, there are also integral models. They are also integrable quantum fuses in two dimensions, one plus one dimensions. And they can also be discussed from the viewpoint, the fourth dimension of Chun Samo theory. So certainly this is a very old topic, and there are a lot of results going back to decades ago. But the point is that you can start from the theory, and you need to know. The theory, and you need to know something a little bit about this, but for the most part, you can pretend that you don't know about the old literature and just analyze this, just depends on your perspective, but this is a very funeral circle. So, you can, in principle, just study the theory, following some standard description in Funal Fuse. And you can reproduce many of the things which you're found here. Sometimes these things are found by dry and yellow, et cetera, but many of the things look systematic here. systematic here. Now, what I want to talk about is, I'm not going to really go into too much detail about how this happens, but rather try to make contact with some other things discussed during this conference. And that's the Hitching module, I guess, and Hitching integral remote system. So that's another different type of integral structure. And then how this also relates the lambda's correspondence. Lambda's correspondence, geometric lambda correspondence. So, and what I'm going to talk about is based on dozens of papers, including mine, but many other people. And also, well, I'm not today going to tell you the final answer for everything. So, but rather try to present you a map of what type of things are there and how things are related. And the goal is to try to raise some questions, and hopefully, some of you become interested in. And hopefully, some of you become interested in some particular aspect or tell me if something is normal or not, etc., and then start the conversation. So, that's what I want to do. But I should also say that in passing, there is also connection of polychannel signals to yet another aspect of individual models. Like a self-deal young mills can be a dimensional deductions. But that's yet another thing which I want to mention. Okay, so before starting with the whole each hybrid, I thought that I should start with something which is more Let's see, which is something more familiar. And that is the three-dimensional Chung Simon theory. Now, in the three-dimensional Channel Simon theory, well, okay, so I'm going to consider, okay, so in the three-dimensional Channel Simon theory, we want to choose the gauge group. So this is the gauge group. And well, in terms of simple L-group, in practice, say. In practice, say SUN, for example. And if you take this group, that's the standard three-dimensional Channel Seimal theory. Now, what I want to do is to consider a version of that where this is replaced by complex form. For example, S A and C. So then I'm going to have the connection. So this is a G C connection. A equals to parographic A equals to A plus I phi. So they are part denimized by part. So other than the fact that it's complex, it's very similar to the usual Chang-Simon theory. So the action functional, Chan Mirriden, 3-manifold, and trace of A VHDA. And well, there are different notations for this. This, but let me this notation where this is the key trace is meant to be the key form, g variant variant four. And then there is a coefficient which I forgot to write here. Sorry about that. And this is usually called the level. Now, the level is typically integer of pi. But here in this complex word, you can make it the complex parameter, which I like psi. But this is not the context. So this is not the quantus. Well, partly because it's a complexified. So everything is complex. This level is also complex. And so the imaginary part could be continuous, for example. So this is the complex channels. Now, well, other than the fact that it's complex, things are pretty standard. Things are pretty standard. So you can try to discuss what type of structure is encoded here. And so this defines an action functional. So in principle, it defines the pass integrals and you can compute things. But let's see. Let's see. So we should probably start with the classical CV. And that's the, well, this is called the equation function. And so that's the differential equation associated with this. And that's, of course, just the equation that f equals to zero. The equation that f equals to zero, heat strings is zero. So this is a GC flood function. And so what we get is a product connection, so the modular basis, and a complex semosieric quantizing. Now, we can try to proceed in various different ways, but one way is that this m is a three. This m is a three-manifold, but you can try to take the Hamiltonian perspective, choose a time direction. And so let's say a Hamiltonian perspective, choose M to B time direction times some two manifold. And then there is a modular space of route connections. GC flout connections on the Connections on this C. And well, let's see, sorry, I'm going to use the sigma notation to just make it the same. At this point, it doesn't matter, obviously. So there is a modular space of route connections. And you can try to, well, okay, so here there is a syncretic form here. And then you can follow the procedure of geometric quantization to the line value, geometric quantize, et cetera. So that's one way to quantize the case. Way to quantize the city. And yeah, so this modular space itself is interesting. So GC connection, so S3 and C cradle connections. And the simplest case is N equal 2, it's S32C. And in the case of S32C, so there is a rad connection. You have to model it by the group action. But the it it's SL2C and and that's that's already indication that the there's a connection to, for example, hyperlock geometry. It is also S T C. It is also S T C, motion of S M T C. So the solution equation of motion sometimes is interpreted as a hybrid wave function. And let's see. So yeah, also, for example, SLN2C, this is the modular space to C connections, which includes SL modular space SL2R connections, which in turn includes the trihenial components. So this includes the trigger space. includes the tihemular space on this sigma. And then you can, what this means is that there is a tihemus. This uses the standard dihydral theory and there are nice coordinates and then quanta is and then there's a nice action of mapping class group. So that's a whole topic of quantum dihymega theory. Well so that's an interesting topic in itself and also well so far I just talked about a sleeve manifold itself. About the three manifold itself, but just as in the case of usual Chan-Simon theory, you should consider a not. So, this is a not k, and consider the note invariant. And the note invariant is obtained by considering the horror of the gauge field around this node, and then considering taking a trace, so you get some invariant. So, and then you get interesting environment three manifolds, but not in no complements, and that's a subject on its own. Yeah, except that I'm not going to go into too much into deep, and because what I want to do is to make a connection to the Landrans problem. So, how does the connection come about? Come about. Historically, that's very interesting because when Kakusi and Witten started thinking about the geometric language in their own way, they were not anticipating connection to this. But only later, several years later, Witten himself tried to analyze this. And in the end, somehow he was led to the same theory, which was necessary for understanding the Lambda's quota. So let's see. So what is the structure? So, what is the structure? Here, you have the 3D transgroup. People sometimes call it the complex channel theory or analytic by continuous transmission theory. So, with the gauge group DC. And on the three mindfuls, you can write as a three-mine. And if you write there are some knots, and then you include it. Now, here, this is a three-dimensional theory, but you can consider the three-dimensional theory as a boundary of some four-dimensional theory. Boundary of some four-dimensional theory. Now, there is some four-dimensional theory which is also a TTFT. And the statement is that this three-dimensional channel semi-series is the boundary of this 4D TTFT under appropriate boundary condition. Now, what is this TTFT? Well, it's a so-called GL twisted, geometric language twisted theory. Twist of Twist of twisted theory. So it means a topological twist of some theory known as the four-dimensional equal four supernatural. And what, let's see, so I'm going to explain this moment thoroughly. Not the four-dimensional equal supernovae, but just what this species here is. And that's the sum four-dimensional TTFD. Now, what is the data in here? Now, first of all, here is a complex Chan Simon series. I just deleted it, but the action has a level, which I denote to subside. So, it has a Chan Simon series with the level of psi. Now, there is a corresponding parameter here on the 4D Chan Simon side, and there is also, of course, And there is also corresponding one parameter psi. And there is some geometrical meaning of it. It's actually this parameter psi is a combination of two parameters. So one is the so-called actual electron coupling. So let's see. So it's a gauge, complexified gauge coupling. So there is a Young-Mills coupling. And so this is the gauge coupling of the theory. And this is the set of parameters. The theory, and this is the seller parameter of the theory, which is the style parameter of the 4D some super inverse theory. So, this is a nice parameter which transforms used nicely under the modular transformation. Now, in addition to that, there is one more parameter, which is a point GCP1. And this is needed for the specification of this twist. So, there is one parameter for me of the twist. And geometrically, the meaning of this is that this is the CP1 of the hyperhera structure. So, there is a CP1. Structure. So there is a CP1 worst or pipeline structure and then associate twist. And then what, so this study was studied by Capiston Mitten. And what Capus-Mitten found is that these parameters combine nicely into a single parameter, which is psi. And that parameter appears as a counterpart of this level of the complex chunks I would say. So at least that's how the parameters match. And also, let's see here, there was a complex connection. This was. Connection. This was, I denoted A plus I phi. So here also we should have the same field at least. And so this is a supermil service. So you just have a gate field A, and you don't seem to have the field phi. But it turns out that this is of there is a con similar field here. So this phi was originally it contains many of the scalar fields, but the scalar feature turned into a gauge field after the copper fields. After the work of the fuse. Okay, perhaps it doesn't matter, but what's important, there is still a complex distribute here on this side. Now, how to go from here to there? There are roughly speaking two ways to explain this connection. You either start from 3D and go to 4D, or start from 4D and go back to 3D. Now, which one is more understandable might depend on your preference, but I bet that starting from the 3D might be easier. Starting from the 3D might be easier for some of you. 3D to 4D. So let's see. This is discussed in the paper within analytic configuration of Chan Simon C. Let's see. So what what is the setup? Here, it's actually related to how to define this setup. So here everything is complexified. So here everything is complexified and you can discuss what is the definition of the theory. And if you believe in the pass integral, roughly speaking, there is this John-Simon's functional of A. So this should define some partition function, for example. And when this A tube A is the usual compact form, which values in the SEN, for example, people know how to compress. For example, people know how to complex it. But when things are complexified, there are ambiguities in how to define this because it's a complex integral. Which means that you have to choose an appropriate integration contour that maybe you'll define. So you have to choose an contour. Which is not unique. So there are multiple contours. And then there's a canonical way of choosing the contour. Of choosing the functor, if you regard as a final dimension integral, and that is to choose the left symbol. So, what it means is that you start with the solution of the classical equation function, which is the flat connection, complex flat connection, and then consider the downward most flow with respect to the downward most flow. So, start with the cloud connection. So, this contour you can choose to be a left to. You can choose to be an F symbol. Well, of course, this is the infinite dimensional setup. But nevertheless, you can be bold and try to adapt what people usually do in finite dimensions. And so you consider downward most row. 4, H is, I take to B, I times this is a John Simon's form. Okay, so here. Well, except that there is also, let's see, well, perhaps, okay, sorry, okay, so here, by this, probably this is different from the previous notation, but by this I mean Chansan's function itself times psi. So this was also psi, which is it is a complex parameter, which in general might call a phase. So I should include it here. But only the coefficient matters. So this is the phase of psi. Because you can always, okay, so because in the equation I'm going to just write down, you can always discal the parameter t. And then this hot star of t manifold. And then Chansama's functional of A. Some functional A, this way to A, and there is a bar. Then you're going to put exponential minus R of also for the phase. Okay, so what is made by this? So you start with the cloud connection, which is the equation of solution of the classical equation of motion, and then you consider the most row with distributed disk. So this is the descent equation. To this. So, this is the descent equation. And when you do that, so this A was originally a field in M3, three-dimensional connection. But now I want to introduce this formal parameter T and then introduce a dependence because I want to consider flow. So the A on N is now promoted to A T on R T times M. So that's how you get the equation of the four dimensions. Now, if you look at this, this is F bar. So what you get is that the derivative of A is given by F bar, what's D of F bar. Now you can think of this equation as arising from some gauge fixing the four-dimensional equation, which is very Which is really F equals to minus i epsilon, alpha, and then f bar. But now in four dimensions. So this is a nice new coordinate. So well, if you regard it as a connection in four dimensions, there is one more component. But you can think of it setting down, using the gauge transmission, set that to zero. And then this becomes one of the components of the The field strength evolving the time direction. So, this is turned into dot. So, what you get is something similar to, very similar to Self-Neil-Yamian's equation. But since they are complex, there is a parameter alpha, also a bar, etc. But it is some complex alarm. Ah, 40 self-developers. Or perhaps I should say anti-selfiel youngers, because here it's minus. So it's a nice equation, and things are naturally complexified. Now, so in this conclusion, by hindsight, is actually very natural because if you start with the usual Channel Samus theory, Chan Samus functional. Channel sample is functional. There was a connection to self-dealing mills. And one of the reasons is basically: if you have, for example, FHF, time topological set angle here, and then you integrate the parts on the whole manifold, and then this can be turned into the evaluation of the Chang Samos functional by integrated parts. And what we found is a complex analog that. Complex analog of that. So we have the complex chance of function here, and we have the complex FDA-Yammer's equation and they degrade it by integration of parts. So it turns out that I wrote one, but I'm actually not going to explain them too explicitly, but if you want to go back to four-dimensional three-dimensions, but completely found in a recent paper is that it goes through all this procedure. And you get a complicated action, but it does that. Most of the action doesn't matter. It's a topological theory. Seduction is very trivial. Except that you get something like this. Except that you get something like this with some coefficient of psi in front, except with the f replaced by complex f. Now, if you go integral parts, you get the channel summons function, the serie, which is the series here. So this is how the connection to this full-dimensional theory works. And a priori, it's not free of it has anything to do with the language. It has anything to do with the Lambda's. But there is a nice property of the polynomial force superannuation known as the SQL T. And this SQLity acts by commuting this parameter of psi C tau plus D for ABCD taking values in SL2. So there is a nice duality after. So there is a nice duality acting on this pie, and here it's translated due to the action of this label. So there is an associated kind of visibularity on this 3D channel summon side. And why is this useful? Well, let's see. Before coming to 4D Chan Simons, let me say one more thing. Why there was a connection with Pitty Modular. So let's consider the Hamiltonian quantization. So, this is a general 3-manifold, but let's consider the Hamiltonian quantization for serial, just as I said before. So, we have the 3D channel signals on Rt times sigma. Then, this arises both from DL 3C theory, a post-pacific theory on um uh on uh r t times sigma times sa half r um well you can also consider the if it has an interval with appropriate boundary condition so what i've seen so far is one of the endpoints but you can replace that for an interval if you like and discuss the the other boundary condition at the other point which i'm not very going to do so i might sometimes write interval instead of the same line um and and and then um And then, what you want to do is, first of all, if you take it to be time-independent, you get the Bogomorinium equation on sigma times r and then the Hitching equation on sigma. So that's how you get the Hitching module. Now you get the hitching moduli. And if you go to the other side, so let's define sigma theta there to be RT times R interval. Then there is some two-dimensional theory here. And that is two-dimensional sigma model with target space given by HG modules space. And this was the cortex squared. And this was the context where people started discussing the geometric rung bands. For example, there is a Builson line in T here, so that was observable of the Channel 7 theory. And you can keep track of what happens here. And there is a corresponding operator here. And also there is an SQL of that, which has known the Tefuf line. And the Tefuf line was mapped to the HEC modifications, the solutions that were more in the equation. And the fact that these two data, two Fuft lines and Newsom lines, are labeled by the same data is the counterpart of the geometric subject. So that's the Lambda's connection to geometric lambda's. And at least that's a setup of how people discuss the Lambda Squad small case. Okay, but my point is not to. Okay, but my point is not to, this is not, in fact, this is supposed to be an introduction, perhaps I'm a little bit too slow. But what I'm going to do is to add the Q deformation to everything, in a sense. And that sometimes goes by the name of Q long runs. And well, the caution remark is sometimes there's also quantum long runs, but that's the different quant. Quantum Long Runs is supposed to mean a different thing. Nongrands is supposed to be a different thing. So there are two different quantizations, so you have to be careful. But anyway, I could introduce some one parameter deformation in the sense of the story. And that's actually how the connection to integral models I mentioned comes in. Any questions at this point? Okay, if not, let me go on to discuss the four-dimensional Xiang Simon symbol. So maybe I can have a quick question. So maybe I can have a quick question. This is yet a single model. And then so you need to extin incorpor incorporate the extra ingredient, which are the brands. The extra ingredient, which are the brains taking values in the categories. And then you can keep track of how. So there is a statement of the SDRT comes in, sorry, landlords comes in from the SDRT, which is some option of sending this psi to minus one of psi. So that's the action. And then what we're going to do is that there are some extra objects, which are like a brains, objects in the calibrate here, sitting here, and then keep track of what happens under this action to each of the brains. out this action of t for each of the brains. And then that's marked A brain B brains. And then here you need an argument, extra argument to say that A brains are trying to be more than this section. Yes. But I don't credit you too much of an expert. Yes, but yes, that's how the original argument goes. Yes. Correct me if I said something wrong. Okay, so let's see. That's how the correspondence goes. And well now Now, what I'm going to do is to consider another robot. And so, I'm going to replace everything here by something else. So, I start with the 3D channel samples and replace by 4D channel signals. So, yeah, basically, you get the 4D channel samples, you get the 5D theory, and here it becomes a hitch equation replaced by the group by. Replaced by the group value counterpart, multiplicative heat chain. That's what we find. And it's surprisingly niche, actually, because along the way we generate infinite enhanced net oxidity. But let's see. So let's talk about the 4D channel signal city. So what is the 4D channel signal city? One way to describe this is that it's a holomorphic topological anode from Combined partly holomorphic, partly topological analog of three-dimensional Chun-Simon theory, which is topological theory. And so here it's a TQFD. All the three directions are treated equally. But here, I want to consider the theory on manifold of the form sigma times c, which sigma times c, where e gel is a 212. Now I'm going to put the complex structure here. Here it's a, as for the definition of the series itself, this is topological. Although in the end I'm not introduced a complex structure here as well. So two manifold times two manifold. Now the theory is defined also by one modator, which is this omega, which is a holomorphic one form. Omega, which is a holomorphic one form on this C. So, well, the simplest example C is equal to, okay, well, the actual example I'm going to discuss is C c star. So, this is C with 1.0. And then this one over one form is simply Dg over C, for example. This is the simplest example. But you can also consider more complicated one forms. Complicate platforms, be it zeros or poles, and that will make the story more interesting. Now, with this data, I can define the action functional to be integral of sigma times c d veh omega, and this is the pay wage dA. So it's the same familiar old function of John Simon's functional, but now with the functional, but now with the with the h with omega. So locally, in some local quantities, this is essentially dz, which means that this A is a connection taking values in the complex white cage group. And we consider four only for this as components, but since we are taking with a wedge with the dz, we use the z component for connection, and this is actually a z component connection. So this is nearly like a Chan-Simons connection. Chan-Simon's connection. So if you turn down the, if you include a compressed structure here and then write down the coordinates z and z bar, so this has a connection, component, this connection has a components ww bar and z bar, but no z component. And then there is a coefficient in uniform. I was writing h sine bar. Okay, in this context, I'm going to template h bar, diagonal right side, but with some coefficients. Right side, but with some coefficients, which is again not quantized. And what's clear from this definition is that it's the theory, at least in the definition of the theory, we didn't use any complex structure here because that's only omega appears here. So the theory is topological here and holomorphic here. So this is a holomorphic here. So this is a holomorphic here and topological easy. And uh uh so that's a partial holomorphic of the 3D Samsung series. And in fact, uh it's a this type of structure that only part of the direction holomorphic has to do with the partial mirror symmetry in the thing. So you might have a very strong Mirror symmetry and things. So you might have heard that there is, okay, there is something also called a 6D channel segment series. So this is a homomorphic channel signal series. And typically you take a three form, and then which is the holomorphic connection. Please, your A is full connection or of free connection? Well, let's see. So we establish the full connection, sorry, connection on the full nine. So for example, you do the gauge transformation, et cetera, you should use The gauge transformation, etc., you should use the gauge transformation of the four-dimensional system. But in a sense, you don't use one of the components in the definition of the cell. Do you have a kinetic term of this function? No, no kinetic term. Just the same. So this Poisson bracket is zero. Well, let's see. Poisson brackets in far please. Well, between A's. Between A's. Well, I Well, I would say that when you try to, for example, it's similar to channel signals, 3D channel signals, for example. So I saw that if you take two manifold times R, for example, there is a non-trivial Poisson bracket between different components. Because it's a modular, you get a, for example, in a 3D case, you get a modularized basic model. There was a non-trivial Poisson bracket, different components. And that's how we get that. Yeah, but the Poisson bracket usually comes from kinetic term. So uh well, let's see. You usually come from the kinetic term. Uh User comes in like an ethic term. Well, let's see. Yeah, well, let's see. I don't think you really need it, but for example, if you really, one way, if you really want to improve the kinetic time, if this thing, for example, comes on the twist of 4D equal 1, etc., and then that actually itself actually has a kinetic time. Yes, which might satisfy EPA. But the reason I'm not making tau is that that's in the language of it's a q-exact tau. It's a q exact term. So there's a kinetic term about this q exact term. Yes. So, yeah, that's right. Probably that's a better answer. Yes. And yes. Okay, any other questions? Yeah, so let's see. What I was saying here is that there is a 3D Chan Simons. This one is a topological theory. And then 6D Chan Samus, this is a holomorphic theory. Because it's a Because it's a okay, so I might call it Chang Samus functional of 01 component. And this is, and then this is the Body Chan Samos which I wrote before. And this is partially holomorphic, partially topological. And the relations between these are in some sense the T T duality. So you if you well, what I mean by T duality I need to formulate and write a paper about it. Formulate and write a paper about it, but let's see. But roughly speaking, you start with the theory here and do the dimension deduction in appropriate direction. So for example, in the Fourier channel signal, suppose that you get the signature times two manifolds. Suppose that the spectral curve is a single, and then there is a time direction times S1. And then you can do the so-called dimensional reduction along S1, which is to do the Fourier expanding with S1, and they take only the With this 2S1, and they take only the lowest mode. And then you're going to get the 3D channel signal. And this is the, and along the process, this is just getting rid of the QR modes. But along the way, you do some of the holomorphic information and reduces topological thing. And this is what you expect from the discussion biosymmetry. So this is like A model, this is like a B model. And in fact, this one is the is the intermediate between between A and B. Intermediate between A and D. Yes, there is a 5D version. Yes. Thank you. In fact, there is also a 5D version. And in fact, this is a three-form, right? So basically, you just replace that by two-form. Yeah, in a 4D channel sample, there is a one-form, which is one form. And so, and here. But if you want the 5D channel series, you get you want to get the complex four two months two complex two-dimensional manifold. It's a Z1, Z2, times R, for example. At times R, for example. And you're going to write down the, for example, dz1, dz2, which junk sign star. Or in general, you can replace this by more general. Yes. So there is also a nice intermediate here. So there is a nice connection of everything. And this is really a amino symmetry in the sense that the this is a D3. So like a D derived D3 times. So in the philosophy XYZ it's only a and and It's a near. And so this is the idea of partial neural symmetry, which might be interesting in more general. And sometimes it enriches the story because it was topological, which is fine, but this contains more information because it's a polymorphism. Now, what information does it contain? Well, you can try to guess it from this structure. So, who did Chance Admin theory? On sigma time c. But first of all, it contains essentially the three-dimensional transform. And where you have the quantum group structure you can get. So the representation of that should be incorporated here. If you consider this, point C is a cylinder. Now, what else did we know? So first of all, it contains a topological series topological. This is boromorphic. Holomorphic. And so, what this means is that it's a fusion of topological theory and two-dimensional holomorphic theory. And two-dimensional holomorphic theory is essentially, but in algebraic formulation, it's the vertex of the algebra. Now, this thing, if you like, there is a terminology E2 algebra, local constant operation of algebra. So, what you should get is that you should combine these ingredients together in a nice way while incorporating here. Here. Now, because a dot structure is governed by this young young, or in this case, quantum affine algebra, of k, which when, so this is a, there is a h bar parameter, which is the h bar parameter of the theory, which appeared here, is a quantum parameter in the sense of the voltage transmission theory. But if you set it to zero, what you get is you get, but with the actual With actual extra formal parameter z correspond to holomorphic coordinate here. So things become essentially, there is extra information coming from holomorphicity here, and that enhances the quantum group structure to here, infinite dimensions, which is then Q deformed, which is a non-trivial statement. But there's an argument saying that if you incorporate h square non-zero, then that turns into the segregation, which is a quantum of fun. So, this is how, and the quantum by algebra is the algebra underline trigonometric integral works. Yes. Well, let's say, so sorry, but maybe well, sorry, sorry, there should be yeah, sorry, that's the same thing. Yeah, uh but so in fact uh yeah, I think this notation is uh Yeah, I think this notation is. Yeah, yeah, sorry. Okay, so I'm not sure the notation. So, what I meant, okay, so. Because it just defined algebra of. Yeah, yeah, okay, so there's a UQ gate, and then there is just a add the form of private to everything. And then there's a H1 deformation to here. You just need to remove the Q, no? Okay, well well in a trigonometric case, yes, but uh and centrally extend. Yes, yes, well centrally extend, yes, okay, yes. Pro perhaps the notation is uh is a little bit nice, but uh I actually don't know what the canonical notation is. What do you find from the Jungian you get by further deformation? Well, if you want to, so this is a, yeah, so if you want to obtain the well, quantum one is a trigonometric version of the Jungian, right? So you can try to go back to the rational case, but so here in this case it's a cylinder. And you can go to the uh the front frame by sending the radius, yes. By cylinder radius, yes. That's how you get the. So you've got the, there is a choice of curves, some nice guys of curves, C, cylinder, and elliptic curve. And you can repeat the same procedure, and then you get the series of Yang Yang depth structure, Yang Yang, funnel, fine, and some elliptic algebra. Another question. So other C's you don't want to consider, like hygiene is. Well, the answer is actually a little bit complicated. Is actually a little bit complicated. So, for example, you just go to obtain Young Yell from integral lattice models, etc. There is a no-co-argument in the sense that, yeah, so for the discussion of integrability, the fact that the theory is topological around here is very crucial. You want to move the line around, et cetera. And for that, it's important that this one doesn't have any zero. This holomorphic math doesn't have any zero. It picks up three possibilities, and that matches nicely with what other people. And that much is nice if it's what other people say. For example, data-minded refill classification, we integrate models. So that much is a nice match. But sometimes, for example, if you are not interested in integral lattice model per se, but for example, you want to obtain integral quantum fusion, for example. And that itself, for that itself, you don't there need a topological invariance, because the theory you get is holomorphic anyway. So in that case, you can actually introduce the complex coordinates here. Actually, introduce the complex coordinates here, and it makes the discussion entirely complex structure-dependent. And in that case, you can have this one, it could have a zero, and the discussion generates the more general genus, higher genus. And in fact, you can obtain a zero of integrable from the field series whose spectral curve is a higher genus. And associated with some, yeah, some serious, yeah, okay, anyway, the geometry. Okay, anyway. The geometry of that surface. Well, let's see. Alpha and go down is, yeah, but I don't, let's see. Well, at least the cross-host theory people discuss in practice in affine goldan tend to be spheres. Well, so I'm not sure if, in the strict sense of affine gold down framework, I'm not sure if any kind of hierarchy of spheres. Having said that, in the end, my understanding is that. But in the end, my understanding is that coming from this type of argument is that Hafine water models in the end, the Hamiltonian perspective of the Portuguese. So, and from that perspective, anything you can say from the Lagrangian formulation, you can say it's the Hamiltonian formulation. So, in that sense, there is something like a fine-order model describing the hierarchy script. Yes? Okay, so I think I still have them in this result. So, let me try to uh then come to finally to the uh Come to further to the enriching the story. So I start with the four-dimensional Chiang Simon theory. Instead of the three-dimensional Chiang Simon theory, oh, in fact, this one's eliminated, so let me copy it. So here, and then, okay, so I'm about to consider again let's see, S1 times. Let's see, S1 times this here, it's a sigma. Yeah, so here I take the VC to be against silver. And then, so if you reduce it, what I said before is that if you reduce along this one, you get a 3D translucency on Rt times sigma. And then there was a discussion of the four-dimensional G-Pist theory on. On RT times sigma times C double. But now we have an extra circle. And it turns out that there is also a 5D version of this theory. Simply by wedging. So FHF, and then watch with the follow-up to conform feature using. That defines the GF theory. Well, I don't know if this is a standard terminology, but some five-dimensional theory. And this is topological holomorphic. And similarly, this one is also topological. And similarly, this one is also topological oromorphic. Oromorphic in some directions, topological in some directions. And then I have the same thing with the extract incorporated. So this is the structure. Now, the question is: what is the enrichment? Well, first of all, here, the enlitment was that here, for example, you have a quantum group, there is a quantum of fine contact. Group. There is a quantum affine counterpart of that. Sorry, I don't know the notation, but okay, I can write a quantum or pi, yes. Which contains a quantum group has a final animation part. So integral structure. Algebra underwrite here. Uq of t hat. Uq of t hat. Oh yeah, I say CC. That's probably thank you. Yes. Yes. So so in indeed it's a harmonization. So these since things become forum of it, so this harmonize everything. So these harmonized everything. Now, uh here, uh okay, now, um here, okay, so what I'm going to do? Um, well, um what do what we get uh is so you can again take this to be, sorry, not this direction, take this direction to be sigma t. And then deduce to two-dimensional theory on sigma times S1. On sigma times S1 or not on sigma, sorry, on R times R. Except that we target something like a Hitchin module space, but not the source with the sigma, but sigma terms as well. And this often goes by the name of the group marriage. Name of the group valued hitching moss ice space or multiple precursor hitching. And yeah, a lot of people discuss that. There is, for example, a nice paper by Ediop and Thesprem, which is fast up. And in fact, this one also arises from the Necro 4-dimensional n equals 2 theory, which demonstrates this 3D equal 4-theory, which was discussed in earlier part of the meeting. So there is some connection, but let's see. So there is some connection. But let's see. Okay, so this thing is there is a S1. The existence of X1S1 means that there is a, in the hitching modular space, there is a Higgs field taking values of the joint. And usually, it takes values in the realge of. But here, in this situation, you have to exponentiate that Higgs field such that the resulting things become group value. And that's that's the name the reason for the name group value teacher modules. Yeah, if you say it in a little bit of a physics way, there is a scalar field, and if you have a finite radius, it has scalar field, but it's pure density, so you have to exponentially. So anyway, so what you get is the multiplicated fitting thing. And that's how the textual structure is. The extra structure comes in. And then, what's important is that there is an extra parameter here. For example, when I said that there is S1, there is a parameter which is the size of this S1. And this one gives right to some deformation parameter. This one gives right to another, like H bar, if you like for quantum parameter. Found the parameter. Okay, I don't know what, I didn't have the time to check what is the standard notation segment, but let me go h bar. So there is some another deformation parameter. So remember that here on the original theory, you have h bar, which is the quantization parameter of the original of the theory. But now I have an extra parameter coming from this circle, which is another h-bar. And as far as I know, again, I don't care if you're an expert on geometric numbers. Expert on geometric language. But here, this parameter Q tilder, this is called a Q. This one is supposed to correspond to Q ramblings correspondence, and then this one is something that's called a quantum language. So you have a double deformation of the same thing. Now, there is, of course, a discussion of the quantum Q-rambons correspondence by Agnadic Freinte of Mokunkov. And I don't have time to. And uh and I don't have time to check whether the setup is exactly related by string duality and hence the the concept is the same or not. But I suspect it is. So well let's see. The one way to see that is that at least one way towards seeing that is that this is a six this one I said is the come from six dimensional theory actually. Six dimensional theory. Well so-called one from one theory on even instead of Even instead of R, sorry, instead of interval, I can have R T multiplex this one. Instead of R, so okay, interval, I might replace it by significant y, so by, okay, I just have an interval. I have like a cigar with an extra circle here. And there is an extra circle, and if you reduce it along the circle, you get the interval, partly speaking. What is leaking, which is what you have here. So you get the six-dimensional theory describing the same thing. And this theory is known to be SDO, so-called, to the theory which they started with, which is this little fusion. So the way we have these two parameters appear are different, different looking, but they should be related. Now, what Related. Now, what okay, so that's a kind of a big picture as to how to formulate everything. And in a sense, I haven't made any specific comments. Indeed, there was a question how to formulate Q randoms in this post-formance. And in order to do that, I have to incorporate brains, how to mark with each other, etc. But what this strongly suggests is that there should be a multiplicative group-valued version of everything. And that will involve in practice the theory on this two-dimensional. The theory on this two-dimensional analysis of this two-dimensional theory, just as in the case of the usual Landran's correspondence, except that here it's different, but it's still a two-dimensional theory. And that's also there. Now, okay, so the question is that there's an extra, there are two big questions I have here. And I'll probably try to finish. Is that? Oh, sorry, I didn't. Let's see. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I started a little bit late, actually, so I now remember it. So perhaps I can take questions or any questions? Yes. So what's the negative story is the could you could you say what is the analog standard? Uh let's see. Well, what is the analog Hits bundle? Uh yeah, well uh I can write down the So I can write down the well, yeah, I've seen some abstract definition, which I'm not sure if it's useful for me, but yeah, even the definition itself. Yeah, I mean, at least the heat chip, the counterpart of the heating equation I could write down. So in a sense, just like a capacitive heating equation, if you just reduce the surface, you get the heating equation. In the complex structure, SMJ, this is some convention. And you can do the similar analysis. This is a specific theory. So you can like kind of. This is a specific series, so you can write on the equation and then write on the same thing. And that's what I've attempted to call multiple hitchhikers. Yeah, there is a geometrical description, yes. Which I try to tell you offline, but I'm not too confident to tell you in front of many people. Yes. But that's Yes, that's that's there is already the definition, yes. Any other questions? Okay, so then let's yeah, so let me, the question is that, okay, so this is all the story. The question is that, okay, so clearly the doing the Q deformation and founder deformation of the lambda itself is interesting. But also from my perspective, is there anything we can learn from this side of the story? From this side of the story, I said at the beginning of this talk that this was a connection to a lot of integral construction in a different type of integral structure, like an integrable lattice model on a field series. There's a huge literature on that, including on how to quantize the theorem. And then the question is that, well, first question is that, okay, so this is not a good colour, I guess. The question is Classization of integrable lattice model integrable QFT from four-dimensional John Simons. So, okay, perhaps I should actually say that, for example, if you want to obtain integrable quantum field theory, what we should do is that they should shrink this currency. This curve C. Then you get some two-dimensional theory on sigma, and it tells us that there's a very general argument saying that this is integrable quantum view theory. And you can quite well realize the massive steering model, signal models with the target space drug varieties, and all sorts of stuff here in this case. Here in this case, and as I said, there is already a literature on how to quantize the serial. All sorts of things. Which means that it's useful to quantize this direction. But since everything is related here, it should be that quantization we are talking about here. It should be related to the question of how to quantize here. And some of the names that in some cases, the integrability here is only classical. Sometimes integrability is broken by quantum effects. Is broken by quantum effects, and there is some condition which needs to be satisfied for that to be subtracted, and what is the functor, etc. And so, the question is the quantization of hedging first of all lambda. Let's see. And then also, another question is that on this side, there was a your On this side, there was a job asking a really good question, actually, because here, for example, I have taken the curve C. But in the discussion of integral quantifier theory, you can actually consider much, much more general situation. So in integral quantum fuse theory, we can take general g mass r C, general with a higher genus curve, higher genus is around, and then another. And then another integrate polymorphic function with poles and zeros. Now, clearly, when it touches, for example, zeros, something special happening at that point. So there's a curve here, there's a special point. And that happens quite often geometrically. Now, and then there's a very beautiful story that if you start with this data, geometrical data, there is association. Geometrical data, there is associated integral one of Q Z, which includes many of the models associated with hygiene and spectrum purple. And the most conventional models people discuss in the literature, like massless titting, et cetera, are just very special cases where you have a spectral curve is a P1 and then only two points, two singular points, et cetera. But in general, it can be more or more situations. Now, the question is that, okay, so The question is that, okay, so there are many main varieties made to go point of user here. The question is: is there any counterpart here? Counterpart in the hitchhine or run runs type story. So that's the question. And yeah, so I think I can go to finish Maurice. But the question is that. But the question is that, so today I'm going to read out some basic story, kind of narrative, as to how to incorporate the discussion of OD Chan Sam series into something extra, which is the Hijimodi space and the logo is in rundowns. And what I've shown is that there should be, yeah, there is a very rich story involving this volume chips. Asylum series and alpha mass. This model is simple series and alpha mass setup. And some of the structures people discuss, for example, there is a paper by Major Town and Iam Ashmikumer, who discussed the connection to the conjecture by Gates, Gore and Ruby, which is supposed to be a Q2, some body format algebra type formulation counterpart of the Q Langrans correspondence. And on one side of the correspondence, they have the Yeah, so non-service requests only have the custom listed category. So the presentation category for the affine D algebras. And here, if you start with the folding chances, you already have an affine structure here. I said in reality, there is also a fine d algebras. And that seems to match what people expect from that point of view. So that's one small example. But I'm sure that there are many examples as to how to think about it. Examples as to how to think about it. And also, I'd be very interested to know whether you find any particular order or parts you might be interested in and want to explore further. Thank you. So, are there questions, comments? Well, your last remarks were interesting, but so could you? So were you on the one hand proposing that the Q land first bond is attributed to the uplift from the 3D to the 40 story? Yes. Comment is I don't think so. For the following reason, what Camp Boston did it is just related to playing the side parameter. So again, it's the original. On the one hand, the original was based on the representation theory of a Feint movie on a critical level, and then basically the story of Kate's Maria Jury was simply to form the personal representation theory of a Feika's movie in a way on the critical level. And in the dictionary that Lucy Witten proposed, this would just be to go from a special value of side front zero or infinity generic value of side front zero. Yeah, that's right. Yes, yeah, that's right. So you need now that you mention that. Yes. Yes, that's right. So there's indeed a psi parameter. But the psi parameter is actually h-bar. So in my notation, which is one of the plotting. So maybe in that case, I was probably mean... I should exchange quantum with Q. Yes. Yeah, okay. So probably, maybe I was missing quantum and Q. Sorry. I need to check carefully with the literature to see. Yeah, if each one is of each parameter, yes. But there are two parameters. But there are two parameters here, and I know it's h bar, but this is the level of psi, or psi of the compass diminishing, also, yes. And that's one of the parameters which appears there. And that's, so that's a Q deformation long run, so you might call it the Q language, yes. The thing that confused me is here. Yes, you seem to be saying you are getting an integral of quantum film theories, uh but um well it seems you're getting uh what is called a tiny film models in this context. Flow models in this context, which basically should be thought of as a chiral half of integral quantum field theories in a massless limit. So it does not mean the full integral quantum filters like Mass Ethereum or Zeigordon, but a certain limit thereof, which... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that's right. So if I that's related to, for example, that is a little bit uh, let's see, ambiguous about whether you have a hard rack or interval, for example. Whether you have a half line or interval, for example. Yeah, and I was switching it between because I don't want to say each time this is this similar. But for many of this, indeed, for this is completely correct. If you just have this, you get a chiral, for example, WW, but chiral everything. But in the end, you're going to have integral, and then that gives the other chiral half, anti-chiral half. So the spectral curve counterpart of that is that you have a function, special points, and then you put the different boundary conditions. For example, one of the components. Boundary conditions. For example, one of the components, W component, the gaffe becomes zero at that point, the W bar component becomes zero. And that's a chiral anti-chiral combination which generates the full theory. And some simple generalization of that statement is we can have, so this is a chiral defect, so let's say let's put plus and minus chiral and anti-chiral defect, but you can have multiple such defects. And then that generates, if you take just copy your plus and minus. If you take just copy of plus and minus, you get the double zw model, for example. So you get the multiple copy of double zw model, but it comes from the same thing. So it actually means that these series are not decoupled. We have a couple of copies of best minimum witting models, and the coefficients are chosen somewhat miraculously that they are integral. And that is one of the canonical examples which people introduced on Hafine Gordon, but also we can go from there. And that's the, and then of course, if you deduce it to here, it becomes a little bit degenerate. A little bit degenerate, so it becomes something like a layer of special points here. But nevertheless, it exists. And also, you can stay in here, you don't need to use it here. So that's a very natural object here. And there should be a counterpart of that in this story. So if anyone has any idea or if anybody has seen anything discussed in the literature, I'll be happy to discuss. Can you say quickly how you go from the 4D to the 2D here? Ah, yeah, yes, yes, that's right. So the 2D to 4D to 2D theory, well, okay, so what you're going to do is, okay, so basically solve for the theory classically along this direction C. So what it means that all the charters say that some version of the if you write on the equation of motion and if you write it here, it means that the connection is holomorphic around this curve. So what I'm going to do So, what you're going to do is that in practice you have a spectral curve C, then you put in various different special points and boundary functions, etc. And then you're going to solve for, look for the modularized space of front bundles on that C, which is compatible with the conditions. And then there is a modularized space of that, but let's solve for that. And then drop that into the four-dimensional channel size of action itself. And you get some action. And then that depends on the point of the moduli of the bundle. So given the point of the bundle of the moduli, it Given a point on the boundary of the motor eye, it generates something. And so the degrees of freedom of the two-dimensional series then comes from the degrees of freedom, coming from the boundary motor of this curve. C. That's how you work out the induction. Hello, machine source then.
