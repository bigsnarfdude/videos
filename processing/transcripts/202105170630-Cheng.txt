Start. Okay, our next speaker is Professor Zishin Zheng from the Academy of Sinica from Taipei. Okay, next welcome. He will talk about the positive mass theorem and CR Yamari equation on five-dimensional contact spin manifold. Okay, go ahead, Professor. Yeah, yeah, sorry, it takes so long. So long. So, thanks to organizers for the invitation, first. And then, in this talk, I would like to present a short introduction to the work about the positive mass theory and equation in CR geometry. In particular, a five-dimensional test. So, now how research team? How research team, besides myself, it includes Andrea Macchioti, SNS, PISA, the Itali Gao Su and Paul Yang, Prince Lin University, and Hong Ling Chu, Tsinghua University of Taiwan. Okay, let me make a short introduction to the terminology. So we can see the R-dimensional manifold M. Dimensional manifold M and we endow with the almost complex structure J on a counter bundle called the CR structure and we define a p-mesh for this CR manifold or is asymptotically flat blow up at some point by taking the integer over a big sphere of Of sub connection form, omega, say which sub counter form at infinity. So this is the CR analog of the ADMS in the general relativity. So here, the counterfunction theta, the blow-up counter-function theta is defined to be the green function to certain power. At this point P infinity times some finite M and the green function is respect to the of course CR La Prashi. So we will see next slide. And also another invariant called Yamabi constant, Y denoted by Y of J which is spectacular infinite bound of the index. Taking the infinite bone of the integral of the scalar curvature, talaka Website scalar curvature and all a volume to a certain critical power, critical power. So we have two quantities, P mass or P mass, or and Yamabi constant. Okay, then. And then, if this Yamabi constant is attained by a certain conformal factor U, then you satisfy the so-called CR Yamabi equation with minimal energy. And the MJ is called embeddable if there is a CI embedding phi, such that it's a phi preserving, phi lower star preserving the context structures. The context of choice. So, our aim is to solve the Yamabi equation after establishing the positive mass theory. Okay, let me give you a briefly summary about the three-dimensional case. So, in 2017, Machiauddy, Young, and myself proved a Proof apart from my theorem for dimension three. So it based on the show-young solution to the box B equation on weighty soblov spaces. So the assumption is that suppose the Yamabi constant is positive and the J is embeddable, which is equivalent to the original condition by the result of the Yuya Takyuchi. So Yuya is a regional Kengo. Institutional can go to our last speaker. Then the mass is now negative, and your mass is zero. Then our CR manifold, in fact, is CR equivalent to the standard three-sphere. So as a consequence, the Yamabi equation has a solution with minimal energy for the embeddable CR3 manifold, close three manifold. Three manifold. And also, we have a version of the generalized Riemann mapping theorem. That is, if omega is a strongly shield convex domain C2, close enough to be unit ball, and suppose the mass is zero, then omega is biological to the ball. So this result is interesting. This result is interesting in view of sophisticated time model invariants. And next, in 2019, Makio Di Yang and myself study some exotic CR3 sphere, which is called Rossi spheres. Called Rossi spheres. So for Rossi spheres, the mass is negative. And if we give the precise decay order in the parameter S. And we notice that the mass is never negative for the remaining case. In the same paper, we also show that the infinite moment of the sorbo quotient of what is this field coincide with the This sphere coincides with the Yamab constant of the standard sphere. But the constant, this Yamabi constant for the Rossi sphere is not a 10, which means, which implies that the CR Yamabi equation for Rossi sphere has no solution with minimal energy. On the other hand, On the other hand, I think the law has it. Kabaro proof that for any CR manifold, the solution is always exist. I mean, solution to the Yamabi CI Yamabi equation always exists. So we know the Gamalwa solution must be of not of the minimal type. Not of the minimal type. So it has the higher energy level. So this is for three dimensions. So let's turn to the five dimensional case. So just in these two years, Hang Ling Chu and myself show that if M is a close Contact spin manifold of dimension five. And suppose there is a spherical CR structure with five manifold with positive Yamabi constant, then we still have positive mass theorem. And the mass is lamentative, and if mass is zero, then it's CI equivalent to the standard five-sphere. Figure and in a separate paper, we prove that we also show that the connected sum is closed within a certain class of spin, spherical five manifold with partly Yamabi constant, including S5, a Mazi P is R integer, and S4. R integer and S4 close S1 of subradius A larger than one and the connect sum of the RP5 and RP5, two copy of RP5. These are all satisfy our assumption in the main theorem, the positive main theory. And all layer connect sum, any copy of connect sum of this five, this class of The least class of the five manifold is still spins very cool and with positive Yamabi constant. So as a consequence, over the above five, so on the slides, I show an example. So over the above five manifolds, the CI-Yamabi equation has a solution with minimal energy as a consequence. As a consequence of the positive mass theorem, so this is for the close contact spin manifold. And next way, for open case, in the same paper, if n is asymptotic flat, this is open, Lancant manifold, asymptotic flat, pseudo-condiment and spin manifold or dimension five. Or dimension five. And suppose it says spherical with lang negative tanaka-Webster curvature, then the mass is lang negative and the UMass zero, then this pseudo-commission manifold, asymptotic manifold should be isomorphic to the Hessian group as a pseudo-commission manifold. So we know the version two of partial mess theory or this open. Open mass theory, or this open case implies the partial mass theory of the close version number one. Because we can take n to be the blow-up at a point through the counter-form by choosing the counter four equal to the green function at this point times some finite counter four in time. Some finite kind of form time on M. And in this case, the Atarika wave curvature is identically zero when you blow up here. So we only have to prove this version two, I mean for the symptomic flat case. Okay, let me see. So the idea of proof is to use To use the spinner approach, so we can see the contact derived operator on some positive or negative spin space. This is just similar as in the remaining case, but we trigger the wetter field on just on the contact direction. Just our contact direction. And then we have the Wensembert type formula, which says the Elohim square equal to the connection Laplacian plus the Webster, Kanaka-Webster, a scalar curvature, plus some extra term involving the T derivative. So this T is the rib vector field associated to the counter form theta. So now So now the problem is how to deal with this key derivative 10. So here is the key algebra for the dimension five case. So in dimension five, we observe that this clip for algebra turn sigma e beta e2 plus beta. In dimension five, it's identical with zero. On the positive spinner, but not on the negative spinner. So it follows that this d square, d square is exactly just connection upon the plus the scalar curvature up. When we retrick, we trick on the positive spinners. So we know this d square is sub-elliptic. Sub-elliptic and this part of this spinal space. So we can solve this sub-elliptic equation for d square. So we get a such that so we can find the spin field passi in the find the positive spin such that d squared passi equal to zero and the psi goes. And the Psi goes to the constant spinner at infinity and plus a certain decay rate at infinity. And this is yeah, this is done by Chu just recently. So so so so then we apply this uh so-called Wenserburg formula. Wensable formula of this number for Venzable formula to the solution of this derived equation and then take an inner product with the pass and integrate in yeah so so we get then we get a formula we get this a Witten type formula for the mass the mass the mass is the pickup from the boundary term at infinity At infinity, and all the boundaries just go away due to the fast decay rate of this difference of passi, solution pi, and this constant spinner. Okay, now so now if this tana co-webs curvature is Lagriff, or so or when n is the blow-up of the point of Blow up of a point of a at a point of the closed manifold, then we know in this case the w is zero. In either case, the mass is lamentative. And the difficult part is mass zero. How do we deal with the mass zero? How do we categorize the case of mass zero? zero so so we know we know the website scalar curvature is zero and next step is we we have to prove the torsion of the torsion is also zero and the total curvature is zero to show the torsion equal to zero uh we apply an uh we apply an idea motivated by the shungyao argument in a proof for the In the approved for the demanding case. And let me see if you, because time is time limit. Maybe I skip the detail of this argument. Yeah. So let me construct the contract suitable when mass zero, we contract suitable asymptotic flat. Asymptotic flat, asymptotic flat meaningful with curvature, website curvature zero. And by previous magnetivity of the mass, this the mass of this family of structure is non-negative. On the other hand, this equal to the integral of some Webster curve. Webster curvature times the US, then you take derivative in s equal to zero, we will get zero equal to the sum integral of torsion square. So then we can prove the torsion is zero from the last equality, and then we have to show the total curvature is zero, but this is simply by This is simply by using the Bayantial identity and some other curvature formula, temperature formulas. Then we can show this in fact total curvature is also zero. So once we know the local geometry is already Hessenberg, then there's a topological argument using the developing map. Then we can construct a map from the From the H2, from the neighborhood of infinity in the Hessenberg group into this n, this n in our asymptotic flat manifold. And then extend it by a developing map to a total map, to a covering map. And since infinity, the label for containing Containing infinity, and if it's not one-to-one, then like at least two fundamental domains, but the one containing we has infinite volume, but another one has finite volume. So, this contradiction shows that this extension per side theoda must be one-to-one. So, we get isomorphism. Okay, sorry, give me just one more minute. Sorry, give me just one more minute. So, once we have the partial mass theory, then we can show this Damabi constant is a 10. This simply by a test function estimate. The idea originally due to Rishon. So, Rishon's idea also works in CR case. And the mass, you look at the formula, this mass play an important role. So, for a mass is positive, then the Yamabi constant, the Yamabi constant YMJ, which is inf of E of 5 beta divided by this norm of 5 beta. Some LP known, this 2 plus 2 or 2 over N is LP. and it's as uh lp norm which when you take in is this constant this yamabi constant so then we know this uh yamabi constant is less than the yamabi constant of of this uh sphere standard sphere and then which implies the some approximating solution is compact and converged It's compact and converged and converges by the zeros and d so this y is uh 10. So Yamabi counter means that we can solve Yamabi equation with minimum energy. Okay, thanks for your attention. Sorry for the take some Sorry for it. It takes some time. I'm on a screen sharing. No problem. Okay, we just have one minute. Any short questions?
