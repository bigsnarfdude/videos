Sorry, our first speaker today is Julius Emikina, who will talk to us about cut and paste the variance of manifolds via K-theory. Yes, thank you so much. Go ahead. First of all, thanks a lot to organizers for the conference and for this opportunity to speak. So we kind of have one big talk about different parts of the same project. Part of the same project today. So, my first part will be based on our paper with women in topology. So, with Rene Hugzema, Mona Merlin, Laura Muri and Carmen Rowy. So, mostly the talk will be based on that paper. And the plan for today will be first I will talk about C-surf congruence in classical setting. Then I will Then I will explain the analogous definition inspired by this classical setup for polyhedra for manifolds. Then I will talk about the so-called K-theory with squares, which is a framework due to the Harrich and Campel. So this is some kind of construction of K-theory that generalizes Waltham. That generalizes Walthausen's construction and is applicable to our situation and gives, as a result, a K-series spectrum, and it takes as an input, let's say, category of manifolds with certain notion of squares. I will explain that. And in the end, I will show how, well, not show, but I will explain how it gives this cut and paste invariants. This catent-based invariance of manifolds as its by node. So let's start with a very classical thing. So C-source coanguence for polyhedral. And this is a very old story. And this is a very old story, like 200 years old, maybe. Let's imagine that we start in R2 and we look at polygons. And we call two polygons scissor congruent. If we can take scissors, take one of the polygons, cut it using scissors, decompose it into smaller polygons, and And glue them back in a way that we only allow gluing along edges. So, no substantial overlaps. And the result will be called C-source congruent to the first polygon that we start with. So, let's write this down. So, I call two polygons E and Q. P and Q in our two C or congruent if and only if I can write B as a union of those pieces that intersect on measure zero parts and Q such that pieces. Such that pieces are pairwise congruent. So, example is let's start with a rectangle. This is my cut, and this is how I can rearrange those two pieces. So, these two polygons are sisochondron. So, one very obvious observation. One very obvious observation is that when we do this operation, we don't change area, and this is a theorem that it is enough to distinguish polygons in R2. So, area is the only CISO congruence invariant. And this is a theorem due to Boyai that is more than 200 years old. So, 2.0 So, two polygons, I see sir, congruent if and only if they have the same area. And then in 1900, in the famous Congress, Hilbert presented a list of problems. Present at least of problems that he considered important for the next 100 years. And it was problem number three. So let's ask the same question about polyhedra in R3. So is it the same question? So we just allow to cut polyhedron along codimension one planes. And the question is: Is volume enough to determine that two polyhedra in R3 are scissor congruent? So is volume enough to determine? Cisero congruent of two polyhedrons, and the answer to this question is no, and it was figured out by Dane, so student of Hilbert one year later. And his counterexample was: let's look at tetrahedron. Tetrahedron of volume one and of and to let's look at a cube and they are not Hisoconguent so how how did he distinguish them so there is one extra invariant which is called Dan invariant and it's very nice so I will just write it so you start with So, you start with a polyhedron and you write a sum of all the edges of this polyhedron P. So, these are edges. And you take lengths of the edge and take a tensor product with dihedral angle at this edge. So, what does it mean at the hedral angle if you have your edge? If you have your edge, you take a plane that intersects this edge orthogonally, and you see how it meets faces, and you get some angle. And this is your dihedral angle at HE. So, this sum now lives in tensor product of R that corresponds to lengths and R. And R mod by Z, and then their product is taken over there. So one can check, it's not very difficult that when you do a cut and paste operation on polyhedra, then you don't change this invariant. And this is then invariant of P and now this is Ethereum due to C. Ethereum due to Siddler that volume and then invariant are the only invariants of CISO congruence in R3. So volume and then invariant and determine CISO congruence. CISO congruence in R3. And now, an interesting part is coming further. You can ask the same question in dimensions higher. So in R3, R5, so on. And there is a way also to generalize this notion of then invariant into dimensions higher. So now it will be not just one invariant, but a bunch of invariants. Of invariants. And the question is: what about N higher R volume and this generalized den invariance All the C-serve congruence invariants. So, this means if you compute those, does it determine the C-served congruence class of your polytop? And this is an open problem. So, for n bigger than five, it is open. But one But one can go even further. So, not only ask about invariance of C-servang, but let's consider the so-called C-serve congruence groups. And C-servicence group for a given N means that you look at a group generated by polytopes in a random. So, by polytops, I mean just convex hull of finitely many points. So, you take a Belian group generated by polytops, its group under its joint union, and we say that we quotient out relation that if two polytopes are cis or congruent, then we quotient out p equals q. So, what So, what we just noticed that we have, we already know two invariants: volume, so R sits inside C-served congruence. And we have a then invariant. So, this map from R to C-SO congruence just takes your number and sends it to cube or the. And sends it to cube of the corresponding volume. And then invariant lens, well, let's say n equals 3. In this case, we will land in the standard product. And the guess would be, well, naive guess would be to say that the group is just a product of these two guys. But this is not the case. This is not the case. So, a den univariant, this D, it has a co-curnal. So, there is something here. And this co-current is not so easy in general, and even in this case, to determine. So, the story is not about this, but I want to tell that it was Goncharov who was studying these kinds of questions. And he noticed that when you try to write such When you try to write such sequences, such as this core kernel for higher dimensions, that what you see, you see some kind of K-theory appearing in that core kernel. Well, I will not write an explicit expression what's there, but let's write his observation that C-serang groups are related to K-series. And it appears in Co-Kernel of the Anuariant map. And then it was Inazeka who was interested in this, and her idea was, I think, very natural. So she thought, okay, if you see. If we see that it is somehow related to case theory, then maybe we can categorify this CSER congruence group and write them as case theory of something. And then this whole thing, it comes as a map of categories. So you write CISO congruence group as case theory of something, then you see algebraic case theory. And maybe if this works, you can write a If this works, you can write a map of categories, and this comes as pi-naught of the construction of K-Series. So, unfortunately, I don't think that they achieved this goal, they achieved something, but we somehow want to be to borrow this idea of viewing C-sur congruence groups as a case theory of something and develop it further. Bit further. So, if we want to apply it to cut and paste groups of manifolds. So, this is what we will be focusing on today. And let me tell you what these cut and paste groups for manifolds. So, now I'm writing SK because it's in German Schneider und Kleben. It means cut and paste. It means cut and paste. And they were introduced by Matthias Kreg, Karas, Ossa. So these were all students of Hilzebruch based in Bonn. So no wonder why it was in German. And so what is this CSO congruence notion for manifold? It's very analogous to the case of polytopes. What we do, we What we do, we let's say for me, manifolds will be smooth, close-oriented, and I will not repeat those adjectives. And all maps will be, almost all maps will be orientation-preserving. So, I start with some manifold. It doesn't have to be connected. I cut it along coordination one sub-manifold. So, I So I require that this cut decomposes my manifold into two connected components. Well, not two, maybe more, but when I cut, the manifold separates into two parts. And then they have the same boundary. And I say that we glue, but using some different diffeomorphism, maybe. And the result. Maybe, and the result is SK equivalent to what I started with. So, let's make some pictures and write a proper definition. That's first example. So, I start with manifold like this, and then so green is my So, green is my cut, and I glue this red part to this part, also with red, and the blue part to blue part. So, this is my chosen new blue ink, and the result will be. And the result will be like this. So, by my definition, these two guys are SK equivalent, so cut and paste equivalent. And definition, formal definition, I say that two n-dimensional manifolds. N-dimensional manifolds. So, when we talk about CISO quadruence of manifolds, we fix the dimension. So, n-dimensional manifolds m and n are sk equivalent if I can write m as gluing of two parts along phi and n as gluing. And n is gluing of the same two parts but along some side. So this is my definition. And in contrast to cut and paste groups of polytopes, these groups are actually very easy. Not very, but they are really known. And the result is. And the result is that the only invariants for SK are all the characteristic and the signature. And so, if you want to write what the groups are, they are trivial if n is odd. You have one characteristic in case if it's If it's 4k plus 2 in dimension, and if the dimension is divisible by 4, then you have other characteristics and the signature. Well, but nevertheless, so even though the goal is not to study the groups, but to see what kind of spectrum we can get out of that machinery that was used by. That was used by Inine Jonathan to study something else. So, to apply this kind of machinery, we have to modify the groups a little bit. We want to allow boundary. So, philosophy here is that when you have case theoretic construction, you get some, you split some kind of sequences for model. Sequences for modules, let's say. But if you work with some abstract categories, you also see some relations on y naught between objects. And so if you want to obtain some construction that splits some kind of diagrams, then you want objects to be of the same nature. And here we want to encode some relation for manifolds. For manifolds using cards. And cards, these are manifolds with boundary. So we want to have as objects manifolds with boundary. So we have definition prime. Oh, sorry. I maybe skipped one step. So I defined what SK equivalent manifolds, but I did not say you what are groups. Not say you what the groups are, but the groups are completely analogous to the case before. So, SKN, but let me spell it out, is defined as a growth energy group of monoids of n-dimensional manifolds. Operation of monoid on monoid is given by the joint union, and we quotient out SK relation. So, this is what SK and group is. And now I want to modify the definition a little bit. Well, I would allow a boundary. So, in this case, I want to say what does it mean for manifold? What does it mean for many volts with boundary to be SK equivalent? It is the same definition as for closed case. So you cut and then you glue back only along the cut that we made. So even though manifold itself had some boundary, we never touch this boundary by the cut. And when we glue, we also don't take that boundary into account. So we cut. Boundary into account. So we cut and we look back along the cut. So definition prime for boundary would be analogous with this warning that going back. Meck is only allowed along the cut and maybe one picture for that. So, let's say this is our manifold this boundary. Let's do Let's do this cut and again rearrange, just swap these two upper pieces. So I will go this guy to this and this guy to this, and then the result will be. Result will be like that. So, this is an example of SK delta equivalent manifold. So, let's see what how much we How much we change the group when we introduced the boundary. So, small lemma. I claim that we didn't change it much, that all SKN groups for closed manifolds They just sit injectively in this new one, and there is an obvious map that when you do the cuts and going back, you never change the boundary. So the map is you take a representative here in the group and you send it to its boundary. Boundary and this Cn minus one means it's a Grotengie group generated by n minus one dimensional manifold that bound with operation of disjoint union. So C n minus one is a coordinate group. According to group generated by of monoid given by n minus one dimensional manifolds z bound and so D short classes. DCL classes. The second month given by DCL classes. Okay. So we had this old cut and paste groups, SK groups, that we wanted to study that encode all the characteristics and the signature, and we changed them by this boundary component. Boundary components, but still we have those both invariants or the characteristic and signature. And the change was made such that we can feed the category of manifolds with boundary into the machinery of k squares by the Harrison Campbell. So let me explain. Let me explain you what this machinery is, and then we will see how do we apply this to the case of manifolds. So, we all know that there is such a thing as algebraic A-theory, and now we want. And now we want somehow generalization of this that would split squares. So what this means? It means first of all we should have some input which is a category with squares and a category with squares Is so is a category C we ask that this category has co-products so this co-product and we also ask for two subcategories of morphisms and I will denote it by And I will denote it by two different arrows. So this is an input of two subcategories of morphisms in C. And now third input is a notion of squares. So this is a set of Um, a set of diagrams that look like this. So, this should be commutative diagrams in C where horizontal arrows are coming from first. Are coming from first subcategory of morphisms, and vertical arrows are coming from the second subcategory of morphisms. So it's not all such squares, but some set of squares that satisfy this condition. And of course, we want some extra conditions, and I will not spell them out now, but I will tell you. But I will tell you what is the nature of this condition, and then we will be able to write those conditions yourself. So, given this input of a category, two subcategories of morphisms and notion of squares, we want to construct, so out of such C, we want to construct a bisimplic set. That will be denoted like this and the set of bisimplices K L bisimplices are given by All diagrams of size K times L so this this K rows and L columns where in the notes you can see all the colours. Note: You can see objects, and every individual square in such diagram is a square from the datum of squares. So, for instance, one one by simplex will be just given by such a square. So, this is one one simplex. So, zero, zero simple seeds, for instance. 00 simplices, for instance, are just objects. 01 simplices are like this, and so on. So this is the construction. You consider the set of all diagrams of the size KL and you declare this to be your bisimplicis. And if you really want this to be a bisimplicial set, then A bisemplicial set, then you have to have the notion of phase and degeneracy maps, and these are given by so let's say phase map is given by removing corresponding row or column. And then you want to be able to compose. And then just to have bisemplicial set, you should write all the conditions you want from squares. For instance, as I just said, you. Instance, as I just said, we want to compose. So we have to declare that whenever I have two squares that agree on one of the edges, then you should be able to compose. So composition of two squares should be a square and so on. So you write all of these conditions that are required for bisemplicational set, and you will have a set of conditions that you. Set of conditions that need to be satisfied by those squares. Okay, so this is a construction. And if I take loops of this bisimplicial set, bisimplicial set, I define this to be k square of the category C. So if you ever see construction of wealth houses, let's say. Construction of walthausens, let's say construction of a case theory, it is a little bit actually similar to this. And if you saw Thomason construction, then it's even more similar to this construction. So you consider certain bisimply shall say coming from filtration of objects in your category. And this is more or less what's happening here. So this is a definition. This is a definition of k squares associated to a category squares, and this is an infinite loop space. So, why actually it is called k-theory. So, remark if C is a waltham category. Then you can equip C with the notion of squares. I don't really have time to explain this, but it's very natural how one can impose squares on Waldhausen categories. And then with this notion of square, if one applies squares construction. Squares construction to C squares, then it will be an equivalent spectrum as if we just applied Waldhausen's construction to Waldhausen category C. So this construction indeed generalizes Waldhausen construction, and so we can safely call this K-Serum. And then theorem. Then Serum. So this one is due to Zaharevich and Campbell. Oh my god, my knowledge of alphabet is terrible. Did you then want to take the second loop space in the definition of k-square? Why don't no, no, no, no, no. So for Wauthausen, we do the same. So we, when we do Same, so we when we do s construction, we take loops, and in this case, we also take loops, right? So it's the same. I'm just asking because it looked like what you were doing was the double S-dot construction in this example. No, no, no, no. So, no, it's not double. So, I didn't tell you how to translate to squares from Walthausen, but if you think, if you do you know Thomason construction, so it's exactly. Thomason construction. So it's exactly Thomason construction. So the way I would define squares, it would be like squares looking Thomason construction. So well, maybe I just say this. So squares would be those squares. But wouldn't I mean, would there be any k, zero or zero, L simplices in your construction apart from a base point? Apart from a base point? Or is the bottom simplex of one, bottom non-trivial, simple? I mean, it seems to be one, one simplices? Well, let's discuss this after the. Okay, yeah, sure. But yeah, yeah, I will answer. I will answer. Yes, okay. So I'm pretty sure that there are no extra loops here, but yeah, we will discuss it afterwards. Discuss it afterwards. Good. So, theorem to Kemple and the Harry, which of course I messed up the alphabet, is that if you want to compute what's k-naught, it's very easy. And it is a group generated by objects. So, abelian group generated by object. Group generated by object and the relations are given by squares. So, whenever you have a square, it gives you a relation, and these are all the relations. And there is only one condition here. So, for this to be true, we want to have initial object in C. Object in C. Okay, and now it's time to just apply this kind of construction to the world of manifolds, this boundary. And it's last paragraph: ska and this boundary via k squared. Y are k squares. So the category C will be n-dimensional, smooth, compact manifolds oriented with boundary. So this is our category. Now I have to tell you what are these two subcategories and what are squares. So two subcategories, they will be the same, but it's Be the same, but it's still important to have those two subcategories because they are part of the data for squares. So they are embeddings that embeddings from, let's say, M to N, if these are your object, that send each boundary component. Each boundary component of M either, and then there are two cases, entirely to some boundary component of N or entirely to the interior of N. So let me show you a picture of what Let me show you a picture of what's good, what's bad. So, let's say this is M. This is, for instance, N, and green will be the image of M. So, such a thing would be good. So, I just include M into N as this color. So, this is nice. This is good. So, this is nice. This is good. And bad would be, let's say something. If I first touch boundaries and I jump, this is bad. So, I really want my boundary components behave nicely. So, I said, if I cut along those, I get two nice Get two nice manifolds as a result. So, this is my condition on morphisms. And now, what are squares? So, squares are diagrams of manifolds that are push-outs. That are push-out squares in category of spaces. So push-outs in spaces. And this is my condition. And I claim that if you apply squares construction to this, first of all, this is an honest category with squares. And then it gives a desired result. Desired result in terms of if I can compute k0 of this, I indeed get SK groups. And this is our theorem. Now I should be careful with letters. I hope it's good so many folds and delta plus this notion of square. Plus, this notion of squares is a category of squares. So I can apply k squares construction. And if I compute k0, I claim this is cut and place groups. And third result, before I finish, we have a nice map from Nice map from these k-squares of manifolds to just algebraic k-series of that. So as I told you, and I did not explain this properly, we can view any Walkhausen category as a category with squares. As a category with squares. So I view the category of chain complexes, homotopically bounded chain complexes over that as a category of squares. And this is my claim. So on one hand, I apply k-squared construction to chain complexes. On the other hand, it's just Wolfhausen construction, and this is algebraic K-theory. And the map will be And the map will be sending manifold with boundary to its singular chain complex. So this is a map of category with squares and on k0 on k0. So left hand side is SKN with boundary, right-hand side is just Z. Right hand side is just that. So there is an induced map. And on generators, any representative in SKM with boundary is given by a manifold with boundary. And as you could guess, this manifold would go to its order characteristic. So this map just sends a manifold to its singular chain complex. This singular chain complex is categorifying all the characteristics in terms of this case square construction. Yeah, unfortunately, I think I'm out of time, so I guess I stop here. Thank you. So now I already have a question by John. So the question was. So the question was: Did I mess up the number of loops? So I think I did not. How to turn Waldhausen's category into category with squares? So the claim is that my squares should look like this. So, those squares that have covibrations as vertical, sorry, horizontal maps and all maps as vertical maps, and they should be push out up to weak equivalents. So, push out up to weak equivalent. And this is not exactly S-dot construction, this is Thompson construction, and this is maybe one. And this is maybe why it was confusing. And if I show you these squares, would you agree that I don't have to take an extra loop? I'm sure you're right. I'm not in a position to completely check everything at this point. Okay, let me think about it. Okay, let me think about it. So, so, like, in S construction, maybe you were thinking of. I guess I could ask two questions here. So, sorry. Maybe that helps. So, you forgot the realization of the bisemplico. Maybe that maybe that. Oh, yeah, yeah, I didn't say realization. Does it help? Realization: Does it help? Well, of course, I missed out that part. Yes, that's fine. I don't know how you would take loops on it by simplicity. Oh, yes, take the realization, but I mean, the question is somehow whether how do you treat, for example, the one, zero simplex or zero, one simplex? Right. So, is that the base point or is it different? So, in S construction, you just have one zero simplex, right? And in the in the double. In the double S construction, so S dot S dot, the one, zero or zero, one simply C would just be the base point. And so only when you come to the one, one simply C would you have something different from the base point. And so in particular, the one after taking geometric realization, the one skeleton is still point, and only the, there's only two cells in higher. But I'm sure there's just a question of normalization here. So that's fine. Actually, could I ask, I mean, when you. Actually, could I ask? I mean, when you described the square structure on manifolds, did you mean to say that the two notions of arrows, the sort of the one with the curve and the one with the feather, were the same? The same. Or did you mean that there were sort of two cases where you meant the one in respect of the other? So with the curved, the arrow with the curve at the end, were they supposed to take the boundary of M into the boundary of N? No, no, no, no, no, they're just the same. No, no, no, no, no, they're just the same. They are the same. Yes, so in your example, they were the same. And okay, so your example also sort of suggested that. So you mean to take the same horizontal and vertical maps here. Yeah, these two cases are just what I am allowing to do. So they are not like corresponding to two arrows. I'm just saying that whenever you take one of the arrows, like it treats boundary nicely. Boundary nicely, but two subcategories are just identically the same. Whenever you have a morphism in hooked subcategory, it's also a morphism in vertical category. Yeah, it's just a symmetric construction, like it happened in this case. Great. Great. Thanks. Thanks for the question. And since we don't actually have a pause. We don't actually have a pause before Renee's talk. Maybe if there are any further questions, they can be asked after the next talk when we're in the discussion period. Okay, so let's thank Julia again.
