Today I'm going to talk about the following topic and you may be wondering why such a crowd we're here, people, and I have to, in the best possible way, blame Galena, who's not here, where we actually got together. Well, Galena, thank you. Because we met at the workshop she organized in Atlanta in 2019, and although this is not the original problem we were working on, that's where it all began. Where it all begins. Okay, so let me start first by posing a practical question, which will be a story of Alice and Bob. So as usual, they want to talk to each other, and Alice has a few points in space. And what she does, she lights up those points one at a time. And Bob sees that and performs something. For example, so unfortunately, the night is foggy or maybe snowy, rather. So when Alice sends or lights up point X, because of the noise around, Bob doesn't see necessary exactly that. He sees some random point from the neighbor. So Bob sees x plus L v and splits. Expose W and let's say W here is uniformly distributed on the whole algorithm R, you can get an old. So together with this guys, we are trying to learn more about information theory. Thank you, Debing, for mentioning that at the end. And apparently, in information theory, the notion that characterizes the quality of the communication channel Communication channel is the notion of the entropy introduced yesterday or two days ago by Perter. So let me remind you what it is. We talked about, we're going to talk about Rainy M2P and Rainy is here of order alpha, so a random variable S, order 2 into 3, and then And so 1 over 1 minus alpha. And we're integrated the density raised to the power alpha. It's density of the strength of 0. So yes, it's defined like this for alpha greater than 0 and alpha greater than 1. Alright, so then the question that we need to solve to help these two That we need to solve to help these two is the following. The other one have the following. So, what's happening here? They're communicating, but at some point, Alice decides to bring those points closer to. Fuelants closer together. And we want to understand how this affects the communication. We suspect that the answer should be the full. So the entropy should decrease when we have the contraction, which is the, you can think about it as one Lipton time. W is the noise, and we assume that, you know, since it should be something like this, it should be symmetric, some kind of symmetry, like the radial symmetries that I'll talk about today. Symmetries that I'll talk about today. Okay, so if you read the title or look carefully at this picture, that of course it reminds you of the Knerfs-Olsen conjecture that is still quite open in general. And in fact, I would like. And in fact, I would like to mention both of them. So if we have a finite set of points in Rt and we contract them here? Yeah. Alright, so we contracted those points and the new centers are Y's. Then we suspect that the intersection of the balls, let me fix the radius. Balls, let me fix the radius, the same radius for all of them right now. We suspect that the radius, sorry, the volume of the intersection, just copy. I suspect that the intersection should become bigger than intersection. And so this is what I'm going to denote by, let's say, one, formula one. And we also suspect that the union should behave the other way. So this is the ball, intersection, ball centered of at J, and they all have the same radius, so I'm not mentioning them. This will be form number two. And since I'm denoting things, let me denote this inequality over here. This storm. Okay, so yes, we are not claiming that we solve the conjecture yet, unfortunately, but we do see a clear relation between those two. And in particular, for the second one, we can see. The second one, we can see a little bit more that this is equivalent to complex set K, that would be equivalent to saying the following, that TK plus ball should be less or equal than K plus T. Right, just taking points and approximating how to set them. Points in approximating Hong Kong. Okay, so now what I'm going to do, I'm going to first convince you that this is not just meaningless generalization of the unknown question, because in fact there are some equivalences between our question and this. Okay, so equivalence number one, let's be able to do that. Number one, let's be mounted like this: is that if I do have a star, I know that the affirmative answer for the question was a star, or alpha close to zero, zero plus, then in fact I can conclude that formula two is true. Why is it true? Because Why is it true? Because, well, if you take the order alpha, then in fact, you're going to have a logarithm of the volume of the support. So let me write here. Since one can take the random variable s with the support to be k and w to be uniform. W to be uniform on the board. Then again, as I said, the H of alpha of the logarithm of the volume of the support, and it's equivalent to number two. Okay, that's one direction. Second direction is, in fact, number one, and this is the intersection, I suppose, in conjecture, for alpha For alpha two, three, four, etc. implies the stop. Why is that the case? Well, here to see that for x I'm going to take the discrete Eigen variable and I'm going to assume that the probability that x is equal to xi is equal to xi, going to be equal to p. And w, as before, will be uniform on the ball. Then the density of x plus w, in fact is the convolution of the densities. So x plus w is going to be equal, let me copy it, one What we copy it. One of this, the volume of the ball, and then we have the sum of pi and characteristic function of the ball that is shoot. Now the same thing for the after the contraction, right? Because then instead of xi, I just need to put yi. So then. So then, they're here. So please remember, one is intersection, two is the because then our star reads like this, right? It's the integral round me to cancel 1 over p on both sides because I'm going to have this i raising to the power alpha. But please note that alpha are greater than 2, so we have this as a negative coefficient, so it actually flips. So this should be equivalent to the same thing for, oops, i. So after the contraction turns away. Then what we do, we expand and we realize that the characteristic function of the intersection is a product of characteristic functions. So if we do have that one hold for this alpha, Have that one hold for this alphas, then start loses. Okay, and then the last observation regarding the equivalences is that star actually is known to be true already if alpha is 2, 3, all the way to d plus 3, where d is a dimension of our space. The dimension of our space and any contraction, which follows from the fact that number one is known to be true for most d plus three models. And this is that's definitely now. And this is designed out. Here, don't do so. All right. Okay, so that's all about the equivalences. In the next part, I would like to discuss briefly how we handle this question, in a particular case of random variables and A. Of random variables and any contraction. And time remains. I'll show you another byproduct we got regarding in principle, but I'm not sure about them. Okay, let's erase this. All right, so conveniently arranged the star. So for any regular isymmetric, quasi-concave quasi-concave means all upper level sets are convex. Random variables x and w. So they're both like this. So they're both like this in Rd and any contraction this char. So this result is one of several actually that we proved and we sometimes We've proved, and we sometimes have to sacrifice something about random variables and you know add extra conditions for contraction. So we have like four five theorems regarding this is one of them. But in general, yes, we don't have the answer to this question. Okay, so what's the idea of the proof here? The idea is that if we have regularly symmetric Stuff. We probably should think about balls. And if you apply a contraction to a bowl, then it's going to be inside of a bowl again, up to shift. Okay, so if it's up to shift, then we can actually say that Tx plus W with our contracted random variable plus noise is Noise is more concentrated than the one without contraction again after shift. Okay, so the again the real idea of the current Okay, so the again, the real idea, that's just heuristic, the real idea is based on the notion of majorization. So we say that a function f majorizes g if we take average of all the ball centers at the origin of the star. I'll explain this star in a second. If this holds. Now, what is a star? Thanks to Julian, we already know that this is the symmetrically decreasing rearrangement of our density. So, just a picture really quickly: if we have our density like this, then what we do for a fixed output we Output: We look at all the set that gives us that values, or greater equality values. We measure the volume of the set and then we create a ball of the same volume as these guys and correspond to the same volume here. And then we create so basically it's symmetrization. So we apply our symmetrization, we then use this, we apply Then use this, we apply the notion of majorization. Here, I think about this being as the density of x plus w, if I'm not mistaken. Density of Tx plus W. Okay, then also we know how to calculate this, because it turns out that That the average over whole of the symmetric decrease in rearrangement of F is the largest value among all the measurable sets of the same volume as the ball, where you don't have a star. And this is the reference I have is Bouchard, but I don't know if it's the right one. Okay, good. So now what does it have to do with entropy? Because I'm talking about densities, but where's entropy? Well, entropy is just integral of the power of density. integral of the power of density. So here another result is useful, the one that says that if f is majorized by g, then in fact you can hide a function inside as well. Let me just write it here. So, what do we want from this function? We want that f of zero is zero, and this function is continuous at the origin. So if you do have majorization, then you can conclude this. And the reference here, I don't think that's the right one, not the original one, but I'll write it anyway, just so we have it. So it's Martin and Wang. Okay, so now you can see that we can apply this result for some particular choice of function phi, and it becomes pretty obvious. So if we do have majorization, so we can apply this for a function which is just the power function. Which is just the power function. And you need to do the opposite when alpha is less or equals one, it's still greater than zero. So in fact, this is not the question about entropy, this is a question about maturization. Now, how can we show meteorization? Please remember we have the condition radially symmetrical both x and w and no restrictions on the contraction. So, to show patient, Between those densities before contraction and after. In fact, it's enough to show enough to show that, remember we have this interpretation in terms of integrals of volumes, sorry, integrals of the bowls. So we need to show that for So, we need to show that for any r greater than zero, there exists a measurable set. So let me denote it as E tilde with R, just to keep in mind that it comes from bull of radius R, with the same volume, but it's not the bowl necessary, such that the volume is the same as of the ball. The same as all the ball at this point. Okay, and what do we want? We want that we have some information about probability. That probability of the fact that they fall into this ball should be less or equal than probability Okay, but in fact, we know something about the function involved in this expression due to our condition. So according to Anderson, this is 1955. This is 1955. The function that corresponds to fixed point x, probability of x plus w falling into the ball under the assumption that we had in our random variable w is radially symmetric. And moreover, it is quite compute. So, it's enough now for us fix going. Fix buoyant x in R D and to show the falling, the probability of x, and it will look a little silly, but it will make sense in a moment, x minus 0 plus w falling into the bowl is less or equal than probability. probability of Tx contraction of X minus contraction of the origin. We don't have assumption that it's linear, so just a zero plus the noise falling into the ball like this. So let's show this. Well, this is clearly true. Why? Because This is clearly true, why? Because this guy, the norm of this, is less or equal to the norm of this. Because we do have radial symmetry, right? Over here. So the value of the function here is less or equal than the value of the function here. Under some guarantees that this is true. So then, well, it was a fixed point, we can condition, and instead of fixed point, we can have random variable x. Right? So, in fact, we obtain the following minus t zero plus the noise falling into zero R and now it becomes And now it becomes not obvious, but a little more clear what we should take for the set. It should relate to this and to this. So pick PR tilde to be the shift, possible shift of the group. That will do the job. Three more minutes. Amazing. Okay. So as I said, the paper we have contains several theorems in this flavor, but sometimes we have different conditions, random variables, and contraction. So when we were proving another one, we actually needed to talk about the program. To talk about some kind of symmetrization of convex bodies, and one of the notions that generalizes a lot of them is the shadow system. So, using the shadow system, we actually showed the result that was already known, that was done by Gregorius and Peter. But let me state it anyway. It's going to be a very short one. It's going to be a very short one. So if K is a convex body and our interaction is linear, then you know tier 0 is 0. Then you can actually obtain the expected behavior of the intrinsic volumes. Behavior of the intrinsic rules under the contraction. So it is clear for volume, but for example surface area and other factors not so clear. So the proof is actually not very hard. We just observed that under the contraction you can squeeze your TK inside of the one guy through the One guy from the shadow system set. And then, using convexity of shadow system, we showed that inequality actually holds. But I don't have time to talk about it, so that's all for now. Thank you very much.
