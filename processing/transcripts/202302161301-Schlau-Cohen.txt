A group of theorists, but I am an experimentalist. And so, what I'm going to talk to you about today is how we can use experimental tools and new materials to control excitons and then measure their excited state dynamics. So, excitons are the molecular scale currency of electronic energy. They direct and control electronic energy for applications like electronics, images, and images. Like electronics, imaging, light harvesting. But if we think about excitons and we zoom in on an excitonic system, as we can see in this MD snapshot, they are very challenging to optimize. And fundamentally, that's because there's a lot of degrees of freedom. There's many intermolecular interactions within the condensed phase. And all of these interactions fluctuate in time. So, what this gives us. So, what this gives us is not just a theoretical problem, but also a materials development.
