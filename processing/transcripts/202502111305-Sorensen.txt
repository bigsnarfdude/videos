 We're going to drop on our knees. I guess now it's fast, so okay, so welcome to the afternoon session, and now we have Eric Sullensen who will tell us about exact ground state and the two deep quantum photos models under an in plane. Okay, so first of all, thanks to the organizers. It's a great pleasure to do. It's a great pleasure to be here and enjoying this conference. So I'll be telling you about some stuff that we've been working on concerning locating ground states or sat ground states in a magnetic field. And we managed to do this for some relatively simple models. But hopefully it can tell us something about a more general model. So this is work that I've been doing together with So, this is work that I've been doing together with students of mine, Edison Richards, and there's a paper here that you can consult if you want to learn more about it. But I'm also going to tell you a bit about some prior work that led into this, which I've been doing together with AMT's group at the University of Toronto. So, basically, I'm going to tell you about two things. First of all, these exact ground states, how that works out. Ground states, how that works out. It's a very simple construction, and hopefully, I'll manage to explain it. And what we would like to know about in these 2D models is also excitations. Unfortunately, we can't say much about that yet, but I can tell you about excitations in the equivalent model in one dimension. So, that's sort of the plan. And so, what is a 2D? What is a 2D quantum compass model? Well, it's a model where we have interactions that depend on the bond directions. So that's work that started in the early 70s by Kugel and Komski, where they looked at orbital models and they came up with models where we have interactions. Can I get this to work? Can I get this to work? Where we have basically easing antiques, but the kind of easing antiquities that we have, they depend on the direction of the product bonds. And there's a nice review paper here by Lucinov and Vanderbregg that I can highly recommend. The model that we're going to be looking at is the square lattice model. It's about the simplest model that you can imagine in two dimensions. In two dimensions. So I have easy x interactions in the vertical direction, no, in the horizontal direction, and then set interactions in the vertical directions. So that's a very simple model, and in particular, we're going to be looking at this model in a magnetic field. So we should not forget about this magnetic field. So why should we care about this model? Uh oh, that might oh, okay. Yeah, I'm confused here. So there are a number of things that are known about this model. If I do not have a magnetic field, so in that case we have nice conserved quantities, and they actually lead to some consequences. One of them is that all eigenstates are going to be two-fold degenerate. And the ground state, the entire ground state manifold, probably has an extensive degeneracy. The other thing is that there are some known equivalencies of this model. I can map it on to a zoom-more model, the P plus IP superconductor, and I can also map it onto the torrent code. So the reason why you started to look at this model was that if we can say something about the field potential and phase diagram that is. The field potential and phase diagram of this model, maybe it will tell us something about this general class of models. So, why should we care about this model? Well, one reason for this is, of course, that the catalytic Honeycomb model that we've heard a lot about already, it falls within this class. So, in this case, we have a Honeycomb lattice and we have the same easing interactions, the XYZ. The X, Y, and set that are arranged around these honeycombs. And that model that in zero field again we have a gapless spin liquid that are sitting if all the couplings here are equivalent, then if we change, put in an isotropy, then we go into a gapped spin liquid. But the huge interest is in us understanding this model in a magnetic field. In a magnetic field. Okay, I can't do this. I have to go here. So there, by now, sort of a class of materials that are called ketanic materials because hopefully they realize this honeycomb model in some sense. I should warn you that they're residual interactions. And one thing that these residual interactions will do is that they actually induce magnetic order in ground state. Ground state. So if we look at the ground state phase diagram, then there is what's called a zigzag antiferromagnet that's sitting in low field. But what you typically do in this is that you try to kill off this order because you're not really interested in understanding this magnetic order. You want to look at these in-liquid physics. And so one thing you should note here is that these are experiments where they put the field. Where they put the field in the plane. So, in this case, it's along the A direction, which means this direction. And what's observed is that there is apparently a very intriguing phase that's sitting above the magnetically ordered phase. And in this phase over here, there should be a paramagnetic phase that's induced by the high field. So, the precise nature of this phase, that's not understood. And when we started to look, And when we started looking at these models, that was certainly something that was quite interested in understanding what could possibly happen when you switch on a magnetic field. And these are some exact diagnostic results, not on big systems. In this case, it's 24 sites. And the thing you should perhaps note here, which I guess I forgot to mention, well, it's indicated here. Well, it's indicated here. In this case, the field is not along the A directions. It's more or less perpendicular to the honeycomb lattice. It's not quite the 111 direction. It's tilted off slightly away from the 111 direction. Your phase diagram is schematic or a measured phase diagram? This is an experimental phase diagram by An Scoop from Preston. So, I think the transitions out of the ordered phase here, and they're pretty certain about those, they're experimentally measured. The transition here from this pupitive spin-liquid phase and into the paramagnetic phase, that's more, well, that's established really what's going on here. And whether that phase actually exists or not is So that's why we wanted to say something exact about it. So there's a lot of interest in understanding just the experimental results in these systems. So these exact ionization results, the field is more or less along the one one direction on the left quite. And then we have this intermediate phase that William already brought out in his talk In his talk Monday morning. And if we could gain an understanding of this phase, that models would be interesting. But the important thing that I always find very confusing about these models is, of course, the entire phase diagram will depend on the orientation of the magnetic field. I can get new phases simply by tilting the magnetic field. So I just wanna show you some more experimental results because Show you some more experimental results because I was in Toulouse and there's a high magnetic field up in Toulouse. And these guys took alpha ruthenium trichloride, which is one of the best materials for realizing this honeycomb lattice. And then they stuck it in a magnetic field. And these are three runs of their experiments. And what they're tracing out here is the magnetization in the direction of the magnetization. In the direction of the magnetic field. And then they do a derivative of it, and then you can see there are some indications here of transitions. And if you note, the magnetic field in Tesla is up to sort of 80 to 90 Tesla. I'm always impressed by that. All three. Yeah, as opposed to standard. So if you look at the simple So, if you look at the symbols over here, the ones with the big error bars, that results from these runs like this. And then the other points here, they're numerical calculations of models where you take the honorable lattice and then you add a few additional points. There's pretty good agreement that holy there is an interesting face sitting there, and what we What we eventually could say about that would be interesting. So, that's basically the answer to my question. We want to have something to say about what phases could occur once we have one-dimensional interactions, and then hopefully also to say a little bit about the excitations. So, let me explain to you how I arrive at these exact bound states. So, it's a very simple. So it's a very simple construction. All you have to do is you include the magnetic field term and then you fix the magnetic field strength so that it's precisely matching the J coupling that you have here. And then you put the field, in this case, in the X set plane. And if you do that, then you can simply absorb the field term into the coupling term. Coupling term. And that's a construction that's often done if you're working with field-dependent models. It's sort of completing the square, if you like. But in this case, it actually works out exactly for that precise value of the field. And it also works for, I don't need to have spin one-half. This works for any spin value. And so you could say, well, this doesn't look very interesting. I just absorbed the field term. But it turns out that this. Field term, but it turns out that this Hamiltonian that we have here is actually positive, semi-definite. And that means that all I have to do is I have to find an eigenstate. And if that eigenstate has zero eigenvalue, then I have that mark state. And if you look at it, then you can see, well, if on this side I put the field in the x direction, and then on the other side over here, I put it. Side over here, I put it in the set direction, then both these terms cancel out. And so all I have to do is to decorate the lattice, which is what is essentially just a product state. But it's not just in the set direction. I have to put on every other side, I have to put the spin in the X direction. So then we have exact ground states. There's a little few wrinkles to this. Little few wrinkles to this. It only works if I have periodic boundary conditions, then it's exact. And I also need to have an even number of sites in both directions. And then the other thing here is if you start generalizing this, you could say, well, if I had a model that would have also a wide coupling, then why couldn't I do it for the cutaneum model? And for a long time, I thought I could get it to work for the cutaneum model. Container model. In that case, you need a field in the 111 direction, which is precisely what we looked at. But it doesn't work out in that case because I can't find a derivation of the lattice with these product states that works out. So there's some topological constraints from the lattice geometry that you have to satisfy. And for instance, you can't also do the 3D version of this model that I'm looking. 3D version of this model that I'm looking at because the coordination number was too high. But in the case that we're looking at, then it can be done, and then we have a nice simple model. It sort of looks like an anti-ferromagnet, except for the spins are not sort of up and down. They're in the X and Z direction. So there's just one single point here where this is exact. And so, hopefully, we can say something about the phase that surrounds this point. So we have to watch out. We could imagine that that special point was somehow a phase transition or whatnot. And at this point, I want to apologize because we should be talking about entanglement. And this state here clearly has zero entanglement. Integral. But there will be integral mate when we go away from this special point. But so we did some, you know, we always go back and sometimes do exact diagonalizations because we want to check that whatever we work out actually. Is it check positive or negative? In this case, it's antifermagnetic. Yes. And once we stay it in a magnetic field, then that becomes a pole. So anything I'll be saying has antibiotic couplings. So we did a little sweep here. Remember I said we had to have even number of sites in both the X and the Z direction. That means that I can't really do very big systems. I can do 4x4, 4x6, but if I want to do 6, but if I want to do 6 by 6, then it becomes really tedious. I can't sort of sweep up. So, one thing we like to look at when we do calculations like this is the second derivative of the ground state energy. In this case, that's just the magnetic susceptibility. And you can see for the big assistant, that would be the red curve here. And I get some nice sharp peaks. And the exact point that's this line. That's this line. And there are also some blips here, and that's from sort of first-order transitions that are highly finite size-dependent. So we don't worry too much about those. The scaling of this quantity is known. So if I have a phase transition, a quad phase transition where 2 does not exceed 1, then this one should actually diverge. And hopefully, you can see. And hopefully, you can see here as I increase the lattice size, maybe peaks get sharper. I'll show you some more results that clearly indicate where the dotted lines, these two dotted lines, are. And they're sort of our final estimates of where the transition appears. So, since I showed you the experimental results, if I do a trace of the magnetization as I increase the magnetic field, As I increase the magnetic field, then it shows these spots where the transitions occur. So, in the experiments, they did a derivative essentially of this curves, which should give you this magnetic susceptibility. But it's increasing sort of almost linearly within this phase. But you can clearly see that transitions occur. So, this product phase. Product phase that we look at, a simple way of characterizing it is by looking at the vector chirality. So I do a cross product. If you look at that state, you'll realize that that's going to alternate as I go through this system. So what we end up is taking the absolute value of this, and we can use that as an order parameter, and that's the points that you see here. So I clearly have a well-defined. So, I clearly have a well-defined space sitting there. It looks like the exactly solvable point is within that space. And so, the other thing that you can do if you do any exact valuization is I can look at the gap. And this is where William was telling me that he could kill a gap that was around 0.2. In this case, we have a gap here. We have a gap here. First of all, there's something that's very notable, and that's the fact that the ground state is not only exactly two-fold degenerate at the exactly solvable point, it happens to be the case within the entire phase here, even for finance. Rather unusual. And then we're plotting some of the excited states, and you can see there's a well-formed gap in this. Well-formed gap in this phase. The low-temperature phase here might be enigmatic, and I think it's well understood that that phase should in reality be that as so. What we did was that we went a bit further, and one of the techniques that you can use today is IPAPS. So it's tensor networks that you can run out to the thermodynamic limit. The other thing is that you can do ID and I. The other thing is that you can do IDMIG on barge cylinders. And what they do here is again, we're looking at the magnetic susceptibility, they sharpen up the transitions. And you can see a very sharp transition up at the when we cross over into the polarized phase at high p. And that all sort of just corroborates what we had from the exact itemizations. And this is a sort of a more fleshed-out version. Sort of a more fleshed-out version of this vector chirality. That's again the gap between the last panel here, that's the bond correlators, which we use to argue that there's some kind of matic order in the low temperature phase. So if you look at the phase diagram, then it's somewhat surprising because we mapped it out as we sweep the field. So this is in the plane. In the plane, so this is the X set plane of the field. So you can see here it's H in the X direction and in the Z direction. And then we can map out this entire phase. And the exactly solvable point is just this single point here. And the claim is that it gives rise to this rather extended phase that is likely. That is likely gapped with the degenerate ground state. There are also some little pockets of other phases that are sitting here, which had similar product state ordering. And I'm not going to tell you much about them, but the other point to note is that this phase transition where we cross over into the polarized phase, that's all second order, where there's everything. Whether everything else is first-order phase transitions. And if you look very closely, then you can see there are some color points here that you may not be excited about, but not satisfying to me because they show results from infinite cylinders done with IDMIG, where there's the blue points are from these two-dimensional IPEP calculations and they're converging to each other. converging to each other and uh not to mention one thing here maybe it's on the barn dimension of the iPod what what's what was the barn dimension you used for the iPod it's not it's not huge so I think it's up to four in this case there's a well-formed gap so you don't need to crank it out to some Get out to some gigantic yeah, but the yeah, so down in the low temperature phase, that's not going to be good, and that's why we can't say too much about the low temperature phase. The way you actually, yeah, anyway, I can tell you how we map out these first-order freeze transducers in low field. It's a bit tricky. Bit tricky. Okay, so what we would like to know is: well, first of all, where is there the gap to? What can we say about excitations in this phase? Is it a very small gap? From the exact analyzations, it looked like it was a rather sizable gap. So we want to look at that. But I can't say too much definite about this two-dimensional model. So I want to go. Dimensional model. So I want to go back and look at a one-dimensional version of that. And so that's the second part of the talk. I want to tell you about the one-dimensional version of this physics, which we actually did first, but I want to tell you about it last year. So if we look at what this would look like in one dimension, then it looks almost It looks almost too trivial to assume that it would be anything interesting that should occur, but hopefully, I can convince you that that's going to be the case. So we want to go back and look at the Kitev honeycomb model, but then I want to cut out a strip like this one where I just go XY, XY, XY, and then I want to call that the I want to call that there are several citated chain models. So, this one we have to call the cetaid spin chain model, which is a very simple spin chain where we have an alternating E sync X and Y transitions. You can probably immediately see that that's exactly solvable. So, there's a lot known about this model. And there are some results, I believe, from 2006 where they included a field in the set direction. Set direction. And in that case, you can also solve it exactly, and nothing interesting happens. You just immediately polarize the system, and there's no phase transition. And so at some point, we were just discussing what would happen if we didn't put the field perpendicular to the train, but in the X or the Y direction. In that case, it's much harder to work out. And lo and behold, you end up with basically the same. End up with basically the same phase diagram. So if I put the field just in the y direction or in the x direction, then nothing happens. I just cross over to the polarized phase and run off to infinity. But right around the 45-degree angle, then we have the same phase that's sitting there. You can see I've indicated the You can see I've indicated the exactly solvable point. It's exactly the same construction. So I have these two ground states where I go x, y, x, y, x, y, or y, x, y, x, y, x. And again, I have some vector chiral order. So you can see if I plot just the phenomenon entanglement, that's the blue curve, then it's hitting zero precisely at this. Zero precisely at this exactly solvable point. And it's peaking sort of sizable in the neighboring phase. We believe that this phase here, which I call the Kongog phase, is sitting at the end of a critical line. There are some symmetries, symmetry argument that shows that that's possible because there's non-symmolic symmetry that's involved here. Symmetry that's involved here. If I'm sweeping in the field angle, then this is a plot again of this magnetic susceptibility, but with respect to the angle. And again, you see some very sharp peaks here indicating that I have well-defined phase transmissions into that phase. So again, we looked at this and then we said, well, let's just have a quick look with the exact analogization. Quick look with exact valuizations. And the first thing we did was with the open boundary conditions, in this case, up to I think 36 sites. And it looks like there's a small gap. It's not huge, and then there's going to continuum sitting. And at this point, we could have closed the book and not done anything more, but at some point, I decided just to look at what would happen with both the boundary conditions. In that case, you see something that's completely. That case you see something that's completely different. We have not a sort of a two-fold degenerate ground state. We have some states that are dripping down from some continuum up here. And there are more and more of these states coming down, which means that the spectrum apparently is completely different once I cross over to looking at open boundary conditions. And there was sort of intriguing. And that was sort of intriguing. And the reasons for that is actually due to these bond-bad directional interactions. So what we're thinking of is these two states that form the two two-fold-denient mouse states. So either you go x, y, x, y, or y, x, y, x. What you can do is that you can introduce a domain model between them. And in this case, we call In this case, we call that a soliton. And if I just plot the magnetization as you go along an open system, in this case with I think 384 sites, and then I'm plotting just on every second sites, and there you see the Y component with the spin and the X component with the spin. And you can see right in the middle, then they switch over. So if you do a three-dimensional plot, then it actually Three-dimensional plot, and it actually looks like this. So you have some kind of domain wall or what I call a soliton that is sitting in the ground state. It's the actual ground state. It's not something that you excite out of it. And then we cause degeneracy, strong degeneracy in that ground state? No, that ground state is. Well, in the thermodynamic limit, it's a bit of a question, but in this case, it's a unique ground state. It's a unique boundary. This is open boundary conviction. It's open boundary conditions. So then the kink is fixed in the middle. Yes. And so the hand-waving way to think about it is that if I'm not exactly at the solvable point, then it corresponds to sort of a particle that's sitting in some kind of so I have essentially sort of states that the Yeah, yeah, the so what we can what we can do, so you can see the sort of transition between or the actual position of this solitonical domain wall is here, and you can see it's growing in size so as we crank up the field. In the low temperature, or when I transition out of this soliton phase, then I would claim that I have more than one soliton. That I have more than one soliton sitting. And so we're not condensing solitons, this is we're increasing the field and we're actually evaluating them on that. Amuses me. And so the soliton phase is described by the range of fields where there's exactly one soliton in the Lagrange state. And then that's a picture of the high field phase. High field phase. So, what we did was we sort of built on some old work of Shastri and Solid Land for the J1, J2 chain. And then we built out a variational picture of this where we have our two ground states, and then somewhere in between, then I'm going to pick a site. It actually doesn't really matter much what you do on that site, but at some point you transition between the two brown space. Between the two brown slips. In this case, we considered aligning the spin on that side with the magnetic field. If you're exactly at the solvable point, then there's no energy cost associated with it. In fact, you would lower the energy when you do that, if you had these open boundary conditions. And so that's what I'm trying to do here. And I can put this domain model anywhere in the open chain. Chain. And you have to note here that the blue bonds correspond to an X-H coupling, and the red bonds here that's a Y-Y coupling. So I have to choose an ordering. So of course, if I do that, then you could say, well, if I put in one something, why don't I put in two, three, four, five, or maybe more of those? So if the the next one that you will have to put in, it's gonna transition the other way. Going to transition the other way. So from the yx state to the xy state, or in this case from the xy to the yx stone. You would think that that would be entirely symmetric, but due to these bond directional interactions, that's almost forbidden. So there's a very high energy cost going if you go in that direction, and that's because the blue and red bonds here. Blue and red bonds here, they end up in the wrong position when you do this. So you can't lower the energy by doing this here. You can increase the energy tremendously by doing that. So there's an asymmetry, which is again very unusual in other spin chains that we look at. Then there's no difference between a domain wall and an anti-domain wall. So what we can do is variational calculations. Can do is variational calculations. And as I mentioned, they're modeled on some very interesting work by Shafri and Sutherland in the early 80s. So I just write down a variational wave functions where I allow myself to put this kink anywhere in the open chain. And then I have to calculate all the overlaps because I end up with a generalized eigenvalue. And that's a lot of tedious work if you want to do this for a big system. If you want to do this for a big system, but today we can do that if we represent everything with matrix product states. And we can do this very quickly and precisely, and then I can actually solve it. And so this is what you see, the variational calculations, that are the open points. And then the solid, no, the open points, that's the MRG. The open points, that's the DMRG calculations, and the open solid points, that's these variational calculations. So, very good agreement for the ground state. We can more or less exactly reproduce it by variational calculations. On the other hand, this heavy soliton, I can't get that with DYGE because it's a high-energy state. And precisely what that means in this case is a little bit more of a More or less clear than it is with the shows that these variational calculations, we can push them relatively far. And so one thing you can do is I can look at the mass of the soliton, or what I call the mass of the soliton, as just how much the energy is lowered by the presence of such a soliton. So I look at the energy per site as I go along the chain. Sight as I go along the chain, and if I'm far away from the soliton, then it just has a constant value. But right where it transitions, then you can see that the kink lowers the energy locally. And then we can map out the energy cost for doing this. In this case, it lowers the energy, so it's negative. So the price of a single soliton at this delta V here, it's less than. Is delta V here, it's less than zero. Then going in the other direction, that's now going to cost something. And it turns out that magically the two don't cancel out. The forbidden soliton or the anti-soliton here is heavier, it's more costly than the single soliton. I believe that this is the reason why you actually get a spin gap in this phase and why that phase exists at all. If they just cancel out, then All. If they just cancel out, then this whole picture wouldn't have been of much value. So what we can do here is that we can also look at this soliton, and then if I look at the excited states, then I get a whole sequence of them. So this is again comparing the So this is again comparing my variational calculations with the DMRD calculations of the first excitement. So it's been, as I was saying, as a particle in the barrel that you're sitting there. And I can not only have it in the ground state, I can have it in excited states. And as you increase the energy, then you get more and more of these excited states that are sitting here. Sitting here. Um and uh the uh and of course we uh once you've done one soliton you do two solitons. So I can imagine writing down a variational calcul our states where I put a soliton here and an anti-soliton over here and then I just put them in any place on the open chain and it actually Open chain. And in that case, again, I can repeat the same additional calculations. It just becomes way more tedious. And then I'm back to the exact ionization results. So these red points here, that indicates these two soliton calculations that we do. And there's not sort of a, I would say there's a fair I would say there's a fair agreement with the exact diagonalization results. The energy gap that we get is a little bit larger than what we see in exact diagonalizations, but still this seems very reasonable to me. If we look then at open boundary conditions, then the green lines here, first of all, just to remind you, the blue points, that's the exact organizations. The exact organizations and the green lines that would be all these single soliton states. The ground state is this one, then the first excited state, and so forth. They're coming off and sort of dripping down of the continuum that we're sitting up here. There are also some red points, and I didn't stress this too much, but everything here is not authorized. So we don't have any. So, we don't have any good quantum numbers. And you can actually do these one-soliton calculations where you include two soliton states. And if I do that, then I get the red points, which are almost on top of the exact idealization results. If I increase the system to larger and larger system sizes, then you can see that that starts to agree with the results where I had not. With the results where I had not included the two soliton states. Sometimes, in a hand-waving way, what we call this one soliton is somehow emerging out of a or sort of dressed with two solitons for small system sizes due to the fact that everything appears non-orthographical. And I think this might be about it. On time here, so just to summarize, I showed you that for these models, then we can find some exact ground states. It looks like that leads to a gapped phase. If I look at the equivalent one-dimensional models, then we end up with these single soliton states. And if you want to read some of the papers, then they're here. Way to take an odd number of sites with open boundary conditions? I mean, that's also the other interesting thing that once I have Once I have open boundary, I think I forgot to mention that, but that's in this plot here. If you look at that carefully, once I have open boundary conditions, it doesn't matter whether I have an odd or an even number of slice. It's completely independent of that. Again, something that is not often seen. You can more or less, from these small sizes, you can see the lowering of the energy by the presence of the solid on the periodic boundary conditions, then I need an even number. So I guess here we're doing 28, 30, and so the guitar of chains. So the catav chains, you took the sort of simplest one, right? You have no ZZ interaction. Um people looked at the one where you have a two X Y X Y but with a middle Z interaction like a fatter strip? You could I haven't thought of that, but that's possible. You want to go back and we're Where was it? So you want to make a cut So you may want to make a cut where you go Well this is going to give you X Z right is that where you're saying you want it to cut like this or no no no so you want two of these X Y chains horizontal with the Z bonds in the middle like a meta or yeah. A meta or yeah, it's like two copies of your spin chain coupled with a Z. Oh, well, so if you do the ladder, we looked at the ladder. I tried to decorate the ladder and I mean we need to Hamilton and work out in what sense. Well, uh, it's the shadow ground. The way that this works is that I have to, so if I do that, I can arrive at this model here. So I can absorb it, I know the field value where this is going to happen, but I cannot find a state that gives me zero. Zero. That's fine. Yeah, but what do you gain? You have it solvable when we model it? Well, no, but I can't solve it. The MRG on it. So it's not that. The MRG on. Yeah, well, so you know, when you so we've done that extensively for the sort of lateral representation of these models. We get a very nice phase diagram. Space diagram. We can measure this all. Yeah, that's what I meant. But you get some interesting phases? Yeah, we get sort of tons of phases. I don't think it's a good idea. That's the best phase. You just have to say one. So if I do the K-gamma model, then I think we located 15. So this is the same model. Well, yeah, I can show you the latter's yield time. Maybe these how many exact common states do you actually find? Well, that's a good question. So here we found, so in this case we found two, but I cannot prove that you can't find that. But I think that's very unlikely. The other thing that I would really like to do is to look at this model and then mathematically prove that there is a gap. Oh no about the G1, G2 model. And I went back and looked at that model and looked at the proof of the gap there. It's non-trivial. Something that I can immediately see. Maybe someone else can tell me how you. Someone else can tell me how you prove. But there is a gap there. So that's why I got work. We had some discussion earlier about sort of a gap that you observed in the exhibit organization and whether that could disappear in thermodynamic limit. But for fanaticism sciences, I mean, you always find twenties in them. Yes, yes. And the other surprising thing is that this is Thing is that this is exactly, it's not like you find two ground states that are close. They're exactly degenerate throughout the entire phase. The other thing that I should mention is that we cheat when I'm writing down these states. They're not exactly as simple as this one. Once I go away from the exactly solvable point, then we actually have. The exactly solvable point, then we actually have to tilt the directions on the alternating side slightly away from exactly the x and the y direction. So the angle between them is still more open. So the numerical calculations are a bit more involved, but that's the picture behind it. And pretty true. Did you
