Okay, I'm George Willis. I'm going to chair this first afternoon session of the workshop on totally disconnected locally compact groups via group actions. And our first speaker this afternoon is Colin Reid from the University of Newcastle. Colin is well known for his work on pro-finite groups and also for his work on local structure of TDLC groups. TDLC groups. More recently, he's been working on decompositions of TDLC groups. He did some very powerful work with Philip Weselik on decompositions, and he's going to tell us about some of his latest developments today. Thank you, Colin. Thanks, George. Yeah, so this is the, as the title suggests, this is something. As the title suggests, this is something of an aspirational talk. So there will be theorems. I'm not just going to be waving my hands, but the sort of theme here is to present a certain approach to thinking about the class of totally disconnected locally compact groups. So, with many classes of groups, there's some kind of notion of a rank. There's some kind of notion of a rank or some sort of numerical complexity of the group which you can do induction on and hopefully decompose the group into simple parts that there's some sort of minimal case that you get to. So the order of a finite group and obviously finite groups have a composition series where the factors are all simple. Series where the factors are all simple. Soluble groups, you can talk about the derived length, and then it reduces to studying abelian groups. Lie groups, you have the dimension. And there are more sophisticated examples, but anyway, just some notion of being able to count how big your group is. And the question. Um and the question I want to ask is: Can we do this for a class of totally disconnected locally compact groups? And I'll throw in second countable to avoid some technicalities, but really, really just think of totally disconnected locally compact groups. Is there some way of talking about the rank of these things or to sort of decompose a general group in this class into Group in this class into some sort of irreducible or basic parts. Now, there are a few obvious objections to this. One is that, you know, I've included all countable discrete groups, which seems a bit hopeless to come up with any sort of general structure theory for. So we'll need to sort of mod those out somehow. But also, there's sort of two ways in which groups in this class go to infinity. One is that you could take an ascending sequence of open subgroups and then form the direct limit. So this is something. This is something we're going to have to deal with. And then the second is that you have inverse limits, although only with compact kernels in general. Otherwise, you can take inverse limits more generally, but then you break local compactness. So there's sort of two directions you can go to infinity. Sort of two directions you can go to infinity with direct limits and inverse limits, but the inverse limit one is sort of contained in the sense that all the kernels are going to be compact eventually. And you can also take any countable sequence of groups in C and stick them together. You can't quite take a direct product, but a local direct product. A local direct product or a restricted product will give you another locally compact group. So this class is fairly big, is what I want to say, and we need to deal with that. So there's sort of two principles I'd like to suggest here. One is that we're not going to aim for sort of outright finiteness properties like, you know, finite. Like you know, finite derived length or finite order or this kind of thing. So, we're not going to have any sort of finiteness in an ascending direction, only in a descending direction, because we have to deal with direct limits. So, when I say well-foundedness, i.e., descending chain conditions. These are sort of equivalent notions if you assume the axiom of choice, which I will be assuming throughout. And the second thing is that we're not going to be able to say very much about discrete groups. And for this second point, we're just going to sort of put compact groups. Sort of put compact groups to one side as well and say, well, they have their own theory. So we'll treat compact and discrete groups as somehow basic cases. We're not going to worry about those. Okay, so these sort of principles first became clear, at least to me. At least to me, reading the work of Philip Weselek on elementary groups. So this is a class of you take, so it's the smallest class of TDLC SC groups that contain all the countable discrete groups and second countable pro-finite groups and is closed undertaking closed subgroups, quotients, increasing unions, and extensions inside this class C. Inside this class C. So if you've encountered elementary amenable groups, this is basically the same idea. Or I should say, though, that the non-discrete version of the von Neumann-Day problem is still open. All the amenable TDLC groups we know are elementary in the sense of Weselect. So these can be characterized by These can be characterized by so this is sort of a constructive definition of them, but they can also be characterized by a well-foundedness property. And this is the kind of property that I want to talk about. So if I write resG for the intersection of all open normal subgroups of G, then this is a characterization of being non-elementary. So So, a non-elementary group is one where there's an infinite sequence of compactly generated closed subgroups, each of which is contained in the discrete residual of the previous one. Okay. And so I just note here that we're allowed to have gi equals gi plus one equals raise gi. Plus one equals res gi. I'm not saying if that happens, then it's also non-elementary. So this isn't necessarily infinite sequence of properly, a proper descending chain. And because I want to use this later, you can convert this into a form that only refers to compactly generated open subgroups. So we instead So, we instead say we have an infinite sequence of non-compact, compactly generated open subgroups. Well, I'm not going to be able to make GI plus one be contained in the discrete residual of GI, but I can make it so that it is up to a compact factor. So, Gi plus one res GI over res GI is compact. Yeah, and again, you have to allow the case here that Gi plus one is equal to GI. To Gi. So, what this is saying is that elementary groups are characterized by a certain property of the set of compactly generated open subgroups. And I'll just remark that this is actually a countable set. So, if you're sort of from a descriptive set theory perspective, I guess this is a good thing. Perspective, I guess, this is a good thing that you can just start talking about countable relational structures and so on. But yeah, this is not like asking about all the closed subgroups is what I want to say. There aren't too many compactly generated open subgroups. And this sort of well-founded perspective leads to a rank function which is defined as follows. So the rank of the trivial group is one. So, the rank of the trivial group is one. And if G is non-trivial, then we take all the compactly generated open subgroups, then we take their discrete residuals and take the rank of those. And then we take the supremum of that and add one. And there's a simpler formula of G is compactly generated: that Ïˆ of G is Xi. xi of g is xi of res g plus one. Okay, so this supremum here should be understood as an ordinal supremum, like all the values here are ordinals. And it's exactly the sort of absence of these infinite descending chains from the previous slide that makes this a well-defined function on the elementary groups. So this rank. So, this rank makes sense exactly for the elementary groups. It doesn't make sense for non-elementary groups. And in principle, you could argue by induction on this rank to prove results about all elementary groups. Okay, so this doesn't answer the original question because not all Original question because not all groups in C are elementary. And it's worse than that. We don't have a good sort of handle on exactly what divides the group, the elementary groups from the non-elementary groups from well, from a couple of different perspectives. So from a descriptive set theory perspective, the natural thing to do is to take the symmetric. Take the symmetric group on the integers, and then you think of this class C as being just the locally compact subgroups of sim N up to isomorphism. So up to isomorphism, these are exactly the TDLCSC groups. And then within there, you have the class of elementary groups. And then So, I don't want to define the Frost-Borel sigma algebra, but if you're familiar with it, then C prime is in there. We don't know if E prime is in there. So, sort of the structural complexity of this, of the elementary groups within the locally compact groups is not known. And you can phrase this in the following way to ask: what is the largest. Way to ask what is the largest, what ordinals are possible for these ranks? And you can show that, so I should say the rank is always a countable ordinal, but maybe it could be any countable ordinal. Well, it can't be any because it's going to be something plus one, so maybe it could be any successor ordinal, countable successor ordinal. Ordinal. And what you can show is that the ranks are unbounded below omega one. In other words, you get all the countable successor ordinals, if and only if this is not a Braille set in the Braille sigma algebra, the F-ross Braille sigma algebra, sorry. But on the other hand, if they other hand if the if there is some upper bound then we can take a we can obviously take a local direct product so the supremum would then be achieved and they would really be a group an elementary group of the largest rank um which seems a bit strange but but we don't know um uh so i'm not going to say much more about descriptive set theory but i just thought i'd put that in there for those in the audience interested in For those in the audience interested in that perspective. And from a decomposition theory perspective, there's one obvious class of groups that are not elementary, and that's the class S of non-discrete, compactly generated, topologically simple TDLC groups. And the reason these are obviously not in E is because there's just no way to reach them from any of the construction steps. Of the construction steps, they're not direct limits of anything because they're compactly generated, they're not extensions of anything because they're simple or topologically simple, and they're not compact or discrete. So we can regard them as being irreducible, but they're clearly not elementary. And because the class E is closed under quotients and subgroups and so on, And so on, groups in S can't occur as a quotient of a closed subgroup in E. And the question is: is the converse true? So, if we have a group, we have a non-elementary TLC SC group, is there some closed subgroup H and then a closed normal subgroup K of H such that H mod K is in S? And again, this is not known. And again, this is not known. So, I would say this second question in particular is one of the most important questions that we have at the moment in the general structure theory of TDLC groups. What is it that makes a group non-elementary? Is there sort of this obvious obstacle? Okay, so here's a general approach to studying a group. approach to studying a group in this class of TDL-CSC groups. So first thing to say is well we can write it as a direct limit of its compactly generated open subgroups and then there are various things you can say about which properties carry over from compactly generated subgroups. So it would certainly be a good start to understand compactly generated groups. Compactly generated groups in C. And actually, a lot of the examples people are interested in are compactly generated. Okay, so then there's some good news, which is that we do actually have a series of finitely many factors in this case, where each factor is either a compact group, a discrete group, or a chief factor, meaning that there is no closed normal subgroup of G. normal subgroup G that lies strictly between Gi minus one and Gi. So you have what we call an essentially chief series. And you can make some statements about the sort of uniqueness of these essentially chief series as well. So what this is really saying is that all the complexity of your compactly generated group occurs in its chief factors. Okay, so that's nice. Okay, so that's nice. And then you have to ask, well, what do the chief factors look like? And in some cases, they're quite nice. So for instance, Capras and Monot showed that if you have a compactly generated chief factor, it is basically a product of copies of a group in S. I mean, there's a slight wrinkle here in that they only proved it's a quasi-product rather than a direct product, but. Product rather than a direct product, but we've more or less got a handle on what this thing looks like now in terms of its sub-normal subgroups. The trouble is that if you take a chief factor of a compactly generated group, that's not necessarily compactly generated. And then you have to ask, well, what are its sub-normal subgroups? And the answer is they can be more or less anything. So, with some mild caveats, you can base With some mild caveats, you can basically make any group in any sort of compactly generated group in C up to a compact normal subgroup, you can make it appear as a subnormal factor of a chief factor of a compactly generated group. So, and that means you can iterate this process. You know, you could make it a, you could put it inside a chief factor of something and then stick some more stuff on and then make that and put that inside a chief factor of something and so on. Inside a chi factor of something, and so on. So you see quite quickly there's no hope of getting any control over ascending chains of these things. But there might be for sort of descending chains. If you look inside a chief factor and then take its chief factor and then its chief factor and so on, maybe that terminates. So we can't really think about completely generated groups in isolation. We have to keep going between. We have to keep going between the compactly generated case and the general case. So, okay, so that looks quite daunting. But maybe we can make this process terminate so we do actually get to some irreducible groups like the class S. And if we had a nice rank function, then we could rule out certain kinds of infinite descent so that it does tell. Definite descent so that it does terminate. But there's some conditions we want this to satisfy. So these features are just motivated by the approach I outlined. So we want to be able to pass to a two factor, which means that we really need to be able to take quotients and And to be able to go from some normal factorization to the whole group, you want to also be able to take extensions. So a nice thing to have here would be that the rank of a quotient is at most the rank of G, and the rank of G is at most the sum of the rank of N and the rank of G mod N. Something like this. So the second condition is we need to be able to handle. Um, we need to be able to handle directed unions, so um, the rank should really be determined by the rank of the compactly generated open subgroups. Or to put this another way, we want the rank of G to be sort of roughly the rank, the supremum of the ranks of its compactly generated open subgroups. And the third is that we're going to need to be able to take some. Um, we're going to need to be able to take certain subgroups. Um, so we want to be able to take open subgroups, certainly, and we want to be able to take normal subgroups and have the rank come with us. So at least for nice subgroups, H of G, we want the rank of H to be less than or equal to the rank of G. And the fourth thing we want this rank to do is actually give us a basis for induction, it has to actually tell us something. For induction, it has to actually tell us something about the group. So let's say we've gone to a compactly generated group, then we want there to be a closed normal subgroup of smaller rank where G mod n is of a special form where we can actually say something definite about its structure that's not true about TDLC groups in general. General. So the rank function xi for elementary groups has all of these features. Behaves very well under quotients and extensions. Number two is true. You get the least successful ordinal above the rank of the compactly generated open subgroups. Number three is true for all closed subgroups, actually, in the case of elementary groups. Groups actually, in the case of elementary groups, and then in case four, you take n to be resg, and then the special property that g mod resg has is that it's a syn group, so it has a base of neighborsly identity consisting of compact open normal subgroups. Or to put it another way, it's sort of an inverse limit of discrete groups. So in that case, you get a very strong condition on this G mod n. This G mod n. But going beyond the elementary groups, we're probably going to have to make, we're probably going to have to give up some features. Okay, so one thing to note is that trying to get a rank that goes well for all closed subgroups is probably a bad idea. And the reason is the following. So you take a compactly You take a compactly generated TDLC group, TDLCS C group, then you can divide that by a compact normal subgroup and then have, sorry, there will be a graph, a connected locally finite graph on which G acts vertex transitively with compact kernel, is what I want to say. And then you can lift that graph up to a tree. Up to a tree. And so then you have a group acting on a tree vertex transitively. And what this amounts to is that you end up with a co-compact subgroup of the automorphism group in the tree because it's acting vertex transitively. And the group acting on the tree maps onto. the tree maps onto this quotient of the group acting on the it maps onto the group acting on the original graph which will have some compact kernel um and going from the tree to the graph gives you a discrete kernel so you end up with um yeah g mod k is isomorphic to g tilde mod d okay but the thing is the point here is that k and d are small from our perspective because they're compact and discrete Perspective because they're compact and discrete, respectively. So they're not going to contribute very much to the rank. So what this is saying is that every group in C appears as a closed subgroup of this particular group. Now, in the world of Polish groups, for example, this is a common thing that you have sort of universal groups where everything appears as a closed subgroup of something or other. Something or other. But this is not really the kind of situation we want if we want some sort of, you know, if we want each group to have a definite rank and then we can perform induction on that. We don't want something that's sort of bigger than all possible groups. So we're not going to be able to get all closed subgroups to have rank less than G. But we still need the rank to be inherited by a D. The rank to be inherited by a decent class of subgroups, enough that we can do the sort of regional approach argument that I outlined. So we want open subgroups and we want closed sub-normal subgroups. Okay, so fortunately, there is such a class that isn't just all closed subgroups. So I'm going to say that a closed subgroup of That a closed subgroup of G is a Rio subgroup, so this is regionally an intersection of open subgroups. If for every compactly generated open subgroup of H, then K is an intersection of open subgroups of G. So this looks a bit weird, but it turns out this is sort of the natural class to construct starting from the open side. Construct starting from the open subgroups, like if you're allowed to take intersections and direct limits and so on, you sort of get stuck in this class. And in particular, all the following are Rio subgroups. So closed normal subgroups are Rio. Rio subgroups of Rio subgroups are Rio. So in particular, subnormal subgroups. Intersections of Rio subgroups. If I just take a pointwise limit inferior of a net of Rio subgroups, that's also Rio. And if I have a Rio subgroup as a co-compact subgroup, then the Mo subgroup is Rio. It doesn't go the other way. You can't just take a co-compact, like co-compact subgroups in general are not Rio, but if it has a Rio subgroup, has a co-compact subgroup, then it's Rio. So it's So, it's a pretty large class of subgroups, as it turns out, but it's somehow constrained by being constructed out of open subgroups in a certain way. And so, the other ingredient I want to use is reduced envelopes. So, if you have a TDLC group and a compactly generated subgroup, then there's an essential. Then there's an essentially smallest open subgroup that contains the given one. So you've got an open subgroup that contains H, and whenever any open subgroup virtually contains H, so up to finite index, then that open subgroup also contains E up to finite index. So that's what I mean by E being essentially the smallest subgroup, open subgroup containing H. Subgroup containing H. Okay, so it's not odd to see that E is then unique up to finite index. Less obvious, it's invariant under changing H by finite index. I guess that's also fairly obvious. And unsurprisingly, if you start with a compactly generated subgroup, its reduced envelope is also compactly generated. Generated. So, okay, so I'm going to define OC tilde to be the compactly generated open subgroups up to finite index so that I can talk about reduced envelopes in a unique way. So, then if I have a continuous homomorphism of TDLC groups, then I have an associated envelope map from O. map from OC tilde of G to OC tilde of H, where so I take a compactly generated open subgroup up to equivalence and then I map it over to H that gives me some compactly generated subgroup and then I take a reduced envelope in H and you can show that if this That if this homomorphism is a closed embedding, in other words, G is a closed subgroup of H, and it's actually a Rio subgroup, then the envelope map is injective. So different compactly generated open subgroups of G have different reduced envelopes in H, basically. It's actually stronger than that. You can show that all the You can show that all the open subgroups, compactly generated open subgroups of G occur as the intersection of G with a compactly generated open subgroup of H. So there's a good connection here between O C tilde of G and O C tilde of H in this case. Okay, so this leads to a general idea for a rank function. So given group So, given group in C, define some partial order on pairs, and I'm only going to consider pairs where H is already a subgroup of K based on how H is embedded in K. And you don't want this to be sensitive to finite index, so it's got to pass to OC tilde of G. Okay, so then we say that this oh. So then we say that this partially ordered set is well founded if every non-empty set has a minimal element, which assuming choice is the same as no infinite descending chains. Okay, and then any well-founded poset gives you a rank. And I'm going to do it this way. So if we start with a minimal element, we just give it, we're going to say row is zero. Give it, we're going to say row is zero, that one, and then for all the other elements, um, you take the supremum of the ranks of the things below it, and then add one. So, I should guess I should emphasize here: this should be a strict partial order. We don't want to allow any element to be below itself, otherwise, this obviously. Below itself, otherwise, this obviously breaks. Okay, and then we can define the rank of g with respect to this way of defining the partial order as the supremum of the ranks of the elements plus one. So the plus ones here are just a sort of bookkeeping, I guess. It's not, I don't know if it's too important exactly how you define them. Exactly how you define the numbers, but you want to make sure that you sort of you don't lose too much information. Okay, so then given a brio subgroup of G, if we know that the envelope map is an order embedding, so we know it's injected, but if it also respects this order, then that means that the rank of H is less than or equal to the rank of G. Is less than or equal to the rank of G. Because it's, you know, it's effectively a sub-poset that you're measuring the rank of. And you can make a similar statement about extensions and quotients as long as the envelope map of a quotient is a quotient map in the sense of posets. So the sort of two elements are all. The sort of two elements are ordered if and only if there's sort of pre-images that are ordered. So, okay, so these are conditions that are sufficient to produce a nice rank function. And so, I want to finish with an example of such a rank function. I don't think it's the right deficit. Think it's the right definition, it's probably not the right definition of a rank function for groups in C, but it's a definition for which I can prove these things. So similar to res, which was the intersection of open normal subgroups, you can define res omega of a compactly generated group. And this is the unique largest H mod res omega A. H mod res omega h is the unique largest quotient that is elementary of finite rank. And then we say that h is less than k if first of all h is sort of almost contained in res omega of k. So h res omega k over res omega k is compact. And we also want to sort of keep We also want to sort of keep track of these quotients in S. And this second condition is needed to get us beyond the class of elementary groups, basically. And the second condition is motivated by results of Capras Monot. They proved it for res K, but it's true also for res omega K. If K mod res omega K is compact, then Then there are these quotients in S appearing of res omega k. And actually, every proper closed normal subgroup of res omega k is contained in one of these mi's, such that res omega k mod mi is in s. And using this, you can prove that this is actually a proper ordering. So I assumed here that k is non-compact, and then that ensures that. And then that ensures that if this happens, it doesn't happen in a vacuous way, you really do get groups in S appearing, and therefore H has infinite index in K. Okay, so then we define, we can check these conditions, as I say, that the envelope map of for a Rio subgroup and a quotient. And a quotient is an order embedding and a quotient, respectively. Actually, the quotient map case here is the more difficult one because the basic problem with dealing with quotients is that the product of two closed normal subgroups isn't necessarily closed. So, describing what the structure is of sort of closed normal subgroups and how that changes when you take a quotient is actually quite. Changes when you take a quotient is actually quite delicate, but it works in this case. So, what this means is that O C tilde of G effectively sees the ordering of O C tilde of H when H is a real subgroup, and it also sees the ordering of OC tilde of G mod N for any closed normal subgroup N. So then we can define a class of S well-founded groups, which are the groups which this partial order is well-founded. And we can prove lots of things about the rank, similar to elementary groups. So every elementary group is S well-founded, and there's a bound on the rank. If you have an S-well-founded group and a Rio subgroup of G, it's important here, I can. G, it's important here. I take a real subgroup and not just any old closed subgroup. Then H is S well founded and has smaller rank. I take a quotient. So G is S well founded if and only if N and G mod N are S well founded, and you have this nice bound on the ranks. Yeah, and then the class of S1 founded groups is closed under direct unions and it's closed under sort of residual things. So if you're residually S1 founded, then you're S well founded. And again, there's a bound on the rank. Okay, so what kind of induction type thing do you get? Well, if you take a group in ES that's non-compact. ES that's non-compact and compactly generated, then you go down to res omega g, that has some quotients in S, maybe, which we only consider the quotients in S that are where M is has finitely many conjugates in G. And that means we're actually only taking finitely many quotients in S. You can prove this. So you're going into res omega. You're going into res omega g, and then there's a quotient of res omega g that's sort of formed by intersecting finitely many kernels of maps from res omega g to a group in s. And then once you've done that, you end up with a group that's characteristic in G and is of smaller rank than strictly smaller rank than G. So we do have something, some basis of induction here. Induction here. And in particular, we can answer the dichotomy question for groups in ES. If you have a group in ES that's not elementary, then actually you have to have a quotient of a Rio subgroup that's in S. And we can also say that this class is characterized by the groups in S that belong to the class. So if you want to describe exactly what this class is, it's sort of enough to know what this. This class is sort of enough to know what the groups and S in the class are. And it has the same closure properties as elementary groups, except that closed subgroups are not necessarily in the class. Okay, so some examples of these groups. If you take a tree and you have a group acting on it with TITS independence property, which Solomon will be talking about. Talking about. And you suppose that the local actions of this group are primitive but not regular, then G inherits being S well founded from the local actions. And you can bound the rank in terms of the local actions. And basically, the reason this is the case is that every proper open subgroup fixes a vertex. And so the sort of local actions. Sort of local actions really determine what the open subgroups look like. And in particular, using one of Simon's constructions, this means there are two CIF naught groups in S that are S well-founded of finite rank. And I think you can get rank two, in fact. So another example: if you take a group that has a linear open subgroup. Open subgroup, then it's S well founded and the rank is at most four. And again, this is because there's very good control over open subgroups in this case based on this result of Capras and Stulemeyer. And then another example is cats-moody groups. So these are not exactly the usual cats, the sort of cats. The sort of Katz-Moody theory, Katz-Moody groups, you take, you let it act on a building in a natural way and then take the closure. You get a TDLC group that way over a finite field. And again, here, so Capras and Marquis prove a they basically classify all the open subgroups up to conjugacy of these groups, and that's enough to say that the rank is. The rank is finite in this sense. And so, all these examples, we basically know they're SOL founded because we have really good control over the open subgroups. However, not all groups are S1 founded. So, here's a sort of counterexample. If you take a Bergamoses universal group, which I'm not going to define, with Define with nilpotent but not regular local action, then it's not S well founded. And the proof is an infinite descent, basically. So if you're familiar with the plus group of these things, you take the plus group, that's compact by simple, well actually simple in this case, but it's not compactly generated. So then you take an open subgroup in there, which is compactly generated. Which is compactly generated, and it will act, it will preserve some proper subtree. And then you take the plus group on that, and it's compact by simple, but again, it's not compactly generated, and so on. And so you find that this, this, if you keep taking a large open subgroup, this process never terminates. However, if we made all the same definitions, but we just threw in all the non-elementary simple groups, not just the compound. Elementary simple groups, not just the compactly generated ones, then U of N would actually be S prime well-founded. So I don't know if there are any groups that are not S prime well-founded. There probably are. But yeah, I guess the question is, is there some way of taking this idea further and proving that all TDL CSC groups that have a well-foundedness property Foundedness property, or if not, maybe there are more classes to be considering along these lines. And there's a way of sort of taking this approach to organize the class of TDLCS groups. I'll just leave you with some references. Thanks for your attention. Thank you, Colin.
