So, before I start, I guess I want to thank you all for all the amazing talks you gave. For me, it was very insightful to learn all the good things you guys are doing, coming from a different discipline, and also the organizers for inviting me to be here. So, as most of you don't know me, it's just a bit of a background about me. So, I'm a health informatician. About me. So, I'm a health informatician. So, I work, I'm part of medical school faculty. So, my lab is all multidisciplinary. We have people from clinical background, like psychiatrists to software developers and also engineers in our group. So, my interest is really more on the healthcare delivery end. So, I'm interested in improving healthcare delivery. Improving healthcare delivery, especially using these emerging consumer technologies like mHealth wearables, alongside with the digital information we have on people, data that comes from consumer technologies as well as traditional EHRs. I'm sort of really interested in two things. How do we monitor and support people outside the clinic environment? If they're patients, If they're patients, it's like in between clinic appointments, how do we support them? If they're at-risk groups, how do we provide those monitoring and support in a free-living environment? So I work really across two different areas with two different groups. Work with data science and tech people to create tools. So basically we create dashboard applications for Create dashboard applications for health professionals to monitor patients' progress outside the clinic and apps and nudging interventions for supporting patients. So that's like the tool part, which is itself very challenging. And then the other part I work on is working with the patients and the health professionals themselves to really understand the design and implementation issues. And often, And often these two areas actually are going in opposite directions. So it's working across these two. It's a bit like herding cats or like a plumbing job here. Something you have to do, but it's not very satisfying. No one wants to do it, but it's good to do it. So I want to just run through some of the work we're doing in the mental health space. We have projects in other areas, but I'll focus on mental health. I'll focus on mental health. Just to quickly acknowledge various bodies that are funding us. So to start with the problem, so mental health care delivery problem. So these are the numbers in Australia. We spend around 7% of the healthcare budget on mental health care delivery. Some would argue that's not enough, but that's a separate question. Separate question. Over the last 10 years, that has actually gone up by four times, so it has actually increased at a higher rate than inflation. Parallelly, the mental health outcomes have not improved in obviously population surveys, which are tracked every year of the health service metrics like readmission rates. These things are getting worse and worse. So, the more services we're putting in, the more worse outcomes we're getting. We sort of see this. Outcomes we're getting, we sort of see these trends happening. And I think that's related to the fact that mental health is a very nebulous concept. It's not objective what I mean, but I use this example of diabetes as a better example. You have a single marker, like a blood test, you can do and measure blood glucose. And you could use that to really do diagnosis or monitoring. You don't really have anything like that in a mental health space. In a mental health space. Instead, the only way to quantify mental health is to really rely on this expert assessment paradigm. So it's a self-report paradigm. And that works okay in the clinic session when you're seeing a doctor, a trained specialist, they can diagnose problems, but it's really outside the clinic. There's no tools to track changes or Or triage the right support. So, this is the problem we want to tackle. Are there other ways to monitor mental health? And obviously, there are things like two things that are there. There's a EMA methods that are good to extend clinical-based monitoring, but there's all sorts of challenges with that. Missing data is a big problem. And then there's digital footprints. So, we started characterizing all the types of data we could potentially. We could potentially collect on people and look at behavioral patterns in those which are relevant to mental health. So this was in 2015. We were looking at these. There's lots of challenges with collecting this data, which are not really technical challenges alone. There's ethical and regulation issues. So we did, on one of we also did some studies to understand people's. To understand people's willingness to be monitored with this data. So, this was one study where we recruited a cohort of young people who visit a popular online mental health service in Australia. We intercepted them when they were on their website. We asked them to just link one of the several activity tracker devices. Devices, if they're using one, or we suggested they, if they haven't got one, we recommended they use one. We did a baseline assessment of their using gas, that's their depression anxiety assessment. So we started to see some interesting signals, like the volatility patterns in the daily activity duration or like three-month period, or correlating with their anxiety scores, not with depression. So there are With depression, so there were some interesting signals. I won't go into the details about the methods now because I want to talk about something else. Following on from this, one of the things, there's a lot of work that's happening in this space. People are looking at the whole field of digital phenotyping in psychiatry is quite advanced. However, there's a big problem with this. Most studies are done in like Most studies are done in like sort of not so well characterized populations. They are done in small samples and they rely on the individuals to provide the label in order to identify digital phenotypes. So most studies are in this 20 to 30 people sample size or a duration of a couple of weeks to up to maybe two months. What we are interested in is creating a longitudinal data set on these. Longitudinal data set on these digital indicators, but also explore the clinical utility of these digital indicators. So, for that, we developed, following on what Rich was saying, we also created a mobile platform. So an app for patients to both do EMAs and also track their few objective metrics. We created a dashboard for help. Dashboard for health professionals. We are currently trialing this in two different types of patient groups. That is, one group is people with depression and anxiety who are undergoing CBT treatment for eight weeks. So they get seen every week by their clinicians, so they're getting assessed. So in between those sessions, we analyze the trends in each of the signals. Each of these signals, and we sort of present them like the variability in those trends. So, obviously, a trend could be either increasing, decreasing. These are simple statistics, or it could be volatile, which is often the case. But what we are interested in is the volatility is itself interesting. If the volatility is becoming more, is increasing in between sessions, that is, there is a if you have a is that if you calculate an entropic measure and if that entropic measure is increasing over time, that means the lifestyle patterns are becoming from irregular to more irregular. And that's an interesting indicator for mental health. For example, take the location sensor from that you get time spent at different places every day. One of the index is the time spent at home. Spent at home, which is an important indicator that at the clinical session the health professionals interview and find out. Because as people get depressed or anxious, they do avoid people and spend more time at home. So there are these subtle signals in these data streams that are useful. So that's and the other so that that was the smartphone platform. The other other side is we're also working with We're also working with EHR claims. The other way to look at this is like the instead of the sensor data stream, we have claims data streams. So we're using this to track or monitor chronic patients, people who are on like a treatment regime, who need to have regular GP visits, lab tests done on schedule, or pathology or the need to. Or they need to pick up scripts on a schedule. So, if you're a schizophrenic on a particular type of antipsychotic which has a certain risk profile, then you need to be on that treatment. You need to pick up scripts maybe every two weeks or every six weeks. You need to see your GP every month to get symptoms assessed, side effects assessed, and then you also need maybe um three monthly or monthly blood tests done to Blood tests done to look for metabolic changes. Now, a lot of the time, these things are not actually actualized according to guidelines, so people fall through gaps and the risk of relapse increases. So, what we do is we track the claims and we look at regularity patterns of claims against how those regularities compare to the disease guidelines. So, we might assign So we might assign someone to a red alert if they're becoming more irregular. And if they are actually regular, we give a green alert. So this then gets turned into like a dashboard that gets integrated into out of hospital avoidance programs. So these hospital avoidance programs look at people who have been recently discharged for getting red alerts. If they have red alerts, If they have red alerts, they admit them to an outpatient program. And if they have green alerts, they will discharge them back to community and self-care. So what we are trying to do here is re-engineer the process, which previously was you relapse, you go to hospital, and then you get outpatient support for briefly to we monitor your risk of relapse and we bring you in to outpatient support or release you from outpatient support. Release you from outpatient support. So, it's sort of bypassing this going to hospital model. So, this is something that's being rolled out in South Australia, that's the state where I'm from. About how many clinics physicians are using it then and their role in that? So, at the moment, it's being used in three sites. The way this system works, it's You don't need to recruit patients, it's really integration with EHRs. So, we have around 4,000 patients in these three sites. So, we have a translational grant funded to sort of scale this to the statewide. In 2022, we would have the statewide coverage, and this sort of becomes part of the health service. So, one of the problems we have here is. Um so one of the problem we have here is th these alerts actually um are very noisy. So the the risk of just because they haven't because we are looking at weak signals, they haven't picked up scripts, they haven't attended appointments and often it puts burden on the reviewer to look for signal in volume of noise. So what we are trying to do is now collect labels at each alert about the state. Each alert about the state of the person. These are like potential predictors of relapse, like for example your social support at that particular time when you stop taking scripts, your self-awareness level, what level it is, and how stable overall you are. So that's a health professional will assess them and give us these labels. Was these labels. So, what I'm interested in next is to see: can we increase the confidence for each other? Can we then start to give a risk of relapse? What is your chances of readmission in the next three months, six months, 12 months? So the health services can then use this to triage which groups they want to follow up. And if we don't do that, this sort of thing will never get implemented because the alerts are just too many and and most people are And most people are alert, fatigued, and healthcare. So, the next thing I want to talk is like this work we're doing in the consumer side, like creating support apps for people. And primarily, I'm looking at the mobile phone, how do we leverage that in a mental health concept context. Obviously, most people have phones, and also there are People have phones, and also there are lots of mental health apps. This is a number I have from several years ago. There were 10,000 mental health apps on the App Store of various dubious qualities. And some of them are good, most of them are not effective, and some are even harmful. So we looked at one of the projects we did, we created a portal. A portal which would help people find quality apps that's now rolled out on reachout.com. So it's sort of for a young person who is looking for apps for a particular symptom, and sort of searching on Google Store, they go to this site and they'll get a recommendation of an app that's been vetted by a health professional and end user. So the other thing we have been looking at is nudging people in between. nudging people in between appoint in between clinical sessions as a way to activate them to do the tasks that are prescribed at clinical sessions. So in one of the trials we did with suicidal and crisis patients, when we nudged them in between, they were actually needing to they were actually getting better quicker. They were showing same end of treatment score, but the number of sessions was actually increasing so instead of having Was actually increasing so instead of having six sessions, they would probably show the same score in four. And through exit interviews, we found that getting a nudge from the therapist in between sessions was having intervention effect, pushing them to get things done. And of course, in the last two, three years, I've been working with Susan about microengines. About microandomice trials. I worked with Susan and Wig Stretcher, Streker in Michigan, to work out what is the best time to nudge, which types of nudges work best. We did that in a different population, in well-being, focus in a workplace population, but I'm now interested to take that approach and embed that in the clinical setting. So I'm sort of working on the study. Setting, so I'm sort of working on studies. I'll leave it there, and I deliberately kept this very brief and vague because these are there's a lot of details here. But if people are interested in any of these, the types of challenges that I face are one is how do we do with missing data, how do we handle that, how do we treat those in the monitoring? That's one of the areas I'm interested in. The second aspect is the modeling side, how do we increase confidence in a How do we increase confidence in a real-time environment, improve predictions? I mean, those are the two data science challenges we face. There's obviously a lot of other implementation challenges we have, but that's not relevant here. Any questions? Any questions? I'm curious, how are you using the Medicaid claims data within this work? Like what role does it play? How do you use that to impact the way you make care decisions for participants? So what we do is we really phenotype their claim patterns. By phenotype, I mean the regularity of claim how the claim pattern compares against what an ideal Trajectory of Medicare claims. If there's a deviation, we sort of see that as at-risk. You're getting essentially like a live stream of the CCC. I see, I see. Yeah, so that took us two years to develop a software platform that pulls live stream from. But how quickly do claims come in? Like, if I fill a prescription, how much time delay is there for the future? Yeah, so it's a government stream. There might be pains because in Australia, we have this two-tier health system. So we have the federal, the central government that sort of funds all the primary care services. So everyone, all your services are reimbursed through Medicaid. And we do now have electronic processing systems integrated into all EHR tools. So effectively, 90% of the times the claims are real-time. They go to the Medicare claims. They go to the Medicare claims data base. So you go to a GP, and at the end, you check out immediately claims made by the GP to get reimbursed, and that goes to the database, Medicare database. And our system is having this live connection with it, so then it immediately comes to us. Does that work in the US like that? So your work is pretty, you know, that part is. So your work is pretty, you know, that part is pretty localized, Australia. Well, I didn't get into the details, so there's a gateway in between. So in Australia, we have a national personally controlled electronic health record system. It's called My Health Records. It's built to provide people access to their own health records. So it integrates all the information available on them. And you can build third-party applications that Applications that connect to that. And so we are sort of using that as a gateway to cool. So there's a lot of technical aspects there. So the veterans and the Medicare claims, you can't access them in real time here. Right, that's my part too. Okay, that's cool. I'm not sure if the VA is like you were embedded in the VA. There may be some more real time. But for me, the great thing about Australia is and Australia's and other systems similar is that these could provide test beds for us to demonstrate what we could do. And this is actually, this is in real life, right? These are not like little clinical trials like I run. These are really real life. Well, thank you.
