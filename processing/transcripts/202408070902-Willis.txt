Organizers invitation. So, yeah, I'm going to sort of talk about a sort of trick that sort of comes up a lot in a lot of what I do. And basically, the title says that we're going to be pulling strings around and deciding how that simplifies based on all places and seeing what that leads to. So, just to get started, what's the definition or Definition or recall. I think I'll write a recall. I'm not going to write a full definition. That one complex of the link diagram. Okay, all this stuff is based on definitions for linked diagrams. Well, Well, what is it? Well, it's a bigrated chain complex. I don't know, based on or this sort of local definition that I'll even call it like a definition. Like a definition. Anytime you see a crossing in your link diagram, you're allowed to sort of instead build the code of two resolutions of the crossing. And well, H and Q, I'll write down in a moment. This is the homological shift and quantum degree shift. We have two gradings, homological. Degree shift, two grading, homological, homological grading. And then there's an overall renormalization, sort of after the fact. You build some kind of giant cube of pictures like this, some cubical chain complex. Okay, and there's homological and quantum rating shifts throughout the complex in this sort of very sort of simplistic manner. In a very sort of simplistic manner. But then at the end, you do need to apply some kind of overall renormalization based on the number of positive and negative crossings. Okay, so yeah, just so everything is sort of here. Here is like a homological degree shift. Q is one degree shift. Those are two degrees. All right, and in this talk, we'll also use sort of the combination, the difference between the two. I'm going to call that grading zine. Okay, that's once you have a bi-grading, you have any combo that you want, that's the one we're going to be interested in. In particular, you know, you just think about this as a Z-graded thing. There's actually no Z-shifts at all when you're resolving processes. And then I guess Elema, which sort of then Lemma, which sort of then goes into the main trick that I'm trying to sort of illustrate, is that the key lemma somehow is that if you save renormalization until the end, which is essentially what you're supposed to do, then randomized removes create grading shifts that you can keep track of. Okay, so let me say this. Okay, so let me say this. If some tangle, because these are all sort of going to be based on local pictures like this, some tangle diagram is isotopic as a tangle, some other tangle diagram, relative boundary, I suppose. Suppose. Then the complex that you would set to D, well, is chain homotopy equivalent to some shift of D prime. Alright, and so rather than, I mean, A is somehow like the number of negative crossings that you lost, B is like. Negative crossings that you lost, and B is like twice that minus the number of positive crossings that you lost. But rather than write all that, in some sense, all the sort of things that I'm going to show you today can really just be viewed as coming from the following two Radomiser moves. Which way do I need to go this way? The negative Rademeister one move creates this very specific shift or in our combo grading. It's just a single shift C. And Reinemeister 2 creates this very specific shift. I I mean I I don't I don't know. I don't know. This is just supposed to be concatenated. There is no Z shift for radarizer 2. Okay, so this is something, you know, that, I mean, if this didn't work, the entire mono thing would not be a well-defined linked theory at all. So that's the sort of the key lemma. And then if I were to sort of try to put the main trick down into words on Blackboard. On the blackboard, green board. I would say basically we're just going to have pictures and we're going to pull strings around. So we're using isotopes, and we're going to track the gradings while we do this. Okay? Simplify. To simplify, maybe I'll say like pictures within, let me just say simplify complexes before renormalization and just in some sense, that's it. It and I claim that this trick, you know, used in sort of the right ways is enough to buy you all sorts of things. So, I would consider this. I mean, there's many ingredients into any, but like this, I would consider one of the main ingredients. Okay, well, if you've heard me give talks before, I talk about Before I talk about twists and infinite twists a lot, so let me just write infinite twist. Somehow taking some number of strands and twisting them sort of infinitely often. So there's some sense in which this stabilizes to give a complex that we call PN, sort of categorification of the Jones 1. Categorification of the Jones-Wenzel projector, whatever. If those words mean nothing to you, the important thing about this complex is that somehow, well, one of the important things about it, if you have, if you put a turn back on top of it or on bottom, the whole thing sort of just collapses. Things where it just collapses practical. Okay, and uh and okay, so that's just some gadget and I'm just gonna say that you know this leads you to be able to define things like colored monophthongology. Ophthalmology. DCATFI, the Jones-Wenzel predictors, essentially what you use to build WRT invariance for some options. So let me put a talk about this today, but when I put a little star here, it means also. It means also works for quantum spectrum. So I don't know if familiar we are, but the quadoff chain complex does have a lift category. This is a stable homotopic category. And this is one of the things that translates more or less directly. Okay, so that's one thing that. Okay, so that's one thing that this trick can be used for. Another kind of cute fact that's related would be that, in fact, you know, the infinite twist is some very kind of specific infinite grade. Okay, I claim that, in fact, any positive Infinite grade is the same. Okay, the infinite twist, there is something special about it, but in fact, any positive infinite rate would accomplish the same goal. Okay, that's kind of a curious fact. What does that mean? Well, it means somehow that, okay, the infinite twist is some kind of limiting statement about sort of. Some kind of limiting statement about sort of more and more twisted problems. Should you fix it, give it positive third and then pick powers it? I don't even have to do that. I claim that you give me any infinite word in the brain group. I guess I'm lying slightly. As long as your infinite word uses every letter infinitely often, otherwise you're kind of having an extra strength not doing anything. As long as your word is like infinite enough, then the limiting procedure that would do this, like, or sorry, the limiting procedure that you would have used here, if we use that. The limiting procedure that you would have used here, if you use that for this infinite word, you get the same answer. Up to change homotopy equivalence. Oh, and this also works just fine for spectra. Okay, so I'm not going to say very much more about those today. To today, the things that I mainly want to focus on is what I'm just going to write as full twist simplifications, and we'll say a little bit more clearly, but basically the full twist, the sum, like single full twist of all the strands, and there's going to be a way to Strands, and there's going to be a way to simplify the Kiwana complex to make it a little easier. So, if you do it infinite twist some number of strands, the stable part is how you define the one of all it to be with the corresponding link in S1 times S2. No, so let me so I wrote stabilizers and quotes here, like to define what you mean by the stabilization procedure. You really have to somehow give like Have to somehow give, like, you're taking some kind of you know, categorical limit. You really have to give maps from like one twist to the more twists to more twists to more twists. Okay, and I claim that there's multiple ways to do that. The full twist simplifications I'm going to talk about today lead to, let me say, an alternative stabilization procedure. Okay, where maybe when you call it infinite twist prime? Okay, it's sort of a different way to define what you mean by the word stabilize. This is what leads to S1 process two units. Two ingredients, let me write one more thing and then we'll sort of pause and like try to take it all in, right? Okay, because the other thing that this type of simplification is used for or can be. Is used for, or can be used for, is you can use this to help you relate the vanishing of the steam lasagna of a two-handle body to a Thurston banking number. Of the attachment let me erase and loose pause a second. Question. The product homologies that stabilize me do more and more twists. The scale of zoning module of two antibodies defined cables, right, according to a framing. Yes. As you increase the framing, you're doing more and more twists. That's right. Is the scale designing module stabilized? So as the framing sort of goes off to infinity, can I actually just say this without getting into trouble? Say this without getting into trouble. Yes, I am like fairly sure, but maybe let me say like, you know, I would have to like sit down and review all this again and really be sure. Okay, but you see, you have to sort of, there's sort of two different limiting procedures then sort of going on in that moment. You need to sort of make sure that they take high speed. That moment. You need to sort of make sure that they say nice to each other. But just standing in front of you right now, I can't think of a reason why they wouldn't, but okay. So we're just going to be pulling strands and simplifying complexes. And I guess I claim that this is the main ingredient in a kind of whole list of things. I'm not going to focus on the whole infinite twist idea here, so let me just. Infinite twist idea here. So let me just briefly kind of summarize once more. Okay. Infinite twist stabilizes is some kind of statement about, yes, as you add more and more twists, you have to have maps. You have to have a map from one twist to two twists, to three twists, and so forth and so on. One choice of map creates what we call Pn, and that leads to colored quantum invariance. Okay, and the way that you check that this does what you want is essentially this trick. Is essentially this trick that I've just delayed. Okay. However, there exist other maps from one twist to the next to the next. And one version of that, sort of an alternative version, really requires you first to understand how the full twist itself could have been simplified. It's like a possible scene if somebody just writes down the giant n times n minus one dimensional cube for the full twist. Okay, you should never see. Okay, you should never see what the map is or what the stabilization procedure ought to be. As opposed to here, here it's very easy to actually see what the proper thing is, just keep it writing down the big cube. However, the giant cube for a full twist, if you simplify it properly, you will notice that there is sort of another map available, or an alternative stabilization procedure. That procedure, well, you know, that procedure allows you to define. And that procedure allows you to define, instead of colored invariance, it allows you to define invariance for links in S1 cross S2. Okay? However, okay, so neither of those things am I going to say too much about today. Okay, the main thing I am going to talk about the full twist simplifications because I want to be able to talk about this one. Okay. Okay, the NE positive infinite break, I'm not saying word of. That's just sort of a cute side comment. This idea that you can take the full twist, which is n times n minus 1 crossing, so it's some giant n times n minus 1 dimensional cube worth of pictures, simplify it, and keep track of gradings and things. This will help us realize that I haven't defined this word yet. You're not familiar with this. Turn off familiar with this. Okay, so let me just say it in brief now. Kabano scheme lasagna is an invariant of four manifolds that's built using Kabano homology. In particular, for a two-handle body where I only attached a single two-handle, I'm really just saying something about I had some not to the three sphere in a framing telling me how to attach one two-handle. Okay, we will be able to show results along. Be able to show results along the lines of: guess what? If your framing was below the Thurston-Benniken number of the knot, which nothing about ophthalmology really references, but that's going to be the bound, then the seam lasagna has to be. That's what we're going towards. I don't want to try to write it all yet because I want to, you know, I haven't actually written a definition for this. I'm going to work on the last thing I just want to say is. And I guess, yeah, the last thing I just want to say is that, you know, this, you know, this is going to be the Thurston-Benekin number, but in fact, from my point of view, there's going to be precisely zero contact topology or contact geometry that includes anywhere in either the proof or really the way I'm going to present. Okay. So, but to get there, we first have to talk about full Twitter. Fair, we first have to talk about full twist and ways of simplifying it. Alright, so okay. All this, by the way, like this procedure of how to properly simplify the pull twist so you can see what's going on, is essentially due to present. Okay, but he had sort of his own alternative gradient scheme and things. We're going to try to put into the normalizations or the conventions that I'm using here. So maps between the twists of the GDPN and then different maps are just different shifts? Yes, they're. I think it's relatively easy to look at this one and say this is somehow like the Easy to look at this one and say this is somehow like the gradient preserving one in a reasonable way, sort of before renormalizing the numbers of crossings. Whereas this one actually is a sort of more, there's a serious shift here. Okay, so notation. How what do we have? We have 20 minutes. Okay, FN is the full twist. Okay, FN is the full twist. Uh if you're not familiar, this is I think that's the pretty word. Okay, and we're also going to use the this is and EN is going to be it's called the uses murpy 3. It's called the Isha Swervy grade. Okay, so I'm not going to draw the full twist. Justice Murphy braid is this thing. One strand circles around all the others. Okay, and the key sort of relationship between these guys is that. Is that a full twist on n plus 1 strands is the same thing as the usius-Murphy braid combined with the previous book list. Okay, so this is well, you can do randomized removes to see if you like it. To see if you like. Another notation. Notation, notation, notation. If delta is a diagram, then tau delta is going to be the number of turnbacks over 2. And what I mean is that tau. over two. And what I mean is that tau of something like like a picture like this is turnbacks one, two, three, four. Or if you prefer, this is like the opposite of through degree. The through degree of this thing is one. The turnbacks is the number of transits not making three. Okay, so that's just a bunch of notation. And now, let me. Okay, I gotta pick which steps I really want to show. I do want to show you because Andrew actually already showed you this to some degree. Well, he showed you this, but he emphasized a different thing about it than I want to emphasize. Sort of the base case for all the simplifications is what Diarrhea started to talk about with these classes. Talked about with these clasps yesterday or two days ago. I mean, a clasp is F2. So in some sense, step 0 is that F2, which is, I'm going to draw it this way. F2 is a clasp. And so the way I want to indicate what has happened. The way I want to indicate what has happened, just to indicate how in some sense you could get everything from thinking about this trick, is I'm just gonna do one of the crossings. Okay, I hope that looks reasonable. Alright, but let me just sort of indicate with the color here that I'm gonna like keep. I'm gonna like keep this one separate. So, this one, I have a randomized remove available, and I know what shifts it does. So, this one just sort of turns into, let me not do that, that picture. This one can be turned into this picture. Okay? Okay, so this is sort of my way of sort of drawing what happened. Andrew sort of had the, you know, actually showed the Gaussian illumination, which is literally what's behind the scenes here. And there was some map between them. Okay, and I'm not going to care about the maps. There's some resulting map between these things. If I have to look at homological gradients, it has no choice but to go from here to there and cannot be affected by this. A lot of the effects of like this. So, yeah, maybe it's worth it to just pause here, because if you believe in your ability to do something like this, you're sort of going to believe in almost everything else I write. Almost everything else I write. But I claim that almost nothing happened other than knowing the shifts for this misery. Yeah. And you won't ever need to. Yeah. And you won't ever need to figure out what that map is? Well, no, I'm not going to need to. Another version of me would need to, but version for today does not mean this. Okay? All right. So step one is, okay, let me also just indicate, if we were using the Z gradings, Gradings, then this is sort of z to the zero, this is z to the zero, and this is the only place where a z shift actually. All right, so I claim that doing things like this is sort of all you need to determine that. Sorry, I sh this equals, I don't want to lie, this equals is really like a chain on the token fitness, right? I performed some kind of Reutermeister move, which is a chain on the token fitness. Okay, and I claim that doing things like this and Reid-Meister 2 moves is enough to determine that the Juicus-Murphy braid is some kind of, well, there's the identity, plus everything else in the Juicus-Murphy braid. Eustace Murphy breed looks like this. So I'm going to write this and then explain what I mean. Okay, so I'm skipping a lot of sort of little messing around with pictures here in the interest of time. I claim that you can inductively work out that, I'm not going to draw it, I'm just going to say quickly, in the Justice-Murphy braid, at the far end, these two crossings are a copy of F2. A clock of F2. You need to know what to do with F2 first, for the class. Once you know what to do with the class, you sort of start playing with what's left over and you work out that you're going to get a copy of the identity grade plus some terms that part of the identity. So delta here is just some diagrams, some pictures, okay. And what this notation is trying to say is that any picture. Say, is that any picture in here is going to carry some kind of homological shift or some kind of Q shift, and the homological shifts available for any given picture are in this range. Does the notation at least then make sense? You just keep track of what ranges are available for which pictures. And hey, if you actually, I mean, you know, you might worry a priori if I just write this, what if, like, someone. If I just write this, what if some low h is together with some high q? But in fact, that does not happen. The difference between them is really just between 0 and 1. Once you know EN, you can determine Fn Okay. Well, no, no, we already used that symbol. Star. Using this fact, there's some kind of inductive argument that compares some full twist to a full twist that you've presumably already computed and the EN before it. And the answer comes out to, oh, shoot. I'm sorry, let me write down here. Should let let I'm sorry, let me let me write it right here. So fn is again, there's the identity sort of separate from everything. Everything else has the form. Everything else in the complex has the form. All right. This is using this fact. Okay, so again, rather than write down a bunch of things, I do want to say a couple words about how you would ever hope to get these precise ranges and bounds on these things. And the answer is essentially. Essentially, take this picture. I mean, this is an induction statement, naturally. Okay, you take this picture, and you realize that if you understand how Fn, let me actually draw this. I simplify the previous full twist so it's some kind of giant cost. So, it's some kind of giant complex made of diagrams like what are in here. And I know what shifts are available for this guy. And I also know, like, all the shifts are based on tau, how many turnbacks there were, or how many cups there were. And any cups that are appearing in here, like, can just get pulled through the Jucius Murphy part using nothing but Radhemeister 2s. Like, somehow I just know that. Like somehow, I just know that I will never have to use anything other than Ridermeister 2s during this procedure. I can just count how many. And then you should maybe ask yourself if this had fewer, if this only had one turn back, something like this, what would I be left with? Well, I claim I would be left with a smaller Eustace Murphy green after pulling the things through. And I believe I already know. Through, and I believe I already know how simplified a ushist code is. Oh, the interesting content of this is the shifts, right? That's right, that's right. Actually, counting the shifts. That's all. This is, I guess, yeah, that's the sort of the point of trying to get across is that the main trick is pulling things and counting how much you're doing. That's enough to do all of this. What about the maps? I'm going to completely disregard the maps, right? There's all sorts of differentials floating. Right, there's all sorts of differentials floating around in here that I'm currently disregarding. I mean, resolution is a little bit of a funny word, like, you know. You don't need all the resolutions. Right? Like, I didn't take all the resolutions of this. Right, so what diagrams, my history? What diagrams? Whatever appeared in the previous FX. No, I, you know, I inductively quote-unquote know, you know, but I don't really know. Know, you know, but I don't really know in that I haven't sat down at a new rate. The other seeds are watching the other shifts by the kind of colour. That's right, that's right. So if you prefer, I haven't really left the temporary lead category in any of this. Yes. So with that actually in mind, let's write down what the relevant this thing is. This thing is for Z. And again, I tried to write it sort of suggestively. You might worry that there's like a low H with a high Q, but no, it never happens. You actually keep track. And I mean, you can think of this as, I did almost nothing but write a master twos. The writer master two was the thing that did not shift z at all. I claimed that this thing is just z from zero to tau. I think I'm still confused about something really basic. I'm still confused about something really basic. So, these diagrams could still have crossings in them? No, no, sorry, that wasn't clear. Anytime he uses the letter delta, no crossings. Okay, then I. Yeah, otherwise I hadn't really fully simplified. Okay. All right. So, okay, so that's some procedure. Again, this is essentially due to Lev Brzezansky, this sort of procedure of note. This sort of procedure of noticing all this. As I erase, again, I'm just going to sort of say out loud, because I mentioned the S1 cross S2 business. Well, I'll say it again in a moment. Notice that, you know, the shifts are largest for large values of tau. Large values of tau means lots of turnbacks, but very little through. In fact, if there are evenly many shifts, In fact, if there are evenly many strands, the largest shifts appear for the split diagrams. Diagrams where there was no strands going through as many terms as possible. Just keep that in mind for a moment. Because I also need hours of the food twist. And you start to see where, okay, I'm actually trying to arrange myself so that I'm going to know what to do with. What to do with cables no matter how I train them. This isn't the ending. Okay, but let's just notice that if I know what to do with, let me say this. You know, again, there's some kind of inductive procedure where you can say, if I know how to simplify the full twist, I know how to sort of inductively figure out what happens with these things. And let me just write the shifts so basically, yeah, anyway. So the bond is still the same, but this thing just gets multiplied by k of these. So it's 2k minus 1. And in yellow, this is bad yellow, it's not really often where's a good yellow. And so this is the oh yes, it's still there. Sorry, sorry. Thanks. Okay, there's only a couple minutes left. So Left, so I gotta find the right way to summarize what happens, and the scheme was on you properly. So, in some sense, this is all just to convince you that you could actually work out and count all these shifts, all importantly, sort of the ranges, what kind of shifts can appear. Alright, and if you do that carefully, maybe as I'm erasing, if you do that carefully, you work out, I mean, you can sort of see it based on over there. Sort of see it based on over there. As the twisting rows, as the twisting rows, the far homological end, like the top homological degrees, are entirely made up of with split diagrams. Okay, and this idea, I mean, there's more to it than this, but you sort of work out that these split diagrams are the things that you can see kind of stabilize to build the S1 process. To build the S1 process. That's how you sort of see the S1 process to do it. That's not the focus today. I'm going to try to say something about Planovsky and Lasagna. So this is like a definition or a theorem. Let's say It's really very unfortunate, but to talk about the Scheme Lasagna module, everything, the knot that I'm using is actually the mirror of the knot that I was on my tune in the title. I assume that I have some kind of two-handle body where I just attach something to the mirror of my given knot. Bam. Then, this invariant, this commonal scheme zoning module, I'm going to write like a squiggly equals to say it's related to, or it's, you know, how do you sort of try to compute it. Well, there's some kind of limiting procedure. There's some kind of limiting procedure of Z shift. D shifts of take your knots and the colours. Cable it, there's some fixed alpha, but I think we just ignore it for a moment. There's some fixed alpha. In fact, I think I'm going to say lasagna sub-alpha. There's basically one lasagna for every value. Alpha. There's basically one lasagna for every value of alpha. Okay? And then you start cabling, like from that alpha, you start putting pairs of strands in, more and more. Okay? And you also insert full twists according to the framing. Framing will tell you how to do this. There are shifts as you go. And also, because, you know. What causes anything? You really do have to take this renormalization that I've been putting off till the end. You have to take it in the middle of this limiting this camp. I said in the beginning that there's renormalization after you do everything. When you're doing the lasagna, it kind of gets baked in the middle. Sorry, that was fun. Why did the bell ring? I thought it was. That's why the bell shouldn't have brought it. Okay, there's more to it, unfortunately. You have to take the fixed points under some action that we're going to ignore. The same way we're ignoring the differentials. We're ignoring the limiting procedure. Limiting procedure uses some kind of maps. Okay? Because the reality is basically summary. Use our simplifications and the main trick, I don't want to try to write it all down. I just want to like gesture with my hands. You add some giant cable of a knot and you put some twists in there. Oh, but hey, I know what to do with the twists. I noticed how to simplify. I know what to do with the twists. I know how to simplify them in such a way that I keep track of how many turnbacks were in my different diagrams. Turnbacks are exactly the sort of thing that, in a cabling, I can just pull along the cable and simplify even further. I keep track of all of that. We keep track of all of that. And you learn that sort of the maximum possible Z degree of any one of these things. Okay, totally ignoring anything about this group action, totally ignoring anything about what maps there are between them. Just the maximum possible Z degree of any of these things in here is bounded above by, so well, there's some constant that depends on this alpha that I haven't told you anything about, k, which is. K, which is based on the framing that you chose. Okay, and then there's this value plus alpha plus 2r, that's the number of strands, minus 2 tau times this very curious thing. So And yeah, I'm sorry to rush at the end here. Maybe just let me kind of write down quickly what this bound is. And this is maybe going to feel a little bit like I've cheated you out of something important. Okay, so there's some constant that doesn't depend on R. There's also this thing which does depend on R. And then there's this other term. This is a constant. This CK1 is my notation for the number of vertical tangencies in the all one resolution of the non-K. comes the not k, whatever or not you started with, divided by two. And as soon as you see somebody write something like this down, you begin to understand that, okay, maybe this is going to be related to thirst and fan. Because if this thing was Legendrean, I would replace the word vertical tangencies with cusps. But Kavanaugh doesn't care about cusps. I claim that the real proof really is something about tangents, like tangent points. And it didn't have to be vertical either, but you pick a direction. To be vertical, either, but you pick a direction. Call that this. So, yeah, from my point of view, the fact that this happens to be the Thurston related to the Thurston-Benekin number is a little bit accidental. Okay, so the whole point of this is that if, oh, sorry, minus 2R, this whole thing minus 2R because of this. And so the whole point is that as long as your framing is. As your framing is greater than or equal to, well, if your twisting amount is greater than or equal to this, then this limit, the max Z amount, goes to negative infinity, which is the same that there couldn't have been any homologue as we would. I apologize for going over time today. This is the essentials of what's happening. Okay, so I mean this alpha plus 2r is okay, so here's k alpha plus 2r. Remember, it's a diagram, not just a not out there. Like, I have a not diagram. Not just a knot out there. Like I have a knot diagram. So I have some picture, and I just take that picture and draw alpha plus 2r. So maybe this is alpha, and here's 2r strands, and I just do that. Okay, so that symbol, the bottom here, is just like it's blackboard frame. And then K is adjust blackboard framing by inserting. Just blackboard framing by inserting full twists. It was just, again, like, from a diagrammatic point of view, I think this is the simplest way to keep track of what you've done. Because, again, fortunately or unfortunately, everything is defined in terms of titles. Yeah, so in particular, in a case like it's bothering anybody, k is not derived. Bothering anybody. K is not the Rive. Or sorry, K is not the framing. K is the framing once adjusted by the Rive of the original screen. But also, the number of verticals, the number of cusps is not the Thurston-Benning number. It becomes the Thurston-Benning number after adjusting by Rive. And mirroring. Everything was mirrored. So there's also that that I'm trying to avoid. What's Karl on Screase? It's just this guy. Oh, oh, sorry, sorry. Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry. Of yeah, this should say, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Max z available for any delta within here. Okay, and so, yeah, sorry, sorry, maybe I should say this. The point is that this has to be positive, regardless. It goes to infinity, it's our goes for. No, no, no, no. I'm just saying that, you know, this is some positive number, like. Yeah, yes. And then it can grow as large as you want as R grows. That's right. So then really all that matters is the size of this function. Support the idea that mono-homology should have been defined all along. I mean, somehow, you know, that's like the spectral sequences all go from a mirror. You know, I mean, somehow, like, it seems like the world would be more tidy. I would have been agnostic. Are we still reporting to what? It does appear that for many of these sort of topological. For many of these sort of topological statements, dual appears to be the more natural horizontal. Yeah, right. Like you can go as far back, maybe, as this, but certainly you can just write near this as pleasers. Think like again. Oh, sorry. Did you have a question, please? Okay, thing like again.
