I'd like to talk about some application of phase reduction theory to vortex shedding problem. And so we consider some vortex shedding at low Reynolds numbers. The most famous example is the Kalman vortex street, and its oscillation can be considered as limit cycles. As limit cycles. And as you know, so if the cylinder is oscillating, then the voltage pattern is much different. And in the case of biofluid problems, such as butterfly flight or swimming, in that case, if we consider the whole system of fluid and a driving system of this wing or fins, then Or things, then the total system can be regarded as Limps cycles. And the Limbs cycles is simplified as an oscillator, and its equation is very simplified by this equation, phi dot equal omega, where phi is the phase of the state and omega is the angular frequency. And this phase can be shifted very easily, and I'd like to talk about using a very But using a very simple example. And this is, you are looking at the movie that shows a synchronized metal norm. Two metal norms is on a plate and it can move horizontally. And it's well known that their metal norms are synchronized. And if one of the metal is patterned by this finger, and eventually, of course, it's synchronized again, but it's It's synchronized again, but its phase is easily shifted, as the movie shows. In the case of Kalman's vortex street, if we apply some external force on the flow, then the vortex sharing phase is easily shifted, as schematically shown in this picture. Okay, and potential application of the phase control, phase shift, would be found in the biofluid problems or GFluid. Fluid problems or G fluoride. I'd like to show just one example. This is the dragon flies, hind wing and four wing, and its phase difference between these wings can cause a different amount of total lift. It implies that the phase difference is well controlled, it can generate much lift force without any control. Pauls without any control, any active control. So there are many problems that we can apply this phase shift problem, phase reduction theory, to many kinds. Okay, so the purpose of today's study is focus on the vortex shedding from the stationary object. And I'd like to talk about a brief introduction to the finite reduction theorem. Introduction to the phase reduction theory. And then how to calculate some important function called the phase sensitivity function. And one of my contribution is development of calculation method. And I want to relate the calculated phase reaction, phase sensitive function to vortex dynamics by some examples. So the flow pass cylinder or flow pass plate. Cylinder or flow pass plate. In the last part, I'd like to talk a bit about the optimal external force function for the locking phenomena. We consider some sort of entrainment to the external periodic force and what is the best waveform of external force to achieve some sort of locking phenomena. Okay. Okay. I'd like to. Okay, I'd like to briefly introduce the phase reduction theory. And so to talk, to begin with, we need to define phase. And as data science is now very common in fluid mechanics, many of you know a Kalman vortex street can be represented just by a few modes. And this is an example of the Kalman vortex. The example of the carbon board explode and in using the PCA analysis or POD analysis, which is the same. So, just only two modes represents the many, so the main feature carbon stream. These two fields is two POD modes that represents the flow field and the linear combination can represent this karma. Can represent this Karman box to it. And this magnitude for each mode consider draws some sort of circle, and this is a periodic or limit cycle. In this case, you can define a phase very in a naive way. However, what you consider from now is more general perturbations at any point of space and at any timing of the phase. At any timing of the phase. So we need to define a more systematic way. So we define the asymptotic phase on a limit cycle. This is the phase-based schematic diagram. Not only on the limit cycle, but also any point near limit cycle, near, but of the limit cycle. So we define the phase on the limit cycle by the time. Cycle by the time measured from some certain point defined in some way, it's very easy. But if the point is off of the limit cycle, we can define the phase of this point at this point as a phase on the limit cycle of that particular point such that their difference is converged, the distance converges to zero in the converts to zero in the t go to infinity. In this way, we can define the phase in the phase space. So then after definition of this the phase, and then we can define the very important function called the phase sensitivity function. The phase sensitive function is z is partial derivatives of pi. Partial derivatives of pi with respect to the position in phase space. X is the point in phase space. This function is very important because the phase difference between two points in the phase space can be described by this function. And the phase reaction theory tells us that the system behavior is determined by the phase sensitivity function z. sensitivity function z. For example, if you consider some dynamical system x dot equal to fx, if it has a limit cycle, the system's behavior, limit cycle is represented by this phase equation. If this is part of in some way, then the part of the equation of this phase equation is represented by this function. Represented by this function. Here, you can see the phase sensitive function Z here and external force G. Also, some sort of synchronization programs or interaction between oscillators, then the original equation is described in this way, then this part of the equation is described in this way. Here, you can see the same You can see the same phase sensitivity function here. And after the averaging, this equation is derived as this simple function using gamma. It's called a coupling function defined by in this way. Here also the phase dt function appears. So as I said in the first of these slides, so that this function z determines the system behavior. Behavior. Okay, so the next problem to apply the faint reaction theory to the fluid Borsic shedding problems is how to calculate this function Z and its related problems. And there are several methods, calculate techniques known to calculate Z. And the most simplest one is a so-called direct method. We just, so directory Just the directory part of the system at any, so the degree of freedom, and then wait for a long time. And because this system has a limit cycle, it converges to the limit cycle again, and the phase is shifted from the untabled system. So we can measure the phase shift after convergence. So it's very simple and easy to understand, but it requires a very computation cost because we need ways. Because we need to wait for a long time to converge it. And more sophisticated method is called adjoint method. And this is in this theory, so the Z from the function Z can be calculated as a limit cycle of the adjoint equation in the backward integration. And the Accubion is needed. And the Arcouvian is needed, but in this method, we can reduce computation force greatly, but we require adjoint equation. And we need to calculate the adjoint equation. And not every equation is appropriate for this method. And the third method is my contribution. It's a Jacobian-free project method. In this method, we calculate We calculate Z in the way of the eigenvector associated with the minimum eigenvalue matrix generated from the Partabo system for limit cycle. And in this method, we can calculate the Z in the subspace. And I will talk about in the next slide, but it requires periodic solution and period. But the computation cost is lower than the Is lower than the direct method, which is 1 over n, when n is a period need to convergence. And in this method, we do not need Japan and the George equation, and we only need the time evolution equations. Anyway, so I don't expect all the details, but I published several papers, so please refer to it if you are interested in. Okay, and this, so I'd like to show you some. So, I'd like to show you some examples how it works. And I compared this method with known function of Z in the case of reaction diffusion equation. This is the previous result done by Nakao et al. And this is a calculated result by my method. And this completely the same, and it works well. And I also checked this in. This in the subspace, and this is a case of flow past flood plate. And we show the function z in this here. And I just show you by the effect of the subspace. In this case, the calculation of the whole space gives some distribution z in this way. But even if we calibrate in this small area, the The main feature of this function remains the same. And this is a case where the calculation space can be limited. And also, we can skip some variables such as P to calculate the phase reduction, to calculate the phase safety function, which enables us to reduce the computation. To reduce the computation cost. Okay, this is a way that I propose. And from now on, I'd like to talk about a bit about some applications. And first of all, I'd like to talk about the flows per cylinders. And we solved Navier-Stokes equations, incorporated Navier-Stokes equations. And the Reynolds number is 200. And this is a periodic solution obtained from this. From this calculation. And we show that the flow speed, and we can see the Kalman products as well here. Okay, so now, so in the right of this figure, you can see the distribution of Z, but here, essentially the same, but we changed this Z with the vector Q. As a vector Q, which is so the meaning of the vector Q is as false. So the vector space, so the phase of the original space and so the potable velocity field at the particular point xz and with magnitude u prime, the difference is expressed by the inner product of this vector and u prime. you apply. So this direction implies that the phase difference is more greatly if the perturbation is parallel to Q and its magnitude represents the magnification rate. And this is a way so that I show you the phase sensitivity function in the physical field. In the physical field. And I'd like to talk about how this Q field works. And I'd like to mention briefly what happened in the downstream of the column at the city. So the field, so we picked up in half of the period because this is a kind of symmetry. So we don't need a latter half. And anyway, so the Q field generates Generates some vortex like eddy-dark structure, this swirling field, in the counter-clockwise way, in upper, both in upper and lower side of this cylinder. And in this stage, this vortex generated from the lower part of the cylinder is developing like this. And the vortex generated in the upper cylinder. In the upper field, is so discouraged to. This is a process we see in this period. And this direction causes the encouragement of the vortex generation in the lower part of the flow and discourages the flow in the upper part because their direction, rotating direction is the same. So this perturbation in This perturbation along this line encourages the time evolution from A to B and it causes some field advancing. So we can understand the field of Q as sort of appropriate directional perturbation, two-phase shift. And the next feature of the Q field is an ups. The Q fields is in the upstream region. You can see some sort of AD-like structure in the upstream of this cylinder. Although there is almost very calm or almost straight flow is only observed in the upstream. This is because that the perturbation added to this region, it flows down to the downstream to cause some sort of separation phenomena. Of the separation phenomena. So, as you see, this is standard and this distance can be well approximated to the multiplication of the velocity and period. So, these two features are observed in the Q field. And this can be confirmed when the random number is reduced. When the random number is more small, this BOSIC shedding is Uh, this BOSIC shedding is more so than in some sense mild or not very strongly. And in that case, this field is all become more symmetric with respect to the horizontal line. And this double street goes is just simplified to the single street. Anyway, so using this knowledge, we move on to the analysis. To the analysis of the flow past plate. Here we consider the plate angle of attack with 45 degrees in flow channel and there is a uniform flow here. And you can so you can forget this for a while. And the random number is 200. And here, this, you are looking. You are looking at this movie. This is composer represents velocity field. And you can see what it's sharing is here, right here. And vectors is not velocity field, but the field of Q. So if you see this carefully, if you look very carefully, so the part of it. Very carefully, so the perturbation along Q field encourages generation of this leading edge quote. And you are looking at some sort of strong region in the upstream to cause some separation behavior in the good timing to change. A good timing to change the shift, just change the phase. Okay, so our understanding of in the case of a cylinder can be applied to the analysis of floodplate. Yes, and I'd like to consider some sort of locking phenomena for the external force. And I'd like to briefly explain or review the locking phenomena by external. The roping phenomena by extinct. So you are looking at this oscillator, our metal here, and this plate is oscillating. Here, please consider this plate is moved by some external force as a time of time function f. And in this case, the system is described by this kind of equation. In the case of carbon box street, we are Of carbon dioxide extreme, we apply the external force, time-dependent force, at some point and change the phase of this phase of this vortex shedding or change the separate shedding frequency. In the case of phase equation, this step system can be deduced in this system. Here, psi. Here, ψ is the phase difference between this oscillator and the external pulse, and the governing equation is reduced to this equation. Here, this coupling function gamma is defined by this. And this function, sorry, this equation gives the constant of phase difference can be constant if this phase difference is between. Phase difference is between the maximum gamma and minimum gamma. And in this case, the system is entrained to the external frequency, and it can be called entrainment or local enforcement. And we can draw some sort of famous Arnold term that tells us about the region of entrainment like this. Okay, anyway, so. Okay, anyway, so in the field of flat reduction theory, some optimal problem is solved, optimal wavefall of external force is solved. And the case one is the minimum energy of the external force that enables the local phenomena. We solve the equation for F, function F, such that the energy is minimum under the condition that Rockwick. That locking occurs. And the result is this. And so, in this case, this force field is essentially the proportional to the phase-a-sis function Z or the field of Q that I showed in the previous slides. And the case work to is the maximize the local region. In this case, we consider the problem the energy is. Problem, the energy is constant, but maximize the looking region. In this case, we can solve the optimal force by using sensitivity functions. And we need to determine this psi plus or psi minus. And we can do this using some sort of way. And just I picked up two examples and two examples. And two examples, this force is much different, but both can be a maximized local region. This is just application of the previous theories. And here we want to consider a more practical problem. That is the best position of the application of the external force. Here we consider how the uniform. Uh, we consider as a uniform flow within rectangle, and this pulse oscillates in a sinusoidal way. Okay, we change this position and find the best position for the maximum locking range. Okay, so this is a problem that we consider from now. And okay, to consider this problem, Okay, to consider this problem, we need again so the property of z. And this is a field of phase AC function Q or equivalent to Z. And as you see, this is a very complex spatial temporal features. So the best frequency or best position requires some sort of full decomposition of this field. Of this field. To do this, we applies a Fourier decomposition of Exana force Q and the phase sensitivity function and to consider as a coupling function. This is the sum of the inner product of each mode. So this implies that free decomposition of Z gives us Tells us that the appropriate position or the appropriate according to the mode omega or 2 omega or m omega, something like this. And this is the some, I'd like to show you some results. So the m equals to one case, two case, and on the field of q u so U so q u and field of q b and this is perturbation to u and this is a perturbation to b and because they are so complex numbers so we draw it in a separate way and this arrow is represents complex numbers in the Gaussian plane. So you can see the strong region is different from the U and V or M equals 1, M equals to 2. To two. And because the size of this stone region is very approximately half by one, we determine the size of the rectangle, this size. And so to consider the best position, we determine the size of rectangle, so the half by one, and we only show you the case where the Where the perturbation has only y component. And we change the position of the rectangles and find the maximum of gamma max because this gamma max determines the maximum rocking range. So in the case of m equals to one, the maximum position is downstream of the plate. And on the other hand, in the And on the other hand, in the case of M equals 2 and the base position, the maximum gamma appears in the upstream of this plate. And these two are much different, but so if we consider the uniform force within rectangle region, this can be different. And I think this is interesting because the previous works that consider the point-wise. That considers the point-wise external force, the best position is concluded as a separation point. But in my case, because we consider the finite size of the external force, then this position is not near the plate and downstream, upstream. We can consider, we can calculate the anode. We can calculate the Arnold standard here, and this black line is the prediction theory, so phase reduction theory. And this blue rectangles represents the region of the local to the external force. And this prediction will do very well. And in this case, 2 omega t, it shifts if the amplitude is larger, but it's Larger, but it's very matched with sort of a severe car prediction when epsilon is amplitude is small. Okay, this is the end of my talk. So I focus on the phase of the work shedding and this information can be obtained by a phase reaction theory. And we show you some application in the case of opposite shedding after seeding and plate. After sitting in the plate. Okay, thank you very much for your kind attention.
