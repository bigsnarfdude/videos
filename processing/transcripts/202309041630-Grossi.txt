So, first of all, thank you very much for the invitation. So, it's my first time in China for a week or so. It's a great pleasure being here. So, thank you. I'll be frank by the title. So, today I would like to speak about symplectic automorphism of hypercalor manifolds, and I would like to show you how to exploit some techniques of stofetting. Of second to definitely prove that there is a sort of visibility for a syntactic automorphism of hypermanifold of a different type and a different type. So I will say some words about this. And let me say that this is a this talk is based on a joint work, on two joint works. So on a joint work with the first one about audit six. Or district with Unorahi and Vignani and Onanaba's joint work with Luca Du Renzano Unorati and Benali. Okay, the first one is about obesity and the second one is about The second one is about design, but let me say that the techniques that we use in the second one about design are actually the ones that involve surfacing. So, I would like to show you something about how to prove the definition with the results of auditing. And okay, so let me start saying that for me, X and I together an irreducible homomorphic symplectic manifold, and I will denote by sigma X. By Figmax, the symplectic form. And I would like to say what is a symplectic automorphism. So the definition let's x phi hs an automorphism of x finite we say that f is a sync if If the induced reaction of sigma X, the full battery is the identity, okay, so the action of sigma X is the identity preserved by X. And okay, let me say that today I would like to focus on absolute black polytomosis monologue 10 and OD6, but I think that makes sense to recall a little bit what we know for the other deformation examples. So let me go there. So let me go there. So let me start with the here with the list of examples known so far of Atterfeller up to deformation. And here I recall what we know about complex equal domorphism, what is possibly finite. And here I take the case A, and the results are due to this is the first one that studied automatically. The study of some of our systems itself is mainly focused on the abelian therapy. So the abelian and later we have some results due to MCRI that classify all the roots. So finite of simplexic automorphism of two trees. And let me say that actually the symplexic groups for Symplexic groups for doing results of Macai are actually subgroups of the Macier group. So, actually, there is this kind of relation. Whenever you have a complexity group of automorphism, which is finite of a C2, then you have this correspondence with a subgroup of the master group. For the other deformation types, let me recall some stuff about KPN. Makes sense to mention also here, mention Kammer and Muga. Of here mentioned Hammer and Mugardin. Let me also say that for K3, also, more than Turin and Mukaya, I want to mention also Ciao and Kondo and Garblagnatisarti and Morrison for some other classification with respect to Africa's theory also and other results that are parallel to this one. Samre Mungardi for CT2 and the prime order. And the prime order and then to an imaginary group nice and there is also results due to Eudrex and Mongari for Kiana. For k3n where n is greater than 2. And actually, there is a result of Mungardi, which is in the same flavour of the one of Mukai, that's a construct of the subgroup of the K3N as a subgroup of the Conway group. So there is this relation as for the K of K3, but for the case of K3N. So they're quite similar. For Watson Sen, they'll derive similar. And the derived schemas, we do not have a complete result, but we address some characterization in terms of Lafayette's theory that are due to Mongardi and Bandel for n equal to so these results are lattice directive results and for n greater than two And for n greater than two, we do not have that in Greenwich there as well classification, but let me say that actually the techniques that we can use for n greater than 2 is the same that we need for n greater than 2. And for Audi 6 and Audi 10 are the results that I mentioned before. Okay, so the two going to work that I said here. So let me say now how to save these results. Okay, so the results about automorphism of are rigidity results. And this phenomenon is some slight difference with respect to the other reformation types. So the first theorem is about is of a ventana mitzvunori state that. Say that letter F be an alternate mani called formation type of Japan. So we are just fixing the formation type of X and let F minus one of the m of X in plastic and finite then F F is the identity. Okay, so definitely where there are no other automobile sigma on the detainees except the identity, symplexic and finite. And the second theorem, which is of myself, Moratio Liani, say that any symplexic automorphism. Of finite order on a manifold of opposite types acts pretty on the Bovil Bogomodo 5 lapses. Our H2O act with the Bohr-Bogomodel of GGP4. So the results are quite state in a different way, but let me say that we can retrace the first one actually in the same way as the second one. And this is due to the fact that there is a representation mass of an alpha seismometer isometries. And this representation mass. And this representation map is well known, and it is invariant of this information. And we know the kernel of this representation map by result. Now I will tell you. So it's a marking, which is an isometry. An isometry between our certain integral commodity lattice with the Movie-Logomodo form and here abstract latest L is an isometry and we call X with this isometry a market pair we will know that there exists a representation mass goes from a vibration It goes from a birational transformation, but most exactly over from ontologism of X to the isometrical with the natural action that you can imagine, which is the converse, and you conjugate the other isometry. And these representational markets that I call the lower star is just related to the deformation type of X. Okay, so whenever you stick to the Type of X. Okay, so whenever you speak to the formation type of X, the behavior of this representation map is known for all the deformation types. And in particular, there is this result of Mongardi and Bandel, which says that the kernel of equal world star is equal to the identity if If X is the deformation type of object. Okay, and let me say here, moreover, the terminal of either well star is isomorphic to a finite group with 256 symplectic involutions if X is the formation type of DC. On DC. Okay, so the kernel is trivial in the case of a new panel. And so actually, again, so actually you can state theorem one saying that if you have a symplectic automotive, then this symplectic automotive is in the kernel, so actually it's a free derivative homology. Structurally the commodity. So the two results are, you can say in the same way. And the goal now is to show you how to prove that theorem one is true using sperp activity. So let me show you how do we get this result. Okay. Okay, so before let me say some key results where L is our lattice, we denote by L G, which G at the top, the invariant lattice, which is the set of D and L such that V of V is equal to V equals V. And the co-invariant lattice is defined as the orthogonal complement of the invariant mistake. This is the co-invariant lattice and the other one, the co-invariant one. And the theorem, the current theorem. In a way which is much more convenient for the last purpose. So the idea is the following. So X is an interstellar deformation type Aussie 6 or Aussie 10. Or you can induced, which means the image of the representation map, the financial report, is induced by a group of simplest. Automal signals. Okay, so the co-invariant last year, as I mentioned before, is the negative definite. These are the sublasts of our second integral homology lost. And we have that these co-invariant laxis as an anti-interception with the subset of wall device. With the set of wall divisor for RG6 or RG10. Okay, so what is the set of wall divisors for RG6 and RG10? So these wall divisors actually, roughly speaking, are a way to characterize the Keller summer inside the positive cone and it determines the wall of the Keller cone. So whenever you ask that this intersection is equal to the empty step, behind this. The MT set behind this there is the fact that actually the Keller Trump is fixed by this isometry, and so actually you can say using Osborne Perelli that this isometry comes from an alchomorphism. And this is one of the results that we use to prove that actually you have just the identity as a morphism of what you can. And the other one is a result of eyebrows. The other chemosons that need The other humans that we need the following. So before I introduce lattices, so lambda 24 is in each lattice is the unimodular. Unimodular, I explained what last beginning unimodular lattice of range negative definite of range 24 without roots. So those are actually the in our last history. Our last is lambda 24 of square minus 1. And let me say that unimodular here means that the discretion group is which is lambda 24 dual portion by lambda 24. This is a finite abelian group and this guy is equal to the A. So whenever you have elastis, you can associate a finite abelian group, which is the discriminant group, A D I mean the UR. Maybe I have to move the nuclear just to be called. So, if L is elastic, you can say that we define by L sharproaches differentation, which is a finite above. And you say that in the modular means, it means that after this guy is equal to the identity. And another last piece is lambda 125, which is the even unimoval. Which is the even unimodular lattice of signature 125, which is actually up to eyeometry, a copy of U and two copies of EH minus one, which is the last is associated with the dinking diagram EH. Okay, so the Okay, so the theorem that I want to mention is the following we've resulted L E remove. D. We need a lattice and D as a group of isometry values of isometries. We have some assumptions, so which we need the loop x. Group acts freedom on the discriminant group. Okay, so whenever you have an isomic, you have an induced reduction of this discriminant group. And here you ask that the induced reduction is trivial. And such a destination, you ask moreover that the co-invariant last is negative definite and the And contains no roots, so no vectors of square minus two. If there exists a primitive embedding of this co-invariant lasting, which means that the co-kernel is social free inside the last two that I have introduced here, there before. Then This group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the isometry of the Leech Latvis lambda 24. And moreover, the co-invariant of the our co-invariant lattice L G is isometric to the co-invariant classes of lambda. The co-invariant losses of lambda 24. Okay, this is the result of Augre. And I have to mention also three other authors that are gathered here, and Volfaso. So these three guys found this theorem, but for Theorem, but for completely different reasons. So they are not related to hypercalor and to this kind of problems. And actually, these results will be absolutely useful for us to get our conclusion for Augustana. Let me see. Let me show you how definitely we can guess. We can put together this result and find a way to prove the visibility of a design. Of a design. So it was seemed to introduce some notion of just one notion of perfecting. So let me say that L is the last thing. I need that. This is for this net and I fix the ventilator. And I fix the variance equal to 1. Then I define move as the minimal normal. This is the minimal norm. These other guys, which is actually called the packing gradient in spare packing theory, is equal to this. Is equal to this number, and this is just let me call the fascinating values. All this stuff are related to the problems of a range of sphere in a Euclidean dimensional space. So it's not related, it's also related to Lactic theory, but in this way, I want to recall these tools since the one that I use. So in the ratio. Is the ratio which is delta is the strength of density of our latest cells? So, all these subnet cells actually on graphics that you choose, but there is a result which is the key result for us to get. So, there exists an upper bound that I call the BN for our. For our delta, if the rank of the lasses is less or equal than 24. So, this upper bound was found by at the beginning by Rogers in actually 54 and was computed by Leach later. So, we have actually a number to bound the sum of 3, this delta, whenever the last is at the rand, which is less than equal than 24. rank which is less or equal than 24 and this is not bad since the you know that for the tan the last is actually rank 24 so we have a list of the annual for every annual and we use it now it's just five minutes and i give you the sketch of the tool sketch of the proof uh theorem one Theorem one is the one about object 10, and okay, so you can suppose that the induced action by contribution that G which is the action in homology of F, so what I denote before by this guy, so this is an isometry, okay, of our lattice, it's not the identity. Or is different from the identity, and then we look for a contradiction with the intersection of LG, so of the co-invariant losses, with the wall divisor of a gamma space equal to the empty set. So definitely. Equal to the empty set. So definitely, we hope to find in the co-invariant last divide of course in order to exclude the capacity, in order to get the unit possibilities that give the identity. And here we get, we fix n, which is the rank of the co-invariant losses. We have a characterization of this wall divisor for all the time, and this is due to Mongardi and Honorati. And this And these divisors are, let me say, vectors in L of square minus 2 union the set of vectors in L of square minus 4 and vectors in L of square minus 6 and divisibility. And the vector T L of 1 minus 24 and the visibility 3. So this is the characterization in terms of query visibility for this whole device or for a design. Let me say that using the proposition using the theorem of Using the theorem of Audrey, you can show so you have that. Let me say that G for AUD is the isometry of a value. We have two possible actions for the limited action on the string and group of our detain, which is isomorphic to Z over CZ, because we call that H2OX. H2X project n is a unimodular part plus H2 minus one. So this guy is a finite group. So G acts on the guy as a plus or minus the identity. So we have two different possible actions on the discriminant group. So for the first case, so G F as the identity, let me say that I will not give you the details, you use definitely. Give you the details, you use definitely the proposition, the theorem of Eulb that I mentioned before, and you prove that the co-invariant lattice is the co-invariant lattice for lambda 24, which is the niche lattice. And Hernandez computed these lattices, and we know that there is a vector for square minus four inside. But this is not possible, okay, because we assume that capital G is a symplastic action, so you cannot have world divided inside in the co-invariant, so there is this. Co-invariant. So there exists a vector V in the co-invariance of square minus four, but this is a contradiction because G is simple and you cannot have world divisors. So you cannot have this situation. For a G, just X known trivially. So as minus the identity on the display and group, you can assume. You can assume, let me say that's for sure if you have an action that is not that using minus identity, it's an even order. And actually, without loss of generality, you can assume that V is an involution. And you prove here using the argument of surfacting that this is not possible. So you have now an evolution that acts non-freely already ungrouped. Already took a look at the market. And the situation now is the following. So this an involution that acts on the discriminant group as a minus k. Whenever you have the co-invariant, you know that there is this of the interval. We know that there exists a primitive embedding by general fact system L. And this primitive embedding is equivalent to the data of an anti-egeometry between H and H prime that are H is a subgroup of the Dictionary group of the invariant plastic and H prime is a subgroup of the Dictionary group of the co-invariant one. And this is an anti-A. One and this is an anti-isometry. So, whenever you have this situation, you can get actually some information about ancient times. And what do you know is that you can prove that our H is a final group, so which is some copies of the radical two, so it's two elementary, and actually that H prime is a subgroup, so which is a strictly Group, which is strictly smaller than the swimming group of the coinbariant classes. And so, actually, the index of this data here is simply greater than one. Then, here there is the argument of a square packing that you want to use. So, you want to find an upper bound for the terminal of L. Of a gene, which is the determinant of the co-invariant classes. And you can prove that this is equal to the index, so this index here times H prime. And you know that for other reasons, you can get that this number is not just greater than one, but is actually equal to three with a simple formula. And so here you get that this determinant has an upper bound, which is Has an upper bound which is related to the index of H prime, which is actually this is also has a subgroup where they are the same because this is an anti-hydrometry, isomorphic as groups, and so this is upper bounded by three times two dr. This length here is the one of H and due to the fact that L has to be Now you can guess that N, let's say, the rank of a Z, and we know that this guy is less than 21 since the signature of L is 21 in our case for the turn. Then this L, which is the length of H, I mean, the related to the The related to the order of our loop is less or equal than the two length of our L G, sorry, the invariant square. This is the length, which means the number of generators of the two elementary parts of this group. This is the subgroup H of this guy, and this is less or equal to the rank of the invariant clusters. And the guy is 24 minus m for the same reason. For the same reason, we get that the group protein subgroup of the coin variant is less or equal to the rank, which is actually equal to n. So our determinant of Lg is bounded from above by 3 times 2 to the L, which is less or equal than 2, we expect it 3 times 2 to the mean between 24 minus 10 and n. Minus n and n. And this is the upper bound. So for the lower bound, use for packing. For the lower bound, you say that since the full invariant doesn't intersect set of volume, this implies that for sure the minimal norm of our lattice, let me say not exactly the lattice L G, which is negative definite, but of L G minus one. Is negative definite buttons minus one, which is positive definite, has to be like greater or equal than six because all dividers for a design are vectors of square minus two and minus four. And this is an even lattice. So you have this property. And actually, using the formula that I mentioned before about the density center, you can prove that this guy has to be less than greater or equal than 3 to the n, 2 to the n and And here you use the bound that I mentioned before of leap. And so this is the lower bound. So actually our determinant have this lower bound and this is the upper bound. The point is that now if you check, let me stop here. If you check with the for all n between two and twenty-one, you get that definitely this is not possible because these numbers have to be. Because these numbers have to be is not there. I mean, the lower bound are greater with respect to the upper bound, and so you get that definitely the unit possibility is n equal one. And with a simple argument, it shows that this is the case. So, definitely, there's no way to have co-invariant classes. And so the dash incident. So, I stop here. Thanks.
