   This talk is taken by the book, the known book, Open Quantum System by Petrucci and Brau, I think. So I'm I'm So I'm starting with the definition an open quantum system. So let S open quantum system, which is coupled to another quantum system, B, calling the environment. The space of state H is the Hilbert space, combined system S plus B. This space is given. This space is given by the tensor product of the Hilbert space associated with the systems S and B. And is this anyway? The total Hamiltonian of world system is given by question one. Where H H S is a Hamiltonian of the open system S, H B is a Hamiltonian of the environment, and H E is the Hamiltonian interaction in something like that. The environment and the system, and this is the system couple, and this is the H So, the dynamics of S induced by the Hamiltonian of the total system is often referred to as the reduced system dynamics, and S is also called the reduced system. The observables referring to S are. Are of this form where if the state of the total system is described by some density matrix rho, then the expectation values of all observable acting on the open system Hilbert is in this form where This form where this is the partial trace over S, the space S. Okay, this is not the issue. So we use rho S to the reduced system, the reduced density matrix of the open system and the equation motion. The equation motion for the reduced density matrix is obtained by taking partial trace in this way. So we are working in this region. This is a commutative engine diagram. That uh pro s pro s is the reduced dynamic in the space S and rho B is a thermal Thermal state in state in the space B. So under unitary evolution, we obtain this and the trace. If we take the trace, partial trace, we obtain this, the reduced dynamic. Use the dynamic. Yeah, so this is notation. So let's start with S system S. This system is weakly coupled to the bath P. The Hamiltonian of the world system is given by this equation. Again, the Hamiltonian H S is the Hamiltonian of system S. Hamiltonian of system S and H B, Hamiltonian of system B and H I describe the interaction between both systems. So in the interaction picture fundamental equation, we have this equation, the interaction Hamiltonian H O is given by Is given by this equation. The form integral of equation phi is given by this, where we are considering this Hamiltonian Hi. In order to solve this equation, we have to make some tricky from both from From both from equation six and five, remember, six and five. And after taking partial trace over the space B, we have the following. Here we have assumed that the initial state is such that the interaction doesn't the interaction doesn't generate any dynamic in the bath. That is the That it's the partial trace of this commutator equals zero. Okay, we want to solve this equation. The right-hand side of this equation still contains the density operator of the full system. In order to obtain a close equation of motion. A closed equation of motion for the dynamic reduced process. We assume that the interaction is weak such that the influence of bat is small. This is a key statement. We might treat the bad as approximately constant and Approximately constant and write the for the total density operator of this form. Yeah. This is an assumption. Then we obtain a closed integral differential equation for the density operator rho s in this form. So okay, this equation is This equation is so hard to handle as the dynamic at time t depend on the state of the system in all previous time. So the question of motion can be broken into a time local by replacing this row S by this row S but in the time E. So um this question is not yet a Markovian master question. Yet, a Markovian master question equation and doesn't guarantee the conservative to conserve positivity of the density matrix. So we have to make this assumption. We substitute S by T minus S. You can think the parameter S as indicating how far we go back. Indicating how far we go backwards into the time to account for memory effects, which can be characterized time scale tau B, over which correlation in the back the space B decay. In the Markov approximation, these memories effects are short-lived and therefore the integrand decays very quickly for S greater than greater than the time tau so we can replace the upper bound in the previous equation by infinity and obtain a markovian equation in this form these two approximations are usually usually called the the bohr markovian approximation however they still don't However, they still don't guarantize that the resulting master equation generates a quantum dynamical semigroup. So in order to obtain this equation, we can, we will write the interaction Hamiltonian on this form where the operators where the Emitting operators A alpha and B A alpha and B alpha only act on the system and bath respectively. Suppose we have already diagonalized the system Hamiltonian, HS. So we know its agent values, epsilon, and its projectors onto agent states, capital P, epsilon, pi. Then we can project the operators. Then we can project the operators A alpha on subspace with a fixed energy difference omega. So we have this formula. Since the agent vector of H S form a complete set, we have this relation. Okay. So, we can write the interaction Hamiltonian on this way. This is the adjoint. By using this relation and its Hermitian concugate, we can write the interaction Hamiltonian in the interaction picture in this form. In this form. So here we have introduced the interaction picture operator of the bat in this way. So this term, this term, but if we insert this equation, this equation Okay. If we insert this equation to the Markovian master equation, we obtain the following. After some computations, we obtain this form. So we have used the one-side Fourier transform with this notation. And for this omega, when these omega are closest to each other, we can write this term in this form. The secular approximation is then referred to as the omission of the terms with these different omegas. I mean this term. This is the known secular approximation. Yes, so we have this equation. This master equation can be cast into a little Can be cast into a little limbla form for this. We split real and imaginary parts of the coefficient gamma and we obtain this equation. So finally, after do this, we finally arrive at the interaction picture master equation in this form, where the lambda Hamiltonian HLS commute with the system Hamiltonian in this form. system Hamiltonian in this form okay this this equation is in the is in this form we can diagonalize the coefficients of the previous equation and obtain the Limblan form for the dynamics finally a summary What have you done? What I have do. The interaction doesn't generate any dynamics in the back. This is by this equation and the condition draw T approximate with this tensor product. Remember. Tensor product. Remember that rho D is high state of the coupled system. The second approximation is the Markovian approximation in which the quantum master equation is made local time by replacing the density matrix, this density matrix, at the retarded time S with a With that, at the present time, rho is IT. And finally, in the rotating way approximation, rapidly oscillation terms proportional to this term, exponential of this term, for different omegas are negligible. The example is the following. Example is the following: a two-level system damped by a bath of harmonic oscillation. The Hamiltonian is given by this equation. We have the polymetric and the interaction Hamiltonian is this. Okay, I'm gonna ask this formula. The decay rates are given by this formula. This is not this is not correct. It's not true. Okay. And finally, we have this equation, but the example, this equation have the form Markov. For Markovian mastery question. And okay, this is the book and it's all
