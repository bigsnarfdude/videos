Okay, thank you very much. And thanks to the organizers for their invitation. It's a pity we cannot go to Benfu, beautiful place. And today I'm going to talk about Neapolitics Poland for a special class of dynamic systems is called quasi-periodic shielding cosine. Quasi-periodic shooting co-cycles. So it's a small survey. So it's based mainly based on two papers with Ningrigo, Yi Chen Wang, and Xing Chao. And the Co-cycle, it's a special kind of dynamic systems. We are interested in this Co-cycle and one frequency, mainly one frequency, and sometimes. In one frequency, and sometimes we will say something about multi-frequency. So, one frequency case, that is the base, it's a rotation on the circle, and the fiber is of two dimension. And the matrix here is of this spatial form. We call this kind of Schudinger cosycles. So, Schudingercles. So, shooting cosycus can contain three parameters. The first one is r is called frequency, and e is energy. V we call it potential. So we will assume alpha is irrational. So this is why we call it partially periodic. And we assume the potential V is real periodic. Periodic, we will consider the continuous skies, we will not consider the even the small skies, we will not consider the firework potential and with discontinuity and we consider the good potential. Okay, for this kind of cycles, certainly you can Kynemical cycles, certainly you can define the so-called DR plus volume, and it's defined on this standard way. And this is two-dimensional, so there are this is the maximum the appropriate volume. The other one is the negative of this L. And so I think you all know this. And why people can see. And why people consider this kind of cosycle because it's closely related to the shooting operators, quite spiritual shooting operators. Here in the red one, the red ones is quite spiritual shooting operators. In fact, the cosycle, the shooting of cosy we consider is in fact the eigenvalue equation of this operator. So E is. Operator. So E is integer. So one operator corresponding to a family of cycles parametrized by E. And if you fix the alpha and V. And the first thing I want to say is if you can fully understand the cosycles, this family of cosycles, then that will give you a full understanding. That will give you a full understanding of this operator. And the operating sponge relates to almost everything in the spectrum theory of this operator. So you know, so the application pollen can be used to characterize the spectrum. And for example, zero dioplastic pollen corresponding to AC spectrum. Corresponding to AC spectrum and positive Liophris Polland relates to Anderson localization to pure to point spectrum. And also, Soda's formula is related to the integrated density of states. And maybe also the Dioplane's formula also related to contour spectrum homogeneity and the first of dimension. Mentioning. So here is not very clear. Still need to be developed. And for focus, what kind of problem we are interested in? The first one is if it is zero or positive. So as I said before, it's corresponding to if the spectrum is continuous for the operators or point. point so zero or positive and how to compute compute the up exponent usually give echo cycle it's very difficult to compute the exactly compute the uh the the the the the up exponent but for some special cases it's it's it's it can be done and uh also if you can estimate it to give a right Estimated to give a rougher value of this exponent. Another issue is the continuity. So if you perturb the cosine inhibitor, if the neoprosponder continuously responds to the perturbation. So this is a very important property of or property of neopropho exponent exponent and if you already have a continuity uh if if it is hooder continue if even better if it can can be small and hooder is a bit a bit better than than than continuous and so uh in my talk i will uh mainly uh I will mainly concentrate on these two problems. And certainly, also, it's an issue to get if when you get some information about the neoprexpon, try to say something spectra theory, or if the model comes from quantum physics, try to say something that physicists are interested in. So, Uranus that is. So Urani, that is this for the for some spatial models comes from from physics. And we are particularly interested in which properties of potential and the frequency alpha, we have said Kosaika depends on V, alpha and E, which properties of potential V and frequency are alpha and And frequency alpha and energy influence the continuity and the Oda continuity of these cycles, and in which manner it influences continuity. So we try to understand this. So now I talk about first talk about the continuity. There are some basic facts, not only for Shudingo cosycle. For SL2 cosycers, they are the following. First, Lyabis following is non-negative because our matrix is in SL2, so the determinant is one. So the maximum neoplaton cannot be negative, but it could be zero. And also, And also, this neoprene volume is up semi-continuous. That means if you perturb the equipment, the neoprene cannot jumper, but can drop. And then you will see up semi-continuous implies continuous at a generic co-cycles. Especially, it is continuous at the It is continuous at the cycles with zero Lyophole. So, because the zero is the minimum, it's in the bottom, so it cannot be dropped. So, it's here is always continuous. And also, it is continuous at the uniformly hyperbolic cycles. I didn't define that. I suppose you know that. It's even analytical at uniformly have body cross cycles. At uniformly hyperbolic cycles. So, the only issue is here is the only non-trivial case is the continuity of the optical spoil at non-uniformly hyperbolic cycles. That means which is not uniformly hyperbolic, but the appropriate is positive. So actually, this This Niabilan behavior is quite complicated. It is sensitively depends on many things. It depends on the base dynamic skill. We can just consider the rotation, rigid rotation on torus. Base can be, for example, torus, allosaur on torus, or symbolic dynamic systems. If the base is chaotic, it's random, then urine. Random, then urine the Nyapus bond is continuous. But if the base, the dynamics in the base is less regular, less random, like the rotation, like the irregular rotation, then it's more complicated. Then the diabolical sensitively depends, in this case, sensitive depends on the geometry of the The geometry of this matrix, in Schrodinger cosycles, is sensitive, depends on the geometry of the potential. And also it depends on the smoothness of this matrix function A. And also, it depends on the arithmetic property of frequency alpha. And And in some cases, there are some competition among those facts. For example, if alpha is not very good, it's new media and the metric is very small or is less small, alpha is very good, then the result may be different. So now let's first tell you a negative result for the A negative result for the continuity that is discontinuity in the space of C0 cycles. So, this is a result of Fermi Bouquet. And let us fix the irrational R, then treat the Neoplatonic Poland as a function in C0 space, in this metric space, this metric space. This metric space and alpha is fixed, give a metric here, and you get a drive exponent. And we that prove this is never continuous at any non-uniformly abolished cross cycle. Offset at zero the opposite point and at uniformly abolished cross-years is always continuous. The non-trivial place is non-uniformly hyperbolic. uh hybrid case in this case in this space it's it's it's it it's never continuous that means if you if this space is too big this c0 space is very big if this space is too big it cannot be continuous this area cannot be continuous no matter how how good alpha is so uh so in this case alpha is irrelevant case alpha is irrelevant and then the other side is is if it's if we consider the the the the this the this Liablo exponent in in the space of analytic cosycles then this this this space is much smaller than C0 this analytic space then uh bogan jet miskaya and skya cost lower Sky across lower shooter, the proof. Actually, Neop exponent is continuous at this space for all irrational. That means if you restrict the space is small, here is in restricted space is analytical. So this space is small, then it is always continuous, no matter how bad alpha is. So it's also alpha is. Is so it's also alpha is irrelevant, and then uh the next question is: how about in C infinite space or in finite small space? So if it is continuous in the space of C infinity quasi-periodical cycles, so this is a natural question, and there are some results on. Results beyond analytical space. So the first one is there are some results, positive results in Jevre space. So Javier function is a special class of C infinity function. So it's defined this way. A function, C infinity function is said to be new Jevre. be new jevry if it is uh if it's direct derivative derivatives can be can be controlled this way by the main by this one factory as factory to the power new nu is bigger than one if nu is one this is the definition of analytic function so new is if new is bigger than one then uh uh if if there are this kind of control then There are this kind of control, then we call this function new jewellery. So if new is very close to one, then this function is very close to analytic function. If new is very big, it's far from analytical function. However, this kind of function is a subclass of C infinity, where C infinity function, there's no control. It's a different. It's differentiable for any S, but no control. So, if you introduce a CD over normal, then this kind of new Jeffrey function forms a balloon space. And there are a positive result due to service claim. If you choose V in the Java space G nil with nu smaller than 2, Smaller than two. And also, he needed to assume alpha is definitely. In this case, Nioplus tolerant as a function of energy of E is continuous. So here, nu is assumed to be smaller than two. If there is this kind of restructuring, if new is bigger than two, then I claim also. Nick, Klan also got some result. He can prove if the potential V is very big. So if the potential is lambda V, with very big lambda, and if this V is potential V satisfies some known degeneracy condition. And also any delay CMR5 Stefanine, this case, this LE is still continuous. Is still continuous. So that means for in Jeffrey space, g nu nu is after new, there are some quite many new such that the neoprestolin is continuous. And at the big end, I mean the space, the big end. And this kind of non-degenerate condition is an open dense condition. And so, many ways you can say this Java space is not far, it's not far from an analytical space. And actually, there are examples of continuity even in C2 space. So, this is a result by Y and John. And that probe for there are particular C2 potentials. Two potentials, to speak, cosine like that at a geometric condition on the potential. They also assume alpha is Stefan. Now, if you choose alpha, it's simpler. I mean, the geometry is simple and big, and alpha is Diefantin, and fix that, then Nioplax Holland is the continuous function of energy E. So that means analyticity, even close to analyzing. Analyticity, even close to analyticity, is not essential, it can be replaced by the other properties of potential. So, this is the result for cosycles outside the continuum. But you know, you must have some must assume some smoothness for the potentials because C0 is not. Because C0 is not true in C0 space, it's not continuous. So some kind of smoothness is necessary, but the minimum of smoothness is issued. We want to know. It depends on what. This is a summary. You see, in the two extreme places, the extreme small space is. Small space is always continuous, and in the biggest place, C0 is always discontinuous. In the middle, you need to need some additional assumptions. Here, they all assume the R517. And okay, so in the in the middle spaces. So, in the in the middle space, it's not C0 and C omega, then some arithmetic properties of alpha and the geometry condition or smallest condition of potential will end into game. So, we need to consider that this and now the question is: so there are some possible results, then you can naturally ask if the You can naturally ask if the Liapis Poland always continues in C infinity space, if alpha is Diffantine, then the above evidence support this question has positive answer. And for people in family with KM, Family with KM, you know, in KM theory, the first result was proved by Kermar Goff. They proved the result in analytical space. And technically, it seems he used the analyticity of the systems. And then, you know, the Mosul's contribution is saying that, okay, and the knitted city is not essential. Not essential, sufficiently small, it's okay. So, if you compare that result with this one, you have some reason to conjecture this continuity result is true in C infinity space. But unfortunately, this is not true. We have a count example. So, we construct the county example for bounded type alpha. bounded type alpha bounded type alpha is that means what good and mean is a bounded type many many so this is uh i will not explain this this is a very good uh erration offer and then we can construct a matrix even a shielding matrix uh c infinity such that neopolitics pollen is discontinuous at this matrix that's That's this matrix. That means if you perturbed a needb, then the neophone pollen may have a big jumper, a big drop, dropped collapsed. And moreover, we can prove, we can find some C infinity co-cycles with a very bigger Neaplex polynomial. Very bigger neoplaspolent, but this cocycle can be approximated by cocycles with zero neoplux poland. That means neoplaton, positive diopsy polland cocycles is not an open set in C increte space. Okay. And again, not back to the claims. Back to the claims result. Claim perf for fixed v in g nu, nu is smaller than two. If you assume the frequency is definite, then L is continuous. It's continuous in E. And actually, it's not difficult to prove. In fact, this neoprolovic poll is also. Profit spoiler is also continuous in V, in the potential V, in if V moves in G nu, new smaller than two. Again, we need to assume alpha is Diffantine. Okay. And then we can construct this constructor cosycles in G new with new as big. With nu is bigger than two, so that the Diaplespond is discontinuous at this at this cross cycle. So here this is the technical assumption. We assume alpha is bounded type. So this is a technique. We believe this is irrelevant. So it should have count examples for all irrational. Examples for all irrational R, but we have not do it, we cannot do it. Then, uh, then put them together, you see G2 is a transition space for the continuity. That means if the space is bigger than G2, it's not continuous. Are the people online still there? I assume it's fine. Wait, is it me or is there a problem? No, I think it's it's his connection was parsed. I think it's coming back. You're muted. Can you hear me? Now we can, but we didn't hear you for a minute or two. Okay, no, it's okay. Okay, yeah, no, okay, okay, okay, now it's okay. And then you will see, okay, if If the space is smaller than g2, then it's always continuous if you assume alpha is definitely. So you see, so it's quite interesting why this G2 is a transition space. We have some reason, even when you consider one dimensional cross-cycles, G2 is in some sense different. is bigger than two and mu is smaller than two is uh is different okay so this space is a little spatial for for this problem okay now uh actually uh there are still quite some uh some uh problems uh remain the first problem is we we uh so we didn't construct a Then construct the context numbers for any irrational frequency. We construct the context numbers for bounded type alpha. In fact, it seems that for bounded type alpha is the most difficult place to produce discontinuity. So for New Vidian alpha, maybe it's more easy to produce discontinuity, but Discontinuity, but technically, we cannot prove that. And also, we didn't have an example of a potential way such that the Neapolitan foreigner is discontinuous in E, in energy E. That means you perturb the E so that the Neapolitan have a big drop, a big amount. A big amount, and we can only turn the potential. And you see, the previous result proved the continuity for G nu with nu smaller than two, but the result assumes alpha is dampening. So, if alpha is not defined, if there are counterexample, we guess probably, probably, yes, in case. Probably, yes, in case alpha is very new, and so I'm not so sure, but this is the issue. This is a problem. We I'm happy to know the answer. And also, we conjecture that even we have constructed the discontinuous cosycers, we still believe there this neoplaton in C infinity space is. Fallen in C infinitive space is continuous in the most place of this space. Maybe it's in an open dense set of C infinities space. ARA is continuous. Certainly we need to add here. So we assume alpha is different thing. For alpha is not different thing, maybe it's not true. And it's better if you could give a criterion. So that means you can give something or so, for example, derivatives, non-direct degeneracy condition on V, and it can be verified so that if V satisfies this kind of condition, then it is continuous. It is continuous. And for big V, for big for big lemma, for big potential, we could use the number of critical points and maybe acceleration. But for in analytic case, if you can see the small scale, so we need to generalize the acceleration to this is a To this is a concept in Hawidas global theory to smooth case that define acceleration for analytic function. And if there are some analogous thing in small case, this is a question. And okay, I mentioned those questions. And now I switch to the Now I switch to the Hooter continuity. Okay. Hooder continuity certainly is better than continuous and better than continuous. So most of the results so far are restricted to the analytical category. And you know, for small potentials, for small potential, Small potential, generally, the continuous is not an issue because there is no uniformly harmonic cosycles there and at zero place and zero and uniform cycles is always continuous. But for HODA continuous in the place, the potential is small, it's also an issue. So it's not trivial. It's not, yeah, you need to prove. It's not, you need to prove. Then the first result I want to mention is due to our model. He proved alpha, he considered this cosycle, shooting a cross cycle, assume alpha is different. In his paper, in his result, alpha is not necessary to be one-dimensional, it could be high-dimensional. And if the potential is small, that means this number. This nameless zero, so that if lambda is smaller than lambda zero, this lamina zero depends on alpha and v and potential v. And anyway, it's small such that if lambda is smaller than lambda zero, then it fixed this this this potential lambda v, then the Neapolitan as a function of e is half-holder. It's half folder. So it's half holder. Okay. And another result is due to Vina and Jinskaya. They can see this is a one frequency case, I guess. This is a non-productive result. Then he proved a similar result as a more. The difference is here. He proves the He proved the result for small potentials, but here you see the nameless zero depends only on v, not on alpha. In our most result, the nameless zero depends also depends on alpha. Here is not. So that means this can be not, or this applies to a full measure set of frequency. Okay, so that if the potential is small, it's bounded by an More is bounded by lambda is bounded by lamina zeros, and the upper swallow end is half quoted. Okay. In fact, the result can be improved to the subcritical region. That means in one frequency case, in multi-frequency case, maybe in almost the reducible region. Maybe. Maybe the Hooder exponent is a little smaller than one half. Maybe, yeah. And I want to say in those two results, alpha is assumed to be different, but this assumption may be not necessary, but some kind of arithmetical restructuring on alpha is necessary. You cannot prove a result of arbitrary. cannot prove a result of arbitrary alpha so uh if alpha is it's a shupinuvian there are they might have that they might have problem i heard someone is trying to construct a context number for supernova for the hooder continuity so that is a small potential now we switch to the big potential To the big potential, I mean, in the positively uploaded region, in the positively uploaded region, uh, so there's a result by Goldstein Schlag. They assume alpha is strong different thing. So, this alpha is a single, is a single frequency. Alpha is a number. Alpha is a strong diaphragm thing. I will not explain what is strong diaphragm thing. It's yeah, it's it's not only diaphragm. It's not only Diefantine, but it's better, okay. And however, this is not a very restrictive condition. R for strong defantine alpha is also a full measure site. And ASM alpha is analytic. And they assume that this E. uh this e uh in this interval in this interval the neoplaton neoplaton is positive there's a no band uh delta zero and then he proved uh the neoplaton is is is new hooder in this interval so new hooder this new depends on on delta zero so uh that didn't say anything about how much how big is this new Much, how big is this new? So, this is uh, so then from the you if you check this result, you can ask the following three questions. You see here, uh, here, uh, they see them alpha is a strong diaphragm. So the first question is: Is the assumption alpha is a strong diaphragm necessary? And this is the first question, and also uh alpha is an ESEM alpha is analytical. You can ask if analytical assumption on V not essential. Okay. Can it be replaced by the other conditions? And also there's no estimate on gamma here, no estimate on gamma. So can you give some estimation on the Hooder exponent gamma? So can you do Point the gamma. So, can you do that? So, now let's try to answer those three questions. The first question is: the first, I want to say the strong Divergentinian assumption is not necessary. Actually, we improve the Gutenchnag's result for actually the same result. That's on the same on the same on the same. the same uh on the same uh assumptions for all different things for for all not not uh strong for all different things and even some new reading alpha this new villian uh some new uh for new reading alpha we can define a beta defined this way uh given irrational alpha this q n p n is the best approximation then we can define beta this way find beta this way beta this way if if alpha is new villain but beta is smaller then the result is also true the neoplatonic function is holder and uh this result was further improved by by uh hunry and uh xuen chang and the proof And the proof the same result even for beta is not infinity, but they need to assume alpha is the upper exponent is very large. That means if the dividence can be compensated by the biggest of the optical function. Of the optical exponent. That means if the optical exponent is very big, this result can hold for quite big beta, not like here, small. This result, we assume our beta is small. But this result is resonant because we didn't assume anything on how big is the nearby. So, in that case, You cannot prove a result for beta speaker if Leops falling is small, then beta must be small. And I want to say we should not expect the result for for all R5. If R5 is very new, we we think that the hooder uh is not true. Is not true. So, this is the first answer: that it's a strong diffunding condition is not necessary. And also, I want to say analyticity assumption is not essential. It can be replaced by the other things. Actually, we can prove if the geometry of the potential is simpler, then Then we can even get a hooderness, hooder continuous nuity for C2 potentials. So by geometry of V is simple, we mean this potential is cosine-like. Certainly, this result is for big potential. We have a big lamina here. Namna here. Namna is bigger with cosine, it's cosine like a cosine function. It's not cosine, like cosine function. That is one maximum, one minimum. And the other place that is second order order derivatives is not zero. The first order differen did derivative is not zero. Okay, this is cosine nine. Okay, this is a cosine-like. And in this case, the neoplaton can be continuous. And beta is not needed to be different. Beta can be any finite number if beta is not infinite. Certainly, this bigness of laminar depends on this beta. This is this beta. If beta is very, very big, then we have to we can only prove the result for even bigger lamina. So, namela is big. The biggest of lamina is dependent on beta. And also, we prove that this Hooder exponent is a uniform in laminar. And if I remember correctly, we proved the Hooder exponent is bigger than one. Exponent is bigger than one four or one eight eighties one tenth, something like that. It's a fixed is a fixed number, and actually we guess there in this case the Hooder is important is one half. So we prove maybe one tenth, but I think it's one half. Okay, now we'll try to answer the third question: how to estimate on the Question: How to estimate on the neoproph, neoprof exponent, so the modulus of Hooder continuity. And there are some results. The first result I mentioned is beautiful again. Approved the result for a spatial cosycle that potential is just a cosine function. This is almost a material cosycle, comes from almost material operators. Of most material operators. And here, the CMR5 is definitely this potential is of this very special form. Then, if lambda is very big, then this Neoplaton is almost a half-holder for in E. So this actually, this result is Actually, this result is the same. If you only consider this model, in some sense, this result is implied by a more result, a more approved result for small potentials. But we have duality, you know, we have duality and IDS is the same for dual systems. And then you pseudo's formula, then you can also get this result by. get this result by by by by our most result and all i want to to to emphasize is uh uh uh our attitude is quite uh even prove the result of half-coder is true for lemla is not here is one in if lemla is not if if if it is not the critic case the shubert critic is a subcredit case uh there uh if alpha is different. If alpha is different, it's always half-cooler. So you'll see there are half-hood results on alpha for this spatial case. Then I could think like generalize this result to more general potential. This potential as they assume V, this potential is a small perturbation of our trigonometrical polynomial. Trichonometric polynomial of degree k0. So this is not just cosine 2 pi, maybe cosine 2 pi plus clan cosine 4 pi plus plus client cosine 6 pi. So then the degree is getting higher and higher. Then in this case, they can perve in the positive diabolic diabetes quality region and the near And the Neapolitan Poland is 1,2k0 holder almost, okay, for actually small epsilon. So Kosteng Schlag linked the Hooder exponent with the degree of the polynomial. Okay. The question is: is this essential? Does the modules of Hooder continuity essential in Continuity essentially links with the degree of the polynomial. So here is our result. We said it's not the case. What we prove is here, we assume alpha is different, alpha is trigonometric polynomial. Okay, but we don't care the degree of this polynomial. And then And then we need to assume we can see our result is for big potentials. We assume lambda is bigger than some lambda zero. Then the Neapolitan Poland, if you fixed R for R defining fixed lamina V, then you treat Neapolitan Poland as a function of E. This function is one over two D odor continuous at E, this look continuous. continuous to d so so so you see uh in the level of z so uh the the formulation is quite similar uh as uh as as good strange stock the only diff diff difference is here here this d the meaning of this d in in good strange aspect d is degree of the polynomial here our d is actually the acceleration so i mean i think So, I mean, I think we will talk about later. Okay. I will not explain that. And this could be much smaller than the degree. So there are some kind of, there are, for example, cosine-like potentials. The degree could be upgraded large, but the acceleration is one. It's always one. One so uh in fact we can prove that uh Niabrin's point is half-hood for not cosine-like cosine-like uh trigonometrical polynomial, not only for for for cosine, it's cosine-like. If cosine-like is also true, okay, it dot depends on the degree of the polynomial, it depends on the geometry of the polynomial, okay, and one remark so I want. So I want to say the degree there are this kind of that could be happen that the degree is quite bigger and Neapolitan's volume is behavior nice, even no glynapis. If E zero, if this E zero is in the deeps of the of the spectrum. Of the spectrum and the acceleration can be big. But at that place, the Niablic pollen is nips. And our result has epsilon here, so epsilon is up to small. This is not essential. So I'll give you some intuition. So if our potential looks like this, this our potential is a periodic function, then we what Then what we prove is, so if E is here, then it's at least a half-hood. Certainly it could be much better. For example, if there are some interval in this E5 to E6, which is a gap in the gaps, and the certainly is much more, it's analytical, so it's very good. Very good, and so I mean at the worst one is half order here. Okay, if you if you e is here, then you will see this horizontal line in the intersector the graph of this potential at four points. Then here, the Hooder exponent is one-fourth. And here, in this interval, then Table, then this horizontal line intersects the potential at six points. Then the hooder exponent is at least one over six. So then you see the Hooder continue, we use the geometry of the potential to characterize the Hooder exponent of Neapolitan. Exponent of the Neapolitan. Okay, now there are some conclusions. And first, I want to say usually we cannot expect regularity more than a holder for non-molotone potentials. You know, while functioning is periodic and continuous, it cannot be monotone. It might be some Increase part, decrease part. And I want to say if the potential is a lot more tone, the result could be better. Even it could be analytical. So there are results on that. For for normal term potentials, usually one can only expect Huda continuity globally. So at some point, maybe nuclear. This is due to the gaps. The condo spectrum is quite a typical phenomenon for one frequency shooting operators. Frequency shooting operators, the gaps will force the neoprene pollen to be only hooder, cannot be better. And also, if you in the never for McCallis is due to the resolutions consolidation, so I will not explain that. And so, on the side, who are exponent depends. Hooder exponent depends on many things. I mean, the first level thing is the geometry of the potential. If the geometry of the potential is simpler, and it's much easier to be a hooder, and the hooder exponent can be bigger. And the geometry of the potential is reflected through the coordinality of the level size. Cordinality of never says, never say that never says. So, okay. And or in some languages, critic points. And more precisely, the acceleration. So acceleration describes some kind of geometry of the potential. At least for big potentials. For small potentials, geometry is. Now, geometries is useless, but for big potentials, the geometries is very important. The second important thing is the smoothness of the potential. So, analyticity is not essential. But we need some smoothness. Some smoothness, some minimum smoothness. This kind of smoothness depends on the, I think it depends on the for big potential, it depends on the coordinality of nervous case or the acceleration. And the third one is the arithmetic property of this frequency. So So, our guess we need to assume at least the beta is not infinity, that is, alpha is not Schuknu, and in this case, we have chance to prove Huda continuity, even half-house continuity. If the potential is very big, if lamina is very big, even we can prove half-hood of okay. Now there are some Uh now there are some uh uh questions uh and the conjectures you know we we proved the result uh uh the Hooder continuity for for uh for for uh trigonometric polynomial. And we believe it is true for all analytic potentials. Actually, we proved the result for for bigger polynomial potential. The first step is to generalize our result from polynomial to analytical potentials. And then try to generalize our result to the place where the neoplatonic problem is not big. It's positive, but not big. We believe this is true. Uh given the acceleration, you can control the neoplat exponent. The Hooder exponent. And also we conjecture that this the Hooder continuity is true for typical big smooth potential. So for smooth potential, I think we need to assume the potential is big. Potential is big. The smoothness requirement depends on the here, that's never says. Never says means that the potential V equal to energy V, then the rows, number of rows, it depends on this. And we also conjecture that the Huda regularity holds for typical small potentials in positively opposed. In a positively opposite supplant region, if alpha is 17. And certainly, it's better to give a criterion. So, if you can give a condition which we can verify the condition on potential, then which guarantees the Coda continuity. So, in this case, again, in smooth case, we need to generalize the acceleration to smooth. Generalize the acceleration to smooth case, the smooth, the smoke cycles. So, this has not been done. So, it seems an interesting question. And finally, I want to say, you know, we actually didn't give you any example saying that the Huda exponent can be smaller than one half. You know, remember there. Remember, the cosine potential, cosine like potential, the Hoda exponent is one half. And for other potentials, we prove the new boundary after a hooder exponent. But it can be always true that it's exactly a half-houter. So that means both. Both degree acceleration is not essential, it's a half-order like the small potential case. You see, in the small potential case, if we assume R5 Stephen T, it's always half-coder. It cannot be one force order. So in the positive positive reading, so it's it's different or not. It's different or not. So, actually, I want to say it's often half-loaded, but not always. There are some exceptional case that the cosine is locally hooder, but the hooder exponent is less than one-half. Half and we see the Hooder exponent looks like this one. So, so this is if the worst Hooder exponent quantized, so I think that the you know for energy in the spectrum, then there are different Houder exponents, and the Houder exponent may And the whole diagnosis one may form an interval, and the new boundary of this interval may be quantized, but I'm not so sure. And also, this is another project we are going to study is try to link the Nioplas problem with spectrum zero. With spectrum theory, find more links and we think maybe linked with condo spectrum and extra homogeneous and maybe the other things. And I want to, so I should stop. So I stopped here. So thank you very much for your attention. Are there questions by the audience? May I start? Okay. Yeah, can you? Is there someone in the audience? Because they should have priority. Well, I do have a question, but I also do have a question. So my question is more regarding the More regarding the first part of the talk, the issue of continuity of discontinuity of the Lyapunov exponent. So one issue with these classes, si infinite jevris, is the lack of quasi-analyticity of the potential. And because of this, oftentimes people that study positivity continuity of pure point spectrum of these operators seem Pure point spectrum of these operators impose a non-degeneracy or transversality condition on the potential. So, my question is, and perhaps this is one of the conjectures that you stated, my question is, do you think that in a reasonable class of regularity of the potential, say C infinity, with a reasonable arithmetic condition, say diophantine, putting a transversality condition would be enough to ensure continuity. Be enough to ensure continuity of the Lyapunov exponent. Yeah, at the moment, I guess it's true. Yeah, so but yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess it's true, yeah. For big potentials, you can use this kind of transversality condition. You know, for small, if the potential is not very big, this kind of condition does not make sense, right? Right. So your regularity carturing only makes sense for big potentials. So for big potentials, I think put some non-degeneracy condition. Or as I said, there never says it's finite. So this is another alternative way to say finite. Finite critical points, the non-degenerate. So I think this will guarantee the smoothness. Certainly, we need to assume RF is the fun thing. But yeah, I don't know how to prove that. So at the moment, I believe this result. Thank you. Anna, you wanted to ask something? Sorry. Selana, you wanted to ask something? Oh, yeah. Okay. So I think regarding your question about examples of one over 2D, precisely one over 2D irregularity, I think the gap edges for the cosine of dx potentials, yeah. Yeah, I believe that is true. You mean that at the cab at the cab edge, the acceleration if you take precisely cosine of dx, it should have precisely one over two d yes, yes. I be I believe this is true at the gap age. Yeah, at the cap H is exactly this hood, cannot be. This code cannot be better. So, you cannot actually improve it. Yeah. But another question is, so it seems indeed that all this one over 2D and less than actually worse than Lipschitz business is related, as you said, to the counter structure of the spectrum to all the gaps. To hold the gaps, and because bad things happen at bad edges, and then it propagates a little bit inside. But so, what about multi-frequency case where it is proven in some cases and expected that a spectrum is an interval or contains an interval? Do you expect better? Do you expect there all this? So, actually, for moving. So actually for multi-frequency case, you know, typical situation is spectrum is an interval. In this case, I guess neoplaton behaviors better. So in a quite periodic case, in random case, there are some results. I think it depends on the measure. In random case, it's very nice. So, but we can see. So it is natural to expect that the Lapunov exponent should also be nice in the Lipschitz, but it is not, but actually the results are only weaker than in the one frequency case, right? Oh, yeah. So I guess, yeah, if you assume the spectrum in the spectrum, this endeavor, then in the crestbird case, try to prove more regulative. More regularity for the neoprene volunteer. Maybe, yeah, so I'm not so sure. I expect to it's better. Yeah. So that's actually the Ten Martini proof. That's partially how it went. So specifically for the cosine potential, this works beautifully because if there was an interval, there was regularity. But this is very special for those met you. So, but in general, one would naturally expect that, but no results, as I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is a good question to start. Yeah. Thank you. Okay, so I would propose that we thank the speaker again for the nice talk. Thank you very much. So I
