I'm pleased to be here to start us off. And thank you for the invitation and the organization, Leonid and Jesse. It's been, it is a lovely place to be. And I'll just start by pointing out the fact that we have amazing sunny weather and bougainville is blooming right outside. So let's, okay. Just as a quick launching point, since the pandemic, Launching point since the pandemic began from the very first month of the pandemic. I've been involved in a BC COVID-19 modeling group that aimed to provide mathematical support for public health and the public about the pandemic itself. We've met weekly since the beginning of the pandemic and issued several over 20 public reports, as well as communicated both about the research questions that models we were doing to tackle those. That models we were doing to tackle those research questions, as well as new papers that were coming up. And as you know, it's now this tsunami of publications. So having a group that is evaluating those papers simultaneously has been really helpful. I've also been a part of CovarNet, co-led by Jesse Shapiro. And this has been a really interesting group that brings together both modelers, computational and mathematical modelers, as well as immunologists, public health experts, molecular. Public health experts, molecular and cell biologist experts. And this has really been a group, thank you, that's the one that's going to be sorry. Okay, sorry, I think there's some chat things that you said. There's some chat things that we just had. This is all that sound. Sorry, sorry. I don't know what it is. Just really make that go away. Maybe I shouldn't fuss though. So I raised this because it's actually been a change in how we do science. And so it's kind of been the evolution of how we do science in a more networked way. You all know how much Twitter and these bioarchive, MetArchive papers have played a role in really fast-acting, not only Not only the science is fast acting, but also the collaborations are building in fast acting. And I hope that this is something we don't lose as we move forward beyond the pandemic. So within weeks after the initial reports of a respiratory illness from Wuhan, China, scientists around the world were already scouring the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, searching for signs of adaptation to humans. And since that time, this global effort to understand how this This global effort to understand how this virus was evolving has led to over 13 million genomes now amassed in Gassade, the public database, that's the global public database. And from these sequences, we learn a lot of things. This is a picture of the phylogeny from the first year of the pandemic. So every, this is a subset of the samples from that year, and every dot is a sample included in this phylogeny, and the concentric circles are just time all the way through to the end of 2020 here. End of 2020 here. And you see that the sequences COA last share a common ancestor in late 2019, so it wasn't circulating for years earlier. We can rule that out. The rate of substitution can be determined by calculating with the rate at which these accumulate sequence differences over time, but roughly once per genome per two weeks, which is fast because it's an RNA virus, but actually slower per base pair than flu by. Per base pair than flu by two to six fold per base pair. And this first year had this kind of classic star-like phylogeny where every lineage was roughly equally successful. And that leads to this burst star when a population is exponentially growing like this disease was. And that was characteristic of the phylogeny in the first shape. In the first year, no one lineage was really taking off much faster than any other lineage. Faster than any other lineage. But then, of course, you all know that the second that in December of 2020, the UK reported B117, now called alpha, as a variant that spread reliably in health authority after health authority and week after week. And you need that because you see spread, you see something increasing in numbers because of epidemic forces, not because of necessarily selective forces. So you need to see a frequency change. So, you need to see a frequency change and you need to see it repeated so that you can rule out things like super spreader events or other like a source event that is seeding an increase in frequency but does not reflect selection. So, this was the first strong case of selection. And then, of course, since then, we've had wave after wave, as you all know, variants of concern. The phylogeny is completely different in shape. It's now characterized by these lineages. Characterized by these lineages. It's zoomed out until the end of 2021. So you can't even really see this for alpha, but it showed a similar picture early on where here's the delta wave and you see one lineage proliferating extensively and really out-competing the other lineages and then Omicron there in orange. So early on in the pandemic, Troy, who's on the call with us as well as Sylvain Gandon and Sebastian Leon, and Sebastian, and I developed a model that was a little bit more specific to SARS-CoV-2 to understand the evolution of this virus. And so, some of the particulars about this disease are that it had this asymptomatic phase and pre-symptomatic phase where a lot of transmissions happened before symptoms appeared, as well as a symptomatic phase. So otherwise, it's a classic SIR model where there's an exposed but non-infectious state. Exposed but not infectious state. So, but there's lots of revenues to infection before symptoms appear. And in these models, so all of the interactions involve interactions between the susceptible class and one of the infected classes in these classic SIR models. And if your susceptible population is large and relatively constant, there's not a, you know, you're not getting a huge fraction of population infected at any one point in time, you can treat the susceptible. One point in time, you can treat the susceptible class as a constant over the time frame that you're doing your projections. And that allows you to work with a set of linear equations. And those linear equations allow you to say how fast is the wild type spread. And any mutant that spread, that changes any of these parameters, these flow rates, the transmission rates or the flow rates, the progression rates of the disease, you can ask, how do those mutations spread? And so that allows us by And so that allows us by having new mutations that alter these parameters and tracking their effects on the leading eigenvalue or the rate of spread of this disease, we can predict how the virus is selected. Doing so, you get an equation. Let me walk you through this equation. So this is basically measuring selection. How much does a mutation or a set of mutations, a new lineage, change the spread rate, the leading eigenvalue of this virus? Of this virus. And there are terms in here. So, this first set of terms involves these beta terms. Those are the transmission rates from either the pre-symptomatic, the symptomatic, or the asymptomatic classes. And the deltas are how much does a mutation change those terms? So these are this first set of terms are how does selection, what is the selection that comes from changing the transmission parameters. Then you have Then you have terms like the U's. These are the right eigenvectors, they're strictly positive, and there's the proportion of individuals in each of viruses in each of these classes. So it's like a stable age distribution, but it's not the age distribution, but the stage distribution for the different stages that the virus could be in, whether it's in what proportion of the virus is in the exposed class or the asymptomatic class, et cetera. Or the asymptomatic class, etc., those are strictly positive. And then finally, you have terms that are the left eigenvector. In demography, these are classically known as the reproductive value. And what that represents is if you had a virus in each of these classes, what is that virus's contribution to the long-term population size of the virus? So, you know, viruses at late stage in the infectious class, they're almost on the way out, so they'll have a lower reproductive value than in. Reproductive value, then viruses in the pre-symptomatic phase that have all of these transmissions to do, and then all of those transmissions to do. So those reproductive values are also strictly positive, but they allow us to better understand how selection acts on this disease. So by and large, transmission is always selected to be positively favored. That's the first term. And the transition rates, by and large, are selected to decline. And I've summarized. To decline. And I've summarized this in the next slide. So, stepping back, the main take-home points, higher transmission, we would expect that for any disease. And that means either higher transmission, higher intrinsic transmissibility, or a higher ability to infect people that had been infected before. So more immunovasion. But there's also selection for prolonged infectivity, lengthening the amount of time that is spent in each of these infectious states. Spent in each of these infectious states. And then there's some terms where the extent of selection depends. Like whether or not there's selection for more asymptomatic or fewer asymptotic depends on exactly what the infectivity is from this stage versus the symptomatic stage. But the main take-home point, I think, for the public is that selection on mortality is very negligible. The reflection on mortality is very negligible. And that's because by the time it reaches a stage where death or severe impacts are had, that's long after the virus has come and gone. Yeah, yeah. Or well, sorry, just clarification, isn't that? No more Callie, doesn't that depend primarily on the assumptions about consensus in the various not so much for this disease because this really sorry to interrupt you, but uh, would you mind please repeating the question for the online participants? It was already repeat the question. Yeah. Yeah, I'll repeat it. Just that the question was, does this conclusion about negligible direct selection on severity and mortality depend on the detail? Depend on the details of this particular. Sorry, does it depend on the relative transmission states of the various stages? I mean, and yes and no. And so it does matter that most of the reproductive value of this virus happens before that mortality. That's the key point. So it doesn't really matter if they're going here or there, it's not that sensitive to that. Or there, that it's not that sensitive to that. But for other diseases, that's not true. And death happens concommittant with viral transmission or even facilitates viral transmission, like with Ebola, where a lot of them, but in this disease, the mortality happens late. And this is illustrated in this graph, where the viral load basically has come and gone before the really severe sequelae and death happens. And so, as far as the evolution of this virus is concerned, our deaths are immaterial. Our deaths are immaterial. It's not selected to increase or decrease our death rate because the evolution of the virus depends on being able to propagate to another case. And that's basically come and gone for most infections. So there's negligible direct selection and severity mortality for SARS-CoV-2, not for other diseases. And we wrote at that point in 2020 that virulence evolution. 2020, that virulence evolution will then be largely driven by the indirect effects or side consequences, what we talk about as pleiiotropy in the genomics literature. So, there are two possibilities, we argued. Mutations might couple a higher transmission rate, like a higher ability to get from person to person, with higher mortality. That would be positive pleiiotropy. And we might expect that if mutations increase the replication rate or the ability to get into our cells in the first place, that would increase transmissibility. In the first place, that would increase transmissibility, but it would also increase the severity of the disease potentially. And alternatively, mutations might arise that alter the tissue tropism such that the disease tends to be preferentially infecting cells that are in the upper airway. At that point, it was mainly a deep lung infection. Then, transmission is hard for the virus to get out of those deep lung tissues. If it had evolved to be an upper respiratory, To be an upper respiratory tract infection, such infections could lead to a higher transmission rate, but be less virulent. So that was 2020 before any of the variants of concern had arisen. But we've seen both of these possibilities in the variants of concern where alpha, beta, a little bit, gamma, and delta all were more virulent, increasing death rates and hospitalization rates, whereas Omicron has a lower virulence per uninterrupted. Per uninfected, unvaccinated person, with a hazard rate somewhere like half that of the original Wuhan strain, which is given a one in this graph. So I think it is evolution of virulence. There's a lot of misunderstandings about how virulence evolution will work. And I think these kind of early simplified, simple models really allowed us to see and pretty. us to see and predict some very kind of coarse predictions about the evolution of this virus. So most of what we've been doing is tracking the rate of spread of the variants of concern and just to walk through make sure we're all on the same page I'll just talk through the kind of basic population genetics models of that of how we estimate selection. So we go on to a genomic database like Gassade and then on each day they'll have a number of sequences On each day, they'll have a number of sequences that are deposited. This is for Canada, and we'll know what number of them are BA5 and what number of them are BA2. So we can estimate the frequency P of a particular variant that we're interested in. And we can estimate its selection coefficient. This is the classic, this top equation is the classic evolutionary equation of change in frequency is equal to selection times the genetic variance. P times 1 minus P is the genetic variance. P times 1 minus P is the genetic variance within the population. If P is 0 or 1, there's no evolutionary change. And that leads to the solution to that evolutionary differential equation is this one, which is a logistic S-shaped curve. And the steepness of that S allows us to estimate the selection coefficient. So, given all of this data, we can basically say on any one day, the Basically, say on any one day, the probability of observing the data on that day is given by the binomial equation with the number of sequences from that day and this equation for p. And that allows us taking the log and summing over all day to get a likelihood of seeing all of the data. And that's easily here. I'm just showing it for two types, but this is easily scaled up to where these are the frequency of any one type and you have multiple. Frequency of any one type, and you have multiple types. And that allows you to both infer the strength of selection, albeit estimate giving you selection coefficients per day, as well as confidence intervals. The other, maybe slightly more useful way of modeling selection is using logic plots. So that takes the allele frequency, divides it by the other allele frequencies, one minus p, and that And that turns the equation into one when we log it that's linear in the selection coefficient and time. So, the law on a logit plot, what we should see, so this is on a log scale, p over one minus p, we should see a straight line if selection is acting. And that really is a visual clue that it isn't a super spreader event or one place that is really got had an epidemic. Had an epidemic spread and then is then spreading out because it won't lead to that kind of continual day after day after day rise in frequency at the same rate. And so that's a really good clue selection is constant. Now going back to the CPIR model, one of the predictions that we made early on was that the strength of this, so for mutants that gain a transmission advantage, that selection should really depend on S. Selection should really depend on S. So, if there's anything that's done in the population to remove the susceptibles from, to lower the susceptible pool, and that can be any NPI measure, that you might see a reduction in the selective spread of those alleles at any point in time. And we saw that. We've seen it repeatedly. This is a kind of a classic example of when during the alpha in BC, we actually had alpha and gamma co-circulating. And gamma co-circulating. And during that wave, there was a circuit breaker. So the hospital started to get full, and a circuit breaker was announced on the 30th of March, 2021. They closed the restaurants, they closed a lot of businesses, restricted social gatherings. And you see this really big kink in this logic plot, where the selection coefficient favoring alpha, this variant with a transmission advantage, then had a slowed selection coefficient. A slowed selection coefficient. We saw that too with Omicron, not because of a public health measure. With Omicron, we saw this at the beginning of January across many jurisdictions. And I call that a collective concern shift in the selection coefficient. It was when the lines got so long to get tested. The concerns about hospitalizations in other countries were dominating the news, and collectively, people's Collectively, people started their own individual protective measures, but this is largely not a public health-mandated transition. So, we do see these kinks and these transitions and selection coefficients when there's like a big event, but by and large, we don't. And most of the time, you just see these logic plots with continuing selection over long periods of time at roughly the same slope. From those, we can estimate the selection coefficient. From those, we can estimate the selection coefficient, and I've just done this across in Canada for the various variants against the previously circulating variants. So these initial selection coefficients are against wild type, and then delta versus alpha gamma, omicron versus delta, and et cetera, et cetera, BA5 versus BA2. So you always have a selection coefficient relative. You have to name which one you're calling your strain of reference. And that's what. Strain of reference. And that's what I'm doing with these arrows of showing which one I was using as a reference strain. But hold on a second. These are astronomically large selection coefficients, and that needs to be emphasized. As an evolutionary biologist, I've never seen outside of lab experiments anything like this. These are selection coefficients per day. And translating those into doubling times, we're talking about doubling in relative frequency of just a few days to a couple of weeks for these variants. That's really fast. Variants. That's really fast evolutionary change. Really unparalleled. So, where are we in 2022? Of course, Omicron hit the scenes. It's the first variant to have a major immune escape attributes. It had three times more spike mutations, a lot of those concentrated in the receptor binding domain where the spike attaches to ACE2 and enters into our cell. Too and enters into our cell. So I had this burst of mutations, a lot of which changed that kind of outside look of the virus and thereby evaded our antibodies and our immunity to better infect our cells. And as you know, it also changed its tropism, becoming more of an upper airway infection. So, some of the unusual features of Omicron, despite the fact that we didn't Of Omicron, despite the fact that we didn't hear about it until November 2021, it actually has a really old evolutionary history. And it first diverged from the other lineages of SARS-CoV-2 back in early 2020, early on in the pandemic. So there was, you know, a year and a half of basically we didn't see it until it popped up on the scene in enormous numbers. And that's not the only unusual feature. As I mentioned, it had. As I mentioned, it had a burst of mutations. And what I'm showing in this graph is the number of substitutions from the Wohan strain over sampling date. And this is from the Covarnet group. And the mutation rate is the slope of these lines. But with Omicron and with many of the other variants of concern, like alpha, what we saw was a shift up. Like not a shift in rate, that would have been a change in slope, but a change in inner. Would have been a change in slope, but a change in intercept. And that suggests some event in its evolutionary past where mutations could accumulate at a higher rate. Not that it was a mutator or something like that where we'd expect it to continue to have a higher slope. So more than the expected number of mutations, disproportionate number of changes in spike, a long period of evolutionary divergence out of sight, a year and a half where we didn't know about it. There's also evidence that recombination was involved. Involved. And all of those are features, unusual features, are consistent with passage through an immunocompromised or persistent infection. So I'm putting these black boxes there because we don't actually know what caused this large pulse, these unusual features. It could have been passage through an animal, but there's reason to expect that it would be passage through. It would be passage through persistent infection because we see very similar patterns in those individuals who have been tracked with chronic infections. And those, we've had case studies of people infected for over a year with the same strain that was evolving over time. Again, there is a high and prolonged viral replication where the lineage within any body is experiencing extremely different selective pressures than the vast majority of the various Than the vast majority of viruses that are transmitting from person to person. Not only are they not having to transmit out of the body for that period of time, but oftentimes those individuals have a weakened or no immune system. So those immunity selective pressures are entirely different, allowing the virus to accumulate mutations and spike and change in ways that allow it to better persist in those individuals. Hidden from surveillance efforts simply because it's evolution, but it's happening inside a single individual. Single individual. And there's also higher potential for recombination because you have that long, persistent infection. So any secondary infection that that person has over that long period of time allows for double infections and recombination. And I should say that with two to three million, sorry, 40 million people worldwide living with HIV, more living with chronic Living with chronic cancer or other diseases that suppress the immune system. This is a large fraction of the population, estimated in the United States to be 2% to 3% of the population are immunocompromised. So we're basically, we've got two kind of evolutionary processes going on. The transmission one that we think about mainly, but then these independent evolutionary trajectories happening in persistent infections. And that, that. Infections. And that allows for this virus to explore evolution, the kind of fitness landscape and the genomic evolutionary space in a way that I think is unparalleled. Here's a graph by Harari et al., just kind of illustrating that the genetic changes seen in chronic infections mimic those seen in variants of concern. This is the genome. And again, both show this excess of mutations that are able. Of mutations that are able to substitute in the spike region compared to mutations that accumulate across the sequences globally. There have been case studies. Here's an example case study of a person living with HIV who was followed for 190 days. And I raised this particular story or case study because, in this case, the initial immuno. The initial immuno, the immunological attributes of the initial infection were really similar to the wild type early on in their infection. But it evolved over time to gather mutations, especially in the receptor binding domain, many of which we have an omicron, like these mutations and that mutation and these mutations. And by the end, it had neutralizing ability that was closer to beta. So within this. Beta. So within this individual, it basically evolved to be what would have been a variant of concern had it emerged out of this individual. Now, I suspect that many such evolutionary trajectories are dead ends for the virus. The person is either cleared or it evolves lower transmission from person to person. But with so many people with persistent infections, this route towards variants of concern is something that we need to pay attention to. Need to pay attention to and provide as many to base. We need to prioritize globally the identification of persistent infections and the treatment of persistent infections if we want to reduce the evolutionary potential of this virus. So it is a truism that evolution will explore more of. Will explore more or adapt faster if the population is large because more mutations can accumulate in a large population, and most mutations will accumulate in that large circulating group. So, right now, that's mainly BA5, mainly Omicron variants. And so, most of the mutational changes we'll see will be in that group, as we've seen with BQ.1 and all of these other ones I'm going to talk about in a second. But we should not ignore the possibility of a major shift. There are still delta variants and still alpha variants that are being submitted. Alpha variants that are being submitted and non-VOC variants. So the rest of the tree of this virus has not gone extinct. And that's probably because of these chronic infections or other isolated pools of individuals, but it probably more likely chronic infections. And it is still possible that variants will evolve outside of the Omicron lineage, especially in the future when they maybe are less recognized by the immune system. Recognized by the immune system that gets more and more trained on Omicron. And again, any major shifts could lead to more severe or less severe diseases as we've seen previously in the pandemic. There's one sign of hope, and I don't, this is speculative, but the major transmission advantage that Omicron underwent, this shift from lower to upper airway, kind of creates this cliff in the fitness surface that makes it, would make it challenging. That makes it challenging for any of the other variants to be able to out-compete Omicron. So, that is a Delta variant would have to be able to spread so much faster to be able to compete with Omicron. Otherwise, Omicron is going to race through the population and most people are going to be immunized by the time that delta can spread. So, this is a kind of speculation. This is a kind of speculation and a hopeful speculation because as it stays in upper airways infection, that will be good news in terms of this lower severity that Omicron has. It's not impossible that it could evolve to have both upper and lower airway infection, be able to infect both types of cells well. So it's not impossible that it doesn't go to be more virulent. And then finally, I said that it had roughly a half. I said that it had roughly a half a virulence, but you multiply that by the bazillions of cases that we have with public health measures basically removed. And we still have, as you all know, high hospitalization and death rates. Right now in British Columbia, for example, we have higher hospitalization rates than we did in the first two years of the pandemic entirely and death rates. So we're kind of in a new phase and you've read Of in a new phase, and you've read this in the news of this variant evolving, where because in Canada, 100% of people pretty much have been exposed to the virus, either through vaccination or infection. And so the name of the game has really shifted to viruses being better able to transmit if they change what they look like to our bodies, change sites in the receptor binding domain in particular. And there were in this graph five sites that were. Graph five sites that were known to really change the ability of antibodies to bind to the spike protein are being tracked. And the key point is that you're seeing the convergence to these kind of genetic solutions to provide immune evasion ability, but you're seeing them from multiple pathways. Here's the BA5 pathway, the BA4 pathway, the BA2 pathway, and they're all converging on these set, this family. Converging on these set, this family of mutations in the receptor binding domain that allow improved immunity. So I'm going to talk about the BQ family that's here and here. Also briefly mention the XBB and CH1 family that's up there. Quick. Yeah, we're three minutes to. Okay. So that convergent evolution is a sign of immune escape, and we're tracking over time. And we're tracking over time what that means to the BQ variants. We're seeing it rise in frequency. These are BQ in the United States, I'm sorry, in Canada, where they now comprise about 20% of sequences. Globally, rising proportion, both in Canada and globally, selection coefficients on the order of 8%. That's equivalent really to what alpha had over Wuhan, just to give you a sense of this is how fast BQ is spreading relative to BA5. To BA5. And that's what we're seeing in Canada, the United States, and Europe. We're seeing different pictures in different places. XBB is just taking hold more in Asia, and that may be because XBB is a BA2 derivative. And the extent to which different countries had BA2 waves or BA5 waves may make them more or less susceptible to BA2 derivatives versus BA5. Two derivatives versus BA5 derivatives like BQ. That's speculative, but possible. It could also be it's just a founder effect, which variant got there, which immunovating variant got there first. So we can also, not only do we want to know about the evolution of this virus, we want to know what is the impact on actual growth rates. Here, I'm estimating the growth rate little r, the exponential growth rate of the subvariants by multiplying together the free. Multiplying together the frequency dynamics with the I use cases over 70 as a more reliable record of who is getting infected. There's too much underreporting in younger people. So I'm focusing on this age class to try and minimize underreporting. And from that, we're seeing exponential growth rates at this moment in time of BQ in Canada between 4 and 7%. This is the tail of the BA5 wave. The BA5 wave has never gone down, and we're going to see this kind of prolonging of the BA5 wave or new BABQ wave, whatever you want to call it. So I think I'll have to skip over that. I'd be happy to talk about the immune impacts of that. I'll just highlight that Europe's a little ahead of us in the BQ wave. Of us in the BQ wave, and I take this as good news because we're already seeing signs. This is in gray, the hospitalization rates look like they're peaking and going down. So the BQ, if you look at the immune evasion potential, it's possible that the BQ wave could have gone through the entire population again, and that none of our immunity would have worked. And we're not seeing that. We're seeing a turnaround. So yes, it's infecting more people, but it's not looking like it's going to be like wildfire. Going to be like wildfire going through the whole population because it's already turning around, suggesting that immunity remains substantial against BQ. So I think just to wrap up, we need to continue to inform the public. The view that we're beyond COVID means that people can't make informed decisions about their daily lives. We're seeing really low booster uptake, less than 10% since August in Canada. And that's partly because of this. And that's partly because of this kind of perception that we're beyond COVID. We're not beyond COVID. We're continuing to have very high, and we should still see higher rates of infection than any time prior to the Omicron wave. And the boosters do help. So this is where it's also a communications issue. Yes, it's immune evasion, but if you have enough antibodies in your body, then even if it's a poor match, there are enough of them that the chances that the Of them that the chances that the virus is able to be bound and prevented from entering a cell goes up. So it's still worth boostering, as one of the graphs I skipped over showed. And these bivalent boosters help a little bit extra too. It's not a game changer, but they also do help better recognize Omicron. And again, as I mentioned, need to globally prioritize treatment of those suffering from persistent infections. Thank you. Okay. I think we're at an hour. So maybe, or I guess no one can hear me except everyone in the room, but thanks, Sally. That's great. We're at the hour. Should we save questions for the breakout room and just to Breakout room and just to stay on schedule? Yeah, I think that would be great. Especially because the next speaker will have to leave right after his talk. So we'll have lots of time to ask the questions after. Perfect. So breakout room one for Sally at the break. Great. All right. Leonid, I'll let you introduce the next. Okay. Thanks. Nicely. So Thanks, Nestle. So great pleasure to introduce our next speaker, Ollie Ratman from Imperial College. And he's going to talk about keeping momentum beyond COVID, genomic surveillance to strengthen HIV public health interventions and lessons from Rakai Uganda. Go ahead, Ali. That's great. Thank you so much, everybody. I will say before I start, it's, you know, as every time, it's a great pleasure to. Every time it's a great pleasure to be with you. I did it like two years ago. It was remote. I really hope that next time I'll be in person and I very much look forward to this. It's such a fantastic group and just to foster interactions and conversations and sharing ideas, just hopefully then also lead to collaboration. And then now here you have my title, which is talking about beyond COVID-19. COVID-19. And, you know, clearly from Sally, we heard there is COVID-19 isn't over. There is a perception that we're moving beyond COVID-19. But I think it's really without, you know, I mean, in full acknowledgement that who knows what's waiting for us very soon, but also with the winter period, at least here in the Northern Hemisphere. And, you know, I'm speaking from my London living room where it's getting cold. Living room where it's getting colder by the minute. So, with all further ado, what's the story that I want to tell you today in the next 25 minutes? It's a story about public health success, really like a fantastic success in declining HIV incidence rates in Africa, but also a story about growing inequity in the sense that men are benefiting. Men are benefiting more than women. And I think we really have to address this growing issue. And we're thinking then about really readjusting and refocusing some of the major multi-billion dollar public health interventions that are in place. And I'm talking about how HIV pathogen surveillance is helping us to find out how to do it. How to do it. So that's really what my talk is about. And what are the lessons that we have accrued over time in the past year in my group and beyond in Panjay HIE? I'll talk about this in a minute and then the Rakai Health Sciences program as well. So these are the main collaborators that I have. And the subtext really here is: if you're thinking of what do we do with this fantastic scaling up of genomic capacity that we now have. Economic capacity that we now have worldwide, how do we best use it? And where do we, what are the strategies and how are we deploying that kind of resource? And so this is why I wanted to come in and say, so what are the lessons that we've learned in the HIV field and how is it done there? Sort of highlighting a little bit that it's a bit different to how COVID-19 genomic surveillance is done. And so we want to be careful on how we kind of set up these systems going forward. Systems coming forward. All right, okay. So let me start. So, and I want to kind of connect just back again about this really extraordinary. Oh, no, and then you can't see my pointer. That's unfortunate. Scale up of pathogen genomic surveillance in Africa. And I'm still trying to figure out if I can scribble on the slide or do anything here, but I can't. I think I'll just have to go. I can't. I think I'll just have to go ahead without this point in there at this point. And I apologize for that. So, this is just an example that the extraordinary achievements that we had and have done with some of us here in the room included, in scaling up genomic surveillance in Africa. If you look at 2020-21, you can see the countries in red where there was no NGS capacity in public. No NGS capacity in public health laboratories fast forwarding to 2021 and 22. And then, what a target really is of this group to really have capacity really in all countries across Africa to sequence viruses. And I think Eduan is probably like with you or with us in the group and some people here, I think David Rasmussen, who was part of in this paper here. Was part of in this paper here, and he kind of also contributed to that, and many others as well. So, lots of us to think and reflect on these issues. And then on the backdrop of that, we had the WHO very recently release their 10-year strategic framework to strengthen country, regional, and global pathogen surveillance. And that was really like understanding that what we have achieved. And the understanding that what we have achieved in COVID-19 and then how do we take this forward over the next 10 years? And the link to the strategy is at the very bottom of my slides. I hope you can see that. But the objectives that they are trying to measure, and there are five of them, they're about improving access to tools for better geographic representation. There is now a call out for the Asia Pathogen Genomic Initiative. And just to get sequencing capacity, but also access and use of bioinformatics tools and statistical analysis models out and be used worldwide. The next objective is about strengthening the workforce to deliver speed, quality and scale. The third one is about to enhance data sharing for streamlined local and global health decision making. Local and global health decision making and action. So, this is essentially the goal, the objectives as they are kind of phrased by the WHO. And the fourth one is about maximizing connectivity for timely value add-in in the broader surveillance architecture. So thinking beyond just sequencing. And then to maintain a readiness for emergencies. So we've already seen how, thinking back to Africa, how the Thinking back to Africa, how these sequencing capacity that's been built up has been used to identify the Ebola outbreak, the very recent one in Uganda, just like a few weeks ago and still ongoing. But also, if you're thinking about monkeypox and other infectious disease threats. What is What is Pangea HIV in this context? You're thinking about keeping the momentum going. So it's the Pan-African HIV pathogen genomics program. It has links with all the, in the map on the right corner, the red dots. So these are surveillance sites that are contributing samples to the consortium. And really, the key point about this consortium is that. About this consortium is that the sequencing is done in a surveillance framework. So the sequences can be understood, integrated with population surveillance and clinical care. So in other words, we know the demographics of the population, we know their behavior because these surveys are done and people are asked about their behavior, like in migration, out migration. Migration, out migration, sexual behavior, these sort of things. We understand HIV incidence. This is where the main characteristics of the HIV epidemic in Africa are characterized and quantified through these surveys. We understand clinical care uptake and behavior of the willingness of the individuals to engage. Individuals to engage with clinical care and take-up treatment options. And so it's in this kind of rich context that we have set up the pathogen genomic surveillance. And I want to talk to you a little bit more about lessons learned in a particular setting. So this is in the Bakai Community Cohort study. So this is close to Lake Victoria in Uganda. I wish I could use my pointer. In the map, you can see. In the map, you can see like these funny circles, and each of these circles is one of the study communities. There are 40 of them, four of them are on the lake, at the lake, and the remaining 36 are a little bit further inland. There's a kind of horizontal line at the bottom of the map, so that's the border to Tanzania. And that is the Rakai country. And that is the Rakai Community Cohort study. It's been in operation for more than 30 years. And we've kind of analyzed data from essentially the 2008 to 2018 period. And what I'm trying to show you in the different colours in the circles is that we have a very good understanding of who we have for which individual. For which individuals, infected individuals, we have identified the virus and sequenced the virus. So in gray, the kind of little kind of parts in gray, they show like the proportion of the infected population that reported ART use. And using that as a proxy, we thought we wouldn't be able to identify. Able to identify and sequence virus from individuals who are reporting ART use already because they have suppressed viral load. So we didn't attempt to sequence them. And then the red part is the one where we successfully sequenced HIV-infected individuals. So you get a sense that it's really like a high sampling scenario. We are sequencing on average more than half of the infected. On average, more than half of the infected population. So, put that into context, like when we kind of think about COVID-19 genomic surveillance. So, it's really very focused on the location where we understand the population denominators, but then we use as many resources as we have to sequence as deeply and as high coverage as possible. So, that's sort of the broad setting of. Setting of Pangea HIV. And I talked about this two years ago already. So, one of the key discoveries of Pangea HIV is the following. So, when you do HIV deep sequencing, you get multiple sequence fragments and you get that per person. So, if you build a phylogenetic tree as kind of shown in the top part of the figure, so the multiple fragments. So, the multiple fragments you can see them as the tips, so these are kind of different diamonds, right? And per person, you can color the tree, and suddenly you can play this game of phylogeography between individuals, not no longer between countries or counties, but really between individuals. And it gives you a sense, so for example, that M1, person M1 in light blue, preceded F2, the one in darker colors. The one in darker colours, yeah, and so we do this because these are deep sequence fragments, we do this on 250 base pair alignments, we do this repeatedly across the genome, and it gives us a sense of certainty on who infected whom. And you can see like this coloring in the graphs at the bottom isn't always the same. So we are far from certain at the individual level. So there's a great deal of uncertainty about who we think. Uncertainty about who we think is ancestral to whom, or if we can tell anything at all. But at the population level, once you start to aggregate over these peers, you get a great deal of signal and the whole technology turns into a fantastic public health tool. I will, probably in the interest of time, I will skip over. Skip over these slides here. But going forward, just think the main point is here: rather than thinking about traditional phylodynamic analysis, we can really use the added resolution that we get from the deep sequencing to directly have direct data between peers of individuals, saying like who is first and who is second, or who is a likely source. Second, or who is a likely source, and who is a likely recipient. Again, this is not proof, but aggregating over many individuals, we can establish some population level transmission. And that is ultimately some very basic regression analysis. So it's far less complicated and scalable and also much more user-friendly and doable by many more people. So at some point in the last year, I happened to read this. I happened to read this paper by the Global Burden of Disease 2019 collaboration that was published and announced at HIV. And what this figure shows is HIV incidence rates in 2019. And it looks at incidence in men divided by incidence in women. And then they call this the male to female ratio. You can see like how really different it is in Africa. In Africa. So, HIV incidence is much higher in women than in men. And that's what we mean by saying that the African HIV epidemic has been female. And so the questions that we wanted to address is like, what are the recent trends in HIV incidence in women? Are these disparities between men and women closing? Are they widening with all the interventions that have been ruled out? And then this is where now the Where now the HIV genomic surveillance comes in. The questions then were: so, really, which male populations drive insulin in women and vice versa, right? And the hope is that because we really understand the denominated population, we can really do that very well. And then finally, what are the best strategies to close the gaps and improve population health? And that's again the part where pathogen genomics is important because we have identified these. These what we call source-recipient peers. So, not just likely peers, but also where we know the direction of transmission. And we can play counterfactual scenarios on the identified events. So, it's a little bit different to standard epidemic modeling because we go back to the identified data points and then look at the underlying data for these individuals and say, What would have happened if that person had, for example, started ART earlier? And we assume. Earlier, and we assume some standard efficacy rates. So, that's sort of where the genomics comes in. And so, what we see, and I want you to focus on the bottom four figures. So that shows the age of the individuals on the x-axis, and on the y-axis is incidence rates per 100% year. And if you look at the first one on the very left, around 12, you can see what age. 12, you can see what HIV incidence rates used to be quite high, and especially in young women of age 15 to 24. You can see how this red bar part really stands out, very high rates. But you can see like over time, really success. This is the success part of my story. How really we have managed to drive down HIV incidence rates in the population. This is fantastic public health success. Success. I've been with people in Uganda really recently. They are delighted about this process, especially because they know what it meant back in 2006 to have such high incidence rates. But you can also see how incidence rates have shifted by age. It's now much higher in women of older age, between 25 and 40 years, and generally, like always, like a little bit. Generally, like always a little bit higher than in men. So we're observing much fast, we're observing faster declines in HIV incidence in men than women, and that applies to all ages above 25. And then using now the HIV genomics pipeline that I briefly described, we can actually document that transmission from men increased from 52% between 2006 and 2008. 2006 and 2008 to now 57% in 2016 to 2018. So the proportion of transmissions from men is increasing. Now that makes sense if we look at the HIV incidence rates immediately, right? But imagine a situation where we wouldn't have this population denominator in a much more complicated situation. So very important to link both together. And so immediately this increase that we see in the In the phylogenetic data, immediately makes sense, right? But what the incidence data doesn't tell us is that the sources are shifting in age. So the plots in the middle, they show the inferred age of the sources in the phylogenetic analysis. And the plot is done in such a way that the male sources plus the Sources plus the female sources add up to 100%. That's what the plot is showing for each round. So you can see that by round 18, generally, like the blue curve is much higher than the red curve. There's many more male sources than female sources. And you can see how the age has shifted over time. So the triangles, the upside-down triangles, are the median ages of infection. Are the median ages of infection with men? So transmissions from men are shifting to much older ages, and overall the disparities are widening, they are not closing. So there's something that we need to do. How are we doing on time? Okay, I will attempt this. Let's see. Give me a few minutes. I will let me tell you, I think the, let me focus on this one. Let me focus on this one here. So, what because we are operating in the context of the surveillance cohort, individuals who are found HIV positive have their viral loads measured. So you get an understanding of population level viral load with the idea being, and that is shown, so I can tell you already, that is shown in the black lines by age. And the idea here is that people. And the idea here is that people who are viremic are still infectious and so should be the sources of new infections. That's sort of the idea between behind the population level barrel. So they show like the composition of the population that is still baremic. So who are most likely the sources? Now, what we find in the genomics, in the HIV pathogen genomic surveillance, is Genomic surveillance is the colored lines. These are the sources that we determine through the phylogenetics. And you can see that what we, the top row is round 15, so 2011 to 2013. And the bottom row is round 18. So that is 2016 to 2018. And you can see that if we focus on the female sources compared to who have Compared to who has viremia, the sources are shifted to the left. Yeah, so you can see the two modes they don't agree with. And in the bottom one, if you just focus on the women, so we cap in the light brown the figure from round 15 and added in the pink the new age distribution of the sources in round 18. So you can see it went. In round 18. So you can see it went lower, but pretty much stayed with the same age distribution state as before. And now, what we can demonstrate, which I'm not showing you, that's the other part of the figure that I kind of Zoom glossed over, is we are also quantifying a sexual behavior. And it is true that sexual contact rates in the last or preceding year. The last or preceding year are usually much higher in the younger population compared to older populations. So, when you kind of start to integrate sexual contact rates into the discussion, you see that viral load simply population level viral load as shown in the black figure can't make sense because people that are younger are much more active, so have much higher transmission risk over the same duration. Duration period. So that is why, again, it's really very informative to think about the phylogenetic outputs in the context of much deeper output here. And so if you just very briefly talk about the male sources shown on the right-hand side of this plot, you can see really this very extraordinary peak in transmission sources at young age. At young age, between age 20 and 25, between 2011 and 2013. So that's the top right plot. And compare this to who is actually variing. And you can try and understand how sexual behavior gets factored in to kind of explain the differential between the two. But if you now look at round 18, you can see how to some extent this has been mitigated over time. So it's much less pronounced. Time. So it's much less pronounced compared to what it used to be in 1915, the focus in the young ages, but it's much more generalized across all ages now compared to what it used to be. Okay. So I just wanted to again give you a little bit of an idea on how we are able to then understand the HIV pathogen genomics results in the wider context of the data. Results in the wider context of the data that is available and being collected. So I skip over the rest here. I have four minutes to go. We can start to think about the possible mechanism that underpins this H shift. And in brief, the dots with the open circles, they show HIV. They show HIV prevalence in that age group. So, if you focus on the middle plot, for example, age 25 to 34, let's look at 2018. So, we see that about 17% of women are HIV positive in the inland population and about 9% in the men. Now, that HIV prevalence has been, has largely become irrelevant. Has largely become irrelevant because we are now thinking much more of a remaining population bar load in the population. I just mentioned this roughly as a proxy of people who are still infractions. And really the public health success, again, is that is shown in the dotted, in the full dots, which are generally lower than HIV prevalence. So that's the proportion of those HIV-infected participants. Those HIV-infected participants were still viremic, and you can see it's much lower, right? So, there is much fewer people that we have to worry about in the sense that they might still contribute to infections for environment. But at the same time, you can also see very clearly that there have been much faster declines in population viral load in women compared to men. So, women are much less infectious compared to men. Are much less infectious compared to what they used to be, and I've just put in these numbers here. So, if you look at the population by remote values again, let's focus on the 25 to 34-year-old ones, the middle arm figure. And to go from the green, sorry, the blue full dot to HIV prevalence, it's a factor of 2.3. But if you want to go from the actual population where I will note now in women to To prevalence in that group, it's a factor of 4.5. So, relatively speaking, a much faster decline in population viral rate in women than in men. And that could really underpin why we're seeing so much faster declines in HIV incidence in the other gender, so in the men compared to women. And what in this figure I haven't put in is voluntary medical male circumstances. I have one minute to go. I briefly mentioned already that we can think about counterfactual modeling analysis done on the phylogenetically identified source recipient pairs. I will say here just that we've done it. We've investigated different strategies. I will just briefly name them and then maybe leave it for discussion in the breakout room. So we've thought about closing half the gap in demand relative. Closing half the gap in the men relative to women in terms of achieving the viral load suppression that we see in the women, closing the entire gap, or simply having 90, 19, 90 in men across all age groups, or even achieve the new UN AIDS targets, which are 95, 95, 95 in men. And we can see what we can speculate about what impact that may have using HIV genomic surveillance. HIV genomic surveillance. And what we believe is that roughly, if we were to close the gap in man that we are observing, we would, and this is harder to see now, but it's the dark orange curve, and it's really pretty much similar to the dotted line. So the dotted line is the HIV incidence that we observed in men in the last surveillance round. And you can see it's pretty much the same to the dark orange round. So that's the incidence in women that we predict. In women, that we predict if we could close the gaps in men. And I will just get here. How are we thinking about going forward? We're thinking about integrating the deep sequencing into real-time clinical care to monitor and counter exponentially increasing drug resistance in Africa, and that is true. We can then reuse at no cost the phylogenetics to track and trace in real time our local transmission channels. Our local transmission channels. And we can also integrate this into the analysis that I presented to you just now to really respond to changing infection genomics because they do change with this different interventions and the impact that they have on the population. So we have to be on our toes to really think about the most effective intervention programs going forward. And with that, I'd like to thank really everyone involved, especially the health sciences. The health sciences program staff that are operating on the ground, kind of trying to reach out to the households in cases and trying to kind of re-engage individuals in care. It's really a fantastic job they are doing. Of course, all the study participants who consent and agree to be part of the study and our funders. Thank you so much for this opportunity. I don't want to be here anymore. Sally, if you're trying to say something, you're on mute at the moment, or I'm not trying to relay the collapse, but I hopefully all of her heard them. I did, thank you so much. I actually, Leonid, I can't. Actually, Leonid, I can stay a little bit longer because my kids are at home already, and thankfully have been quiet. So, if anyone wants to speak to me in this apparently breakout room number two, I think I'm happy to go there. And thank you again so much. And apologies, I can't be there in person. Fantastic. Thanks very much.
