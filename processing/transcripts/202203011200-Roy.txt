I do know it. No problem. So am I visible now? Now you are visible, yes. Okay, so the title of the talk is the One Dimension Kadar Parisi Zark and Koromotis Yvashinski Universality Plus Limit Distributions. Thank you, Debank. So good afternoon, everybody. So I will begin by thanking the organizers. Begin by thanking the organizers for giving me this opportunity to talk here. So, today I'll be talking about limit distributions in the one-dimensional slightly louder, slightly louder. Okay, sure. So, I'll be talking about limit distributions in the one-dimensional Karthar Parisi-Zhang and Kuramoto-Shivashinsky universality class. Shivashinksky University class. So this is joint work with Rahul Pandit at Department of Physics, ISC. So let me give the motivation behind this work and I will recall a few basic facts here. So fluid flows are modeled by the Navier-Stokes equation, which is the first equation. Which is the first equation, and this equation is often augmented by the incompressibility condition. So, this is which is the second equation. Here, u is Eulerian velocity, nu is kinematic viscosity, rho is density, p is pressure, and f is external force, which can be deterministic or random. So, it was suggested by S. F. Edwards in 1964. In 1964, that a random forcing can be used with zero mean and whose radiance can have power law dependence on the wave number. And typically, but not always, we force Nevier-Stokes equation at large spatial scales. And an important parameter for this problem is the Reynolds. This problem is the Reynolds number, which depends on the typical velocity scale and length scale and the kinematic viscosity. Now, in 1977, Forster, Nelson, and Stephen studied the normalization group for the randomly forced Navier-Stokes and Berger's equation. And then in 1979, D-domination In 1979, D. Dominicis and Martin used the normalization group for the randomly forced Nevier-Stokes equation to obtain Kolmogorov scaling with power law dependent random forcing. And since then, there has been many studies in this direction. Another interesting work is by Sai Manu and Param. By Sai Manu and Pandit in 1998. They studied numerically multiscaling in the randomly forced Navier-Stokes equation. Again, they used Paulo spectrum with Paulo dependent random forcing with P0 equal to zero. Now, in the literature, there are other deterministic and stochastic models. And stochastic models, which are much simpler than 3D hydrodynamical equations. So, the question is: are there such similarities between statistical properties of non-equilibrium steady states of this deterministic and stochastic models? So, one such model is this one-dimensional Kudomoto-Shivashinsky equation. So, this equation is a deterministic model, and its form is given by equation one here. And here, H is interfacial high profile, and L, the system size is a control parameter. This PD was studied in various physical contexts. So, some of them are chemical waves. They are chemical waves, flame-front propagation, and flow of thin fluid films. Now, in this equation, the forcing comes from linear instability. So, if we take Fourier transform, we can easily see that the lower modes are unstable, whereas the higher modes are dissipative. And because of And because of these properties, this PD shows rich dynamical behaviors. In particular, if we take very large system size, then it displays spatiotemporal chaos, which is reminiscent of turbulence. Now, another model, which is this stochastic PDE of Cardiff. This stochastic PD of Kardar Parisi and Sang, which has recently generated a lot of interest. And this equation is given here in equation 2. Here, H is again interfacial height profile and nu, lambda, and d are parameters. And eta is a zero-mean Gaussian white mass. This model was studied by Karthar, Parisi, and Zhang in 1990. Karthar Parisi and Zhang in 1986 to model a growing interface with non-linear mechanism. And I should also mention that the special case when lambda is zero, then the equation is linear and the equation is known as Edward-Wilkinson model. And later, it was found that there are other discrete models which. Which were related to this 1D KPC equation. So, some of them are polynuclear growth model, weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process, and directed polymers in random media. Now, all these models are together referred to as 1D KPZ universality class. And these models in this universality class are characterized by Are characterized by KPZ scaling, which says that for large times, the high profile H is dependent on this linear, is this dependent on a term which is linear in T. And there is also a contribution from a subdominant term which is proportional to k to the power beta kpz and and along with an along with a random component and here v infinity and gamma depend on the parameters mu in lambda and t which we have encountered in the kpz equation here the exponent beta kpz is one-third and it is related to the dynamical exponent which is three by two for the one d kpz universal class and this is also related to the surface roughness or interfacial width which is given here. Which is given here. Now, this random variable chi has different limiting statistics, that is, probability distribution functions for different initial conditions. And here we mention three prominent initial conditions. So, one of them is IC1 or wedge initial condition. For this, we get traceved distribution for Gaussian inventory ensemble of Gaussian inventory ensemble of random matrices. IC2 or flat initial condition gives traceodium distribution for Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. And IC3 or Brownian motion gives Bichrin's distribution or BRLC in short. Now, these preserved distributions have their origins in random metric theory. Random matrix theory. The largest eigenvalues lambda m of n-cross in random matrices, which can be chosen from either GoE or GoE, satisfy this equation. And this random variable chi beta is distributed according to traceodum GOE or traceodum GUE, depending on which ensemble we are considering. And this bicrane distribution, it was. This bicrange distribution was studied in PNG models with external sources, and its relevance to 1D KPZ universality class was shown by an exact solution due to Imamura and Sasamuto. And it was also shown in experiments on turbulent liquid crystals by Tarkiuchi. So, all these universal distributions appear in all the models in the one the KPC universal. Models in the 1D KPZ universal D class as the distribution for appropriately defined height fluctuations. Now, there has been previous numerical studies in which there was compelling numerical evidence that in the spatiotemporally chaotic but statistically steady state of KSPD, the long distance. PDE, the long distance and large time behaviors of correlation functions show a crossover from Edwards-Wilkinson forms to KPZ forms. And the crossover time and length were estimated and the estimates are given here. Now we ask these questions that this universal PDFs, which are well known in the context of 1D KPZ Universal D class, are these disclosures. Are these distributions also present in the spatiotemporally chaotic state of the case equation? To answer this question, we perform direct numerical simulations and we use exponential time differencing method with Rungekutta fourth order scheme for time matching, along with a pseudo-spectral method and two-third DLS rule on a period. Rule on a periodic domain and we write our code in CUDA C and we used these DNS parameters. Now, from our simulation data, we computed equal time correlations, which is shown in figure A, and we also computed time-dependent correlation function, which is shown in figure B. Now, in the context of Now, in the context of this PNG models, the exact scaling function for this time-dependent correlation functions were computed by Plaufer and Spohn. So, we compare their exact result with our numerical data, and we find that our numerical result agrees well with the exact scaling function. Scaling function. Now, to extract the distribution for height fluctuations, we consider these quantities. So, first we check family V check scaling for width W, and this width W is defined here in this manner. And we expect that for a small L, for sufficiently small L. Sufficiently small L, this width behaves as L to power alpha. And when this L is sufficiently large, often taken as large as the system size, this width should behave as T to power beta. And the dynamical exponent Z is related to this exponent and is given by alpha Y beta. And the KPZ values for alpha and beta are half and one-third, respectively. Half and one-third, respectively. Then we also compute this quantity v infinity of t and at the end we should take t going to infinity limit. We also compute this quantity skiminess and kurtosis for the height fluctuations and we define it here. And finally, we will also compute the rescue height fluctuations which we Which we define here. Now, so first we consider this initial condition called IC1 or wedge initial condition, which is shown in figure A. And for this, we find this kind of behavior in initial evolution and it is shown in figure B. So we checked family, we checked scale. So, we checked family, we checked scaling, and we show this in figure A. So, here we find that the exponents which are obtained from family physicians scaling are close to the KPC values. And we also compare the values for skewness and kurtosis with the exact values for traceodum GUE distribution. And we find that the values of skewness and The values of skewness and kurtosis agree well. And finally, we show here the large time, long-time behavior of the height profile. And in figure B here, we plot the distribution of height fluctuations, T-scale height fluctuations that we have defined earlier. And we find that this distribution matches well with the Tracy Dum GV distribution. GV distribution. Now we also consider other distributions which are IC2 and IC3. And for IC2, we get traceodum GOE distribution. And for IC3, we get bike range distribution. And we also compare them with exact results. And we find good agreement. And in this plot, we show all these three distributions together for clarity. Now, in a recent work with Manas Gurukhani at ICTS, we considered this quantity, which is called out-of-time ordered correlator. So, this quantity has been recently studied in, I mean, it recently generated. In, I mean, it recently generated a lot of interest in classical and quantum manufacturing systems. And this quantity out of our time-ordered correlator or OTOC is used to study spread and growth of localized perturbations in these many-body systems. So we define OTOC for Ks or KPC equation in this way. We evolve Ks or KPC height profile. Ks or KPC height profile H naught up to time Ti. We create a second copy HP by adding a perturbation to the original copy. Then we evolve both copies and we consider their difference and divide by the magnitude of initial perturbation. And this is this we call dx of tau and this is the X of tau, and this is the outcome. And this quantity, which we call OTOC, is often shown as a spatio-temporal heat map to reveal different types of dynamical behavior in different parametered regions. So we computed this quantity for both Ks and KPC equation, and we find Otop for K's equation which is OTOC for K's equation which is shown in figure A, and we find OTOC, we also find OTOC for the KP's equation, which is shown in figure B. One thing, so here in red, we show all the values of this quantity o toc, which are greater than t and which are lesser than one, are shown in blue or green, depending on this color bar. Green depending on this color bar. And so here we observe for the case equation that the perturbation initially spreads with approximately constant velocity and then permeates the system almost at the same time. We also observe a similar feature in the case of 1D KPC equation in which the perturbations initially grow and then they permeate throughout the system. Then they permeate throughout the system. So one can guess that this feature that the perturbations permeating this whole system almost instantaneously is due to non-linearity. And this is indeed correct for the KPZ equation. And one can write an equation for the difference between the original copy and the first. And the perturbed copy of the height profiles, and consider an equation for this difference. And one can find that indeed the non-linearities are responsible for this kind of behavior. But for K's equation, it is somewhat different. So, to see this, we linearize the case equation, ignoring the Equation ignoring the nonlinear term. Then we can write an exact expression for the hotock. And this expression is shown here. We found an series as a sum, but we have not found any simpler expression. But when we plot this, I mean numerical. plot this i mean numerically compute compute this and plot this we found we find this kind of this kind of a heat map and here we observe that the same feature is also present when there is no non-linearity term so this suggests that the linear terms in the case equation In the case equation plays a major role in the spread and growth of the perturbations of the case equation. So in conclusion, we demonstrate how to obtain traceodum tracy and traceodum GOE, traceodum GOE, and bicrane distributions in the spatiotemporally chaotic state of the 1D case equation. And this is the first time that these PDFs have been. This is the first time that these PDFs have been found in a deterministic PDE which displays spatiotemporal chaos. We also observed some similarities in how a localized perturbation spread in these two models, though the reasons seem to be somewhat different. And this connection seems to be very interesting. And this is the very fertile area for collaboration between phases, fluid dynamics, and mathematics. Fluid dynamists and mathematicians. So I conclude here and thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? So so you said it's you demonstrated uh You demonstrated the tracy video distributions, different types of tracing video for deterministic equations. So there is no noise in your chaos equation? Yes, there are
