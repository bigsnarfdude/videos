Talking about integrative mediated adhesions in a cross-stock with activized inside scale and all these things. Okay, first thanks for invitation. It is a pleasure to be here. And I'm starting with the old movie made by Louis Kramer showing acting in the migrating fibroblast. And this is a nice movie. You have all features of migrating cells, which you also can see in Which you also can see in this nice review by Lauren Von Schoen and others. And this is indeed quite well known. But to interact with the external environment, to migrate and to do many other things, this acting system should be connected with the kind of some elements of microenvironment. Some elements of microenvironment with the extracellular matrix, and this is mediated by integrine adhesions. So, integrine adhesions actually is nothing else as a peripheral domains of the actin cytoskeleton. And of course, you are familiar with focal adhesions, which are associated with the bundles of actin filaments producing the pulling force and by. But besides focal adhesions, there are several other types of adhesions. And I mainly speak today about so-called fibrillar adhesions, which are very numerous in some cell types and responsible for adhesion of cells to fibers of extracellular assembly. In addition, some cells have Some cells have odasomes, very different types of adhesions, which was mentioned in the previous talk by Vivek yesterday. And sometimes there are some cells that can express all three types of such adhesions upon appropriate signaling. It is like endactalial cells, for example, which we will see. Which we will see here for such cells, it is quite important. First, I give you a general overview of these three types of integraine adhesions. Then, I will speak about non muscle myosin filaments, which appear to be the major players for the regulation of this adhesion. Regulation of these adhesions. And I will try to demonstrate that actually all adhesions are associated with microtubules, but microtubules regulate them via regulation of assembly of mice and phylactines. I will discuss this issue in detail and using capogenetic method you will see how just targeting of Just targeting of microtubules to individual focal adhesions mediate disassembly of these adhesions. And finally, I will compare in detail these fibrillar adhesions and focal adhesions and show that mode of their regulation by myosin is completely different. So let's go one by one. Focal adhesions, of course. Focal adhesions, of course, majority of you are familiar. This elongated several micron lens entities, the aggregates of integrin receptors and many accessory proteins which connect integrin with the silent. We know that each mature focal adhesion is associated with the contractile stress fiber, which produces. Which produces pulling force. And we know the architecture of assistant to terrin and this connection, but altogether there is more than 200 different proteins which make this unit not Unit not only purely adhesion structure but mechanosensory structure. And first indication about mechanosensory function of these focal adhesions was obtained many years ago in our lab when Daniel Riblin kind of made very elegant experiment. He attached micropipette to the upper surface of the cell and then gently shifted it inward parallel. Inward parallel to the substrate, so only this region of cell was under tension, and only there there was a transition between initial dot-like adhesion into mature elongated focal adhesions. This is one thing which is probably the first evidence that focal adhesions could be made. And of course there are data, including our own. Data, including our own, the size of focal adhesions uh very nicely correlate with the substrate rigidity. So focal adhesion indeed responds to the mechanics of the extracellular environment. So function of focal adhesion essentially is mechanotransduction and mechanosetting. Then oda somes, they are very pretty, they as we show. They, as Vivek showed you yesterday, contain the ring of adhesive proteins, exactly the same as here in focal adhesions, but the actin core is completely different. And instead of this bundle of parallel filament, it is actually R23-mediated branching network of actin. And these adhesions are very Adhesions are very dynamic. They assemble and disassemble, so the lifetime of such podasome is about five minutes, while focal adhesions can survive more than 20 minutes. And major function of these podasomes is actually degradation of matrix. Because if you plate cells forming podasomes on the labeled gelatin, for example, and you see Gelatin, for example, and you see these holes where this gelatin is degraded, they are all underneath the core of the podas. Now, fibrillar adhesions, which we did not discuss yet at this meeting. Alexander? Yeah. Can you just say what the size, for those of us that are new? The diameter of podasoma is about one micron. And uh adhesion? Focal adhesions would be Focal adhesions could be several microns in less. But in diameter, are they related? That's what I'm trying to say now. Related in which sense? The focal adhesions, are they related to the podasomes? Well, it is the same order of the size, but podasomes are smaller usually than mature focal adhesions, even though focal adhesions could be of different sizes, while podasomes are uniform. Are uniform, essentially. Of course, they can be slightly different upon different signaling or different conditions, but essentially they are uniform. Now, fibrillary. Sorry, can they turn into photography? It's an interesting question. Other w uh probably other way around, we'll be correct. We observed uh some situations when we can convert focal adhesions into podacy. Focal adhesions into codasomes, but vice versa, I'm not sure. Yeah. Are the focal adhesions different if the integrin is a collagen receptor compared to a fibronectin receptor? No, actually, I do not think that there is a very strong change in spectrum of integrines between focal adhesions and codasomes. I mean, if you put a cell on If you put a cell on a fibronectin-coated substrate compared to a collagen-coated substrate? Yeah, of course, there will be different. In focal adhesions, alpha-v-beta-3 is prevalent, and this is fibronectin receptor. If you plate these cells on collagen, they probably will feel not very well until they produce their own. They produce their own fibronectin. Or if fibronectin is in the medium, of course, this is also fine. Okay, now fibrillar adhesions. Fibrillar adhesions are elongated entities, sometimes longer than focal adhesions, covering the entire ventral surface of some cell types, like endacterial cells here. And they nicely polycalize this fibrous. Polyatalized with fibronic fibers created by these cells. Now, if you look on specific proteins by which we can identify these fibrillar adhesions and distinguish them from focal adhesions, this is, first of all, tensin I and III, which proteins that connect integrine with actin, similarly to tholin. Similarly, to talen, even though terien you can find also in fibrilla adhesions, but the main link between epsin and integrine is tensin rather than tailin. Now, specific integrine, alpha 5, integrine is also a very nice marker of fibrillar adhesions. Now, fibrillar adhesions actually, their role, as I said already. Their role, as I said already, in matrix assembly. And if you look on them, they are also more dynamic than focal adhesions. You see, these lines are greeting and changing their position slightly, while focal adhesions at the same frame are looking completely immobile. So altogether, these three types of focal adhesions perform everything that cells need to deal with the mud. Need to deal with the matrix. It can create matrix, it can degrade matrix, and it can transduce force and serve as a mechanic sensory devices. Now, all three types of disadhesions also are associated with microtubules. And this association, which became clear relatively recently, is mediated like mix. Mediated like this. You have the complex of protein associated with the membrane consisting of essentially four proteins: two isoforms of liprin, a protein called LL5-beta and protein called LX. Now this complex is associated with the cortex and close to the membrane and reprint beta 1 can bind to Can bind to a protein called Kank, which will be one of the main characters in this talk. And this Kank actually, from one hand, can bind terrion, but then it binds to liprien beta-1 and connect this complex to any integral adhesions, because terrien you can find in any integral adhesions. And LL5 can bind protein called CLASP. Protein called CLASP, which is very common end-tracking protein of microtubules. So, via this link, microtubule tips can bind to any integrin and thalium-containing adhesions. In addition, CANC also can bind one of the kinesians, which is also a protein that located at the microtubal tip. So, you have this. So you have this dual association of microtubules with integrine containment adhesions. And you can find a Kung, which is a marker of this link, in all cell types, actually, and in all adhesions. For example, focal adhesions here in this cell, they have this belt shown in green surround Shown in green, surrounding focal adhesions and containing CANK1 protein. Now you see here in this cell, in addition to focal adhesions, there are also some other structures which are positive for CANC. And this is nothing else than fibrillar adhesions. In fibrillar adhesions, you have nice collocalization with their marker tension with cunning. And finally, cell. Can. And finally, cells that form podasomes also have Kan in the ring structure of codasomes. So all these adhesions in principle can bind microtubules and we demonstrated in one of our previous works that indeed cut is needed for targeting of microtubules to focal adhesions and to podasone. So is the binding just at the plus end or is it a long it is essentially It is essentially binding through clasp and therefore it is binding of the ends. And then it's just like in this cartoon, like, you know, like with the plank is like a handful of molecules. Does it seem like that, or is it like we have a real structure of this stuff of the plusness of how it bedded in? Well, this is very dynamic pointing. Essentially, I do not think that microtubules all the time are All the time are linked to adhesions. They are coming and detaching, but without count, the probability of overlapping of microtubules and focal adhesions becoming kind of low, similar to any other place in the cell. Okay, now we have the cytoplasm. Plus ions in the cytoplasm, where they're not attached to the membrane, do you also see tank at the plastic? Of microtubules. Of the microtubules? No, tank localized to adhesions, essentially, and also dispersed over the membrane in some situations, but we did not see their association with microtubules, even though it involved in microtubal tracking. Now come to myosin, which is Now come to myosin, which is kind of main character here. This is structure elimination microscopy on non-muscle myosin filaments, which permit finally to see individual mini filaments in non-muscle cells. It's labeled with the myosin-like chain and therefore the neck where myosin heads associate with the myosin tail. Associated with the myosin tail are labeled. So individual filaments look like two dots. And you can see here how these two dot type structures, which is individual filaments, form at the leading edge of the cell and then incorporate in the pre-existing stack-like structures, which is really very beautiful. And you can see even more beautiful pictures of these stacks. Of these tags, yes. What is the scale here? The length of mini few mm is 300 nanometers. So you cannot see it using regular microscopy. You need super resolution microscopy and SIM is perfect method for visualization of my issued findings. And finally, I'm not going to discuss here how these stacks are formed, even though we published. Affirmed, even though we published with Sam Saffron some models that maybe can explain it. What I want to emphasize is that these structures are highly dynamic. Here I remind you how formation of myosin filaments is regulated, and this is due to phosphorylation of myosin light chain. Only if myosin light chain is phosphorylated, the myosin molecule. The myosin molecule can assemble into these filaments. And this phosphorylation can be mediated by several enzymes. One of them is very well known, myosin-like chain kinase, which depends on calcium. But probably most important is rho kinase, which is not only phosphorylate by itself the same residue as niosin-like chain kinase, but it also phosphorylate and inhibit. Servate and inhibit myosin-like chain phosphatase, which is always removed the phosphate from the myosin-like chain. Therefore, rokinase is really master regulator of myosin-like chain phosphorylation and therefore assembly of myosin fuel. If you inhibit this raw kinase, you can immediately, in several minutes, disassemble all myosin filaments. Look. Myosin filaments. Look, we add drug, no myosin filament, we wash it out, they appear again. So, this is very important experimental tool that we broadly use. Now, rho kinase, in turn, of course, is activated by a small G protein rho, which in turn is activated by a series of so-called So-called g-protein exchange factor, and among them, there is one which is most important for us. It's called GAFH1. GFH1 can activate raw and therefore initiate all these cascades. Now, why it is important for us? Because GFH1 is associated with micro-TB. Here you see the cells paying for tubulin and for GFH1. And for GFH1, and you see nice collocalization. And by some reason, when this GFH1 is sitting on microtubules, it is non-active. Why is that? Not very clear. It is not simply sequestration, but probably probability of encountering some inhibitory kind of protein on microtubule is higher for PFH. For PFH1. So, when you disrupt microtubules with nacodazole, DFH1 releases to cytoplasm and undergo activation. And this is what I want to emphasize because it is a very strong effect that you have always when you're disrupting microtubules, activation of rod due to release and activation of FH1. And usually, people of mechanical. People of mechanical community kind of overlook this effect, even though it is obviously the strongest effect. The cell without microtubules essentially differs from the cell with microtubules, not necessarily because it does not have microtubules, but because it has a very high raw activity. Can I ask a question about the rising media damage? What's the lifetime? Time? It's actually, yeah, we measured it and actually published it as minutes. Yeah, and then it's five minutes. We did actually frap analysis and you can find kind of what happened with myosin molecule on individual mediphilamins. The kinetics is, as I said, order of. is as I said order of meanings. Now what is actually most important thing that I want to deliver today? That it is not necessary to disrupt microtubules to activate FH1 and so it is enough to disconnect microtubules from adhesions. So here you have again control cells with microtubules and DFH1. Microtubules and GFH1, and here is the cell with knockdown of cunk. Nice microtubules, they are absolutely not compromised, but GFH1 is released from microtubules because microtubules are not associated with adhesions. And this GFH1 indeed activates raw and increase the number of biosinfilaments, as you can see here. And you can apply. See here. And you can obtain such a situation by either knockdown of calm or knockdown of some proteins belonging to this complex, liprin alpha, liprin beta or clasp. Or what you can do is overexpress the domain of Kank, which interacts with sterlins, so OK and domain, which displays endogenous. Displace endogenous cancer and also disconnect microtubules from adfusions. In all these cases, the situation will be similar: namely, you have intact microtubules, but you have release of BFH1 and activation outlook. Now, I just want to show what is going on with adhesions themselves when you disconnect. Then you disconnect them from microtubules. And you see here the cell that form focal adhesions, and this is myosin. And you disrupt microtubules or disconnect them, but in this case, disrupt. You have a burst of formation of myosin filaments and at the same time the growth of focal adhesions. Understandable, because focal adhesions mechanism sensitive, you pull them strongly. Sensitive, you're pulling stronger, focal adhesions aren't hitting. But interesting, two other types of adhesions respond to this in completely different way. Look at these podasomes. Burst of myosin induced by disruption of microtubules leads to elimination of podasomes. Podasomes simply cannot coexist with the myosin filaments. It is a bit different to what Vivek To what Divek told you yesterday, but I definitely sure that this is what is going on with polasomes and with our macrophage type cells. Now, with fibrillar adhesions, here you have in red focal adhesions and in green fibrillar adhesions. You disrupt microtubules, you have growth of focal adhesions and elimination, gradual elimination of fibrillar adhesions. Fibrillar adhesions. So finally, you have cells full of myosin and lacking fibrillar adhesions and fibrin active fibrillates. So unlike focal adhesions, which are growing upon microtubule disruption or disconnection from adhesion, both codasomes and fibrillar adhesions are disappearing when you have this activation of myosin mediated by the Mediated by activation of the affection. Oh, why singular is I will try to explain at the end of this talk. Now, all these questions. Okay, I should show you one thing which I like very much, and this is how we are trying to selectively To selectively attract the microtubules to individual focal adhesions and how this all working in this situation. So, this is first of all the kind of working hypothesis when microtubule is connected to adhesions, GAFH1 is arrested on microtubule and not active. Then, if you disconnect. If you disconnect, the FH1 is released, undergoes activation, and it leads to activation of raw and rock and formation of myosin filaments, then remodel adhesions, but they remodel different adhesions in a different way. Now, what I want to show what happens if we selectively attracting microtubules to adhesions, and for this we And for this, we kind of develop the following of the genetic system. We express in the cell the two halves of Kank protein. And each of this half is fused with the so-called ILED sequences that can be activated by blue light, and this blue light change the conformation of this protein in such a way that they contact In such a way that they connect to each other and therefore restore this broken link between focal adhesions and microtubules. And now look at this cell. In these cells, this construct is expressed in addition to vinculin which mark the focal adhesions. And then we illuminate only this corner where these two adhesions are and therefore attract microtubules there. Microtubule there. Look what happened. This adhesion starts to slide and then disappear. Then we indeed showed that sliding preceded the disassembly of adhesions. So this is an important point. Now, is it indeed depend on the fact that we attract microtums? Let's do the same experiment with cells without microtubules, be that with micro tumors. Microtubules, treated with narcotazol. So, these are controlled cells. We illuminate focal adhesions light and disappear. We have cells without microtubules, we illuminate, nothing happens. We have cells which were washed out and they again have microtubules, we illuminate here and they slide and disappear. Now, of course, we labeled microtubules. Microtubules using sear tubulin and measured how the overlapping of microtubules and focal adhesions changing upon illumination. And what we found is actually unexpected, because in first several minutes you indeed have a strong increase of amount of microtubules overlapping with adhesions, but then it goes down even Go down even significantly lower than equilibrium kind of overlapping of microtubules and adhesions. So, this is a dynamics that we obtain upon this opta kang activation. Now, interesting thing that for this killing, disintegration of focal adhesions, CapH one, which I mentioned, is critically important. Is critically important. Here you have two cells expressing this option constant: control and cells which actually have knockdown of GAF H1. You see, if we illuminate them, control adhesions slight and disappeared, GAF H1 knocked down, adhesions are not actually not disappeared. Now, GAF H1 and Now, GFH1 increasing Rho. So, can we rescue the knockdown of this GFH1 by simply pharmacological activation of Rho? We can do it using so-called CNO3 drug that was delivered for bacterial toxin. And when we, together with lockdown of GaFH1, treat cells with this CNO3 and then eliminate, we can obtain sliding and disappearance of this. Sliding and disappearance of this adhesion. So, the contractility, the activation of myosin filament is critically important in this process. Here we have some measurements and also important that using the same drug that inhibits raw kinase, we also can prevent this process of disruption of focal adhesions by recruiting microtubules. Finally, local. Finally, look on myosin. This is in purple you have myosin. This is adhesion. In green, it is a labeling of adhesions, which however you will see only in the first frame. Then watch myosin and we illuminated this zone. Now look what happened. At some point after illumination in several minutes, you have concentration of myosin in proximity of illuminated. Proximity of eliminated adhesion and finally contraction which induces this slighting of adhesion and disruption. Actin is also concentrated in this zone and participate in this contraction-driven disintegration of focal adhesions. And if we will look on the time course, first thing will be first peak will be Be first peak will be increase of microtubules and then they go down. Then, second is increase of myosin filament in the proximity of illuminated adhesions, and only after that, focal adhesion itself will disintegrate. Now, we have working hypothesis how such thing happened. This is focal adhesion. It exists only It exists only when it is under tension and biosin is always here and produces this tension. Now microtubule is coming. Microtubule, when it is coming, doing two things. First thing, it sequester GFH1 and reduces the GFH1 activity. Second thing, which is more hypothetical, it brings something which slightly weakens. Which slightly weakening this focal adhesion, but not disrupted yet. Then, as we saw, microtubule is withdrawn. When microtubule is withdrawn, according to what I said, DFH1 should release and undergo activation, which leads to concentration of myosin filaments here in proximity and increase of pulling force. Of pulling force. Since this adhesion is weakened, it leads to sliding of focal adhesion, and since the friction is relatively low, these sliding focal adhesions already not experience force and therefore undergo disascent. This is a model which we kind of translated into simple kind of deterministic model with Alex McGillner. Model with Alex McGill, and this is the flow diagram that actually this model is based on. Dynamics of essential components, GFH1, Kan, microtubules, and twin cooling, more or less correspond to what we see in our experiments. Of course, this system is very good to figure out other players that participate in this process. Participate in this process, and besides GFH1, now here you have two black and red kind of list. Black list is the proteins which are actually we tried and which are not affecting this process, even though some of them were suggested in previous publications. I will not name now on the right side, on the contrary. Now, on the right side, on the contrary, there are proteins that are definitely involved in this process. Here, for example, you have the intensity of adhesions after elimination. In control case, drop down. In the case of nacolazole, when you do not have microtubules, it remains high. And these knockdowns or pharmacological treatment also prevent the disassembly of these adhesions, and among them, And among them, besides knockdown of FH1 or inhibition of raw kinase, also PAC kinase, focal adhesion kinase, interestingly, probably kinesian one, so indeed you need to deliver something through microtubules. APC, very interesting protein involvement of which in this process was already suggested by Bruce Good in several recent publications. Several recent publications, and interestingly, AlphaTat, one which is acetylase of microtubule. So, microtubule acetylation playing an important role. So, this is this part which I'm finishing. And then I have simply to list what I wanted to say here. I wanted to explain the difference between fibrillades shown here and Shown here and kind of in their response to my. And I will not go in detail through slide, but just briefly show them just the titles. Fibril adhesion formation also depends on myosin, but unlike focal adhesion, if you have already existing fibri adhesions, depletion or inhibition of myosin, Inhibition of myosin do not disrupt. This is number one. Number two, this is the nice movie. You have both focal adhesions and fibrillar adhesions and you inhibit myosin formation by the same inhibitor. And you see that focal adhesions disappeared. You will see it in a second. You see it here in the central image. While fibrillar adhesion Image while fibrillar adhesion remain absolutely intact. Second important thing is that if you activate myosin, then you have disruption of fibrillo adhesions. This, as I already mentioned, and we confirmed it in many situations. And this explains the role of microtubules, because microtubule disconnection actually induces Actually, it induces the myosin activation and this leads to disruption of fibrillar adhesions. Now, what is special about fibrillar adhesions and different from focal adhesions? Fibrillar adhesions can follow the topographic clues. For example, here we play that cells on preexisting matrix that produced by some other cells which were Some other cells which were decellularized, and when you plate our cells on this decelerized matrix, the new fibrillar adhesions form along the pre-existing. What we also did is we prepare this electro span nanofibers. Nanofibers in order to mimic these matrix fibers and found that our adhesions indeed form along these structures, but not focal adhesions. So fibrillary adhesions labeled in green here nicely follow these fibers, but focal adhesions not. And what is important that both these processes formation. Processes, formation of fibrillar adhesions along pre-existing matrix or along these nanofibers is actually myosin independent. So if you have this nanopattern, fibrillar adhesions can form along this nanopattern. And then we also showed that. We also showed that not only nanopattern, but just edges of micropattern could nicely produce the fibrillar adhesions following along them and also in but not focal adhesions and also these processes myosin independent. Now fibrillar adhesions similar to podasomes are very sensitive Are very sensitive to membrane tension. If you increase membrane tension, you can eliminate odasomes and you can eliminate the fibrillar adhesions, but not focal adhesions. And this is another way to increase membrane tension. Previous was the hyperosmotic shock, and this is treatment with this beta cyclodextrin. And finally, this process. This process of formation of fibrillar adhesions can be kind of disrupted if you increase membrane tension also on the pattern. So all together it suggests the following idea that what is concerning fibrillar adhesions and probably podosomes. Adhesions and probably codasomes. Myosin is important here as a regulator of cortical tension. So if you increase cortical tension or membrane tension, it leads to disassembly of fibrillar or focal adhesions, but does not affect the focal adhesions. So this is the conclusion, and I kind of want to give credit to people who did it. Want to give credit to people who did it. Julian did all the work related to octa-cung, and Aaron Farucher did all the work related to comparison of fibular and focal adhesions. And the part related to podasomes essentially was done by Nisha Rafik and Yukaka Nisha Mura, and this is published already. And uh Shi Chung, who was the instrumental in Instrumental in making this seam microscopy visualization of myosin theorems. Of course, other people also participate in it and we collaborate with people in MBI as well as many people in other places, including Israel. And thank you for your attention. Okay, we'll take, we can maybe have discussions over coffee, but we need to get our photo done because James is waiting for us. So we'll go out and take a picture. That'd be great.
