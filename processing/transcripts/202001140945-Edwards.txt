I'm not feeling on greatest help form, but I'll do my best to try and explain it. And obviously, do stop me or ask me if it doesn't make sense. So, this is this brand new analysis I did last month for the IPCC deadline on the total Landec contribution to see the MRIs this century. So, I'm giving a seminar on this tomorrow, so I put this Tomorrow, so I put this graphic in for my colleagues in geography and kings. But this is, I'm attempting to make projections for all of this, so both the ice sheets and, as I'll show, 18 of the 19 Randolph Glacier regions all at once. And so, again, some of this is background for tomorrow's seminar, but basically, the idea is really to try and help with the problem that With the problem that glacier projections, glaciological projections, tend to be a step behind climate projections from the IPCC because of the cascade of models that's involved. So, you know, and not just IPCC, but sort of, you know, when I was in the ICTC project, we were making projections for the S-RED scenarios instead of the RCPs. And so that's sort of a typical thing to be using the kind of the previous generation climate models and scenarios. Kind of the previous generation climate models and scenarios because of that lag in the modelling and that cascade of the modelling chain. And also, just generally, there's less of a history of uncertainty quantification in the field, as we know. So, only fairly recently, these quite systematic model intercomparisons, paternal parameter ensembles, and things. So, those are the sort of themes. Of course, we do have this kind of new paradigm, and apologies if I'm not sure which talks exactly have been shown or what. I'm not sure which talks exactly have been shown or will be shown this meeting. But this new paradigm for AR6, where we've got the ISMIP6 and Glacier MIP projects, and that's the data that I'm going to be using in the talk. So we have the Ocean Model into Comparison Project, which I think is about 17 groups, the Glacier Model into Comparison Project, about 11 groups. And of course, this is much more thorough and up-to-date assessment of uncertainties than before. I'm assuming most people are familiar with one or the other or both of these projects. But broadly speaking, Projects, but broadly speaking, more than 200 projections for Greenland, for Antarctica, and for the global glaciers. Sampling uncertainties under climate models, in the scenarios, and in the ice-ocean process parameterisations, which I'm going to go through. And some of those projections are under the current scenarios and models. They managed to squeak in before the deadline to use the SSPs from CMIP6 models. Models rather than the RCPs from the CMC V models at the last moment. But inevitably, because of the reasons I said on the previous slide, there are still those limitations where most of the projections are for the RCPs and for the CMIC-5 models. Not to say that there's anything wrong with that, but we'd like to extend that to the current generation. A relatively small number of the climate models, you know, a few climate models. You know, a few climate models rather than the full multi-model ensemble for each project. And although there was this exploration of the ice ocean process uncertainties that I'm going to mention, it couldn't be done, this is for ISMIP6, it couldn't be done with every model in every combination. So it was a sort of a partial design, a partial ensemble there. Before I go to the details of the model, Into the details of the model ensembles a bit more. The aim of this analysis is to use emulation. And if you're not familiar with emulation, if it hasn't been already talked about much in the meeting, emulation is one of the words given to statistical modelling of computer models, also known as surrogate modelling or meta-modelling, where we are doing this for the purpose of estimating the uncertainties of the model by predicting. By predicting, characterizing the response of the model as a function of its input values, so usually parameter values. And so we do that, of course, so that we can fill in the gaps for different input values that we didn't run the model for. It's just regression, it's just interpolation in the parameter space so that we can fill that parameter space more thoroughly. And this analysis is a bit different because, as I'll show, it's trying to do As I'll show, it's trying to do the whole multi-model ensemble at once. And so the reason that I wanted to have a go at this is the two ensembles are really good opportunities because they have systematically sample, both of them systematically sample global climate projections. So actually one of the inputs that I emulate as a function of is going to be global temperature change rather than model parameters in terms of Rather than model parameters, internal model parameters. And the ISMOP six design also samples these ice ocean parameters, what I've called ice-ocean parameters as well. And in a very nicely done, systematic way, in a very well-defined way, which is extremely unusual in multi-model ensembles. It's often not possible and it's usually not done. And so in this analysis, I'm going to show it's emulating the C. Going to show it's emulating the sea level contribution from the ice sheets and the glacier regions as a function of the global temperature change, and also for the ice sheets as a function of those parameters that control the ice-ocean interface. And then, once you feel like you've characterized that relationship reasonably well, you can take probability distributions for those inputs to sample many values of temperature and iso. Temperature and ice ocean parameters and churn them through the emulator or the emulators to generate PDFs for sea level. Box your core. That's probably an extremely specific British reference box your core. And so the idea with the Gaussian process emulation is that it's just Krieging, it's just the same mathematically as Krieging, but instead of interpolating in space, it's Of interpolating in space, it's let's say interpolating in the input space of the model. And normally, in quantifying uncertainties for models, we would emulate one model at a time, and that looks like the left-hand side, where we have a parameter of the model x is the x-axis. I don't know if using the mouse is going to help much, actually. I can't see it. But the x-axis x, x. But the x-axis there is some parameter of the model, some input value that you vary in your ensemble, and then f of x is the output, in this case C-level contribution, say in a particular year. So the red stars are the original simulations of the model. And then in this case, the picture I stole is showing a mathematical function, a true mathematical function, is the red dashed lines. Apologies if you're red, green, colourblind, but there's the dash line. If you're red, green, colourblind, but there's the dashed lines. And then the Gaussian process emulator will go, is an interpolation, a very flexible interpolation, non-parametric, it doesn't make any assumptions about functional form, that passes exactly through those points. That's the black line, the green line of the emulator mean function is going through the stars exactly. And then it also gives uncertainty estimates, which grow, of course, in between the simulated points. So the further you Points. So the further you are from a simulation, the bigger the emulator uncertainty is. And so those the 95% prediction intervals are grey. So that's the standard when you are emulating a deterministic model. And so the idea here is what you would do if you were emulating a factor stochastic model or Krieg and noisy observations, which is to allow Which is to allow the emulator to not pass exactly through this emulator point. And so here we've got red stars that are a bit more reliable place, we've got multiple estimates effectively, which are noisy. And you'll see in some plots, actually, we have for a given X, we have multiple values stacked for that X in the ensemble. And then the emulator is just going to allow some more flexibility to go through that, otherwise, it's going to have a bit of a meltdown because it's got multiple. Have a bit of a meltdown because it's got multiple observations for one x. So that's the idea. I don't think emulating multi-model ensembles has been done like this before, but please let me know if you've heard of anything. It has been used, as I say, for stochastic simulators and for incorporating just internal variability in climate models, I think, by Daniel Lewis. But yeah, I think this was a case of, you know, have a go and see if it works. Go and see if it works. So, a bit more about the ensemble designs of the data that I'm working with. Glassia MIP was sampling, was using all four RCPs and using a few different, off the top of my head, I think it was 10 different climate models, I can't remember the number, you know, fairly thoroughly for all of the different models, the glassier models, and all of the different regions. Uh, and all of the different regions, and then ISMIP6 was focusing on the top and bottom RCPs from CMIP5, and then also added the equivalent SSPs 585 and 126 from CMIP6 runs. So, all I mean by that is that we have the climate projections from multiple climate models, and then whichever inputs are relevant, atmospheric temperature, precipitation, ocean temperature, this kind of thing, is what's used to drive the ice sheet models. Used to drive the ice sheet models. And then another thing that's relevant for ISWIP6 is these ice-ocean parameters, of which there are three. So for Greenland, I'll show these a bit more detail on the next slide. For Greenland, there's a parameter that governs the retreat of tidewater glaciers. So Donald Slater has a couple of papers on this. I can't remember if Donald's at the meeting, I don't think I saw another list. I saw another list, which governs the retreat of the terminus position as a function of ocean temperature and meltwater runoff, which are provided by the regional climate rule MA. And what's nice about this and the next parameter is that the values that ISMIP6 used were quite well defined. So Donald and others came up with a distribution, a probability distribution for Distribution, the probability distribution for that parameter. And ISMIP6 sampled the median and the 25th and 75th percentiles for the runs. Which is great. So that means we have a good understanding of how that uncertainty relates to the projections. And then for Antarctica, there's a basal melting parameter, gamma zero, gamma here, which similarly a distribution was Distribution was estimated for that parameter, and is MIP6 used the median and this time the fifth and 95th percentiles. Although, as I'm going to show, there are in fact two distributions for that parameter with different assumptions. But basically, that's a parameter that translates the ocean thermal forcing into basal melting for the ice sheets. And then we have what I've called an ice shelf collapse switch parameter. Shelf collapse switch parameter where most of the simulation, the majority of the simulations, or the default was to not have this on, but those that did run had a scenario of ice shelf collapses through the century, which was governed by the predictions of surface meltwater on the shelves governed by the temperature threshold as done by Luke Truscell's paper from the True cells paper from a couple of years ago. So I've just treated that as a switch. We basically have eye cells collapsing or we don't. So the first two of those parameters, the ones with the distributions in a bit more detail, so the Greenland tidewater glacier retreat one, kappa or K, I've put in my paper. There's the distribution there. You can see it's mostly negative values, so that's retreat with increased ocean temperature. With increased ocean temperatures. So the thermal force in there is Tf, and Q is the meltwater runoff in the parametrization, and L is the retreat. And the ISMIP6 runs where the solid black line at around, what is it, 0.1 or 2 is the median of the distribution, and then the two dashed lines are the twenty-fifth and the seventy-fifth percentiles that I mentioned. 75th percentiles that I mentioned. So he generated that distribution, and I've just taken that directly based on a combination of observations and Mar simulations. And then for the Antarctic basal melt parameter, that's this gamma zero at the front of this equation here. This is Nico Jourdain's and others' work, Favier's work on developing a new basal melt parameterization fit. For is MIB6. As I say, basal melting is a function of thermal forcing. In here, you've got TF, the XYZ draft is the key part. The reason there are two components to that equation is because the thermal forcing is taken both locally to the grounding line and locally to the point that the basal melt is applied, and also a regional sort of a sector average with a basin average. With a basin average. And the reason that there are two distributions here is so on the left, bottom left of the slide, there are two different distributions for gamma zero, which are quite separated. So the very thin blue histogram at low values of gamma zero is obtained by tuning to getting gamma zero values that reproduce Zero values that reproduce Antarctic mean basal melt values. So the width of that distribution comes from the observational uncertainties. And then the lower, broader distribution towards the right, the higher gamma zero values, are obtained by tuning, by reproducing the highest basal melt rates under Pine Island glacier. So much higher. So, much higher melt rates, of course, than the Antarctic average. And the ISMIP6 values that were used were the median and 5th and 95th percentiles of both of those two distributions. Well, sorry, of the lower distribution and then the median of the higher distribution. So, what that means is they ran simulations for the three black lines at the bottom end, close to zero-ish, there's a solid and two-dashed, and they also ran the value at the Also, ran the value at the red solid line further up. So, what's that about 1.5 times 10 for 5? And then in the end, nobody, I think, ran the two red-dashed ones. They were sort of further down the list and didn't get wrong. And so, I had a discussion with Nico about what the sort of true uncertainty, if you like, was about that parameter, because obviously those two distributions are quite different and they're not joined up. And what we came up with is to merge them with some heavy smoothing. So, if you look at the on the left-hand diagram, there's a thin blue line, which is a kernel density estimate with quite a broad bandwidth. So, basically, a smoothing that's applied to both distributions together. And then, if we sample that distribution, we get the distribution on the right, which is our kind of merged. Which is our kind of merged, kind of splurged, sort of combined version of the two distributions, which basically says we think it's most likely to be at those low values tuned to the mean Antarctic melt rates, but could stretch up to these higher values which are consistent with the Pine Island melt rates but at lower probabilities. Tanton, is Azorian, if I interrupt, to ask a question? Sure. So the So the delta T basins are tuned for each gamma zero value, the delta T basins are tuned accordingly. Did you worry about that at all when you merged the two? Do you conceptually at least have a different delta T basin? No, and thanks for the question because that's made me realise I'm really running over time here, so I'm sorry for that. I'm going explaining in too much detail probably. No, I didn't. No, I didn't think about the sector-by-sector tuning. I used gamma-zero as an overall metric. And when some models only use the local version, I just used gamma-zero as a broad indicative mode. But effectively, that means that uncertainty gets sucked into the structural error of the models. Thank you. So basically, I emulated, as I say, each glacier region separately. In fact, 18 of the Region separately, in fact, 18 is a 19 because the Antarctic peripherals we assumed were included in the ice sheet, although that's not completely true, as I'll say at the end. One emulated for Greenland, and then I split Antarctica into three because we knew that it looked potentially quite different across the different parts of Antarctica because of the different processes that were happening. So, a different emulator for each year. I wasn't emulating the temporal dependence explicitly, but sort of implicitly by doing each year. Sort of implicitly by doing each year separately. And as I say, the sea level was a function of global mean temperature since 2015 to a given year, and then the opposite ocean parameters where they seem to have some influence. I rejected ones that didn't have much influence with model selection. And I did, if you're interested, I did a leave one out cross-validation, where you leave one of the ensemble members out and predict it with the emulator to check that it's not doing anything too crazy. Anything too crazy and the errors look like they're within mostly the bounds that you'd expect, which is about plus or minus two when you standardize with the uncertainty that the emulator gives you. Can you see me on the screen? You probably can't see me on the screen. I'm not blocking my slide, am I? We can see the slide. So basically, you know, these are not looking too bad. It's a bit difficult to emulate this ensemble, but they're not looking too worrying, I think. And then we can plot the sea level contribution as a function of temperature in change from 2015 to that year. So I'll show the ice sheet regions first. So you can see the blue dots are the ISMIP runs for RCP two point six and SSP one two six, and then the red dots are the simulations under the high scenario, the RCP eight point five and the SSP. And then the lines, so for Greenland, we can see on the top left, we've got the sea level contribution in the year 2100 increasing as a function of the temperature change between the year 2015 and 2100. And by that, and then by the, and then behind it, the box plots are the emulator prediction basically in bins of half a, no, of one degree, sorry. No, of one degree, sorry. So the emulator prediction of the distribution, the sea level distribution as a function of temperature behind it. And you wouldn't expect those to be exactly the same because the emulator is incorporating all of the melt certainty, which I'm going to show in a minute, a bit more detail, whereas the ensemble is only a partial sample of that. And similarly, for the RCP 2.6, you can see there's less variability because there are many fewer climate models that will run. So there's only two. That will run. So there's only two temperature samples at that low end, whereas there are lots under 8.5. And then you, so that's that's the sort of nice expected story. You know, you warm Greenland up, you warm the world up and Greenland melts. But for Antarctica, it's less clear, to say the least. West Antarctica is the top right. There's not much temperature dependence really there at all. East Antarctica, the bottom left. Eastern Talto in the bottom left, you've got a slight decrease in the sea level contribution, the negative sea level contribution. In a warmer world, of course, this is the increased snowfall effect. And then for the peninsula, again, not much dependence. And I'll mention that again a bit more. And then, you know, I haven't put the emulator behind this, but this is the same kind of idea, but for the key melt parameters. Parameters. So in the top left is the green contribution in the year 2100 as a function of that melt of that tidewater glacier retreat parameter, k or kappa, which remember was so the more negative values means more retreat, means more sea level contribution. And then on the right hand side we've got the two plots where the parameter made most difference in the projections. We've got the We've got the melt parameter gamma. When you increase it, you increase the West Antarctic contribution, but not very much the East Antarctic or the Peninsula so much. The grey dots are where people didn't use that parameterisation, they used their own, and they had a much wider spread and they had some negative sea level contributions there. And then the bottom is the peninsula showing the effect of the collapse scenario. So when you start collapsing ice shelves, you get you go from Collapsing ice shelves, you get you go from naught to one, the switch goes on, so from the dots to the stars, and you increase your sea level contribution when you have ice shelf collapses, but not very much in western East Antarctica, mainly in the peninsula, because that's where most of the ice shelf collapses are, I think. Those are the things that are driving the projections, and then once we've got the emulator, we can take prior distributions, as I say, for the uncertain inputs. So, on the left-hand side, we've got temperature distributions. Hand side, we've got temperature distributions in the year 2100 from the FAIR simple climate model. What's nice about having the emulator, one of the motivations was, of course, is that we can do these for SSPs. We're not limited to RCPs, we can do anything we like. So there's five SSPs we used here. There's a big, nice big ensemble, 500-member ensemble from the FAIR simple climate model to sample those uncertainties. So we can crunch those through the emulator. And then these are the distributions for the melt. And then these are the distributions for the melt parameters, isotropic parameters that I showed before. So those all get churned through the emulator. You get PDFs of the contribution to sea level. I'm going to show the ice sheets first and then the glasses. So for Greenland on the left, we've got the sea level contribution at the year 2100, the PDFs for each of those five SSPs. So SSP 119 and 126 are sort of are sort of the one and a half to two degree warming scenarios and then going up through through obviously to 585 is the is the highest the very highest scenario so you can see that that green and temperature dependence that we saw before obviously gets propagated through to the SSPs and then the table of numbers below so I didn't put the the numbers is the the median 5 to 95 percent range and likely range so you can see you can You can see that dependence there. The predictions are wider than the original ISMIP6 because you are sampling the climate and the melt uncertainties more fully than in the original ensemble. And what that actually means is that the PDF width is basically about the same for each of the SSPs. We don't in the original ensemble the RCP two point six is narrower, but that's really because the climate model there are fewer climate models run. There are fewer climate models run, and also because the high and low melt parameter values were not run. And of course, this was only using the 25th to the 75th percentiles, whereas I'm using the full distribution. And then the Antarctic, there's basically no scenario dependence because of a complex interplay between the surface mass balance and the dynamic components. So you saw the East Antarctic sea level fall contribution and Contribution and battling against the West Antarctic and Peninsula sea level rise, and that relationship is very dependent on both the climate model and the ice sheet model. And in this particular ensemble, it all seems to average out to effectively no scenario dependence when you emulate the full melt distributions and the full climate distributions. So you can see the table of numbers at the bottom is basically the same for every scenario, but slightly shifted higher. Slightly shifted higher than ISMIP6 because of that use of the full melt distribution rather than mostly the bottom. Just quickly moving on to the glaciers, mostly, remember this is now only looking at the contribution as a function of temperature and there's no melt parameters. So this is the same the sea level contribution of the year 2100 against temperature again. Against temperature again, but there's no need to do box plots because it's just effectively a Gaussian. So, this is the one and two standard deviation lines about the mean prediction. And the emulator finds that the glasses are mostly quite sort of linear in temperature. I've put here the four biggest regions in terms of sea level contribution that's marked here, which are all about half a centimetre in year 2100 per degree sea change by the year 2100. By the year 2100, they don't go through zero. But that's not true for all. There's a couple of regions where they look a bit more complicated, a bit more of a threshold response. So you can see those examples there where remember Glacier BIP had four RCPs. We've got more information about the scenario dependence in the original ensemble. And so you can see that shape coming up there. So the glacier PDFs look like this. So, the glacier PDFs look like this. The left-hand side is the full glacier contribution, apart from the Antarctic criterals, as I say, which are assumed to be included in the ice sheet. So, you can see there's a scenario dependence there, and you can also see that the width of the PDF increases with the temperature with the scenario. And that's basically because the glaciers are fully, the dominant contribution here is the temperature, and because the temperature. Here is the temperature, and because the temperature distribution is increasing in width for the higher SSPs, it does the same for the glasses. So, if we knew the higher SSP temperature better, that would decrease that uncertainty. And then I just put in the two regions that had a bit more of that threshold response, these ones, Central Europe with Caucasus here. And just to show that that threshold response means that you get a slight separation in the SSPs. So, those bottom two. Please. So those bottom two that are sort of Paris Agreement-y scenarios are a little bit lower and a bit separated from the ones that are equivalent to RCP 4.5 and above. Tamson, we've used up essentially the discussion time. I think I'm basically done. You're basically done. Okay. Basically, because so the bottom line is that you can put all these together. The bottom line is that you can put all these together in a consistent way to make a total Landeis projection and use the same global mean temperature for each Landeis projection through the emulator. I didn't really finish my key results slide anyway. I've said some of it. You can break down the uncertainties due to the different components a little bit. And that was it really. So just very sort of early days on me getting used to even explaining different balances. To keep them explaining the balances, but yeah, that's perhaps the we can talk about the final slide if you if you have another minute, but don't worry if not. All right, thank you very much. Take a quick question. Can I just ask? So, yeah, you have put you've looked at these particular ocean parameters, including an ensemble. Different distributions of those. And I'm wondering whether you are planning to extend this to sort of variability in other parameters as well, and whether that's possible.
