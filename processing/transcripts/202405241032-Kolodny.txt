Not in the literal sense. It's been an amazing week and it's one of the first conferences I went to where everyone seems really open to discuss what they're doing and open to listen to feedback. So thank you, NOAA, and all other organizers for making this happen. I was supposed to talk about modeling cultural demographic interactions among historical corporations, but in light of what's been going on, I decided to switch completely to a different topic. I still have Nanotaz as an example, but I want to talk about the utility. Example, but I want to talk about the utility of agents-based simulations, which I think maybe I underappreciate because I was about to say none have been even mentioned throughout this whole week, and then this morning ruined my whole training. But I would like to point out... So part of the point of this workshop is to get us to know each other. And so I'll try to give you a taste of what we do in the lab through, by going through several five, if we have time, vignettes, each of them just touching upon the question, how we approached it. Touching upon the question, how we approached it, and what we got out of it, but all tying together to be demonstrations of how and where I think agent-based donations can be useful. So, Y8007. Sorry? Agent-based donations? Come on. So we'll get to 07 later on. Well, he's actually featuring in it. My lab does a broad range of things. My lab does a broad range of things. We do empirical stuff, analytical stuff. But today, all of the things that I'm going to show you is from the agent-based technique and from different time periods and so on. So I'll start with even a profound question that I'm trying to throw out like. What are we all about? I think we're not all about techniques. We're not about specific biological questions. I think what we do have in common, and this goes back to what Carolyn talked about, is that we do modeling. About is that we do modeling, and modeling is a way of thought. That I think is what characterizes us, or I would like to think characterizes us. And that includes things like constructing land models and trying to distill the core principles and ignore all of the rest, or appreciate what's first order and what's second order, what's more less important in which case. Looking at Cosati, not only at correlations, so using maybe statistical correlation methods, but to ask about the actual process going on and sometimes other things. And sometimes other things. And I'll jump into the first vignette. Why did nanotas go extinct? It's basically the question that people have been asking from the day that nanotas were discovered. And there have been many explanations offered. For example, there could have been an environmental catastrophe or an epidemic that killed them off. Or maybe modern humans coming out of Africa were better at collaboration or were smarter and had this cognitive ability that allowed. Had this cognitive ability that an artist didn't, or maybe they had clothes and other technologies that they didn't have, and so they were outcompeted. I'll follow Troy's example. What do you think about these ideas? And having referred to what Troy just did, I'll cite him, it's a shitty conclusion with respect to the effect of this distribution. In particular, the Sander-Raym theorem tells us it would be really hard not to get this result. Where I'm going is, people have been working on this for Is people have been working on this for 120 years, maybe 150 years? But when I asked, I asked Mark, what's the null model? What do we expect would have happened when modernist came out of Africa? And the answer was, no one seems to have explicitly sat down and set up a novel. And view figure one, they do the same. They're as good as cooking. So, what I did was set up a situation where whether it's Situation where weather is perfect, both species are as guilt to a neutral model and ask what is expected to happen. And this goes back to 007, our agent, and his assassin. They're fighting each other on the roof of a moving tray and going back and forth. What does this remind you of? A random walk. You're doing a random walk on the roof, right? With sticky ends, in the sense that once one of them falls off, That once one of them falls off, that's it, game over, right? However, it is 007. So, what actually happened? There needs to be a second movie. So, what actually happens is when the assassin falls off, if we reach one of these sticky ends, the assassin falls off, and that is game over. But if we don't, somehow James Bond manages to hold on and get a second chance. And I would argue that that's sort of the situation with moderns and Nagotals, where they would have been engaged in this completely random block, like two elites and a single genetic token. Like two LEAs and a single genetic locus between Africa and Europe, so every time, you know, going back and forth potentially. But ecological reasons that I'm not going to go into seem to have created a situation where migration is either unidirectional or strongly biased to be unidirectional. So moderns, like James Bond, get a second chance every time they try their luck and go extinct, but nanotones don't. So it's obvious, yeah, I mean, this suggests that the non-model should be that the nitroton should go extinct, and then the current. Be that the narrator should go extinct, and then the question already addresses to: did this happen fast enough? Right? Did this happen faster than we would expect given a drift scenario? And so this can be easily modeled and simulated and actually use agent-based simulations to do this. One of the advantages of doing this using agent-based simulations is that it's much, much, much easier to communicate to the community of archaeologists that ask these questions. Because there's no scary math. We can actually look at lineages on the screen. Look at lineages on the screen right now, or the demonstration of what the solution does. And actually, it took me quite a while to wrap my mind around how do I actually do another hypothesis testing in this kind of setup. So I found myself reconstructing an actual distribution and looking at the actual where the threshold of 5% is, like reconstructing what a significance test is. Yeah, so this is vignette number one. Yeah, so this is vignette number one. It was pretty brief. I didn't motivate it too well, but hopefully you got the wisdom. And I want to talk now about a second project also oriented towards the archaeologist community where we're interested in the question of connectivity among prehistorical populations. This is a study led by Yotam Benarit. He's in my lab. He's showing middle-aged stone tool that we found in one of our lab hikes. Of our lab hikes. And the question is: you have two assemblages of material culture from different sets. And you're interested in the question: how much connectivity was there between them? They're contemporaneous. Like, say, 100,000 years ago. What would you do? How would you estimate the connectivity between them? FSD, but on what? On these tools, right? You ask, so in a blunt way, you ask how much overlap. You ask how much overlap you have in the assemblage of tools, right? But actually, that's a sort of a funny thing to do because, in reality, you have categories of tools that behave very, very differently in their trajectory through the population. So, let's imagine you have one trait, this is just an illustration, which shows on purpose not to have illustrations with stone tools because then we would get in trouble with the details, with the actual archaeologists in the crowd. And so, there's one cultural trait. One cultural trait is how you tie your shoelaces. You have multiple ways of doing it. The other is a specific type of knife. So, putatively, one could argue that you have an adaptive tool and a neutral tool compared to alternatives. A new knife might, you know, let's imagine that in this case, it's an illustration, provide some actual benefit. And so, the probability that it would actually establish and spread. Actually, establish and spread following a single event of migration from one population to the others, you know, if we assign selection coefficients, then it would be to S. The selection coefficients don't exist, one isn't here. I'll use it despite the fact that it doesn't exist. But you can imagine that from the perspective of this knife, there's full connectivity among populations even if there's just one migrant per generation. However, for this neutral trait, the probability of spreading to another population is super low if populations are reasonably sized. Are reasonably sized. And so, when we're looking at this bag of all of the traits that the populations share, we're looking at actually two very different categories, or maybe it's a spectrum, right? Like maybe a dichotomous distinction, but doesn't necessarily have to be like that. And we, this isn't even, no, it's embarrassing to call it a model, but we can simulate this really easily to demonstrate this idea and show that neutral values basically barely spread in the same conditions. The only difference is the selection coefficient, whereas Coefficient, whereas selective traits or traits that have selection coefficient, which is not nearly neutral, spread and you have sweeps, you have everything up. And so we demonstrated this really nicely. And this should have implications for how archaeologists think about their data and how they analyze computing populations. So this was interesting. We presented it last year. We presented it last year at the annual conference of the Prehistorical Society in Israel, which is pretty significant. There were 150 people in the audience. I was really scared how they would accept this, but it was accepted with great enthusiasm. I was really surprised. It was super positive. So it seems like we have things to offer to this community by bringing what seems to be completely trivial to everyone in the room and applying it to the kind of data that we're doing. And applying it to the kind of data that it is. And doing it with these visual illustrations again was really helpful. Skipping to vignette three and four. Another reason to carry out agent-based simulations is that it really forces you to understand and it forces you to make decisions. You need to implement something, you need to decide how you make the decision. And so, I'll start with the question: what's the strongest semi-implicit assumption? Implicit assumption, maybe not it is known, but it's often forgotten assumption in the right-fisher model. In your opinion, it's you know, there are many assumptions. Each of you just can like one the most. That could be one, but actually, that's one well acknowledged, right? It's glaringly obvious that that's a difference from reality. I would think that the most implicit assumption that it's easy to miss is that there's proportional selection, right? Proportional selection. The number of offspring you have is proportional to the payoff you gain, your fitness, the payoff you gain. But actually, reality is probably way more like this. So, if this is the payoff you gain throughout your life, say you do many foraging bouts and you have to then translate them to offspring, so below a certain number of successful foraging bouts, you won't reproduce at all. At the other edge, above some limits, it won't help you to get more food because you're so fat that you have nothing to do with it. Have nothing to do with it. And so, in between, it needs to be some more deliberate. And if it's this way, that actually has huge implications for anything that has to do with noise and variance, right? Risk-taking. Let's go to an even more extreme scenario. Oh, yeah, so I did this. I studied how monsters make decisions. And risk-taking in green monsters, they became yellow in this presentation, and with huge implications. I'll talk about that in a moment. What would the fitness function look like? What would the fitness function look like for an ibex? Radius? You want to be faster than the predators, but once you're faster than the predators, being even faster than the predators. So that's one important thing. But the other, you just think about viability selection. But with respect to reproductive success, there's going to be one male which is going to have a harm of females, maybe 12 females, and there are going to be a bunch of young males that won't. So it's a winner-takes-all. So, it's a winner takes all. And so, effectively, the fitness function is just a truncation selection function, with only the, say, 10% best-performing individuals reproducing, which would have huge implications for these monstrous risk-taking decisions, right? And effectively, you can get any result you want, or any result across the board can be what we expect would occur, depending on the structure of these fitness functions, that we often don't discuss at all. We often don't discuss at all. So, yeah, so this has implications far beyond risk-taking, right? Any kind of noise is implicitly risk-taking. Anything that eventually feeds into reproductive success and is noisy will eventually so this suggests that there might be a pretty large group of cases that we think are sort of solved and could benefit from revisiting. Could benefit from revisiting. Another advantage that we have in IGBS simulations is that it allows easy comparison between alternatives. So if I were to set up a mathematical model for each of these fitness functions, I would need a different approximation. It's even just, you know, characterizing them. I can't just draw by hand something or come up with a bunch of points that are not, I don't know how they're described mathematically and implement it. But here I can. So at least at the Here I can. So, at least as a first step, I would argue that this provides, can provide quite a lot of intuition about what's going on before doing any heavy lifting of analytical solutions for you. And also, you can track the fate of single lineages, sometimes helps you get an intuition about what's actually happening behind the scenes under the hood. Via number four, how am I doing on time? Oh, there's no video length. How would you model migration? Would you model migration? Imagine a situation, this is a preprint, imagine a situation where we have this grid of sites. The green sites are natural nature reserves. These are party blocks, the blacks. Nothing can live there. And then you have these questionable sites that are artificial, and we can set them up or decide not to, but it's a real decision-making problem that the wildlife authorities in Israel have. We can set up artificial sites that might. We can set up artificial sites that might act as a seasonal pond and allow production of these toads or these newts. Or we cannot. Why wouldn't we create them? Because we're worried that they might be in a collagen trap, a situation where the site emits the cues of a high-value site, attracts individuals who try to reproduce there, but then it fails. For example, it drains too early or it accumulates pollution because it's near to roads, things like that. And the question I want to do is. And the question I wanted to ask in the study is: which species would be more at risk from such sites, or which species might actually benefit from them? And the assumption is that even bad sites, once every 10 years, there are just here with lots of rain, and then the toads can reproduce them, or once every five years. But the question is, are the toads going to overall benefit from this or not? And are the meats going to overall benefit from it or not? What's the difference between using toads in this context? That each toad in Israel, right? Each toad in Israel, we have the bandit newton, we have the green frog, each batch of eggs has like 8,000 eggs in it versus between 20 and 50 eggs. These are the typical, between 20 and 50 eggs per female in the news. So they are selected to different extents. And we also compare to four offsprings. What do you think, intuitively, what do you think would the result be? Like which species would suffer more or benefit, potentially benefit more from addition of artificial sites that are sometimes okay but sometimes terrible? Why? Because if it's successful it has more offspring than the other blood surface. Exactly. So in more ecological terms, these sites are going to reach carrying capacity regardless, right? One pair of toes multiply reproducing there demographically. Let's put the genetic diversity aside for a moment. Genetic diversity aside for a moment, I'll get to it in a second moment. But demographically, at least, each of these will reach time capacity even if just one pair of toads are produced there. Even if we lose hundreds of toads to these bad sites or intermediate value sites, it's still fine. Whereas if we're a case-letter species with only four offspring, losing potential reproductive success to these bad sites is terrible. And we can, you know, it has some non-linear Things going on, and this is for the highly focant species, this is for the case of species with low focality, and these are the population size as a function of how many traps, potential ecological traps we have, and the fraction of good years. So, fundamentally, you see that the case species does well only if all of the years are good. Effectively, if the artificial sites are never ecological traps, otherwise, it actually is at risk because of this manipulation that. Because of this manipulation that we did. But what I brought this whole story for is not for what comes out of it, which is the main point that I want to talk about with ecologists, but rather how would you model migration here? Migration can be super important. I thought, oh, a side benefit of these sites could be that they act as stepping stones, right? So we're increasing connectivity, we're allowing extinction equalization dynamics, maybe gene flow, maybe increased gene flow, which might be important. So how would you model this? So, how would you model this? There are two trivial things you might do, right? The first two is: if this were a mathematical model, we'd say, okay, there's a probability of M for each individual or overall population-wide of migration between every two D. That might or might not consider the individual level. So, if we define it at the individual level, that might be different from the population level, that might be a complication, but we can solve it. You might say also, well, it may be a function of distance, right? Maybe a function of distance, right? But if you carry out the entity simulations, obviously you could consider these options. But there are a few other trivial things to do, which in a mathematical model we probably wouldn't consider. The best of X sites visited. You can carry out that really easily with an agent, but it's harder to do mathematically. Or the nearest good site, not just any nearest site, but rather you survey all the individuals, surveys all the nearby sites and chooses the best one. Or it could, you know, toss a coin, choose a direction. Choose a direction, walk until they find a suitable site. That's actually probably a reasonable thing for a toad to do. They can't fly up in the air and say, Oh, there's a good one there. We'll just do a random walk, but you can also simulate that as a straight line until it hits a good place. What would the impact of these different decisions have? What is the impact that these different decisions would have on the connectivity, on gene flow? So you can get the exact So, you can get the exact opposing results. So, if you choose this one, effectively, the fewer good sites you have, the fewer stepping stones you have, the better homogenization you have, because every time they walked far. Which initially I was like, oh, what's going on here? But very quickly I realized it. And this can be a real thing. It's not an artifact of the model. Maybe this is actually what happens in nature examples. So, having to implement this helped me realize that there are the devil in the details. That they're the devil in the details, and the details really matter in some of these cases qualitatively. It can lead to the exactly opposite result. So yeah, these are the spices we all talk about. I love it that this term became a thing. And they make a difference between sort of brand food and all the rest. And simulating them in this way allows you to play around. Them in this way allows you to play around and explore much more. So, again, as a first step, I would encourage everyone to do this kind of thing if it's possible. Surprisingly, we have time. I've been talking very fastly. So, I want to present a study that's still in progress. Timothoper is leading it. I recently discussed this a lot with Johav and Gimmy. And it has to do with accumulation of the question of accumulation of the deer's alleles. And the assertion that I want to make that it may be. The assertion that I want to make that it may be reduced compared to what we would think in highly flucian species compared to, again, we're going to this R-selected versus K-selected species distinction. There's a, it's not, so deleterious alleles immediately invokes the definition of deleterious alleles that is used in a redfisher model, and it's not necessarily what we mean. What I mean is simply that if I have, if I'm looking at two individuals, one with one allele and the other with a second allele, they have a different probability of survival to adult. It's deleterious. It's deleterious, but not without all of the carry-on stuff that's already accumulated to this term in the context of our fishing model. And here's a time to go for a shout-out for Crayfish, an amazing pet, and also for child labor and research. As long as you don't release it in a place where it's not supposed to be, it becomes invasive. So, also a great model system for an invasive species. We just have a bunch of these happening in parallel, seeded separately. Parallel seated separately in Israel, it's like a perfect setup for a step. It's a terrible conservation issue, but a perfect setup for a step. So the model is super simple. We have population, initial population with two alleles, and then we have this process of reproduction of esphytodes, and each of them has X offsprings per adult, and then there's a pool of offspring of edX individuals, and selection occurs, we end up with a population of the same size. We end up with a population of the same size, right? So, steady-state population size. And the question is: how does the accumulation of such anterior alleles that change your probability of reaching adulthood change as a function of x? So, I will compare one species that has 10 offspring per individual to 10,000. I won't be looking at x equals 1 because then what happens? There's no selection because there's no overproduction, right? So, going back to Darwin, it's necessary for that evolution to occur. Necessary for that evolution to occur, we need variegation in the population and over a production. Go back and forth. And so, how do we carry out the selection in this step might actually matter, right? And so, if we just do right fisher sampling, we'll get a we'll get no difference between as a function of x, I won't do y, but it's Of X, I won't go with Y, but it's easy to see. I'll show you afterwards why. But we ask ourselves, how does it actually happen? And I think the way it actually happens is one by one they get predated upon. So there's a sampling here with no return. And we end up, gradually, the population of offspring decreases until it reaches N. And N can be 1% or 0.1% of the initial pool size. So there's an interesting So, there's an interesting sampling process here, which is not captured by the standard models we use. Kitty actually came up with an analytical derivation for it. But we end up with a small number of individuals that survive, and that's our provision for the next step. And what we find is that there's huge dependency on X with respect to how many dilators that means you accumulate. So, this is the fixation rate. How do we start with a 50-50 chair? 50% of the alias. 50% of the alleles are deleterious, 50% are healthy, and we ask how many of these reach fixation. And we get that for a population of 30 adults, for example, if we have 10 offspring per individual, we have like 66% fixation. But if we have 10,000 individuals per individual, we have a 90% chance of fixing on the right in the proper allele. Of fixing on the right and the proper allele. Selection becomes super efficient despite the fact that the population size hasn't changed. And that's currently usually not taken into consideration in population viability assessments, for example. Okay, so a few do's and don'ts. And with that, I think we'll finish. I want to cite Daniel for saying, wait, isn't the upside down here or the backwards E? So models, I think, are more about their existence. Are more about their exist cases. So, going back to Caroline's definitions, it's more of a proof of concept than a proof of actual what happens. And they're super important and useful for null models, for example, but they're not very good or not sufficient to say this is what happens. And this goes to the last point I want to make here. We need a very modest interpretation of our models, not only agent-based one, all of them. And they need to be validated and sort of do lots of science. Validated and sort of do lots of sanity checks about whether what we actually get eventually really makes sense and can we come up with tests that will validate that. The worst thing to do when you're doing agent-based modeling is to throw in, toss in all of the things you think might be going on, because then you lose tractability and it's completely covered in covered out. The number of papers that are reviewed that are like that is ridiculous. So never do that. Try to really distill the principles and put in only them or add on the rest. Only them or add on the rest of the stuff later. So, the important spices first, the secondary spices later. Thank you very much. I'd like to thank my lab. I have a great group doing a broad range of things and wonderful collaborators. And I'm thanking you from the standpoint. As we wish. I think what you're trying to say on that last semester. What you're trying to say on that last summary slide is that agent-based simulations used in the way that people use other kinds of models is a productive enterprise. But it's kind of the opposite of how agent-based simulations have usually been sold, which is as a way to include everything that you could possibly think of in the novel. So it's like agent-based simulations in the style of this. The style of this.
