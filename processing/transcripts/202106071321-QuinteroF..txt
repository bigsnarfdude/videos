My collaborators, that's Professor Cook and Dr. Zhao from CUNY, New York. So I'll be talking about computation of transient networks of Phoenix dumbbells. And there we go. Okay, so our motivation behind discussing this, a little advanced, there we go, is to model things like worm-like mice cells, mucins, other. Like micelles, mucins, other transiently networked polymers, really in trying to investigate the viscoelastic fluid behaviors like shear thinning, thickening, and banding with a particularity on shear banding. That's one that we were fairly are very interested in with shear banding. And so we're trying to create a computational model that can exhibit these behaviors. Other motivations, of course, are previous macro scale models. Course, our previous macro scale models and mesoscale models. So, our objective, or I guess the overview of this talk is to discuss previous macro scale models in relatively short time. And then from there, just introduce the fixed-length chains, trying to model these chains using a semi-implicit method so that we can have a Semi-implicit method so that we can have a finite extensibility. And then, afterwards, we'll show some results of this fixed-length chain and introduce our breaking-reforming dynamics afterwards, and then show the results of that. So, again, the objective of this is to be able to model transiently or transient networks of dumbbells. In particular, these transient networks of dumbbells are beads attached with Pheny springs. They are finitely extensible nonlinear elastic springs. Extensible nonlinear elastic springs. So we'd like to model these chains of lengths of, or varied lengths, either a dumbbell or a two-spring, that's two dumbbells attached, and then be able to model a breaking and reforming dynamic so that these dumbbells can reform or the two spring can break. And we'd like to track the network topology in time so we can see how the And time. So we can see how these evolve. All right. So previous macro scale modeling is typically rooted in the, or rooted in the Fokker-Planck equation given here. From the Fokker-Planck equation, the macro scale models are averaged up versions of the Fokker-Planck equation. So with the Fokker-Planck, we can average up and we can get the upper convective Maxwell model. Model, if we, and that would be the linear case, if we chose to use a nominal model, we can get things like Geseccus and the Feeney P model, which is the closure for these, or to it's a closure to arrive at a macro scale model. Okay, so with the macro scale in mind, so to model at the local level. At the local level, to model a chain of fixed length, we use a method that Ottinger has used, which is to, on these chains, call the beads location R and their stretches Q, and then the stress is given. And with this modeling, we can add in an elastic force, some F of Q, and a Brownian dynamic, which would introduce. Brownian dynamic, which would introduce the local Brownian force. So if we were to sum up the forces, we would be able to model this like so, where inertialists, we would have the force from the flow, the force from the elasticity, and the force from the Brownian. So the non-dimensionalization, which is given at the bottom there, I think it's very typical, rather than having an evolution. Rather than having an evolution equation for the bead position, we can have an evolution equation for the stretches and the center of mass. That's QI and these RC sub I. So all of these depend on a Rouse matrix, which is provided there as alpha, and is dependent on the transpose of the gradient velocity, kappa. And depending on which kind of model we want to do, we want to do a little Which kind of model we want to do? If we want to do a linear model, we have the hook in for f of c sub i, which would just be linear. And then what we're interested in is the finite extensible non-linear elastic case, the Feeny case, which is provided on the bottom there. Okay, so with that in mind, we can discretize these evolution equations. These evolution equations, and by discretizing in time, we have for a chain of length. So there would be n beads or n minus one springs, the change in the stretches and the strain in the first center of mass. That would be the center of mass of the first dumbbell along the chain. And from that, we can reverse engineer and we can get the Engineer, and we can get the bead springs or the bead locations along the chain. So here we have to sample delta W, which would be our Brownian force. The delta W's are our Brownian force, which are just a normal distribution of mean zero and either variance of delta T for the springs or just variance delta T over two for the center of mass. So, with this discretization, we use a method that was introduced by or that was used by Samasi where it's a predictor corrector, where in the first step we use a forward Euler and in the second step, we or in the corrector step, we do an explicit step followed by an implicit. Step followed by an implicit step, making the corrector step a semi-implicit step. And this is to solve for the stretches along the way. And the reason for doing this is that the orientation can be determined by the predictor step, this Q predictor. So that'd be the orientation for the next step. And then the magnitude can be determined by the corrector step. And And the reason for using the semi-implicit step is that for a Feeny dumbbell, the corrector step is guaranteed to have a unique solution within zero and Qmax. The reason being is that the semi-implicit step reduces to a cubic for the magnitude. Excuse me. All right. So using this, So using this semi-implicit method, this is for a fixed length chain. So for a fixed length chain of lengths either one and two, we were able to see that there is a fair or a bit of a similarity at lower shear rates, such as at gamma dot equal to one on the top left of the plot. So at low shear rates, the Feeni and the Hookian shear are the structure. And the Hookian shear, or the stresses are fairly similar, but even at a shear rate of five, the Feeny and the Hookian stress curve already start to deviate from each other. So in the region that we're interested in, which would be anywhere up to a shear rate of 100, they're going to be vastly different. So along this fixed length chains on the top right, we see the stress. We see the stress curve for a fixed dumbbell. And we see that the max or the maximum transient overshoot, so it's the stress curve in time. We see that they're attained at the same strain, which is what we would expect for a fixed chain. And then also the viscosity from the simulation equals its zero-shear asymptotics as seen on the bottom left. As seen on the bottom left. All right. So using this, we're using now a Feeny dumbbell and we're able to use this for fixed lengths, but now we want to introduce a breaking dynamic, breaking and reforming dynamic, sorry. So in the breaking, reforming dynamic for the breakage, we have the stress-dependent lifetime. Life or lifetime tau, so from which we can get a probability of breaking. And then the reforming dynamic is since we're able to track the local topology, we're able to say, determine whether or not two beads are within D naught of each other. And if they are, we're able to determine if they're able to reform with probability P reform given there. Given there. So the break and reforming dynamics are based on the potential well that's formed a barrier for breaking reforming. And then with this breaking dynamic, breaking reforming dynamics, sorry, we're able to track the topology of the system. And we're also able to track the components of the chain, which has been done previously, but altogether, this is what we're hoping to. This is what we're hoping to, in turn, just combine. So, the parameters that we're using are based on the parameters that were used in previous papers before. For now, we have in our probability of reforming this beta naught plus beta 1 times some function of q, but for now we're using a beta 1 equal to 0. Introducing a non-zero beta 1 would be something. non-zero beta one would be something that we would look forward to in future work perhaps okay so now the full simulation which we used is to compute the change in q using the semi-implicit method and then from there we'll compute the beat position or each beat position in the system and then for the free dumbbell And then, for the free dumbbells, those that aren't attached, we'll determine if any of the beads are within the capture radius. And then, if so, they reform with the probability given. And then they become attached at the same location. And then, for those that are attached dumbbells, they just break with their probability. So, things to note is that we don't allow for loops, so no self-attachment. And then And then we're only allowing for two types of dumbbells. Either they're free dumbbells where they are able to attach, or they're attached dumbbells where they're able to break. So there's no, we're not allowing attached dumbbells to become even longer by allowing them to continually attach and attach and attach. And then further reforming is done at the ends, at the dumbbells, or at the ends of the dumbbells, so at the bead positions. Okay. So, sorry about that. It looks like there was a small typo there. But yeah, so the stochastic, this is breaking reforming model results. So these are the numerical results for the on the top left would be at equilibrium for the long species or sorry, not the long species, the attached springs. Springs. So for the attached springs, we get a zero shear stress, the sigma xy, which is expected at equilibrium at a shear rate of zero. And we get one for the sigma xx, sigma yy, and sigma zz, again, as we expected. So that's always nice. On the top right is the equilibrium results for the free species. So the comparison between the So, the comparison between the top two plots here is that the top right has a lot much larger variation. And the reason for this is that at equilibrium, when we run this, the number density of free species is very low. Everyone seems to be attached at equilibrium. So, the large variation is just the fact that there aren't very many free species at equilibrium. Free species at equilibrium. So when I run this, I use 2400 dumbbells in a box of volume 500, and we use Lee Edwards boundary conditions to ensure that everything's in the box. And of course, based on the top right, because of that variation, this is our inkling to tell us to run several realizations, as many realizations as we can until it starts to. To seem smoother. And so typically for these, we ran about upwards of 10 realizations to get a decent picture. And then, oh, seems like my last bullet point was cut off. Sorry about that. So the last bullet point is related to the bottom left plot where we required a delta t of 10 to the negative third. Of 10 to the negative third. And so for our regime, which is a delta T, or sorry, a shear rate up to 100, seems like we would require a delta T equal to 10 to the negative third. We didn't go higher than a shear rate of 100. So for this regime or for this region, Or for this region, delta t equal to 10 to the negative third worked out well for us. All right, so as a comparison to the fixed chain, we see that the shear stress on the top left actually does produce a non-monotonic stress curve, which is the implication or which implies the shear banding that we were interested. interested in we have zero shear asymptotics for our first normal stress and then on the bottom left is this n or little n sub little a which is our number density which is the number of attached springs in our box our volume so we see that everything seems at about a Everything seems at about a shear rate of 10, that's where it becomes very interesting for us. We start to get the non-monotonicity around a shear rate of 10. The first normal stress breaks from the fixed 2 chain or fixed length chain of 2 at about gamma or shear rate of 10. And also the number density definitely drops off in a linear log plot. In a linear log plot at about a shear rate of 10. All right, so with that in mind, we decided to vary or focus on a single parameter, which was the parameter of the capture radius, D sub naught or D naught. So with this D naught, actually lowered it from 0.5, which is we started to call. We started to call our standard case as we lowered it to a quarter, a 0.25, which is seen in red here. We see that for the stress curve, we lose that non-monotonicity. For a D naught equal to 0.25, the model becomes monotone. And then this is because if you recall from the or Or, you know, if you can recall from the breaking dynamics in the exponent, there was this d naught squared over u naught times the Feeny force. So decreasing D naught, the effects of that are squared compared to decreasing U naught. And then further, decreasing D naught diminishes the Feeney effects. Okay, let's continue on. So, beyond the steady state, which was previously shown, we also have the transient results. So, on the top left, we have the shear stress curve in transient, and we see that the shear stress attains its maximum at different strains, which is vastly different from the fixed results. The fixed results. Also, of at least particular interest to us was the second normal stress. So, for small times, the second normal stress is positive. And this has been shown in previous works and also has been shown for the fixed length chain. I didn't show the plot here, but we have seen that the second normal stress has this peak, positive peak, and then goes back to zero. Peak and then goes back to zero for the fixed case. But for this breaking reforming dynamic, it has this positive peak and then undershoots below and then at steady state is negative. So we do have a negative second normal stress. All right, so along with tracking the topology, we're able to determine the stresses, or sorry, the stretches, the stretches. The stretches of the model. So at steady state, we're able to show on the top left a shear rate of five, somewhat small, and a moderate shear rate of 20. And then on the bottom left, we have a higher shear rate of 50. And we see that the fixed case does stretch more at higher shears or shear rates. Higher shears or shear rates. And that's because for the model, at high shear rates, the attached dumbbells are confined to a maximum stretch. All right. Okay, so let's move on to some final conclusions. So, in conclusion, we were. In conclusion, we were able to use the Stokesky model, which exhibits shear thinning. That was a nice thing to at least recognize. The break and reforming dynamics does relax the system as compared to the fixed case. And then also the model, the stochastic model with the breaking performing dynamic does show non-monotonic behaviors in the shear stress curve. Shear stress curve at steady state. This non-monotonic stress curve is what implies shear banding. All right, and then so while running this, we found that the mesoscopic simulation is costly since we are tracking the topology, we are tracking the components of the chain that it is costly to run. It is costly to run, but in doing so, in running this mesoscopic simulation, we're able to get some nice results. And then, also, by using this implicit method, which could be considered costly, it does allow for us to avoid the Feeny spring overstretch as we run this. The implicit method does ensure that each spring does not go beyond the maximum stretch that we provided. That we provided. So, with the now that we know that this model is stable and can run, or sorry, not stable, but it's functional and can run. We look to future work which involves that this method will work for other stretches, not just attached up to two dumbbells, but we can run it for instead of a one-two system, we can run it for a two. System we can run for a 2.4 or 4.8 or even with some other added constraints a system in which the dumbbells can attach so that's one two three or one two three four and then further we'd like to introduce a non-zero beta one so that we can have a stretch dependent breaking dynamic and further and this would be Further, and this would be it for the talk. And thank you for your time. Thank you, Lucas. And pretty good timing because we have one minute. I'm not going to ask questions of my own students. So if nobody else has questions, we're going to roll on. I hope people will stay for the discussion. I think there are things here to discuss. So, okay, if there's no other questions, then let's move to the last talk of the session. The last
