So, yeah, I'm going to speak about this problem. We're going to have a discrete lattice, a quadrant, and we're going to apply some force to this and understand how we generate waves and how these waves get scattered by the boundaries of this quadrum. Okay, so the motivation is to try and understand such processes in lattices. Processes in lattices with abruptly changing physical features, and in this case, it happens to be the boundary. So, we have this lattice quadrant, and it's formed from a periodic distribution of point masses interconnected, mass m interconnected by elastic links of stiffness kappa and length L. And we locate the nodes inside the structure using. Structure using indices m1 and n2. n2 here equals minus 1. It corresponds to the lateral boundary of the quadrant, and m1 equals minus 1 is our vertical boundary of the quadrant. And along this lateral boundary, we apply at some point corresponding to m1 star a point force which acts out of the plane of the slide. The plane of the slide. And this generates waves, they propagate into the lattice, they interact with this left-hand boundary, and something happens, and waves go off into the lattice. And we're going to solve this problem using the Wiener Hoff technique and based on a method developed by Anastasia in the last couple of years, which was mentioned on Monday by Matt Nebaco. By Matt Nebicoff. Okay, so to get an idea of what this lattice does, well, at low frequencies, you can take your force, and here we position this force close to the corner of the quadrant because that's where all the interesting stuff happens. You get stress concentrations, etc., at this tip. And you shake it at a given frequency. And at low frequency, what you should expect is. What you should expect to see is something that you would expect to see in the say analogous continuum problem, which for us is the Helmholtz equation posed in the quadrant. You should see circular wavefronts that propagate outwards from the application of the force. And of course, on the left, what I'm showing you is the absolute value of the solution based on the method we apply, I'll show you today. Uh, what I'll show you today, and this is quite interesting because it shows you regions inside the quadrant where wave propagation creates quite dominant deformations in the system. So, anything that's dark red on this plot corresponds to regions where not much is going on in the lattice when you excite this. So, you go along, and you can also look at a real or imaginary part of your. Of your solution. And this gives you the spatially varying factor, which allows you to see the oscillations produced by the waves. And indeed, in that region where you have dark red, you're seeing some sort of interference pattern, which is coming from more than likely waves being bounced off this wall and interacting with waves which are propagating. With waves which are propagating outwardly to the right from this load. And you see waves with a strong, well, with a significant deformation propagating upwardly in the quadrant. Now, this lattice has a, due to periodicity, as a finite pass band with which waves propagate within the medium. And so if you increase the frequency relative to the The frequency relative to the cut-off frequency for that pass bam, you lose that isotropy, you lose the propagation of circular wave fronts, and you start to pick up other strange effects like waves with preferential directionality. And this is a case where we put the force here at M1 star equals 20. And at this particular frequency, waves only propagate. See, waves only propagate in two directions at 45 degrees and 135 degrees to the horizontal axis. So you shake here, you get one ray that propagates into the bulk to the right, and another at 90 degrees to this. And then, as you'd expect, this interacts with the boundary at the left, and you get a reflection of this wave at 90 degrees to your incoming wave. And the two go off together in. Go off together in harmony and parallel into the bulk. Okay, so we are going to try and look at this problem via the Wiener Hoff technique. And just to mention, so quite a bit of a literature review here. So applying the Wiener Hoff method to study wave scattering processes is a sort of well-explored area. And for instance, it goes back to It goes back to Bazal Sharma's paper in 2015, who studied the discrete analogue of the Sommerfeld half-plane problem in the continuum. And in this problem, you have a crack represented by a removal of transverse links inside your structure. You send in some incident wave. This interacts with the crack, and you're interested to know how this wave gets. How this wave gets scattered or diffracted. This problem is solved quite in a straightforward manner using the Fourier transform or Z transform with respect to the direction parallel to the crack. It gives you a couple of difference problems to solve in the upper and lower half planes with respect to that crack. And then you bring everything together and you get a Wiener Hoff equation, which happens to be scalar along. Along the line of the crack. And this can be solved in a standard way. And this method's been extended to look at all sorts of different structures with different physical properties and different defects. So different geometries, hexagonal, triangular lattices, and different defects, rigid constraints. This is an example where we have scattering by the crack, which has a cohesive zone. And I think. zone and I think if I remember correctly this leads to a matrix Vena Hop system in this case which is dependent its size is dependent on the number of links that form a cohesive cell again you can add in physical different physical phenomena try systems with locally resonant properties and this is scattering in a in a lattice due which is formed from periodic distribution Which is formed from periodic distributions of resonators. So that has been done there. And you can study how different phenomena is scattered by the crack. For instance, not plane waves, but rally waves that propagate along the surfaces of the crack and see how they get scattered by the tips of such cracks. Now, I should say that this is the methods used in all of those problems is analogous to the one developed by Leonard Slepian in the. Developed by Leonard Slepian in the 1980s. And this is summarized really well in his monograph in 2002, which looks at dynamic fracture propagation in lattices. Okay, so there you have a crack which actually grows in time at a constant rate. And all the same tricks can be applied there to understand more about such processes. Okay, moving on. So that was about Moving on. So that was about line defects and scattering in those scenarios. If you want to look at scattering by domains, then you can do this. So Shannon and Korolkov studied scattering by a Diraclay quadrant in this paper not so long ago. And using the Wiener Hoff technique. And in this paper, they looked at scattering by a rigid line defect where the solution is written in terms of the Sommerfeld integral. Of the Sommerfeld integral, and they show that this Sommerfeld, this solution satisfies the analogous Wiener Hoff equation that appears through the usual treatment. Now, we come to what's interesting to look at is how waves are scattered by cracks and how they interact with each other inside the lattice. And so, this problem of collinear cracks was studied in this paper here. Here, and this gives you a matrix Wiener Hoff problem that you have to solve. If you want to, so all the problems I've discussed so far concern out of plane waves in these lattices. If you want to study different kinds of wave motion, you can study scattering of in-plane waves. And in this paper, that is studied for the case when you have an inertial defect. You have an inertial defect, and it uses the VNR technique to solve the problem. Now, some more references related to lattice green functions because we have a point source problem. Best place to start or a good place to start is the paper by Paul Martin back in 2006. And the references there where Paul constructs the Lattice-Green's function in the form of a double integral and looks at asymptotics of this double integral. Quantotics of this double integral. And double integrals are a fact of life if you want to solve wave problems in two-dimensional lattices. And more general methods for analyzing or computing those double integrals has been developed in this paper. And again, several computations related to far-field asymptotics of Green's functions have been performed there. Now, if you want to look at some Now, if you want to look at some more exotic things, well, you can take a lattice like this, triangular cell lattice, and attach gyroscopes to the junctions, which couple in plane displacements. And you can excite this thing in plane motion. And what happens is the gyroscopes allow you to propagate waves in only one particular direction. So, this is an example of a Direction. So, this is an example of a Rayleigh wave propagated by a point force on the boundary of a half-space lattice made from these gyroscopic elastic structures. I mean, you can do the same for lambda in the elastic strips as well. So, this is a one-way propagating lambda in this strip. Okay, so back to our problem. So, we have this quadrant, and I'm going to change things up slightly. Going to change things up slightly. In the first slide, I showed I had free boundary everywhere. I'm going to fix the left-hand boundary. And in this problem, well, you could say this can be easily solvable using a method based on something analogous to the method of images. And that's absolutely correct. You can do that. It's just an illustration. Okay, we will look at the case when we have. Okay, we will look at the case when we have a free boundary in a second, which just has some simple modifications. So, this is just to illustrate how the method works. So, in the interior of the lattice, which we represent by these indices satisfying this, we have the discrete Helmholtz equation. As Raphael mentioned on Monday, you can add dissipation inside your frequency term and this allows you to build a physically acceptable solution. Physically acceptable solution. I won't go into details on this, but this is well known. What you'll notice is there's no stiffness, m and l. They've been normalized out in such a way that you can take them equal to unity in this problem. And so the most important parameters is the forcing frequency and the forcing the force position. So we've placed the force. The force along the lateral boundary. And this is the difference equation that governs nodes which are situated along the lateral boundary. We're the forces represented by the Kronecker delta. Then what do we do? Well, we have clamp nodes on the left-hand side of the quadrant, and you can build these conditions into this. I might refer to this going ahead as a boundary, if you will. So you can build. If you will. So you can build these conditions into the conditions governing the nodes along this column of the lattice that is given here, where you're using the Kronecker Delta to account for the fact that certain nodes have different elastic interactions in the lattice. Okay, so this node here has three interactions with its nearest neighbors, where this node and every other node above this has four. Okay, so what do we do to try and solve this problem? Well, we first take a Z transform with respect to both principal directions in the lattice. So we'll start with the transform with respect to the vertical coordinate in the lattice. So we take our equation along the row neighboring the rigid column in the lattice and we apply this. Lattice, and we apply this transform. And so we define these transform functions psi m1 plus, which are analytic functions. The plus means analytic inside the unit disk. Don't worry so much about the details here. I'll explain what's happening. If you apply this transform, one has to have a fight with terms that contain shifts. And also, you need to recognize where you can form yourself. Recognize where you can form your semi-infinite sums, and in doing this process and recognizing where these terms may appear after applying the transformation, what happens is after forming all these semi-infinite sums and recognizing where these psi functions are, you get some residual terms. So, this is an equation which builds in transformed functions and functions and things which are not related to transformed quantum. Related to transformed quantities, so the original lattice displacements, and they're associated with the corner of the structure. You do the same trick with respect to the horizontal coordinate of the lattice. You introduce functions phi, you take the transform of your boundary condition along the lateral boundary, and you get this. Again, the same process gives you this sort of mix of transform terms. Sort of mix of transformed terms and untransformed quantities written here, and this is the forcing and a transform of the forcing written down there. Okay, so we've got two transforms floating around in this problem, and we need to apply those two transforms to the equations inside the interior, in the interior of the structure. So we have this discrete Helmholtz equation. We define this transform function. This transform function, which depends on the two transform variables, via this double semi-infinite sum. And again, you play the same game, trying to recognize how to get things in terms of u. And what happens is, again, you pick up some residual terms now, but these residual terms involve transform functions only with respect to a single variable. So if you apply this, you get this. You get this. And so there are several transform functions in this equation, but all the coefficients are known. And you have this polynomial here, which sits in front of this function here. Now, so we've got, in total, we've got these three equations, and we can go further and reduce the number of unknowns. So by combining these, you can eliminate these quantities in the equation. I think that should say. In the equation, I think that should say phi zero of x. And then you get down to this, which is something similar to what Matt Nevercott spoke about on Monday. You get an equation, a functional equation. You have three unknowns, two transform variables. And the idea is to try and extract, using Anastasia's technique, a Wiener Hoff equation from this. This here is the forcing term in the problem. Forcing term in the problem, and it contains untransformed quantities. And we put up with this as we go through the problem. And what to say? Well, these things disappear, these quantities. So you have everything written in terms of the corner point displacement. And this is because you can use the difference equation at the corner point to make this representation for the right-hand side. So it's a small detail. Now, Now, in the method we apply, it's a good idea to start looking at how you can kill some of these terms. And we start by looking at when this a of xy can be equal to zero. And of course, if this is equal to zero, you kill this and you arrive at this kind of equation where x and y will be interlinked. Um, if you look at this and you put x and y on the unit circle in the complex plane, k1 and k2 are wave numbers, then you get dispersion, a dispersion equation, and this gives you a dispersion surface. And this tells you about the physical properties of waves inside the lattice for variance, various frequencies. So, if you simply take the loading frequency and you plot a horizontal plane such that it intersects this surface, you get a series of contours. And at low frequency, you get circular contours, which is consistent with the fact that you have circular wave fronts that can propagate through the medium when you apply the force. As you increase the frequency, these contours become less. Uh, contours become less circular, and you start to drift to this sort of rhombus here, which is a critical case. And this is this case where you start to have these two preferential directions for wave propagation in the lattice. So, we'll come back to this later. Algebraically, you can take A, write it in this form, where P1 and P2 are the roots of A, and they can be written in this way. This is In this way, this is my attempt at a complex beauty, and this is a map, contour map, where the colour map is the imaginary part of P1. And this function has branch cuts, which is situated outside the unit circle and inside the unit circle. Okay, so just some details there. Now, if I'm using this, these algebraic. Uh, these algebraic roots I can form two equations, right? I can kill that term involving a form two equations and use these two equations to jump to a Vener Hoff, well, an equation for one of the unknown transform functions. Which is a Wiener-Hoff equation we have to solve. This is analytic inside the unit circle, this is analytic outside. This is analytic outside the unit circle and the complex plane defined by X. The right-hand side has a nice symmetry property, but it's not in the required split to solve the equation. So we have to try and manipulate with this now and complete the problem. So this R is in fact this, it's a bit of a mess, and you have your functions sigma and z. Functions sigma and zeta are just written in terms of those algebraic roots of A. So if you just split these, use the usual additive split via the Cauchy formula to split sigma and zeta. You can play with this right-hand side and you can get things into the form required to do the solution to this problem. So here, the left-hand side, this N is now a result of those manipulations. A result of those manipulations. It's an analytic function inside the unit circle. And here on the left-hand side, this is this n and phi minus one. Well, as I said, it's analytic. So this is bounded inside the unit circle. This goes to zero on the left-hand side as x goes to zero inside the unit circle, whereas this on the other hand goes to zero as x goes to infinity. Okay. And you can use the VNARP method to, well, say that this entire function that you can define via these two relations is zero. And you get down to a solution like this at the bottom. But there's still one more step in this problem in that this is assumed to be an well is an analytic function inside the unit circle. And this n turns out behaves like this as x tends to zero. As x tends to zero, but this uh constant up at the front contains well these messy terms, but you'll see this three parameter, the corner point, sat there. And you can use this to kill this constant, okay, so that n behaves like x as x goes to zero. So then everything is as it should be. If you find phi minus one. Phi minus 1. You can use one of those equations we had before to get psi minus 1. And this is the solution written down in this way. And then when you have u of x, y, you well, you go back to your original equation with the three unknowns and simply plug in your psi and pi minus 1 functions. Then it's a case of inverting the z transforms. This one gives you the This one gives you the displacements along the boundary, the lateral boundary, and this one gives you the displacements along the vertical column situated next to the rigid boundary. And this transform here, this inverse transform is telling you about how the lattice displaces inside the bulk of the medium. Right. Medium. Right, so now I promised that we'd look at the case when the boundaries are completely free. So this is no longer constrained. And there's just some simple modifications to this. You have this difference equation now along this column of your lattice. You're doing the same transform. It's all the same technique. There's only slight modifications. You have now a functional equation. Now, a functional equation where the coefficients have a certain symmetry because you've got free boundary everywhere. You've got a different forcing term written like this, where I think before this was a three, now it's a two. Again, you've got that as a sort of parameter that you can use to preserve the analyticity properties of the function in the Wiener-Hoff equation that you eventually get. And there's really no need to concentrate on any of this. Need to concentrate on any of this mess. And yeah, that's your solution, just following the standard procedure. So you can compute the inverse transforms and you can look at how the wave fields behave. Again, we like to look at the modulus. This tells you about regions where you have wave propagation generating high deformations. So we look at the constrained quadrant. At the constrained quadrant and compare it with the free, uh, fully free quadrant. Of course, if you compute this, what you should see if it's constrained is you should see limited wave propagation close to the Diracle boundary, and that's what we get here in this computation. And we have at low frequency, this frequency, circular slowness contours, and circular wave profiles. In the free case, you have some interference here. Interference here, and presumably because this is put trying to push a wave up against the left-hand boundary, and then you have some sort of wave coming back. I'm almost done now. If I increase the frequency, of course, what you get are, well, in the Diraclade case, you get some sort of interference pattern between this in this region, in addition to the sort of clamped the sort of. This sort of shadow region, if you will, where you have the clamped conditions. And what has happened here is simply increasing the frequency has changed the orientation of this interference pattern in the quadrant. You keep increasing the frequency and you get more interference patterns between the waves, as you can see. Slowness contours are becoming less circular. Contours are becoming less circular, you're starting to get flat sides. And if you take a look a bit closely, you can see that these things are starting to flatten out. So, where you have the waves propagating along there, they're a lot flatter than compared to the last scenario. Okay, this is the last example. You have reached the case when you have this dynamic anisotropy. So, you apply this force very closely. So, you apply this force very close to the corner of the lattice, and of course, what you get are two rays as before propagating in parallel into the bulk of the lattice. And when they're close, which is the case when you put the force next to the corner, you can get the interaction between the two rays. And of course, as before, we showed that if you move the point further into the lattice, you don't get that interaction. But that's what you see here when you look at the wave. You see here, and you look at the wave profiles. Okay, so we've verified the method developed by Anastasia just by looking at these two simple problems, which are for two square cell lattice quadrants. And it's allowed us to pick up a bit more understanding about how these unconventional waveforms propagate in this system and reflect off boundaries. Of course, you can build in. Of course, you can build in different mechanical responses and look at different geometries in extending this method, but probably and more than likely, these in some cases, you're going to meet matrix Vienna equations that you need to solve. Okay.
