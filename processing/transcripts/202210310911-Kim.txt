Although I've forget in what order will tell us about some classical invariants of QNATs and approving commitment type invariants for services and format loads. Now the announcements that I have to make. I always do this when I'm teaching. I always have like a list of announcements and I get partway through and then I forget the rest. I think that's all. This will be sort of a chill talk, you know, partly because I had a sign since yesterday, but Yesterday, but also because I think it's good to have contacts. We'll start off nice and so I have got some words. So yeah, okay, let's get to it. Okay, so the title of the talk, I'm just going to call it constructing some channels. Just a title. So, because this is a talk on node surfaces, I'm obliged to give you the following definition that I think everybody knows. So, a two-not, for me, it's going to be a smooth, embedded, safe asset of a two-sphere and a four-spoons. So maybe you want to choose your own adventure, you maybe want to put a public flag or something and say, what does it mean to me? I'm not a well-meaning to found ball. Bounce ball. As to the boundary of the swing with a tree fault, of course. Okay. So, you know, the first thing that you should do, if you were trying to convince somebody that there are such audited services, probably you would tell them of this construction updates back to printing or commons. It's called the Spun Map. I think everybody would be familiar with this, but I'm going to. Familiar with this, but I'm going to build this up in this one lunch or anything. Okay, so Arden, 1925. Okay, well, figure favorite knot yesterday. Then k times the minus of k is a squice knot. And it's the boundary of, well, the knot that you get, or the tangle that you get by puncturing the knot at a point back across the point. At a point, I can cross something animal inside of, let's say, B3 crossed by. So I'll denote this disk by, let's say, V sub K. If you wanted to draw a picture of it, do that. Maybe it looks something like this. Here are all of my V3 fibers. Here's k, there's minus k, and this is the disk that it balance. There are various ways of thinking about this disk. One is the one that I just gave you. The other way is, when you go more physically, you imagine sweeping up a disk by swinging this null tangle through the three hole. Okay, you can certainly make it too smooth like this. two sphere like this spin of k well that's a that's a two sphere that I get just by doubling us this dk okay so this you know this really is a knotted two sphere for instance pi one of the complement is the same as pi one of the of a complement so you start with that Of a couple of methods. So you start with an actual knot, you'll get an actual knot in two-sphere. How do you see this? I mean, you took a product with an interval, basically, and you glued two things right in order to get it. You use some sort of mechanic and convince yourself of this. Okay, so this is something that everybody knows. What I like about this perspective is that it's clear how to modify it. It's clear how to modify this picture to get maybe. Modify this picture to get maybe more interesting too. So here's a schematic which will tell you what I want to do. You've seen me many times before I always draw the same schematic. I'm indebted to Hannah for showing me this, actually. Well, I could put two copies of the port ball with these discs together. But if I want, I could just easily... I could just easily insert some concordance in between them. That would be perfectly fine. So if I have any self-concordance of k next n minus k, I can paste that in here and I'll get a brand new 200. So that would be as a remark. So I can easily modify this. And maybe that's a little extreme. I mean, for instance, I could just locally knock the product. And that would get me sort of everything. And I don't want to do something backward. But maybe it's best to just use an isotopy. So So one thing I could do, instead of just a completely random record, I could insert the trace of an isotopy. And I'll call these sorts of things very generally just like deformations because this is maybe not how they're usually introduced, but that's what I'm just going to call them. So concord to C gives the trace of a self-isotopy. I'll call this questions back. Well, what are some examples proposed? The first is very classical. I think it's a lot of sense. Let's begin to see 1065. Something called a twist spin. So again, to describe to describe such a 2-0, all I really have to do is describe Q as self-pisop, the knot tape maximum landscape. So here's my twist. The twist could be. Here's my night. It's a key hex on landscape. I not it's got k x on minus k that's what they are i will rotate i will rotate one of those subts so parallel parallel to the the points where i performed a connected summon i'll rotate that summit uh through 360 degrees so i get back to where it started with um that's a perfectly fitted subject That's a perfectly fit self-isotopy, k xm minus k. And I can actually stack this. I can do this as many times as I want. So maybe I'll do it like having times. So if I do that, well, I'll make something that I'll call a twist map. So this will call a linkless by T sub M. Okay. And again, explicitly, what is this? Well, it's the top disk union of trace of this cell phase to be union the bottom disk. So I'll just say union trace of pans twist union box disk. So these are already sort of much more interesting two nodes. Well on one hand if I do zero twists that's the same as the spin. So that really isn't it. So, that really is not it. But these have sort of much more interesting variability properties. For instance, the fundamental groups of the complements do not have two monotonic groups. They can have torsion. So, for instance, if you take the five twist spin of the trefoil, the fundamental group of the complement has elements of finite order, and it looks like the combined area group. It looks like the combiner that's the hygiene group across really. Lots of amazing, amazing things happen. Something that's sort of even more amusing, as this camera's eating, again, same thing for Hample 2c5. The plus minus twist spins, which is the plus minus 1 twist spins, are all unknown. No matter what method you start with, you do a plus or a minus one. You start with if you do a plus or a minus one discipline, you always get a two-sphere. And actually, sort of more generally, these two dots are always fibered, and they're fibered by some three-manifold. So more generally, so TmK is fibered by, well the manifold, but I'll say that the cyclic M-fold branch cover over the notch K. Over the nonk in the 3 series. So when m is equal to 1, you just get us 3. That's the 2 knockouts of 3 knots, so not. I'm going to try to intersperse some questions throughout this. This maybe it is it's you may also want to talk to Mandy, who mentioned something similar to me like maybe a week ago, coincidental. It's possible that there's an there's an easy way to see this. There's an easy way to see this. Probably, I think, using anadomic diagrams or something similar. There's a note in Paper Carter and May from 2016. They actually cite Maramoto with the Maganese. From like 1991. Actually, there may be a sort of a nice way to see this. I don't know, I believe that there's a nice way to see that the plus one twist brands are inhabited. I don't know if there's a way to see what the actual fibrin is in the general case. So maybe that's something to think about when you're about standing around a copy. Okay, so that's our first basic isotopy. Nice collection of two knots. Again, they have many amazing properties. Patrick, can you maybe one finite comment? You should say for m not equal to zero, then it's fiber. Sir, are you ready? Okay. Okay, so what? Okay, so what are a bunch of other isotopes that I'll put forth? This one I'll attribute to Libert, 79, who sort of is inspired by something I thought. This is the role of isotopy. So again, back up to this picture, I'm going to describe a self-isotopy of k-canaxon. A self-isotopia of K1X on minuscule and I'll paste it and build myself into a same channel. Okay. So here it is. Here's my copy of K next L minus K. Here's the isotopy that we all know and love. I will take one sum out, imagine that it's quite small, and I'll send it for a lap to get To get perfectly good self-isotopy, uh, there's a you know there's a choice of framing here. Uh, I sort of need to know how I roll through that isotopy. Probably you should pick the cipher framing, but it also makes sense to twist while you roll. Um, the twisting and the rolling sort of commuted, they don't really interact with each other, you can separate them. Um, and all Um and button. I'll just call it sort of the most general two not to build in this way, the m twist n roll. So there's always m twists and n roles. Okay, and again, it's the same thing. So it's this disc, you mean the trace of the m twisting and the bowling is just So that's sort of a much more interesting tuna in a way. They have sort of some other interesting properties that I'll tell you. One thing I'll also point out is that this is a, you know, study and a lot of quite a bit, but I can think of this in this. I can think of this in this sort of stack concordance way. I can think of this as a disk union of another disk, where one disk disk gets the concordance. Those disks are not, I said, top by battery to the standard D sub k. I think you maybe can do this with purple subgroup. There's also a pay-per-view option set up that you're explored. Patrick, there's a question in the chat. Oh, sorry. But Jin Shengbu asks if can two different asks if can two different isotopies give the same 20 of to smooth isotopy and s4 like in your they can you preempted my question that's a great question so i mean all so first of all if i just if i tweak the isotobe slightly like if i tweak the self-isotobey slightly then i'll tweak the isotobe or i'll tweak the representative maybe of the tune up that i've built but only up to a small isotobe. The question is can I do like sort of dramatically looking different things? dramatically looking at different things and get the same tunnels. And that's actually, I'm going to state a theorem which says exactly that, which is really both. For example, I mean even in a twist band case, you do an interesting twisting looking isotopy and you still get something like that. Okay, so here's some like, I don't know, theorems or facts about these genots. Theorems. So the first, I'll just say they're all. I'll just say or all on a paper that they're length. Um the first is that if m is not zero, yet these are all fibers. So if there's any twisting at all, there is all things on this fibridge. And to answer the question, if you twist rolls then a torso, A tortoise spun. And what you actually get is a twist spun on that same tortoise spun. Sort of not obvious from looking at the picture. I think you would need to do some sort of very careful pictures to sort of convince yourself to bring. So somehow in a torus nut, there's enough symmetry that the rolling can sort of all be absorbed into the torso. But is that a problem? Is that a property of the surface or of the isotopy? Is it just that like the is the role isotopy isotopic to like the twisting isotopy in that case? Or is it just that once you glue the two disks together, the resulting two knots are the same? That is a good question, and I don't know the answer off of that there. I suspect it's the first time. We should talk right after this. We should talk right after this. Because otherwise, it's not. So, I also have a related idea. Okay, I kind of have a question. I have a question/slash idea. So, do you know if any of like Litherland, for instance, did he ever think about like sort of like maybe like two component like you know spun links in the sense that you have like you know two arcs and you sort of spin them around? Like, is that anything he discusses? he discusses or is it always are don't he so so far as i so far as i remember he does not discuss answers final things okay in that paper but that's certain i don't think he's thinking of rolson and rollson yeah rolson does yeah yeah because i'm wondering if the same sort of thing is true for them like they're fibered for like non-zeros and recording thanks patrick you go ahead okay great all right we got lots yeah this is great we got already done lots of stuff but uh copyrights I read the lottery copyrights. I love this format. It's not just because I'm really terrorist. So here's another series of papers or theorems that Terry got over in two papers in 93 and 94 to give some more general results. So one is the case knot, the unknot, and you don't do any twisting, then you really do get a non-trivial knot. That's, I guess, very interesting. These, again, these quantum non-groups are not one-note groups, sort of more farther away from being that. He also studied the case for the notch, you start with this flybird. And he came up with a bunch of conclusions. So if case flybird, so is the role span. So is the roll spin, even though there's no twisting. And this note is actually not rubbed. So, you know, in a way, I sort of like to think of these as a reasonable testing ground for, I don't know, maybe conjectures you have, but you know, tuna or compass. Two naughts or complicated looking two knots. If you want you want an example of one, pick one of these. I think you'll be sort of so here's a question that also people can think about, I think, over copy. You know, I thought a little bit about what's the smallest two nut for which we don't know the glock twist is standard. And I think it's this one. So by sigma, I mean the glock twist is the glock twist. By sigma, I mean the globe twist is the glock twist on the zero twist single roll spot of the 7,3-not S4? See if you can do that over coffee today. I don't know how to do it. It's the first knot in the knot table that isn't a torus knot. Because if it's a torus knot, then the roll spin will wind up being a twist spin. We know if the group twists and twist spins are standard. It's also the first knot that doesn't have a knotting number. Not, it doesn't have a knotting number one, because if it has a knotting number one, that's taken care of by the camera hand by solving. So that's how far you have to look in terms of two knots to find something where I don't think we know the both this is standard. If you can do that one, try also to do 74 and 75. Okay. So So a couple other sort of notes on sort of related to Hannah's question. You can do defamation spinning in the context of other services. You don't just have to build spheres. You could, for instance, build a horse period of date. If you just take a If you just take a knot in the, let's say in a three-ball, and you don't puncture it at a point on the knot, you puncture it away from the knot, then you could just literally take the pods with the circle and you get something we call a spontorus. So the spontorus is, well, just literally S1 cross k living inside of S4. If you have If you have your favorite deformation of that knot fixing the boundary of that wall, then you could just as easily do a deformation span. I won't write down the actual definition because I think everybody knows what that is. You keep the value of the block fix, but inside the block, you can move an eye around. So you can have a particular symmetric knot, you can keep something interesting. So I'll call these maybe learn path of K, half per surface. You can also do an analog of the twisting, if you'd like. So in your ball, think of part of the battery of the knot. Part of the knot is because. Of the knot, part of the knot is living on the boundary of the ball, and then due to twisting systems will be on the inside. That will make perfect sense. You get something called twisted spontorous. There's one other thing that Boyle introduces, which I think is interesting, which is he calls the term to Taurus. And so that is your goal. And so that goes one level further and you compose with the actual block automorphism around the boundary of this estimate cross B tree that you're constructing. So another way to think about it is you turn this knot 3360 degrees whilst you're doing all of this deformation. And because the clock map is over 2, that you are either turned or not turned, doing it an even number of times as I count. And he proves some interesting things about these knots as well. Things about these knots as well. So I think many people on this room are familiar with. The spun Toro stock is irreducible. I. It doesn't doesn't factor as Some like, let's say T-Spirit can't sum up, and I'm auditorist. But that's sort of like not always the case. There's sort of various different things that can happen. The two twist ones or two bridge knots they do factor as the two twist spin of the knot connects some an unknotted torque. Anonotic torus, a bunch of strange things happen. It is worth pointing out that these spun tori do come to you given as the spun knot with the tube attached, but that tube is not trivial. There are lots of things to think about there. He asks another interesting question for the coffee break. And it's possible that we. You know, we know the answer to this, but I just don't. So Boyle says that for any dot K the turned one twist spontorous called it, the one twist spontorous. Spun towards a sick with fun album. And he asks, but apparently he says it's quite frustrating. He can't show that it's uncounted. So I'll pose that as a question to the room. I don't know if it's undoubted. It's possible that we do know. Quick Google search didn't turn anything up, so I don't know. Think about this. Perhaps that's an interesting class of it, in the hydroforce group. Patrick, I have a problem with your notation. What do you mean by F sub K? What do I mean by F sub I of K? What does that mean? Well, F sub I of K is the sponge horse that I get by twisting, let's say, K time. So F indicates that it's So F indicates that it's turned and building it first. Because you need one frame for whether or not it's turned and one for the twisting. I agree. These are not characters. I have not either any. There's no indication of the way that this turn. I turned the holes to put the adjective in front. Yeah, sorry, that's confusing notation. Sorry, that does confusing notation. I should have used T for us, so that would have made much more sense. But here we are. I used T for twist one knot. I didn't want to complain to do things. Anyways, are the non-turned one twist bins? Are those unknown? Are the non-turned one twist bins? It's like the CBI two-based to the C-bay. No, I I don't think in general. Think in general. No, no, no. We figured it out. No, we got it. Well, I mean, so that's the same as just doing the one twist two knot and then attaching the one angle. And so it's always... And those are not unknown. Those are unknown. Those aren't. Because the one twist. Oh, sorry, the one, not the two. I'm a two or three knot. Okay, yeah, right. Right, yeah. Okay. Yep. Great. The answer is. Great. The answer is. What's the obstruction to the factorization of the result? Can you repeat the question? Yeah, when he shows it doesn't factor, what's the obstruction? Purple subgroup. Yeah, so if you had a little torso, then somehow the purple subgroup would be smaller. At least that's what I remember. I could be misremembering that. Yeah. The peripheral looks like z squared, but if it were factored, it would just be z. Yeah, I think that's right. Okay. Question for everyone. What is known about spinning things? I don't know very much about it. I'm just gonna say see it and I'm just going to say see it. Is that something interesting to think about the copy? I'll also point out, I won't say anything more about this because I'm running low on time, but you can do extremely similar things for digital types. So we can also do some of my things. And there is a little bit more tricky because you have to, you want to do some sort of deformations that, well, you want to build either a mobius band or a projective plane, so the deformations will have to change the orientation on the arc that you're using. And so there are different perspectives on this. There's a really good paper, Chris and Osman, which the version that I have is not published, but it's really good. They ask a lot of great questions, one of which is the Kinishia conjecture, which asks whether every plane in S-4 actually splits as a two-sphere connected sum on another RP2. So same question with RP2s. They provide many, many, many examples, and they look. They actually do something, they describe how they do these deformations, but they actually do sort of overhead surgery. They identify a loop on a projector. They identify a loop on a projected plane and they replace the neighborhood of this movie span with like a deformation spun. And I won't talk to him about that, because I think someone is going to tell us about some other animal services. Okay, so let me wrap up with a couple of things. So I've given you a lot of examples of deformation scanning. examples of deformation spanning. Not all p naughts are deformation spun. That should not come as a surprise. So there's a theorem that I won't state precisely from Barney Moscova. It says basically not alternatives in commercial spins. And the example that is not is the double of the slice disc with the steep or not. So I went one, two, three, four, five, six crossings. I got this right. Okay, I think that's right. This is the slice disk, but it's even a knot if you double that up. Basically, there's an abstract. Basically, there's an obstruction coming from Alexander points that tells you that that can't be a default spot. I don't know of any other obstructions like this. This is really cool. And I also don't know very much about this paper at all. Except Brian is there. Big question is to ask Brian how this works. But here's what is true about genomics in general. I'll just state this as like Ethereum, a week gene on. From like phase phase two or phase two which is that every tna S4 is the union of two root disks. So the same way that I just sort of hand-wave and built a tune off, I doubled it with a few discs. Built a two-naught by doubling two disks. And the same way that I've been building two knots by putting together disks like this, actually, every two-naught admits a decompositional way. I think this is relatively long. What else did I want to say about this? You know, I'm sure I'm running a long time. I think, you know, I think that I think that I'll leave this as a question. One thing I really like about this perspective that Hannah showed me a long time ago is not just that you think, okay, yes, it's a nice perspective that lets you build two knots. You can always glued your rubber distillery and get two knots. What's nice about this construction is that it has a parameter that you can tweak. You can tweak. You pick two disks and you can spin a dial and get different genomes out of it. And so I'll ask this as a question, and maybe think of this as like, well, no, maybe someone has already done this. Are there similar instructions to the demoralizing picture? Using, you know, I don't, this is not well purposed, this is very big. Maybe using different ribbon discs, using high-symmetric knots, something to this effect. So other ribbon discs. Oh no. We made it so far. Made it so far. What do we do now? Let me ask somebody that he can't hear well enough. He's here. Well, I mean, he's basically, one way to think about this, gluing in this trace of an isotope here, is it's a map from. Is it a map from pi 1 of the embeddings of k connected with k bar to pi? A bar to pi zero values of the two sphere? That's E value? Yes. Okay, and so does that help at all things that way? Or does that mean that are they maybe someone's question was, is something, when you show something as trivial, is that really because you just know between two isotopic isotopes isotopic? Sorry, guys. I managed to kill him. You're right out of time. Anyways, that's the end of our talk. Anyways, that's the end of my talk. Thanks very much. Patrick, actually, you can click the slides up because I didn't think you're right at the end of it. Oh, yeah. Patrick, will you share your screen again? Also, Patrick, if you email me the PDF or Maggie the PDF of your talk, maybe we can just put this on the call.
