I can go perfect. Thanks, Great. Thank you for the invitation. And I'm very happy to join this workshop remotely. So today I will talk about quantifying shape variation using quasi-conformal geometry. We know that people have been trying to look into the problem of using mathematical mappings to study biological shapes. And in fact, over 100 years ago, Darcy Thompson already proposed using. Darcy Thompson already proposed using mathematical transformation to deform one shape to match another and so on. So, basically, in a lot of biological data, we can see that there are some kind of prescribed, some kind of landmark features, some kind of prominent features that we can use as landmarks for this kind of mapping problems. So, that's something we want to take into account when we find a suitable mathematical mapping. And also, there And also, there have been a lot of conventional landmark-based mapping methods, such as the Pokusties method, which makes use of just scaling, rotation, translations, and so on to match two shapes, or the thin-place bind methods, which again takes the landmark conditions into account and then try and find a smooth deformation to match two shapes. But there are some limitations in these methods. For example, for the Procus Dis Method, the land mass can. For the procuses method, the landmass cannot be exactly matched in general. Or in the field-place mines method, the bijectivity of the mappings may not be guaranteed. That means there may be the occurrence of mesh foldovers in this kind of mapping. So, our goal is to find a mapping between two biological shapes such that the landmarks can be exactly matched. So, no matter what kind of landmarks you give me, as long as there's a one-line correspondence with. As long as there's a one-line correspondence between the landmarks, then we want to match the landmarks exactly. And also, we want to find a mapping such that the overall shape is deformed naturally in some sense. And we also want the level of deformation to give us some information about the shape variation. So after finding such a suitable mapping, we want to make use of some properties of the mapping to further look into the shape variation. So that's basically what we want to achieve. What we want to achieve. And in recent years, people have been using conformal mappings to study shapes. Basically, conformal maps are mappings that satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equation here, which can be written as a puzzle F puzzle Z bar equals zero. And we know that there are a lot of nice properties of conformal mappings, such as that conformal mappings are angle-preserving. That means the local geometry can be preserved. That means the local geometry can be preserved under this kind of transformation. And conformal mappings are also bijective, then that means there will be no vote overs. And the existence of conformal mappings is also guaranteed by the Riemann mapping theorem, which says that any two simply connected planar domains are conformally equivalent. So basically, if you are given two biological shapes, you can always find a conformal mapping that maps one onto the other one exactly. Or to the other one exactly. And in fact, people have been using this to study the growth of leaves or to study inside vein shapes by, for example, mapping an inside vein shape to a standardized unit disk and then analyze the vein pattern, the pattern in this unit disk domain. But then there are some limitations in component mappings. And one limitation is that the landmarks cannot be exactly matched. So if we have some interior So if we have some interior prescribed landmarks, then under conformal mappings, those landmarks in general cannot be exactly matched. So that's some limitation that we want to basically tackle. So that motivates us to consider something more general, which is quasi-conformal mappings. So we call that conformal mapping satisfy the Kosher-Riemann equation. Cauchy-Riemann equation and quasi-component mappings is a generalization of component maps, and it satisfies the Belchromi equation, which looks very similar to the Cauchy-Riemann equation. And the difference is that on the right-hand side, Cauchy-Riemann equation is just with zero, while here we have sometime, which is mu times puzzle f puzzle c for some complex value function mu. And this mu is also known as the Belchromi coefficient, which actually tells us a lot about the quasi-conformality of. About the quasi-conformality of this kind of mapping. And we also know that conformal mappings are angle-preceding. And basically, if we are given some infinitesimal circles, it will be mapped to infinitesimal ellipse, I mean, circles under conformal maps. While for quasi-conformal maps, it will map small circles to small ellipses with bounded eccentricity. And the good thing about quasi-conformal mapping is that the definition from circle to ellipsis can be represented largely using the Largely using the biotromi coefficients. For example, the maximum magnification is just given by this Fc times one plus the modulus of mu. And the maximum strength age is again in a similar form with one minus mu. And the aspect ratio is just one plus the modulus of mu divided by one minus modulus of mu. So by simply taking a look into this periotronic coefficient, Into this biotromi coefficient, we can know a lot about how the local deformation is under a quasicomponal mapping. And another good thing about quasi-common map is that landmass can be exactly matched under quasi-combal mappings. For example, here we can see an example with two wing shapes, and there are some prescribed landmarks which are represented as red dots. So, under quasi-convalu mapping, we can actually map one shape onto another shape. Map one shape onto another shape with all the landmarks being exactly matched in. And so, unlike component mappings, which will map small circles to small circles, under a quasi-clonal mapping, it will map small circles to small ellipses, as shown here. So, we can see that all these small circles are mapped to small ellipses. So, they may change in their size, they may change in their orientation, and so on. But then, all these landmarks can be exactly matched. A land mass can be exactly matched. So that's the advantage of using quasi-conformal mapping. So, here we would like to use quasi-convolutional mapping to tackle a number of shape morphometry problems. So, the first one is about inside wing morphometry using quasicle mappings. And in particular, here we are interested in studying Hawaiian trosulpholar wings. So, the major challenge here is that there are a large variation in the overall. Are a large variation in the overall wing shape. For example, we can see in this diagram that the wing shapes are very different. Some of them are pretty elongated and some of them are pretty round in shape and so on. So there's a large variation in the overall wing shape. And another challenge is that there is also a large variation in the wing intersection positions, which are the landmarks basically. So those are the prominent features as we highlight here using the red node. As we highlight here using the red dots. So we can see that all these points exist in all these wings, but they are basically different in positions. For example, here we can see that these two landmark points are pretty far away from each other, while here in this example, these two points are pretty close to each other. So there's such a large variation that we also want to take into account. So basically, the goal is to find a mapping that Find a mapping that can map one wing shape to another wing shape such that the overall wing shape is matched exactly, and also the landmarks can also be matched exactly. And then using that kind of mapping, we can further look into the shape variation. So the way to achieve this is to use something called landmark matching technology map, which is one kind of quasi-combo mapping with a specific property, which is that the quasicomo map map. Which is that the quasi-commode distortion is uniform over the entire domain. So, the way to achieve this is to start with some, basically, we start with two input shapes, and we want to map, let's say, shape S1 to shape S2. So, we can first try and find an as conformal as possible mapping from shape one to shape two that satisfy all the prescribed landmark constraints. So, in general, this will give us something which is not exactly. Give us something which is not exactly conformal because of the presence of the landmark constraints. And the way to solve for this kind of landmark matching quasi-common map is to solve an elliptic PDE in this form, where we can basically just represent this as some kind of linear systems under discretization. So, once we solve for the classical mapping, then we can take a look at the peritronomy coefficients of the mapping. Mapping and then we can get the barotronomic coefficients, and then we can try and smooth the barotronomy coefficient and reconstruct a new classic hormone mapping using the same linear system. And then we can just repeat the process. And basically, the process will just help us smooth out the berotrami coefficient so that we can get a sharper and sharper histogram here, which is representing the norm of the berotrami coefficient. And in other words, we will be And in other words, we will be basically trying to equalize the quasi-governmental distortion over the entire domain. So at the beginning, maybe just the part near the landmark with high quasi-connect distortion. But then over this kind of iterations, we will be able to equalize that distortion so that we end up getting a heck of a map, which is a classical map with the modulus of mu B being a constant over the entire domain. Being a constant over the entire domain. And also, all the landmarks are exactly matched. So, here are some examples. We can make use of this method to do pairwise mapping. For example, if we are given two inside wing shapes with different landmarks and also with different wings boundary shape, we can try and map one shape to another shape. And then, this is the technical mapping result with all the landmarks matched. And then, by having this kind of And then, by having this kind of exact mapping results, we can then, for example, look into the intensity difference between the mapping result and the target wing shape. And then we can use that to compare like the weighing patterns. And if we try and compare this result with the results generated using traditional methods such as the progressed methods or the conformal methods, then we can see that both the progresses method and the conformal method cannot exactly match. And the conformal method cannot exactly match the landmark. So it doesn't give us a very meaningful comparison here. While, once we have this technical map, we can exactly match the two shapes so that if we take the intensity difference, we can really look into the shape difference more precisely. So that's one example. And another example is to look into the bilateral asymmetry of insect wings. So, on the top, we can see two basically the left and the right wing, and they look pretty much the same. But then, if we try and use a technical mapping to map one shape to another shape and then consider their difference, then we can actually see that they actually show some difference in, let's say, area, which can be captured precisely using this technique of quasi-conformal mapping. And another usage of quasi-home mapping is to basically make use of this constant quasi-home distortion, mu to basically measure the similarity of two shapes. So we can quantify the similarity of two shapes by first computing a mapping between them and then using the resulting Coisson distortion, which is captured by this modulus of μ to quantify the similarity. Quantify the similarity. So if mu is small, then that means the mapping is close to conformal, and that means the two shapes are pretty similar under conformal mapping. While if the modulus of mu is large, then that means there is a large quasi-onal distortion. And in fact, by using this kind of mapping, we can basically look into all the wing shapes in the Hawaiian Trosopola wing data set, and then we can try and compute a pairwise mapping. We can try and compute a pairwise mapping between every wing. And then we can get a similarity matrix with mij being just one minus muij, which corresponds to the mapping from shape i to shape j. And then using this kind of similarity matrix, we can perform clustering analysis. And we can actually end up getting a very good grouping of different phylogenetic groups. For example, the ADS-TOLA group and the planet TBA group. Group and the planet TBA group and Grim Sauri group and so on. So this tells us that the shape difference between these wings can actually be captured using this method of quasi-conformal mapping. And another example of the usage of quasi-conformal mapping is to analyze the temporal developments of lipidoptery wings. So here what we did is that we have That we have data of tobacco hot moth wings at different developmental stages. And then we can try and compute a mapping between every successive stage. And then we can analyze the difference between these mapping results in terms of the Belchrami coefficients, which captures the quasi-conformal distortion from one shape to another shape. And then we can also look into the local area change and Change and like some similar measures and so on. So we can basically see that from, let's say, from the larva stage to the prepupal stage, there is a large area change at certain parts, while from prepupa stage to pupa stage, there is another, basically a large change in another region. So using this method of classical wall mapping, we can precisely analyze this kind of shape change over time. Analyze this kind of shape change over time. So, so far, we have been focusing on 2D wing shapes, but in fact, we can also extend this to analyze 3D shapes. So, here in this second work, what we have is a tooth morphometry problem. So, this is a collaboration with a group of dental researchers in Australia, and they are interested in studying upper pimolar teeth from two populations in Australia. From two populations in Australia, one from an indigenous group and one from an European group. And so basically, for each of these kinds of premolar tooth data, what we have is some landmarks, which are these kind of landmarks of cuffs and the pits. And also we have the segmented boundary as shown in this green dot. So basically, what we have is some kind of surface as shown on the right-hand side here. And what we want to do is to And what we want to do is to analyze the shape variation in this tool data set. So now the first challenge is that this time we have some shape variation of two shapes in 3D instead of 2D. So that's something new and we would have to take that into account. And the second challenge is, again, we have some landmarks at the interior parts and we want to basically try and take that into account when we perform like a mapping from one. Perform like a mapping from one to another, and so on. So, here what we did is that we tried and find a landmark matching technical map between two surfaces by simplifying the problem using conformal mapping. So, we can suppose we have like two surfaces, two surfaces. We can first try and use a conformal parametrization to flatten them onto the plane. And so we have like two rectangular domains represented. Two rectangular domains representing these two surfaces. And then we can try and compute a landmark matching technical map using a similar method as we introduced previously to match the two planar domain. And because here we are using conformal parametrization for both Gi and Gj, if we consider the composition mapping Fij, which is given by Gj inverse composite with Hij composed with Gi, then the entire mapping is actually. Then the entire mapping is actually a technical map. That means it is with uniform classic homo distortion. So basically, we now have a mapping between the two 3D surfaces. And then we can again study the classical distortion, which is given by this norm of the Bershawmi coefficients. And then this time we can also take the curvature difference into account. We can have the mean curvature difference and the Gaussian curvature difference. Difference and the Gaussian curvature difference, and so on. And then we can actually use them to study the shape variation in these different tooth data. So in the previous tooth shape analysis problem, we had an important assumption that is we already have some very well-segmented data so that we can just focus on like mapping one tooth shape to another tooth shape and matching the boundary, matching the Matching the boundary, matching the interior landmarks, and so on. But then it may not be necessarily true for general data sets. For example, if we consider another New World Monkey tooth data set, then this time we have even a larger variation in the shape. So we have, again, we have some variation in the tooth shape in 3D. And then we also have those kind of landmarks that we want to take into account. And one new challenge is that there may only be partial surface correspondence between them. Surface correspondence between them. And that means if we just take a look at one shape, then it may not be corresponding to the entire second shape. Maybe it will just correspond to upper half of the other shape. So that's something that we want to take into account as well in this partial surface correspondent problem. So this time we cannot assume that there is one corresponding. Cannot assume that there is Roman correspondence between the two entire shape. And instead, we have to use some free boundary parametrization methods to flatten them onto the plane. And then we have also to modify our mapping method so that we don't assume that the boundary will be mapped to the boundary exactly. While we are just trying to use the interior landmarks to guide the decimal and also the curvature information to guide the mapping between the two shapes so that we can. Between the two shapes, so that we can have like a common domain on the plane, and then we can basically just analyze that common domain instead of the two entire shape. Because basically, that common domain is giving us the partial correspondence, while the outer part may not be corresponding to any region in the other shape. So, again, once we have the mapping, which is given by the composition of the conformal parallelization as well as the The conformal parallelization as well as the planar quasicomal mapping. We can then look into the shape difference between them. And in particular, we can look into first the quasicomo distortion. And then second, the normalized mean curvature difference and also the Gaussian curvature difference. And in fact, we can see that if we perform binary clustering with different parameters for the three terms which correspond to the classical distortion and the mean curvature difference and the Gaussian curvature. And the mean curvature difference and the Gaussian curvature difference, and so on, then we can actually effectively cluster the Folio force with the non-foliar force. And it actually agrees with the theory of primate adaptations, which basically says that there is an extended development of shear crest for folios here. So we can see that in this clustering result, these shapes are basically. Shapes are basically notably different from the non-folio force. And similarly, we can perform binary clustering using other choices of parameters. And then we can also get insectic force versus non-insective force as the two groups in the binary clustering result, which again can be supported by biological reasons. So this suggests that the usage of classical normal mapping is advantageous in analyzing different kinds of like different Different kinds of like 2D and 3D shape data. And so I guess I'm running out of time, but basically we can, more recently, we have been more and more interested in not just crossing all mapping, but crossing of remote flows. And so basically now the problem is that if we are given some continuous growth data, and what we want to do is not just to map one time point. To map one time point to another time point, we want to understand the underlying continuous growth process. We want to kind of like try and predict what's going to happen at some intermediate point and maybe also at some other later time points. So the setup is as follows. So suppose we are given some shape data at some discrete time points. Then we can start by considering a general cost function, which consists of a lot of different terms. Different terms. Some corresponding to the spatial gradient, some correspond to the bending, some correspond to the normal displacements, and so on, and some correspond to the presence of lambda constraints and so on. And then we can try and choose a model type by considering a fixed choice of parameters. And then we can try and minimize that cost function to get the deformation over time. And using that, we can then understand or we can model the growth problem. We can model the growth process for different data sets. For example, for insect wings, we can use a conformal type of model or use some other type of models to basically analyze the growth process to study which part is with the largest dilation, which one is with the largest shear, and so on. And here is another set of examples with some kind of tree leaf shapes, which are in 3D. And again, we can. Which are in 3D. And again, we can use quantum flows to understand the growth of them. So, just a quick summary. So, in this talk, we have covered using the usage of classical mapping for inside wing morphometry. So, basically, for inside wings, we are dealing with 2D wing shapes with landmark constraints. And then, using quasi-go mapping, we can exactly match one shape to another shape and then perform different shape analysis. Um, shape analysis. For example, we can do pairwise mapping or we can do clusterings and so on. And then we can also handle 3D shapes by suitably using a conformal parameterization together with constant conformal mapping. Then we can handle again problems in 3D and also with landmarks. And no matter whether we have a complete correspondence or just a partial correspondence, we can use a similar technique to match two shapes and then perform some shape analysis. And what we're And more recently, what we have been doing is like the use of quasi-common flows for understanding the continuous growth process. And that's the end of my talk. Thank you very much. This is very impressive. I have a very similar problem if I have a matrix, but the two matrices are different stuff. But the two matrices are different subs. I use this methodology to compare them. So can you repeat your question? So imagine I have your two heat maps and they are all you have two heat maps. But they have imagine like two squares in their heat mapping, right? So, if they're in three dimensions, so yeah, so recently we also have some works on like 3D classical mappings. So, if you have like some kind of like 3D data, we are also able to compute a mapping that matches landmarks and also maybe match some kind of intensity information and so on. So, using that kind of mapping. So, using that kind of mapping method, then we should be able to analyze the shape difference between them. So, one question about your metal, it seems to require that the landmarks are the same across the different cases. Suppose you have, for example, insect wings or a species that has fewer landmarks or a random number of landmarks. How does yeah, so if we don't have like the same. If we don't have the same number of landmarks, then we will just be using the common ones. So, for example, if we have some extra landmarks at certain parts, then which are present in just one shape, but not the other shape, then we are not going to have those landmark correspondence. Well, we will just be using the existing landmark correspondence to computer mapping. But then we can then try and look into where that extra landmark is mapped to, and then. Extra lemma is mapped to, and then that can also give us some information. A dependent on the computational cost of running your networks. Yeah, so basically here, in each step, we just need to solve a linear system. And then the computation of the peritonic coefficient is also just a linear operation. And then basically, what we have to do is just to smooth. What we have to do is just to smooth this and just to do it iteratively. So, I guess it really depends on how the landmark distributions are. So, if the target landmarks are too far away, then from like the like if the landmark positions are too different between the two shapes, then it may take longer time to do this kind of iterative scheme. But basically, in each step, we just have to solve a linear system. And that's the basically. Basically, main advantage here. And in practice, in practice, what we do is to triangulate this kind of domain and then solve everything on a triangle mesh. And usually, if we have, let's say, 10,000 vertexes in this triangle mesh, then it just takes a few seconds to complete the iterative scheme. Yeah, I was wondering how to. Yeah, I was wondering how do you smooth the barotronic coefficient? Yeah, so in order to smooth the barotronic coefficients, so the berotrammy coefficients is with like the modulus part and also the arguments part. So what we are going to do is just to consider the modulus part and then try and equalize the modulus part by applying some kind of smoothing operator. For example, we can just use a La Partian smoothing operator. And then And the argument will just be like the same. And then we can just compute a new classical mapping, and then we can get the new peritonic coefficient associated with that new mapping. And then we will be getting a new peritronic coefficient. And so we can actually prove that it is always converging to a constant, which is the constant that we want to achieve, which is giving us a tetram. Have you applied your method for closed geometry? So, every example you shared open geometry, yeah, yeah, so that's a good question. So, currently, here in these few examples, what we have are all open surfaces, because basically we have to try and map them onto our plane domain and then handle that on the plane by solving this kind of linear system. So, if we have a closed geometry, then one possible way is to Then, one possible way is to consider maybe using something like a spherical parametrization together with something like stereographic projection to project that onto the plane. And then that should also be possible for us to perform this kind of landmark matching, positive home mapping. But then maybe one issue would be like that for the stereographic projection, there would be a large area distortion.
