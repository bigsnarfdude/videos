Really love this to be back. I say that again, thank you back and then. Oh, okay. It's lovely to be back in Van. It's a gorgeous place. I'm happy that we get to be here and kind of all be nestled in all the beauty. And hopefully, we're all going to have a good time meeting new people and getting to learn something new. So, when Anita asked me to do When Anita asked me to do this workshop, I don't know, a while ago, I was like, I don't really work on sex differences, Anita. I'm not really sure. She's like, pick your favorite system and look up something about sex differences. I'm sure there is something out there, right? So I was like, okay, okay. And then time went on, time went on, and then it was like, okay, you still want to do this? I said, yes, I want to do this. And then I figured it would be something about blood clotting, because that's what I work on. And I'm going to tell you about clotting today and some of the math modeling work I've done on clotting for the last couple of years. For the last couple of years. But then they asked me to give a keynote talk. And the description of the keynote talk was: Give a lecture on an organ system and some of the recent research on sex differences in that organ system. And I was going, okay. I don't think I'm an expert on this yet, but I'm just going to give you a talk on clotting, and then I'm going to do a little research about sex differences in clotting, and that's what I'm going to tell you about today. And that's what I'm going to tell you about today. So, hopefully, you enjoy the lecture and you learned something. And that's that. So, I'm Corinne Lederman. I'm at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I'm in the math department and also the computational medicine program. And I'm also a PI in the Blood Research Center. So, I get to work with blood clotters every day. It's really fun. All right, so I'm going to spend the first part of the talk just kind of giving you a short overview of. A short overview of plotting and bleeding. And then I'm going to tell you about some spatial temporal models that I've worked on. And then I'm going to tell you about some ODE models that I've worked on. And then I'll talk about some examples of sex differences in clotting. And then I'm going to give a brief overview of what I think our project is going to do, is going to be about this week. Okay, so you asked me to talk about an organ system. So I'm starting with an organ system, even though clotting is just a part of this. So the organ system is circulating. So, the organ system is the circulatory system or the cardiovascular system, right? So, this is a system of organs that, and actually, the heart is the only organ in the system, but it's a system that includes the heart, the blood, the vessels, and blood itself, right? And what's the purpose of this system? To pump blood from the heart to the lungs to get oxygen, and then it sends the oxygenated blood back to the rest of your body so that you have oxygen and all your tissues. But it also provides more than oxygen, right? Blood provides nutrients, hormones. Nutrients, hormones, to the muscles, tissues, and organs of the body. So let's go a little deeper and let's talk just about blood. So we heard a little bit about this in Tony's talk very briefly. So what is blood? What is it made out of? Well, it's made out of a lot of stuff. So the components, the major components are red blood cells, which carry the oxygen to the tissues. The white blood cells, I realize this is a very sort of basic description. Sort of basic description of the functions of these different cell types. But white blood cells are going to protect against infection. Platelets plug holes in blood vessels. Plasma is the soup that contains the water, the proteins, and all the other molecules. Okay, so you can kind of think about this as the basic composition of blood. Oops. Back. Okay, so blood is really considered a fluid. Sometimes I've heard people call it a tissue. Sometimes I've heard people call it a tissue only because it has so many different cell types in it. But what is it good for? What is it needed for? What does it do? Well, it's good for transporting stuff around the body for sure. It's good for regulating your body temperature. And it's absolutely necessary to form blood clots to prevent the blood loss from your body. So everything that you need to clot is in your blood. All right, so let's talk a little bit about blood clotting. So all vertebrates do it. Blood clotting. So, all vertebrates do it, and some and most invertebrates. I don't know all the details of the invertebrates, so please don't ask me because I don't know that. But, okay, so clotting is a physiological defense mechanism. It occurs in all vertebrates, right, because you want to protect your body from losing blood. You want to keep blood within the closed circulatory system. You need a very quick and localized response to do that. That. So the details of the clotting system may vary between species, and that might depend on whether or not they hibernate, their temperature, their organ system, etc. And over time, the vertebrate plotting system has evolved into an extremely intricate and complex system. So it started off with maybe thinking about just some sort of initiator that converts one protein. It converts one protein to an enzyme, and then these cells are used to form a clot. And now, this is even like, I don't know, there's more, there's even more reactions in the last eight years, right? We probably have more details of the clotting system that we're becoming aware of, that we're learning about. But in general, the system itself evolved in parallel with the development of this pressurized system, this closed circulatory system. It became more and more complex. More and more complex. And it's thought that the complexity was to regulate our responses, right? To be able to deal with different types of situations in a wide variety of environments, different organs, and metabolic rates and rate changes, etc. But in fact, there are some commonalities. Okay, so in all of the complexity, why is this thing? It's like going too fast. Okay, so all vertebrate clotting involves. So, all vertebrate clotting involves something along the lines of this. There are cells that clump together, okay, and it's an immediate response to injury to start plugging the hole where blood is leaking. Then, there are proteins that interact to achieve some sort of enzymatic amplification. So you want reactions that are going to happen really quickly. Okay, so to help with that, there are cellular surfaces that the proteins can bind to to localize that. Can bind to to localize them and further more reactions. And then there's some formation of a gel or a mesh that then stabilizes that clump of cells together. Okay, so these are kind of the basic four steps of any type of clotting in any species. And it's really what has evolved since the first clotting system. So let's talk about clotting in humans then. So our normal healthy clotting is known as hemostasis. Is known as hemostasis. So hemostasis is the normal response to an injury where you form a clot and you stop the bleeding. And hemostasis is also thought to be the process where you plug a hole and the blood in the main vessel remains fluid. So how does this work? What are those four steps? Well, there's primary hemostasis. This is the cell clumping. And in our body, Cell clumping, and in our body, these are the platelets. The platelets form an initial plug, sometimes it's just called a platelet plug, that plugs that hole in the injury. But it's kind of weak, right? They come together, but it's not super stable. So the secondary hemostasis part is where coagulation comes into play. So you may have heard blood coagulation, blood clotting. Coagulation is really a term that we use for the reaction network that occurs during the clotting process. During the clotting process. And these are the reactions that happen on platelet surfaces, and specifically activated platelets. I'm going to talk a lot about those a little bit later. And what happens is these reactions culminate in the formation of this enzyme slammin that then has some pretty strong positive feedback and negative feedback. And we talked a little bit about feedback in Tony's talk as well. So this is going to help with that amplification that I mentioned. And it's going to help the reactions occur. And it's going to help the reactions occur quickly so that you can form this fibrin mesh quickly and in a localized way to then stabilize that final clot here to block the blood from leaking out of the vessel. Okay, so now I'm going to sort of zoom in. I'm just going to walk you through that process in a little more detail. Not a ton of detail, but a little more detail. And please feel free to ask me questions along the way if you haven't. Have it. Yeah. Previous slide. You're talking about this clothing. So when we have this scarf, for example, when we have a wound, we have regeneration and repair. So do we have different clothing in these two processes? For example, you can have a wound that leads to scar or scarf, regenerative repair that you have to see. Yes. That you have a so in both of them you have a clock because you don't want to move yes. So, but the end, the outcome is different between these two processes. Yes. Is clotting different in these two processes or no? Yeah, so the question was about sort of injury versus repair and wound healing and things like that. And I'll say that the basics of clotting are going to stay the same, but there's going to be lots of other things that are influencing this process, right? You'll have more initiators, you might have different types of cell surfaces that are also active. Cell surfaces that are also active. There may be some other players that are involved, but in the end, you're going to make thrombin, you're going to make fibrin, and you're going to have a platelet aggregate. And that's going to be the majority of the clotting process. I have the same question about the same picture. This organization of the mesh, is it going differently inside the organs or inside the body? The organs or inside the body and outside because it looks like internal bleeding is much more complicated to stop than you know, external. I think it really depends on the nature of the injury. Again, the process is sort of similar, but it really just depends on how big the injury is, what organ it's in, what other tissues are around. A lot of it's going to depend on the tissue factor concentration. I'll tell you about tissue factor in just a minute. Concentration. I'll tell you about tissue factor in just a minute. And then there's also, so what I'm going to tell you about now is one pathway to initiate the clotting system. There's actually another one that I'm not going to mention, but as I go through it, I'll kind of show you where that happens as well. All right. Okay, how does a clot form? So here is an intact healthy blood vessel lined with endothelial cells. All of your blood vessels are lined with endothelial cells. Some of the smallest ones. Some of the smallest ones are only endothelial cells. But you can almost think of them as like an anti-coagulant surface, really, right? Because if there weren't any endothelial cells, all the stuff under the endothelium would cause your body to club. So following up on that, when there is some sort of injury or disruption to the endothelial layer, the subendothelium just means under the endothelium. Under the endothelium, right, becomes exposed. And there's a couple of really important molecules that are embedded in the sub-endothelial tissue, and those are called tissue factor, very generic name, tissue factor, and then collagen. And there are many others in that matrix as well, but these are the two that really play a large role in clotting. So platelets can adhere directly to that collagen, and when they adhere to the collagen, And when they adhere to the collagen with certain receptors, and in my group, we're going to talk about different receptors that actually really integrants here that are going to bind to the collagen. And then some of them bind through another molecule known as von Willebren factor. But if they can bind to that collagen, there's some sort of activation process that happens in the cell. And once they get activated, they start to aggregate together and their surface properties actually change. Okay? Change. Okay, now I had meant to make another figure that would go nicely with my other schematics, but I did not have time, so I put this other figure that I got and I didn't put the citation, which is bad. You should always cite the figures, so that's my bad. But I wanted to just make one more kind of clear statement about how activated platelets, they also release things from inside of themselves. So they release certain kinds of granules, so like little sacks of different kinds of agonists for other. Agonists for other platelets, but also other proteins. And they do, some of them are released out of granules, some of them are just released out of the platelet cytoplasm. But what's important about this is that this is one way that platelets have positive feedback on themselves. So they release these agonists that can then bind to other platelets and activate those. And in our group, we're going to talk about different activation pathways this week. All right, so let's. All right, so let's zoom in just a little more and talk about what happens. So, the plasma clotting factors in the blood, they're proteins that are all necessary to this coagulation system. They can bind to this exposed tissue factor, and that initiates all those reactions of coagulation. Okay, so tissue factor is where kind of where it starts here. It's the initiator of the biochemical reaction piece. And then, And then enzymes that are made at the sub-endothelium through tissue factor can actually make their way through the fluid onto the activated platelet surfaces. More enzyme complexes form on the activated platelet surfaces, and in the end, we have the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. And thrombin is the major enzyme in clotting. So you will often, you're going to hear me talk about thrombin a bunch because it's really kind of the way you can, it's a good metric. Of the way you can, it's a good metric for how well your blood is plotting, right? And it's also what makes the fiber mesh, which I'll tell you about in a slide or two. And then thrombin is also a strong platelet activator. There's lots of ways. You can already see like all the positive feedback happening in the system. Platelets get activated, they release stuff that activates other platelets, then on their surfaces they make enzymes that activate other platelets. So it's really multiple ways of amplifying the system to get a really quick clotting response. Really quick clotting response to injury. Okay, there are also natural inhibitors in the blood that slow the process. So you don't want only positive feedback and only positive things happening because otherwise you would just overclot every time you clot, right? So there have to be some sort of natural breaks on the system. So there are some natural inhibitors that are around that can inhibit some of the enzymes so we don't make too much of them. There are also other things on the endothelial surface. Other things on the endothelial surface that can, I like to call it scarf things up that flow downstream, right? So you're not clotting all over the body. And then thrombin cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin, and fibrin is that polymer gel or mesh that then stabilizes all the platelets together. All right, there is a delay. Okay, so this process continues until a stable clot is formed. And then note this is all happening under flow, right? All happening under flow, right? Which makes things much more complicated because you already have these intricate interactions between cells and you have all these chemical reactions and it all has to happen while blood is flowing. Let's talk a little bit more about what flow does. Well, the response to an injury, the hemostatic response, is not always super intuitive under flow because what does flow do? Well, it supplies all the clotting factors that you... All the clotting factors that you need to form bromin and make the clot. It supplies the platelets, and it can enhance some reactions by just constantly maintaining the precursors to these enzymes or the proteins that are necessary in the platelets. But it also removes things, right? So it can attenuate the reactions because it's diluting wherever the reactions are occurring just by carrying things away. And then platelets. And then platelets, also not always intuitive because, yes, they provide this procoagulant surface for all the clotting reactions to occur on, but they also cover up all that tissue factor that might be in the subendothelial tissue. So it's good to think about the different types of roles and the biophysical and sort of biomechanical aspects in the system. So overall, it's difficult to predict. So math is fun and it's appropriate for these complex systems, right? Because we can't really test all of these things in a systematic way without some sort of quantitative approach. So a mathematical representation can help us understand the complexity. And so the goal in my group and in people that I've worked with for a while now on Cloning. For a while now on clutting, is really to try to use models that offer some sort of insight about the system, something that maybe you didn't know before, make some predictions, and make some testable hypotheses. That's a question. Yes, please. There is also a vasso constriction response to injury that may moderate flow in case to prevent MO rash. So I guess that depends on the size of the injury. So are you focusing on one specific Are you focusing on one specific type of physical trauma? Yeah, I mean, to be honest, there are so many things you could add to talk about blood clotting, right? There's different types of vessels, there's pulsatile flow, there's vasoconstriction, there's so many things. And this is really kind of an overview. And the goal for the modeling that I've been doing for the last decade or so is really just try to think about all the complexity of the reactions along with. Reactions along with the flow and the effects of the flow. So, there certainly are other types of questions we could ask if we wanted to know how the Vaso constriction affected it. You'd need a model that would have the flexibility, literally the flexibility to do that. But for me, you know, I want to understand what's the question that I want to answer and then what models are going to be appropriate for trying to answer that question. I'm not going to talk about it today, but it's definitely important. Important. Okay, so I think that's exactly what I just said. So that was a perfect segue. Thank you for that question. I forgot the slide was next. So it depends what you're trying to do, what you want to know. What model are you going to use, right? So a lot of what I've thought about over the last 10 years or so is how does flow affect the system as a whole? What are the limiting factors of clot growth? If they stop growing, why and how? Why and how, how do cell surfaces regulate coagulation? So, I've done a lot of work on this in the last couple of years. I'm actually not talking about any of that, which is really interesting, fun stuff, but you know, you have to stop somewhere. And also, the other focus of my group has been thinking about bleeding and clotting disorders. So, can we use math models to predict phenotypes that can help guide a design? Guide and design different treatment strategies. So, I'm going to talk a little bit about this story, and I'll talk a little bit about this story, and then I'll start to talk about our projects. And I do like to walk when I talk, so I hope I'm not making anybody. It's fun, actually, like I haven't been teaching much, so you have to walk around. All right, so again, it depends what you're trying to do. So, in terms of spatial temporal models, there's a number of groups that are studying this. Number of groups that are studying this, and they're studying it from different aspects and different perspectives. So there is a kinetic lattice Monte Carlo type model from Scott Diamond's group in Pennsylvania. So they're looking at specific discrete structures with some sort of simplified or minimal reactions occurring in the background. Another discrete method comes from the Mark Elberts group at UC Riverside. I've mostly Riverside. I've mostly done work in continuum models, although I'm starting to branch out into discrete, which is very exciting, but it's all very new. George County of Doxon's group at Brown has done a lot of this and looking at arterial thrombosis and stenosis. And then Erin Fogleson's group at Utah, we're kind of merged on a lot of projects because he was my thesis advisor and we're still working together on some projects today. So there are some major challenges. So, there are some major challenges in modeling plotting, right? First of all, the time scale. So, the time scale of plotting is on minutes, right? So, like three to ten minutes. So, depending on the scale that you're trying to model, this can be extremely challenging. So, if you're going to model like discrete structures that are elastic and they're all coming into contact with other structures that are elastic in a flow and a 3D geometry, this is an extremely hard problem to solve. Some of these. Some of these discrete types of models, like these, are going to model like milliseconds, and those could take weeks on computers just for milliseconds of time. But again, it depends how much complexity you want and what you're trying to really model, what you're trying to understand. Again, aggregation, platelet aggregation, activation, and coagulation are really strongly coupled, right? As I mentioned before, we need the surfaces and we need raw men. And we need thromen, and then the activates plateless. And so, understanding how this coupling happens, in addition to having discrete elastic structures, makes it an even more challenging problem. Okay, so the continuum modeling approach that I have been working with for some time overcomes some of these challenges. It certainly comes with limitations, right, because I can't capture the correct biomechanics of the cells. There are lots of things I can't capture, but there are some things, there are still some things that we can. There are still some things that we can. All right, so here's an introduction. This was a model from my thesis, I guess. So this was a while ago, but I'll just show sort of an introduction. So this is what I mean by a continuum model. We're modeling densities of cells, not discrete structures. And what you're seeing here is the growth of a platelet aggregate. And underneath that, there's all these clotting reactions that are occurring. Thrombin is just. Reactions that are occurring. Thrombin is generating platelets, they are releasing agonists from within them and activating other platelets. And we can see that the clot is growing and it's changing the flow. And then within it, right, we see that there's not a lot of flow. So here, one of the things in our model was simulating the clots as a porous material that then is coupled to the flow through some sort of Darcy term. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Regarding this this last part, so um the material do the material properties change as the crop develops? That you update the step is and like yeah, the material properties? Yeah. Can you read her question, Carinda? Yes, I can. She asked if the material properties are changing as the clot is growing. And in this model, no. So there's no viscoelasticity, there's no poroelasticity. There's no poroelasticity, it's porous, and that's it. The density can change, which affects the fluid, and the spatial location changes, and that also affects the fluid. And there is a coupling in the advective and diffusive fluxes of how the cells, the cell densities are moving, that's also affected by the fluid, and the presence of the clot itself. Yeah, did you have a question? No? Okay. So then. So then we've extended this to start thinking about extravascular plotting, cell bleeding, and hemostasis. So, okay, I thought this was going to loop, but it's not. So we have a group and we've been thinking about hemostasis and bleeding disorders for quite some time now. And what we decided to do was come up with a To do was come up with a geometry in an in. I'm sorry, I don't know why this thing doesn't want to work for me, but okay, let's just look at this really quick. So, green are platelets, red is fibrin, and what you see here is an in vitro microexcluinic device where we have blood that is coming in from one side and wash that's coming in from the other, and we can set the velocities or the Set the velocities or the flow into the channels in such a way that it can drive flow through this injury channel, which then is patterned with that tissue factor in collagen that makes glotting start. So the goal was to come up with an in vitro device that then we could then pretty easily model mathematically, right? Because rectangles tend to be easy, but corners are not, but still rectangles tend to be easier to think about. So we've developed, we've sort of furthered Developed, we've sort of furthered this model into an extravascular domain to start thinking about hemostasis, right? So, thrombosis you can think about as a clotting that forms in a vessel and it blocks the vessel. It occludes the vessel, right? And then flow is no longer going through that vessel. Hemostasis, right, is where you have a hole and you want to plug it and then you want the flow to go nicely through the main channel again. So, this was some work that So, this was some work that we've been doing to try to iterate between our in vitro device and our models. And then, this is sort of recent. It's all kind of work in progress right now, but thinking about how different pressures in different vessels and different injury sizes affect the clot structure, the forms affect the timing, the occlusion. So, we're kind of working on this right now. On this right now, it's not a finished story, but we're hoping to learn something about how the different pressures, just really your blood pressure around the body, right, is going to have an effect on the timing and the structure of the clots that form in different types of injuries. And this is kind of interesting where, like, this one doesn't grow much out into the rest of the vessel, but this one does, and the only difference is that the injury is slightly larger, but the pressure drops across that injury are the same. Are the same. So, all right. But coming back to kind of just said that, so I'm going to skip to the next thing. All right, so I wanted to tell you about bleeding disorders. And ultimately, this is what we want to do with the spatial temporal models because we want to be able to test this in vitro. So, bleeding disorders, you can't clock very well. There's different treatments, there's combination treatments. Combination treatments, or interested in learning more about how those treatments can be most effective and in what situations they're effective. So, we'd like to come back and be able to test these different types of treatments in our spatial temporal model, but we also need something a little more high-throughput right now to do our initial studies. So, I'm going to tell you more about coagulation, and then I'm going to tell you about a more high-throughput model in just a minute. So, here's that coagulation. Minute. So here's that coagulation picture I had up there from the beginning. So you don't need to know all of this. What you do need to know is all of these proteins that are involved in coagulation. Plotting factors, they're all denoted with a Roman numeral, so it makes it really challenging when you first start learning about plotting to remember all the different factors and how they're involved. And there's so many different reactions that they are a part of. But ultimately, But ultimately, the coagulation is initiated with tissue factor. It culminates in thromen generation, which I talked about. And there are these different inhibitors. Okay, so I'm going to focus now on one bleeding disorder and one of these clotting factors. Okay, so I'm going to talk about hemophilia. So hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder that's characterized by a factor VIII deficiency in your blood. 8 deficiency in your blood and it is an X-linked recessive trait. I'm going to talk more about this at the end because there are some actual really interesting sex differences that come into play here. But I won't talk about it right this minute. It is characterized in the clinic by just looking at the levels of that protein that you're deficient in. So mild is 5 to 40% of normal, moderate is 1 to 5, and severe is less than 1. But interestingly, there's a well But interestingly, there's a well-known variability in the phenotype. Okay, so what that means is two people with the same level, let's say 5% of factor 8, might have very different bleeding phenotypes and tendencies and frequencies. And there's really, we don't know what the mechanism is underlying that phenotypic variation. So we set out to answer this question, in cases of hemophilia A, whisper deficiency, and mild bleeding, what is compensating for that, for that missing protein, right? There's got to be. But that missing protein, right? There's got to be something else that's helping. So, what is it? So, our idea was to think about how there's a normal variation in everybody's clotting factor levels in your blood. So, it varies among everyone. So, here's all those Roman numerals I was telling you about. These are all the clotting factors that are necessary for clotting. And the normal variation is considered to be about 50 to 150 percent. To be about 50 to 150 percent of some healthy meat. So we hypothesize that there could be a clue to the mechanism underlying this by just thinking about the variation, right? Could there be synergistic or antagonistic behaviors within these sort of normal ranges of plotting factors, right? So if somebody has like slightly low factor seven and slightly high factor two, is that slightly lower and slightly higher combination going to give you something better? Combination is going to give you something better than just slight, a slight variation. So, how do the variations alter thrombin generation? Remember, that's the enzyme that we are going to measure the clotting ability with. So, how does it change thrombin generation when factor VII is deficient? So, like hemophilia A. So, we're going to, I said, we want a high-throughput model, we need something efficient. So, we're going to zoom in and we're really going to model this as a small reaction zone. Small reaction zone that's still subjected to flow in a simplified way through a mass transfer coefficient. But we're going to track all the things that I told you about before. So it's just a basic mass balance where the rate of change of all the stuff in the reaction zone is balanced with the rate the stuff's brought in minus the rate the stuff leaves and then plus minus whatever is being generated or inhibiting within that zone. Right? So we're going to So, we're going to take all these variations in the clotting factors. We're going to take hundreds of thousands of different combinations that are simultaneously varying all the factors. We're going to plug them into our model. Then we're going to look at all the output and we're going to think about analyzing the from an output and see what we can find. Okay? All right, so let me orient you to what this is. This is a quantile plot of these. Of these 100,000 simulations with unique plasma level variations. And what you can see here: this is about 50% of all the data lies in here. Within the orange is 90% of the data. And then between the orange and the gray dash bar is 5% here and 5% here. So that's like the 10% of all of those simulations. This blue line represents one nanomolar of thrombin, and that level is important because that's the concentration that activates. Because that's the concentration that activates other platelets. So that's that measure of like, I'm gonna have fast positive feedback with more platelets that are activated. If I reach that amount, that says we're gonna clot. There aren't many cases, any cases, except one when I was looking at a specific inhibitor with this model that would ever go up to one and then come back down. So usually it'll maybe fire is a good word with the neuroscience people here. Right, it's this positive feedback accelerating system where if you get to this Feedback accelerating system where if you get to this one animal, you're good, the system's gonna go. So there was a small number of simulations out of the 100,000 that led to cases that are over this value, okay, of one nanomolar. So we asked ourselves, well, what are the combinations that led to this? Because really, this situation, nothing should really be generating thrombin. So this is a low tissue factor. Low tissue factor and low factor eight case, right? So we would typically not expect to see any thrombin. But what we're asking the model to tell us is, with all these variations, do we actually see anything that's enhanced? And it turns out we did, right? So now we have to ask, well, what are those things? So if you go and you look at, if you just characterize the input levels. Input levels of the factors that led to those specific simulations, you can definitely see the skewed distributions where you have low factor five and high factor two that lead you to generate more thrombin. So the hypothesis at this point was if an individual with hemophilia A has slightly low normals of factor V and slightly high levels of prothrobin, they may be better off, right? Like they may be able to clot better, they may have less. they may have less they may have less bleeding and then we did a sobal analysis that agreed just decomposing the variance and the fontile plot that I showed you from before and then we can narrow it down to just those two things factor five and factor two so we did that and just showed that having you know neither of those you really don't get much thrombin you add one you get a little bit more if you have um If you have normal factor two and high, sorry, normal factor two and low factor five, you get to one nanomolar. But then if you have both low five and high two, you get that much larger response. So we said to our collaborators, can you try this? Can you try these four combinations for us in your microfluidic devices and see if we see anything, right? This was a complete hypothesis from the model. Low factor five is completely non-intuitive. Chapter 5 is completely non-intuitive because it's necessary for clotting to occur. So it was kind of weird that we came up with that. So we went and did some, we went to our collaborators and said, can you do a flow assay to test our predictions? So what they did is they took a collagen-coated surface and blood from whole blood from hemophilia A patients. And then we were able to add in, we actually had to do this. Add in, we actually had to do this through antibodies for factor five and then added back exogenous factor two. And I'll just kind of, I feel like I've been talking for a while. Someone tell me when to stop talking because, no, I'm doing good. Okay, good. All right, so we wanted to do those combinations of four things to see what would happen. All right, so lo and behold, it worked. Okay, this is very exciting. So, over here is just team. This is very exciting. So, over here is just hemophilia A blood by itself. And so, what you see is that there are platelets that aggregate, but not very many. Okay, so these platelets maybe stuck to the collagen and some of them got activated from the collagen, but they definitely couldn't make any thrombin. And thrombin makes the fibrin, which makes the mesh that holds everything together, right? So, you actually can think about hemophilia as kind of a defective coagulation, not platelet activation. Not platelet activation or platelet aggregation. So, when we added back factor two, that's prothrombin, you see a little more platelet aggregates, probably because you do have a little bit of thrombin and there is a little more platelet activation, but not enough to show large amounts of fibrin. When we add the anti-factor V function blocking antibody, we see a lot of fibrin that gets formed. A lot of fiber that gets formed, and then when we add in profamine, we see like a huge amount of fiber that gets formed. So, our observation was then partially inhibiting factor five enhances fibrin deposition in hemophilia a blood underflow. And this was really exciting. Like, I think this was like the first time in my life as a math biologist where I was like, oh my God, the model predicted something and the experiments like verified it. This is it, like, this is the dream, right? Like, this is the dream. I was so happy. Like, this is the dream. I was so happy. It was a few years ago that this was published, but it was really exciting for our whole team. Is this what Queen Victoria has? What's that? Queen Victoria. Queen Victoria. British royal family. Isn't that what they have? I think so. She must be a carrier. I'm going to talk about carriers in a minute, but I don't know. Someone from England can tell me. I know there are some of you back there. Yes, yeah, but I don't have. Back there, yes, yeah. But I don't know if it was that type, I think the video because it's different types. There are three different types. Someone, okay, how many people have Google? Come on. Let's find out. Well, that's a good question, actually, because I do want to talk about carriers, because that's actually really interesting sex difference in bleeding disorders. Okay, so I'm not going to tell you more about this because I didn't have enough time. About this because I didn't have enough time. But what I will tell you is that, yes, our hypothesis was verified, but we then used the model to figure out what the mechanism was, right? Because the low factor five was an odd thing. And I don't have time to tell you about it, but if you go and look at our paper, we do suggest with the model the biochemical mechanism that led to this enhancement. And it really comes down to a competition, at least what our model suggests, is that it's a competition of two substrates. Competition of two substrates for the same enzyme. And that competition changes when factor five levels are modulated. And then we also have in vitro biochemical assays that are verified that hypothesis as well. And that stuff is currently being written up as we speak. So this has been a really fun project for us. So just to conclude for this part, to study phenotypic variability in haemophilia, we use Phenotypic variability in hemophilia, we used a computational approach based on a model of flow median coagulation. We predicted the modifiers of Fromen generation by just analyzing a bunch of data. We tested and validated the prediction with in vitro experiments. We used an ODE model to predict the mechanism, which I didn't tell you about. We have tested it. And then the biochemical assays that we did that verified that prediction actually motivated a whole new project for us to look at. It turns out there's another protein that we. Look at. It turns out there's another protein that we think is really important. And we went back in and changed the model to study the interactions of that protein in a little more detail. And we have some interesting findings coming out related to that as well. We've been building PDE models of extravascular clotting to try to study the influence of pressure and injury size on occlusion times and clot structure, but ultimately we really want, in the end, we'd like our ODE model to sort of tell us what things to look for in the spatial temporal model. To look for in the spatial temporal model and look at these different combinations of hemophilia treatments, actually, because there are a number of new drugs that have come out for the treatment of hemophilia. And in certain combinations, they found that there's actually over-clotting. Okay, so there's this balance, right? You can't clot. I'm going to give you a drug to make you clot. And then you clot too much. Ugh, right? It's really hard to find that balance. It's really hard to find that balance, and there's lots of other types of situations with medical devices, different bleeding and clotting disorders, where this is a really important balance to try and figure out how to hold on to. Okay, so now let's talk a little bit about sex differences and clotting. So I have three examples I'm going to talk about. The first one are these X-linked recessive bleeding disorders, right? So hemophilia A is one of those, hemophilia B is also. Haemophilia B is also. There's also von Wilbren disease. And so all of these are X-linked recessive. So many bleeding disorders are this way. So what does this mean, an X-linked recessive disorder? So the abnormal gene is responsible for the disorder and it's carried on the X chromosome. Okay, so males have an X and a Y, females have X X chromosome. The males with abnormal gene always give that abnormal gene to their daughters, and they become carriers. Barriers. Females with the abnormal gene can give to sons, and then they are considered affected by that disease or having that disease. And then they can also give it to their daughters as carriers. Okay, and so this is like a little diagram that comes from the CDC if you want to, I mean, there's tons of those that you can find, but you just kind of see what happens here. If you have an affected male and unaffected female, you're always going to get a carrier daughter. If you have an unaffected male and a carrier female, you can get different combinations. Female, you can get different combinations. Okay, so what's interesting about this, interesting and sad also, is that female carriers also have symptoms. And this is not really, there's not a lot, I mean, there are more people now studying this, but it's really not something that clinicians worry that much about, right? Because we don't think about carriers of excellence diseases as having the phenotype. But it turns out that about one-third of them do. About one-third of them do. And the kinds of symptoms that they have are postpartum bleeding, they have maternal and neonatal bleeding complications, they have prolonged bleeding after different surgeries or tooth extractions. And we heard a nice talk at UNC just last week about the history of plotting at UNC because it's a place where they've done a lot of plotting research over the last 50, 60 years, one of which was hemophilia. And it was kind of pointed out in this talk that It out in this talk that right, we have all these treatments for hemophilia now. I mean, they're difficult, they're expensive, they're time-consuming, they're not fun, but people, individuals with hemophilia can live a lot longer than they used to, right? They used to only live until maybe the age of 20. And so there really weren't a lot of people, you know, having more kids because they just were dying before they really became that age of having children. And so I think. And so I think this is just a guess and something that I heard and talking to, right? I mean, people with hemophilia now are living at pretty normal ages and they're having children. They're able to have children now, right? And so I think there are just, it's just more prevalent. There are more carriers in the population because they're living to a, to more of a like childbearing age, right? But we don't really understand this and it doesn't correlate to the levels exactly. To the levels. Exactly. So I feel like there's a lot of stuff in here that could be worked on, but I don't know, someday. So that's just one example of a sex difference in terms of leading disorders. It is just the genetic disorder. Another one is sex differences in clotting from oral contraceptives. So this is a project that I worked on last year at the WHAM program, the Ashley, and some other amazing. Ashley and some other amazing people put on, and a few of you who are in my group are here at this meeting. And I stole your slide from our talk, Anna, and just put it in here because I didn't have to make a new one. But let me just tell you a little bit about oral contraceptives and how they affect the clotting system, or really how they affect coagulation, is what I'm going to talk about. So the basics are: there have been different generations of There have been different generations of oral contraception, oral, and they've had, they've known to have clotting problems pretty much the whole time. But the different generations, as they've changed, have had different combinations of estrogen and progestin. And it seems like the newer contraceptives that have more progestin seem to come along with a higher risk of clotting. And so we wanted to study this. So, one of the metrics that people use to say there's an increased tendency. To say there's an increased tendency to clot is something called the APC resistance test. And it's really APC is an inhibitor. And so if you have resistance to that inhibitor, then you have more tendency to clot. And so this is something you can test in in vitro assays. And cut to the chase, if you look at this plot, there's these red triangles are showing a correlation. Are showing a correlation between APC resistance and a risk of venous thrombosis. This is a correlation. And then APC resistance also increases with oral contraceptive use. That's these purple bars. So all we really know from this is that there might be something going on with oral contraceptives and risk of plotting. So we looked at an older paper that had this beautiful data in it from patients where they were not on oral contraceptives and then they went on one. Oral contraceptives, and then they went on one, then they went off for a while, and then they went on another. And it was the same patients every time. So they call this a crossover study. And it was pretty cool because we actually had these distributions of their clotting factor levels. And it's thought that the oral contraceptives actually are changing the levels of these clotting proteins in your blood. I don't know how that's done. I don't know the mechanism underlying it, but these are the measurements that we had. So we asked ourselves: can these factor level changes alone enhance plotting? Enhance plotting and change the APC sensitivity. So we took a mathematical model, our ODE model that I talked about before, and we took these levels. Oh, this is our team. It's my team. And we tested this out. So what we did was we created a virtual cohort of patients where we made these distributions and factor levels that were modeled after the small number of data points that we had on the last slide. Of data points that we had on the last slide, so that's these guys. We developed an APC sensitivity metric to test that, and indeed, what we showed is that the APC sensitivity is enhanced with just making these factor level changes that were reported in this paper. So, that was exciting for us, but there's a whole more, like a whole lot of other interesting things that we have discovered about what to do. Discovered about what to do when you don't have all the data. There's another oral contraceptive that there was data for that we didn't analyze yet. So there's still more fun work to be done on this project, and I hope that we're going to continue. And lastly, I want to talk about the project that we're going to work on this week. So I only have like a couple of slides. Okay, so the pros robotic effects of estrogen and progestin are usually attributed. And progestin are usually attributed to change in clotting factors. That's what I just told you about, right? But what about platelets? We know that they're coupled. We heard about platelets a little bit from Tony's talk. But let's just briefly rehash what platelets do and why they're important. So they have a central role in clotting, right? They have to be activated to get really sticky and procoagulant. They're necessary for hemostasis. Over or underreactive platelets, so that means platelets that respond really well or really poorly to some agonist can affect clotting in some way. Does estrogen affect flavour activation? Yes. Do we know how? It's murky. So there's different studies out there that will tell you different things. Will tell you different things. And it's been really interesting going through the literature. And my team, I heard last night through someone that they were kind of freaking out because I put too many papers in the Google Drive and they were like, oh my gosh, I put so many papers in there. How can I read all these papers, right? I don't expect you to read all the papers. I haven't read all the papers in complete detail. I hope we're going to like learn something together and try to comb through the literature and really sort of understand, you know, what estrogen is doing. So let's go just one or two more slides further. So So, platelets are activated by agonists, and there's a receptor that goes along with that agonist, right? So, we talked about collagen, it'll bind to collagen, and it does that through glycoprotein 6. Okay, so that's a specific type of receptor, and it has a specific type of signaling pathway that is inside the cell that leads to activation. So, specifically, that's through a tyrosine kinase pathway. Then, there are ADP, this gets released from ADP, this gets released from platelets and it has these two receptors. Thromboxane also gets released from platelets, has this receptor. Thrombin is made from coagulation and it has this receptor. So all of these can lead to platelet activation through different receptors and different pathways. So I stole this image from a little video, but here's the injury. You expose your collagen. You expose your collagen, the platelets bind through GP6. This is actually a typo in their picture. That should be GP6. Platelets get activated, right? But then platelets release thromoxane, it activates them. They release ADP, it activates them. Make thrombin, it activates them. And then there's the shape change, von William factor, and all these different things. So activation of platelets then leads to what? Why do we care about activation? Well, I already told you about surface. Well, I already told you about surface expression because we need coagulation. Okay, we're not going to talk about that in our project this week. Shape change, and they release a bunch of stuff. We're not really going to talk about that too much in my group either. Maybe the release. They also activate like a protein alpha 2B beta3, which binds to fibrinogen, and this is what helps platelet aggregate and stick together. So when I say they have to be activated to be really sticky, they can bind through these initial integrands here. Through these initial integrands here, but once they go through this activation process, then they can really stick together through the fibrinogen molecules. And so, really, what we want to know, right, is something about where estrogen is going to fit into this, but how is it affecting and is it affecting these different signalings from the different agonists that lead to this glycoprotein activation? All right, last slide. So, the literature suggests. So, the literature suggests, I should say, some conflicting results. It's interesting when you look at hormone replacement therapy, estrogen therapy, and it's different pre- and post-menopausal. You know, again, we've got to deal with this at some point. So, there's a higher thrombosis risk versus lower reactivity. So, there's different studies that are going to tell us some different things. But, what we have in our hot little hands this week is. Have in our hot little hands this week is some data from one of my collaborators showing that estrogen decreases platela activation in the presence of three of those agonists. Okay, so does that suggest that it's independent of those? I don't know. His hypothesis, and this might be useful for Richard's project, maybe I don't know, is that it's potentially the membrane characteristics. So it's actually known. Characteristics. So it's actually known that steroids and hormones can change the membrane properties and can make them more fluid, which can change the lipid raft construction, which can change the way different ion channels are grouping. It can change the way different receptors are clustering, which can certainly alter downstream signaling. So we're going to talk about different types of models, but I think what I hope our group can do this week is think about a model that can sort of Is think about a model that can sort of test this hypothesis. I don't know what the model is going to be yet. We have different things that we can try out. I haven't even told you about estrogen receptors because there are estrogen receptors on platelets too. But I hope that we can learn together as a group and see what we come up with. So we do have some nice dose response curves data that we can use as well. That we can use as well. So it's like slow cytometry data, so it's just going to tell us percents of cells that are activated under different stimuli of agonists. Okay, I feel like I've talked long enough. These are all the people that I've worked with for a long time that are amazing. I have to say team science is like the best thing in the whole world. I love working with my collaborators. I love working with other people. And it's really fun to get to do that again this week. And if you have questions, I am open. Open. Now, thank you.
