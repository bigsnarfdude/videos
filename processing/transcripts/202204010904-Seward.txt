Question and discussion period. Does anyone have any questions they'd like to present? Sure. Um I'm going to construct water fields on the tourist event. Dr. Fields and the Taurus that uh you don't need you don't have uh parallel classification, you don't need an uh numerical environment, don't have a numerical environment, of course. And the construction is like that. You say that the torus take an irrational flow in the torus, and then you do something to distinguish two orbits. Like two cells like that. But it could also be structural stables. These are cells and these are semiconsources. And the map from here to here is still just generational rotation. And so if you want to classify these guys, you want to know. Want to classify these guys, you want to know whether this point is then, well, if the problem like that is fixed, then you know the rotation number, because you can just look at one trajectory and see how it reads around the torus. So, I mean, when you classify up to homeomorphism these vector fields, up to homeomorphism that preserve H1 of the choice. So you need to preserve the generators. And then if two guys are equivalent, then the rotation numbers are at the same, and the distance between this trajectory and this trajectory must be also at the same posno-irrational rotation. Which means that the relevant that classifies these guys S is one orbit of a rational rotation. And then there is no Borel function that takes unit circles to a border space and takes each orbit to one point. So there is no this is equivalent to easier, right? At least understood. At least Annus taught me that this stuff as a rational annotation is easy. And the question is, what do you get if you pass two spheres with handles and look as simple construction the self-return maps can be much more interesting? Whether we get anything more interesting than easy. Can we have anything more interesting than easy really if we move to spheres with handles? Spheres with handles. Then the map from here to here could be, well, any map of the interval could be discontinuous. These guys are interesting. I hope that these guys are interesting. So I don't know how interesting they can be. Thank you. Does anyone have any questions or comments related to this? Anyone else have a question they'd like to present? I'd like to present, person I'd like to discuss. So, okay. So, this question is about the conjugacy. The conjugacy problem and the connection with full groups. So I'll start with just this question which is due to Tu, which he asked me some time ago when I told him about this and what football said. He actually asked me something about football, which is a very cool question, I think. So take T, the stone half. Uh the standard one halt one half uh battery shift. Okay. And now take U in the football of T suppose that U is isomorphic to T and then the question is R T and U T and U conjugate, but in the full group of T. So basically what you're asking is, is there a version of Holstein's theory which allows you to preserve the orbits? Okay? So this is a very cool question. I have absolutely no idea on how to attack it. So I'll propose I'll propose something, a kind of more general version of this question, which is the following. So we heard about this relation a lot. So is, I'll just write it this way, is conjugacy in Bohel. Bohr reducible to configuracy in the for group. So I think this is a much more trackable question. And I mean, I don't know the answer, but so there were some tools from some recent. Some recent, I should not say tools, it's really a pretty good new theory which have been developed by younger people. And I will probably forget some names, but so there is Arisotelispanejiutopros there is also Martino Rupini, who is not so young actually. He's as young as me, so Jeffrey Duckwork and also Sean Allison. I might spell this wrong. So, and what they did is very interesting to me. So, we have this picture, I mean, this picture of equivalence relationships. This picture of equivalence relations that was presented to you, I think, was kind of incomplete in the sense that, okay, if you look at actions of Polish groups, then simpler things that you can find is compact groups, you always get something smooth. And then, okay, I'll be very, very sketchy, but you have this direction where you look at S infinity actions. And then, And then you have this very nice dividing line provided by turbulence. Okay? But there is another way you can go, and which was developed by these people, which is the remark that compact group is actually a two-sided invariant group, which means that you can find a compatible. You can find a compatible complete metric on this group which is invariant in both directions. Okay? And the point is that here, these full groups, they do belong in here. And even below that, I mean above that, you you have this more general class of CLI groups. So these are the ones ones which admit a complete left invariant metric. Left invariant metric. L1 full groups are examples of this, and actually, locally compact groups are any locally compact group falls in this class. And basically what they developed, so I'm really not an expert on this theory, I just think it should be mentioned, they developed analogues of turbulence which allow you to say that you're outside of this realm or that you're even outside of this realm. So, and okay, so I guess my real question is: I don't know if any of these guys is online, but one thing that I would really like to know is, is there their techniques, can they show that basically out of x mu, this conjugacy action, does it satisfy their condition, which would tell us that then they are outside of this realm? Then they are outside of this realm, and in particular, so the answer of this question would be no. It cannot be correlated. Okay? And one more thing to say that, of course, if the answer to this question is yes, then at least thanks to what they did, it's clear that the conjugacy relation cannot be universal because of this dividing line that they default. So yeah, that's all I okay. Yeah, now I wanted just to add one more thing. So this I really don't know much about this, but I think this could be of interest to people in dynamical systems who know what cohomology is. I don't. But apparently, what they do in particular allows you to say that some problems cannot be classified by chromological invariants. So I personally don't know what that means, but it seems very interesting. And I don't know if you have some kind of problems like this in dynamical system, but I really think you should look up their papers on this stuff. Because it's kind of a new thing compared to turbulence. And I mean, they give very interesting examples, but the more the merrier, of course. So on your second question here is, is T just any measure closing transformation? So then you have this full loop which is actually unique. And then yeah, you can definitely, by DIY's theorem, every element of X mu sits in there. And one thing we we observed with. Sorry, uh the auto resonance. No, uh but okay no I mean the the the the okay just uh you you you you really have I mean basically you have this boundary shift and you are yeah I mean the question specified yeah yes it's not exactly that okay you're really looking at the controversy action of this week which Group, which, I mean, it's kind of like this phenomenon that you had in smooth dynamics, that you have this bigger group, like the homeomorphism group, which gives you conjugate guys. And sometimes you can conjugate by actually differomorphisms, and sometimes you cannot. But the equivalence relation you want to look at is conjugacy by measure plugins. By measure putting some transformation. So, I mean, one part of this question would be a much easier question. I don't know if it's really easier, but would be you look at the conjugacy relation, intersect it with the full group. Do you get something different actually? Or don't you that I don't know at all. And that's yeah kind of this this question. There's something I didn't quite hear. So are you s saying that these things you've talked about, TSI and CLI, would show that the general relation of conjugacy is not reducible, is not maximal on the polar channel? Are you asking inside a given class, inside a given orbit class? Okay. I was saying that if this question That if this question has a positive answer, then the conjugacy relation cannot be universal. It cannot be the general conjugacy relation. Or the general conjugacy relation. The general conjugacy relation on autofix. Not just restrictive. Yeah, I mean the I may maybe there's an easy way to say this, but to to to see this, but uh but def definitely with the the things that they did, I mean The things that they did, I mean, it's yeah, they give you obstruction to having a TSI group action, to being bored reducible to a TSI group action. So just updated, I'm sure that. So, I mean, yeah, my again, the real version of this, I mean, I believe that the answer should be no, and that their techniques actually. And and that their techniques actually apply to show that the answer to this question is I'm I don't I I'm really not uh an expert on these things, so for the first question, have you spent any time thinking about it? I'm like I wonder if have you thought about just trying to do kind of like some sort of sinai version of it? I don't know if that even makes sense. Frankly speaking, I try to look at Ernst's theory and I To look at Ernst's theory, and I understood some bits, but clearly not all of it. So, yeah, that's something that I basically gave up on this question, but I really like it. Now that I think about it more, I guess I don't even know how to formulate a CNI factor version of this question, I guess. Yeah, yeah. I like the question. Good. Any other comments on this? I'll just I'll throw one thing out related to that question. I don't know if it's at all relevant, but I remember many years ago Ben Miller had done some work with the full groups of countable equivalence revisions, looking at some sort of similar questions of sort of when you to stay within the full group and do stuff. I I don't know if any of that is at all relevant here, but might be something to look at. But might be something to look at. Okay. Thank you. Uh does anyone else else have a question they'd like to present? Yeah, I can select. They're really good restrictions here. And so this is an attempt to connect homogeneous dynamics to our topic here. So we take and move. S L D R D is at least free and we take a lattice output that's then S and T C we get the space which you know uh the lattice lambda and consider the actions of uh SAP on this uh Subbook on this file that you show. So we have two subbooks that we are interested in. One is the Lerma subbook. And the other is what we call the report case, which is a sample. Case, which is a circle generated by and one parameter important sums. So this means that it is generated. The exponential of t n for ten and irrepotento and impotent. So, um I will uh say some things that are probably previous to a lot of people here, but we didn't discuss anything like this uh during this conference. So, just uh to make uh it clear that if we have uh uh an element uh a A here and H which is uh sub Choose some element of the space on x just by giving us a g the g posit of the lattice. So this is the A big topic of research in my hands or specification of internal methods. On this X. So let me state a motivating silver for this question and motivating your conjecture. So this is the silver of Marina Backlet. Some point in all space look at the orbit closure under this hook, which can be angry that satisfies these conditions. When it turns out that it will be the object of The object of some other group L, which is a closed sample between H and G. So if you look at an orbit closure, it's actually the orbit of some larger group. bit of some larger hope. Now moreover there is an L invariant measure, probability measure on this closed opening, you get it from the HAL measure on L and Um and uh the interesting part is that every uh h invariant measure uh on x is uh like that. Like that, I mean it's uh an invalid measure or some closed option. And invalid measurements are closed of it. So it's called measure classification in homogeneous dynamics. Arguably this is the same sort of classification that we talked about in set theory, but anyway it's definitely a case of what of the very A case of what of the very thing that Federico described as rigidity yesterday. So this was from H generated by Products. Now the other case was Now the other case the where the uh which is not generated by either contents is still this is a conjecture of Marco's the following so I'm actually uh uh as one conjecture where you can say it also as a few conjectures, but uh It also has a few conjectures, but it doesn't matter. So if the orbit of A, so you remember that A is the diagonal group, you know, there will be other things, but let's say specifically that this. So if this is compact then And that is a closed of bit of some group L, like in that case. And when I said that D needs to be at least free, this is actually of this conjecture, for the other one it's an of this conjecture, for the other one is uh so this is uh not a measure classification, this uh but this says uh uh sort of uh classifies the orbit uh closures up to some uh backness condition. Second thing is that if we have a probability measure on X which is a A in variant and A In a body, then again we should get a similar conclusion to what Ragnar says. So we want to get that Q is the component measure on a closed orbit. Or we'll at least something between A and G and those are okay. And I should uh comment that uh there's a sermon of uh I single anatolic at all. And talk a talk and in non-interstruct that says that this is true if there exists some element in the work such that the entropy of this measure and this transformation is positive. So we have these two theorems and they say that under some conditions on your group, the group for which you require invariance of the measure, then you get a r a rigidity of this measure that is going to be uh uh what we call homogeneous. We call the homogeneous, which is the same here. But there are also counterexamples. So there are groups, some groups such that and that they are not really. Not uh trivial, such that uh there exist uh non homogeneous invariant versions or the merchants and actually uh I think that uh I think that this conjecture, as I said here, is not correct, but sort of you can change a bit something there to get it to be correct, or to get it to be not incorrect, but there are non-trivial counterexamples for statements of this response. So, the question that I'm raising Please do follow. I want to look at the sign of subgroups A such that there exists a variant, maybe let's call it The other letter instead. Let's call it H prime of something. So we don't require anything about this H prime. We just want that H there are H prime variant erodic. Well at end robotic. I mean, the question is: uh what are the descriptive setivity properties of these set aside? This for example is it for L is it? And for example, it could be interesting, I think is that the definition that you want? You want to say something about the probability measure to be non-homogeneous? Ah, yes, obviously, if you are correct. Yes. And this so this uh is just uh everything, but uh It's just uh everything. But uh I'm interested in non-homogeneous measures, age for which there is non-homogeneous measures. Thank you. So this theorem says that uh uh these uh types of uh uh subgroups are outside uh exide. This theorem says that the groups Groups, subgroups generated by detectants are outside the site. So the question is: which what kind of structure does this site have one seen? And this is sort of interesting, I think, from the perspective of even just homogeneous dynamics without says here. Just to know what can you expect. what can you expect uh this uh conjecture to be generalized? I mean what what kind of measures can you invalid measures can you even classify sort of uh It's it's not empty. Uh it so there are okay, so uh it contains uh the trivial hook, but this is a sort of a stupid statement. But uh uh it also contains uh uh uh one one parameter who's a part uh but uh Okay. But but I'm not sure if it contains what exactly it contains. I have a question I'd like to chair. So, what is the complexity of the relation? Of the relation of measure conjugacy on the set of automorphisms of some fixed standard probability space non-atomic that are K-systems or K-automorphisms. Or chaomorphisms. So K as in Komogorov or as in completely positive entropy. So the chaotomorphisms are considered to be those actions of Z that are closest to behaving like Bernoulli shifts. And for Bernoulli shifts, And for Bernoulli shifts, the measure conjugacy relation is smooth. Bernoulli shifts are classified by their entropy by Ornstein's isomorphism theorem. And so these are kind of the next closest family of actions. And I don't know, so maybe the measure conjugacy relation is not too complicated, perhaps, or maybe it is. I don't know. Let's see, so Ornstein, and I didn't do my homework before this to. Shields. Thank you. All right, so Ornstein and Shields. I hope I guessed what you were saying. I think you probably did, yeah. So they showed that there exists uncountably many. That there exists uncountably many isomorphism classes of case systems. Actually, I guess this is what I'm doing. What I just said is kind of trivial because you could just use Bernoulli shifts of different entropies. But they think they did this construction for any fixed entropy. Yeah, for any fixed entropy value, there are uncountably many isomorphism classes of case systems that are not really of a given entropy. And I've, let's see, so I mean their proof of this, I think it, I've never looked at it myself, but I've heard it's pretty technical and involved in using the cutting and stacking technology. So again, I've never looked at their construction myself, but someone who has looked at it a little bit told me that they believe the construction already shows that this is non-smooth. Feldman remarked. Feldman remarked. Oh, okay. They may have given this event piece of their own, and Feldman showed that MDP is knowledgeable. He didn't have the language for not speaking, but his proof exactly failed. Wait, can you say it again? What? This may, any given entropy, I'm not sure. They may be at entropy. Well, it has to be positive entropy because there are cases. Anyway, Feldman was the one who remarked. Feldman was the one who remarked that there's no entropy isn't difficult. Feldman basically showed that you can embed E0. Okay. All right, thank you. That language didn't exist then. That was. Is this like just folklore or? No E as a paper. Okay, it's referenced in the background server. Anyways, yeah, I don't know if anyone has Know if anyone has Feldman with two ends at the end? I think it's just one. I don't know if anyone has, you know, anyone with some descriptive set theory knowledge, well, I mean, okay, Felton. I don't know if recently, if in recent times, anyone has really looked at this seriously, trying to show that the complexity is higher in some way. Any further comments? Any further comments or questions related to that? Do you have any upper bound on that? No, not that I know of. I mean, beyond the upper bound of just measure conjugacy in general. Yeah. And we the set of KO to Another way of saying it is that the past is asymptotically independent of the present. The present is asymptotically independent of the past. Alternate definition of K or is I have a mess you can write down. Oh, you were asking if it's bro? I thought you were saying bro. Actually, in Mark Process, we shouldn't describe the exact data. Anyone else have a question they'd like to present? Question they'd like to present? Something they'd like to discuss? Several diffomorphism features that we please. So it's what Tom Graysky is asking, it's how complicated can the classification for differentisms be complicated. So that was one picture I included kind of statistics aspect. Another picture that I don't keep saying is phenomena. And the thing is that in this picture you have lots of sense and sources, and they may have different periods. And the question is. And the question is, can we classify them using graphs? Infinite graphs. Because, I mean, we have all the components here. We have infinite, many points, things, and sources. We have links between them. And we also have saddles. Saddles, we have edges of graphs. The question is: can we modify this picture a little bit so that it is classifiable by infinite graphs? This is one thing. And the other thing is I got really interested in vector flows and vector fields on the torus and spheres with more handles because what happens is the first return maps that control the dynamics are changed. That control the dynamics are just introvert maps and they can be rather rich. So, they are not measured preservants, so there is a lot of freedom to show that. And the question is, what is the classification of the home morphisms for vector fields on the spheres with hands? And one of the pictures that I showed you, like another one. But I'm not sure it works, of course. So this is a torus. So this is a tournament. And you place like sink, one sink at one point, and you can also place a settle. And there is nothing else. So this is just sink in the saddle. And the separatists of the settle, they just go and go around the tours. Go around the tours, they may not intersect, but they may do whatever they want. There's no restrictions, because if you want to draw a finite piece of securities, this doesn't divide the tours, and we can draw. And we can do any walk. The prefix can do a random element of pi1 if you store every finite piece. And you can correct this any finite piece of pi1 by homomorphisms. But you cannot correct by homomorphisms all the infinite pictures. So maybe this is more interesting than just an easy rule. I believe this will be infinite. I believe this will be inefficient. I have no proof. The question is how exotic I can do by just the vector fields on the tours, or experience with handles, are much more simple than this, because they are essentially one-dimensional. So the question is how far they can go in being complex qui complex com complex specifiable. That's the question. I have a comment. Not being able to classify using graphs is equivalent not being reducible to an estimate. And the issue for, there's this turbulence question. The definition of turbulence involves a group action. So if you have equivalence relation without a group action, then you have to find a turbulent relation. To find a turbulent relation that you could, but this is putting it inside that S-infinity action. Would anyone else like to present a question or a discussion? I can, but I don't want to. If anybody else has one, they should do it. I mean, there's something I could mention that's dynamics really, but it doesn't really involve so much descriptive set theory. But maybe I'll just mention it's brief. Is there a Jewet-Prieger theorem for it? Thanks. So it's known for amendable groups, although I think it's not published in that generality. For all non-amendable groups, I think it's open. But just to say something concrete, say for free groups. So in other words, if you have a free ergotic A free ergodic action of a free group? Does it admit a compact, minimal, uniquely ergodic model? I've spent some time thinking about it in the past. It feels like a very hard question to me. I think Krieger generator helps a little bit, right? Yeah, so you have a Krieger theorem, so you can get, you know, I mean, assuming the action has like finite entropy, you can get a finite generating partition, so you can get a map, an embedding into a shift action. Yeah, you need like minimality, unique ergodicity. And the difficulty there is, you know, for amenable groups, you can. The difficulty there is, you know, for amenable groups, you can kind of use Fulner sets. And when you're doing the Krieger theme and building this generator, you can build it so that labels occur with certain frequencies in Fulner sets. And then this forces any invariant measure attached to it to say that that label has to have some approximate measure. And you kind of do this asymptotically, like refining it and getting these frequencies. Getting these frequencies better and better to converge, and that's how you get the unique regoticity. But for non-mimble groups, you don't have these phoner sets, then how do you force that a particular label will get measured one-third by every invariant measure? It's much more challenging. Anyone else have a question they'd like to present? What's the schedule now? We supposed to stop we're supposed to stop in 10 minutes. Stop early. Stop early? We can stop early or I can go now. But we don't have any questions for this. It's up to you. Although I'm not going to be... I think Felipe and I won't be here for your session a little bit later. Okay, so why don't I do it now? Sure, if there's nothing else we can. Okay. But I may go a little bit over time. So, first of all, I do have this survey. The conference has motivated me to correct mistakes in the survey and so on. But the survey has a number of problems in the back, including, well, I'm going to add these. Philippe is gathering these problems, so please, various people have agreed to please write your problem. Have agreed to please write your problem up and tap with a little bit of background and also a bibliography, references, so people know where to go to understand what you're saying. Okay, the first question with an eraser, this is hard. The first question is very much in the theme of the smooth dynamics. We had this notion with Axon A. And the question: so when I say conjugacity here, So when I say conjugacy here, conjugacy is up to homeomorphisms, bi-homeomorphisms. And M is a compact spoon manifold. And of course, the microphone is a little bit And the question which seems completely open is conjugacy on the axian A diffeomorphisms. All of this work that was done, things related to the snail horseshoe and so on, this is still a So on, this is still an open problem. So, this showing that it's not Borrel would show that there really is an inherent issue with all of the problems that were done very classically by Bolen. A related question, there's another equivalence relation. So let S and T be, oh, sorry, wrong culture. F and G F and G the axiom A is conjugacy is known only if the non-wandering set. Of F is conjugate to non-wandering set of G. So this is studied as well, and is this for L? So this is a weaker equivalence relation than this. This equivalence relation we find to this one, but this is also a well-studied class. Again, I don't know what I'm talking about. There's something called the no cycle condition and the no cycle condition. And the no cycle condition implies. So, if you look at those diffeomorphisms that have the no cycle condition, then the answer is the E class is stable. If you have a no-cycle condition, then there's a neighborhood of the transformation such that everything in that neighborhood of the transformation has Neighborhood of the transformation has conjugate non-1 big segment. So if you can show this is not Borel, then one star is the set is conjugacy, so full conjugacy, not just on the non-wandering set, axiom A. With the cycle condition for L. And my understanding, again, is that there are examples of transformations where the non-wandering sets are conjugate, but the transformations are not conjugate. So the conjugacy of non-wandering sets. Yes. Sorry? When you say the sets are cranjig, you just mean your sets on the F and G are conjugate if you can conjugate F by homeomorphism. You're right about your saying the non-wanted sets. There are restrictions to the non-wanted sets. Oh, okay. There's a conjugate map that takes the non-white sets. Conjugate map that takes the non-londron. Function restriction. But don't ask me too much about this. One question which I find quite awkward, so this is another general question about stability is the following: here's a fact where our Um where our stable F with uh G conjugate to F and G not stable. So there are examples like that. So when we say that the conjugacy for stable diffeomorphisms is smooth, Is smooth, we're not looking at the whole equivalence class. So the question is the following: suppose, is there a, suppose, is there a function, is there a bra function, say? I'll call it S for selector from the set of G such that G Such that G is conjugate to a stable F to the set of F, such that F is stable, such that S of G is equal to F. So this is a way So this is a way so here we have the stable ones, here we have a G, which is conjugate to an F. This is the neighborhood of F where it's stable. Is there a way of choosing something in the neighborhood of F or some stable neighborhood that's conjugate to G. I mean, we're trying to classify the whole equivalence classes, and what we've remarked is that if you Remarked is that if you are in the part of your equivalence class where you're stable and you can associate numerical invariance, that's different than associating numerical invariance to the whole class. And this seems to be. Again, I have a long list. Let me just ask one more that isn't on the list in the paper. And this is a pure value theory question. Question: There's a theory developed by Furstenberg and Zimmer independently, but it says the following. I'm going to abbreviate. So if T is robotic, then there is an ordinal alpha. Um such that uh there is a power T alpha, T beta beta less than alpha, such that first of all T beta plus one is a compact extension. is a compact extension, relatively compact extension of P beta. If gamma is limit, then T gamma is the inverse limit instead of T beta, beta less than gamma, and T is a Uh T is a it's either it's either so either T is equal to T alpha where T is a weekly mixing extension of T alpha. Okay, so how did this Okay, so how did this come up? In Furstenberg's original proof of the Samariti theorem, he did it by induction on these ordinals. He had a recurrence property, and he showed it by induction on these ordinals. What ordinals come up? Well, exactly the countable ordinals come up. And t is called measured distal if t is equal to t alpha, so you don't need the link mixing piece on top. And it's a theorem. And it's a theorem we're coming. It's a theorem from Valejnet and myself at the set of t, such that t is equal to t alpha. So I'm using so I'll measure this tool. Transformations is complete above the And with some work you can prove the following if you fix an ordinal alpha then conjugacy restricted to the set of t such that t is equal to t Uh t is equal to t alpha, and alpha is founded. T is equal to t theta, some beta less than or equal to alpha. Look at the least alpha. This gives an increasing collection. If you bound the alpha, if you bound the beta, so t is equal to t beta, some beta less than or equal to alpha, then this isomorphism is Borel. So for each of the classes, So for each of the classes, the Fursenberg structure theorem gives you enough information you can decide whether or not it's Borel. So the question, by this strange, because the whole set, the set is not Borel, the fullness relation is Borel unbounded classes. So is there a class C which contains the set of T, such that T is measured distal. Distal and measure conjugacy restricted to C is Borel. So by overspill, this has to be much bigger set than the set of T. Measured this long. Yeah, I think I'll stop there. I got the bell, so I got the gone. A natural class would be systems that are for time equivalent to rotations. I see. Okay, well. I don't know. That's a bigger class. So if you take all the systems that are equivalent to a rotation, that will contain the distant systems. That class is what, but I have no idea uh what's the sum of distance objects. I think. Okay. So you have a candidate from the E channel? That would be nice. Okay. Will you include that comment when I submit this question? Okay. If you fix the ordinal alpha, then that says relax. Yeah, this is the ordinal is a pi 11. It's an ordinal alpha, it's a set of things sort of you're looking at the least ordinal such that you can build T. Such that you can build it to mean. If you fix a code for anywhere in the wildflowers, it's a dollar one code down there. I don't know the answer to that. Set below that, of course, is, but yeah. But the isomorphism, you prove it by induction. It's a question about co-cycles and when you're co-cycled above once. Do we end the meeting or okay. At any rate, thank you all for coming. I think it was a very good meeting. Lots of people talked to each other who'd never met, and there was lots of animated discussion. Thank you for coming. Eventually. Okay, we're over. We're done. Okay. And I think there's coffee and cookies.
