Of the Pi's is equal to D. Then, well, any n plus one upper like that defines a morphism, and more precisely, we get a projection map, which goes from Which goes from W D to the space of morphisms. And this is a GM torso, which means that if I look at the class of W D, this will be simply L minus one times the class of the morphism of Of the grid V from P1 to Pn. So this is a gem torso, so it's it splits. Well, it's locally trivial for the RSC topology. So this means that in the integrated ring, we have samples that the class is a product. Okay, so now we want to compute the class of W D. So let me go to the next slide. Okay. So, how to compute W D. So, the thing which is slightly inconvenient is the GCD condition. But as usual, the GCD condition can be more or less removed by using a Mobius argument. So, here, more precisely, what can we say? So, if we take any n plus one upper. n plus one apple of polynomials and if we assume that the maximum of the degree of the p i's is equal to t then there is a a g c d so i take the gcd of these polynomials this is a unitary polynomial This is a unitary polynomial. And therefore, I get that P0 over T up to Pn over T will be an element of W D minus the degree of the GCT. So using that, we get that the space of polynomials which satisfies this condition that the maximum Satisfies this condition that the maximum of the degree is equal to d. And this I can describe quite easily because it is the space of polynomials of degree of degree less than D minus the space of polynomials of degree strictly less than D. And the point is that if The point is that if I look at that, this is simply the sum of the space. So I have to consider the space, the space of possible G C D's. So this is a space of unitary polynomials of degree D prime. So L D prime. L D prime. So this corresponds to the G C D the possibilities for the G C D times W discount. Okay, so of course to here we recognize the product of formal series, so we can express this with formal series. With coefficients in the grotendic ring, so using formal series, what do we get? We get that Ln plus 1 minus 1 times the sum for over D of L d n plus 1 T D is equal to the sum over D of L power D T. L power d t at the power t times the sum over d of w t t at the power t. And using that, we now get that, in fact, the class of W D multiplied by L at the power minus n plus one d. is equal to quite a simple simple symbol so I am inverting L but this is quite standard for any D bigger than one so in that particular case oh sorry I made a misprint here this is a space I divided by L minus one so this is a space of So, this is a space of morphism of the grid D from P1 to Pn. But anyway, the nice point is that once I re-normalized the class of the space of morphism by this, so to get something which has dimension, finite dimension. Then I get that this product, this renov. This product, this renormalized class is constant for d bigger than one. So it's stabilized. Okay, so can we do that for other examples? So there is an example which is we get for free from that. So what we get for free is the product, the case, of the product of projective space. Projective spaces. So V is a product, let's say, for I going from 1 to M of projective space of dimension and I. So in that case, of course, there is not one degree, but for each projection to a projective space, give A projective space give a degree. So, in other words, I can look at the degree map, which goes from the map from P1 to V to Z at the power M. So, in fact, I'm looking at the class of the morphism in the dual of the Picard group. That is the morphism from the Picard group of V to Z. Kakupa V to Z. So now if I take an element in Z power M, which I denote by D underscore, what I get is that the, well, obviously the morphism with multi-degree D from P1 to V, this is simply given by taking the composition. The composition with the projection. So, in fact, it is the same as the product of the morphism of degree di from P1 to Pni. And therefore, I get the simple formula that the morphism of multi-degree D from P1 to V renormalized. So, I will take L at the power sum. at the power sum going for i going from one to m of d i n i plus one is equal to the product for i going from one to m of l n i plus one minus one over l minus one one minus l at the power minus n i on the And this is true if all of the DIs are bigger than one. So you should note that if you look at this dimension here, in fact, it's simply the so D is an element of the dual of the Picard group. You can look at a particular element of the Picard group, which is omega V. Of the Picard group, which is omega v minus one, and you have that this is precisely the sum for i from one to m of di times n i plus one. So this explains this power here. So this is precisely the degree relative to omega phi minus one. So more generally, what we are doing is completely compatible. We are doing is completely compatible with the product. So, if you have a nice formula for varieties, you have a nice formula for the product of the varieties. All right. So, let me go to the next slide. So, as a last example, let me describe the case of P2 blown up in a point. Uh P2 blown up in a point. So, in that case, so V, the surface V I'm looking at can be seen as embedded in P2 cross P1 with homogeneous coordinates x. with homogeneous coordinates x, y, t and u, v. And the equation is, let's say, yu is equal to xv. And the projection to the project space is simply the first projection and is the blowing up of the point with coordinate 001 in P2. And then you can do in a In a almost as elementary way as before, the computation of the morphisms of the grade E from P1 to P2. Then the if I'm not wrong, you have to normalize. So again, there is a projection to P2 and the projection to P1. So you have two degrees, T1 and D2. D1 and D2. And you get, so it's not as nice as a product of a projective space. It's not exactly equal to a constant, but it's in fact equals to something like that, which is, well, I write it like that. So the constant we obtained for P1 cross P1, in fact, plus plus an error. Plus an error term, but the point is that the dimension of the error term goes to minus infinity as t1 plus t2 and t2 goes to infinity. So in this I am using the dimension of a symbol like that. Like that is simply equals to the dimension of V plus K for any K in Z. So this can goes to minus infinity. So again, I'm not completely sure of 3d1 plus 2d2. I should have checked my computations. But anyway, what you get is again D. That is again d applied to omega v minus one. So I think it is indeed that. One of the nice points is that the constant you obtain, the main term in some sense, is the same as for P1 times P1. But in fact, it's not that surprising because if you think of it, the motif of V is the same as the motif of P1 times P1. P1. So, in fact, the limit here seems to depend only on the motive of the variety. Okay, so I have given some examples, so now let me go to the general setting. But, Emmanuel, when you say it's not so surprising, it's not obvious, is it? That I mean, it's not obvious. Okay. And the effective cone is different, so the result is not exactly the same. But still, the point is that the limit seems to depend only on the motive. Right. Okay, so let me go to the general setting. So, um, so the general setting is: I take C to be a smooth, projective, geometrically integral variety over curve, sorry, curve over little k. curve over little k I take capital K to be the function field of the curve over little k and I take V over K to be n-dimensional smooth projective and geometrically integral variety integral variety over capital K and then I need to choose model so I will take a projective model of V over C which comes with a structural morphism from V to C and also I assume that well Well, I could say that V is Fano over capital K, but say almost Fano. I'm not going to define that precisely. Actually, it's not totally clear what is the right condition. So, Fano is too strong. So, I would like to have something which is weaker than Fano, but I don't know exactly what it. Fano, but I don't know exactly what it should be. So, anyway, I need at least that omega v minus one is big in a strict sense. I need v to be rationally connected, say, so to have a lot of p1s and other more technical conditions. For example, I need also that the picker group of V bar, so V bar is over K bar. is over k bar over the algebraic college of k to be a free z model of finite trunk well i think also implicitly i'm using that the effective cone cone of effective devices Devices is finitely generated. So as I said, I mean, I'm using a lot of conditions. And I said that Fano is enough. Fano is enough in characteristic zero, but in finite characteristic, I should be more careful because I have to assume some vanishing of comologies as well. Anyway, so using using models, so using models so using models of a basis of the pica group, I can define again a degree map which goes from the space of sections of the structural morphism. So I see. Structural morphism. So I see this as a morphism from C to V over C to the dual of the picker group of V. So again, it's simply by taking the degree relative to, let's say, basis. So this is the reason for which I need models of the basis of the picker crop. And the point is that this This will map a movable morphism, so a morphism which can be deformed, to an element in the dual of the effective cone. So the dual efficiency cone is defined as a set of y in the dual of the picker group over R such that y applied to D for any effective D is positive. D is positive or zero. So if with this kind of degree, I can then define, as before, the space of morphism of multi-degree D, so from C to V. And then a And then I can renormalize as before by L at the power minus omega v minus one d. And this defines a class in MK, which is, as before, the Goten D ring in which I invert L. All right, so I'm interested, in fact, in the asymptotic behavior. The asymptotic behavior of this class. So, to define the asymptotic behavior, I need a topology. So, as we have seen in Margaret's talks, there are several ways to complete this string, Mk, using various file versions on MK. On Mk. So the simple plus to define is the one defined by the dimension. So for the dimension, F R dimension of Mk will be generated by symbols of the form X times L i if the dimension of the symbols, that is, dimension of dimension of the symbol that is dimension of x plus i is less than minus r so you have to remember that i is an element in z okay and there is also a weight filtration which is well let's say over c i think uh which is due to marker i p dou and uh And which will be more convenient for what I'm going to do, which is defined by using the Odge realization. So I'm not going into details again. And taking the weight filtration on the grotendic ring of mixed arch structure. ring of mixed arch structures mixed arch modules so in that setting the tight motif will have weight too okay so this file version is slightly more difficult to define you have to to do more work but it will be more convenient for reasons i'm going to explain i hope anyway once you have this file function you Once you have this file function, you can define the topological ring by taking the projective limits of mk divided by f r of mk. And I'm not saying which filtration I'm using, but in fact, in the rest of the talk, it will be rather the white filtration. So, this is a topological ring. The point is that, of course, The point is that, of course, when you go to this topological learning, you lose information. So, it was a nice point in Margaret's talk: you have to change the filtration you are using if you want to keep more information. It's a very acceptable point which filtration you should use. Okay, so anyway, so now with this ring, I can define what I'm doing. Which I'm going to call the motivic Tamagawa volume. And the definition of that is based upon the definition of Eulerian products, which is due to market pillou. Sorry. Market Pilou define. Define motivic early on product in MK Hat. So I'm going to cheat a little bit to explain that, but the main ideas will be there. So I take some Some scheme X over C of relative dimension D. And I assume that if I look at the symbol of X at a point, so P is in C, so I take a point P in C and I look at the symbol of the fiber, which I re-normalized. Which I re-normalized by L at the minus D. Then this is one plus some residual term. And I assume that the weight of this term is less or equal to minus three. Then the point is that more or less you can define the product over all points of the class. Of the class of X P L minus D, which will be an element M k hat. So for this, you have to take the weight filtration. So the spirit is, the point is that it's exactly like when you take the product of all primes of something which is one plus a p, this converges. This converges if, for example, you have that the absolute value of A P is less than a constant times P at the power minus three over two, which is precisely the kind of term you get if you look at local densities, right? Using various conjectures, for example. For example. So now the point. Okay. So this was the explanation of the motivic Eulerian product. And now I take a finite set. So what time is it? Oh, I should be careful. Right, so I take a set of finite, a finite set of place. So a finite. Of place, so a finite set of points in C, which is a set of bad points. And I take C naught to be the complement of that. And I'm going to use a concept which is the concept of universal tosses. So, very quickly said, these are special tossers over the variety V such that, so in fact, it is TNS torsors, where TNS is a, TNS is an algebraic group, which is isomorphic to G m at the power. G m at the power R, where R is the rank of the picker group over the algebraic closure. And in fact, the group of characters of TNS, so the morphism from TNS bar to GM bar, say, is the isomorphic to the picker group of V bar as the Galois module. Okay, so it is universal in some sense, and one of the points is that the picker group of T is trivial. And in fact, using that on some extra hypothesis, so if I take T so there are two T's, so this second T should be Second, T should be more curved than the first one. And it is over V, and it is a model of the less curved T. If you can see the difference. Okay, so this is a model over, in fact, C naught, so I should restrict to C naught. So the point is that in general, I can. Is that in general, I cannot have a nice model over the whole of C, so I have to remove a finite set of places to have a model which behaves as a torso. Anyway, doing that, the point is that if we look at the randomized class of T at P minus N minus R. minus n minus r minus one so it is less than minus three so it satisfies the condition to make a larian product all right so now with all that i can define this mysterious tamagawa number so two of v will be the sum over all t so the point is that So, the point is that there is not only one universal torsor, there may be several isomorphism classes of universal torsors. So, I have to take a sum over the universal tossers which have a rational point over capital K. And then I have several factors. I hope I did not forget one factor. In writing all that, so I'm going to give a to express it in a more simple way in a particular case afterwards. Oops, this should be the more curved one. So I take, as I said here, sorry, here I have this condition which enables me to. me to to to use the Eulerian product so I use this Eulerian product but it should be over p naught in s and I have a set of bad place so I have to do something at the set of bad place and I take the limit of V of O P over M P at the power R L at the L as a power n minus r. So I see this v over op over m p r as a k variety. And I renormalize this. I should take the class. Oops, uh the parentheses are wrong. Yep. Uh sorry about that. Um yep. Um this is the class um yeah I think it is yeah wow okay so uh did I forget something? Yes, this is well I am not going to explain this particular term, but this is the analogous of the L function associated to the Galois module Picard of Coup the Picard crop of V bar. So I should define more precisely but So, I should define more precisely, but I'm running out of time. So, and in fact, I did not intend to explain it because it's quite technical. So, anyway, so in the simpler case where in fact we are using a variety which comes from the ground field little k, then we get a simpler formula which is that 2 of v is more or less is more or less and I assume also that the picacoupo V is a picacoupofi bar so times the Jacobian of C at the power r divided by one minus L minus one at the power R times the product for P over C of one minus L minus one at the power R of V V over the residue field at P. So let's say K P over L at the power N. So you see in that case it's a formula which is much nicer and quite easy to compute in the various examples. Okay, so let me now use this complicated Tamagawa number. So the guess is that, oops, I forgot to bring up that we may have an empirical formula, which is as follows. If I consider the space of morphism. Space of morphism from C to V. And I consider the ones which are movable. So again, I should make this more precise, but let me write it like this. I re-normalized by L at the power minus omega v minus one applies to D. Then this converges to tau of V. 2 of V when the degree, which is an element in the dual of the peaker group intersected with the dual of the effective cone, is such that the distance from D to the boundary of the effective cone goes to infinity. So what is the spirit of this formula? What is the spirit of this formula? The spirit of this formula, in some sense, is to say that when you have a morphism from C to V and you have a finite subset in C, you can look at the restriction to the finite subset. So in fact, you have a contravariant factor, contravariant. Contra variant functor which goes from the category of for the inclusions of dimension zero subschemes of C which goes to varieties over K which maps well S to the morphism from to the morphism from s to v so again i have to restrict something like that so this is a space of section of s and as i said if you have a morphism from c to v well you can look at this its restriction to i'm writing on morphism Writing homomorphism, I don't know why. If you have a morphism, I'm not consistent. Sometimes I'm writing homomorphism, sometimes I'm writing morphisms. Well, anyway, I hope you can understand anyway. So if I take a map, I take simply the restriction of the map to S. And the spirit of the formula is that if you look at the space of the formula, At the space of morphisms of the Q D from C to V. Then this, in some sense, has for limit the projective limit over all finite subset of uh dimension zero sub schemes of C of the homomorphisms from S to V. From S to V. So when the degree goes to infinity, in some sense, when the degree goes to infinity, well, a morphism is given by choosing arbitrarily images of points on more than points, but the image, how the morphism respects to The morphism respect to a subscheme of dimension zero. So you can fix, in particular, arbitrarily the image of points. So yeah, that's the spirit of it. Okay, so in particular, very quickly, I guess, when I am finished, supposed to finish. Well, in principle, any minute now. Any minute now. Any minute. Two minutes ago. Okay. So in the last minus two minutes, let me say that this, in fact, implies this implies an equidistribution principle. That is, if I look, I fix a subspace in the space of morphism from S to V, where S is a is something in dimension of a subscheme of dimension zero in C. Subscheme of dimension zero in C. Then, if I consider the morphism the restriction of which is in Y, then in some sense, the quotient of this space of morphism with restriction in Y divided by the total space of morphism, the limit should be precisely Y over the total space of morphism from S to V. So this is to say that in some sense the morphism from C to V are equidistributed in motivic adapt topology. Okay, so let me to finish let me give a few results. So these are results without equidistant, but this is simply the empirical This is simply the empirical formula I gave before. So, David Burke proved that it is true for split Torreg varieties. So, for split Toric varieties, you have the formula. And in particular, so Toric VIT, let me remind you that it means equivalent compactification of algebraic. And in particular, it implies all the examples I gave at the beginning. And there is another case where And there is another case where it is proven to be true, and it was proven by almost by Margaret Biloux. It is the case of equivariant compactifications of affine spaces. So in fact, my PhD student, Lois Phezant, used the work of Margaret Bloup to state the result as I express it in this talk. Okay, and there is also a case. And there is also a case which is not available yet, but almost, which is the case of toric vibrations. So locally trivial toric vibrations. So if the result is true for the basis, and the result is true also for the fibration. Okay, and I'm not do not have time to speak about accumulating phenomena, but the point is that it is well known for the setting in the setting of. For the setting in the setting of Manin conjecture on Manin programs that there are accumulating sets. And the point is that there are similar phenomena in the motivic setting. So you can have accumulating phenomena even for the very simple Fano case, which is a cubic volume. So even for cubic volume, you have problems. Okay, let me stop there. All right, are there any questions or comments for our speaker? Okay, well, I had one actually, which is, oh, sorry, sure, did you have a? Yeah, so I'm exact. What kind of examples do we know? Like this multi-pick button? I mean, I know the Kobako Biru or Shambatura, but and Reserve, but is there any other result? So sorry, say it again. So what kind of variety do you know this like a Mozvik Manning's conjecture? Well, I gave the list here. I mean, the list is at the top. Oh, that's it? I see. Yeah, I mean, to have this precise formulation. To have this precise formulation, the formulation I give with so this formula here, to have this precise formula, well, it is not known in so many examples. I see. So there are results which are going in that direction. For example, there are several people who have looked at that, but looked at the art but this precise formulation is quite is quite fine because it's it's precisely described what the limit of this class is and this is more difficult on there for now there are not so many cases in which it is really proven but i think that uh i mean it should be interesting to to have that Up to now, for equity distribution, for equity solution, I don't think it has been written yet in any case. I see. So even like a flag varieties or those not known. Sorry? Flag varieties, like a generalized flag varieties. Well, for flag varieties, at some point with Anton Jean-Barrade, I've written something which was using the Something which was using the Kapranov works on the Eiselstein series. I see. But it does not give exactly this result. I see. I guess with working a little bit, it should be possible to write it. The point is that it gives the result about the motivic. The motivic height theta function. But this result is more precise than simply looking at the main term of the height theta function. I think. Thank you. All right. So is so there must be then some sort of simplest Sort of simplest rational surface for which this is not known. Like, is it easy to see which surface that is? Well, I guess that would be the example which was done the plane with four points grown up. Okay. Yeah. Because otherwise it's Tori comes and you know the result. If four, I mean. If for I mean I mean of course I if you take lower degrees I mean cubic surface I don't know right well it's if you can't do four you probably can't do six either yeah exactly right are there any other questions or comments i i had a quick question so in the uh classical or the the original version of the rational points distribution of rational points the leading constant i guess was originally Constant, I guess, was originally given as a product, or as the volume over the part of the Adels, which are orthogonal to the Brow group. And then it was this alternative formulation by Sauberger, who looked at interpreting the constant as a sum over the constants associated to the corresponding torses. Exactly, yes. So I was wondering, is there other sort of Brown-Mannin type interpretation make any kind of sense? So the point is that okay. Uh the point is that uh okay, I should say that uh this this was part of the cheating, but of course uh you you see it uh immediately. Uh the point is that uh if I do the thing over C, if I use a weight filtration, I am more or less obliged to go to C, then I guess that you don't have this complicated expression with several torsors and so on. Because uh the Bormann in obstruction of our C. In obstruction over C, I mean, over COT, I mean, you don't get anything. So, so, but I guess that on over other fields, you could get some kind of R money obstruction, and then you will get several universal tossers, and this stuff will go in. But right now, I don't have an example like that. I mean, the case to look at will be non-serviced. The case to look at will be non-split toric varieties over some more complicated fields. It will be interesting to try to do that. I guess that if the field is too complicated, it breaks down for some reasons. But if you look at the very simple examples I gave at the very beginning, there was almost no restriction about the field. I mean, there was no restriction about the field. It worked over any field. But again, But I guess that as soon as you can have homological obstructions and it can be, I guess you can get counter-examples of some complicated fields in general. Okay, thanks. All right. Are there any other questions for Emmanuel? If not, If not, I'll just point out that we have a bit of a break now. The next talk is at 9:30 Mountain Daylight Time, which is, I believe, a time zone that it is possible that none of us are actually in. But nevertheless, it is the standard time for this workshop. So this gives us about an hour before the next talk. There is in that time some social activity on Gather Town, so I encourage you to. Gettertown. So I encourage you to head there. And otherwise, I will see you in about an hour. Let's thank our speaker again.
