Welcome, everybody. This is the second lecture of Franklin Hollander's course on metastability. Just a reminder that the third lecture will take place on Thursday using the same link. So just as yesterday, there'll be approximately two 30-minute tabs, and in between, we'll have an opportunity to ask questions. To ask questions, you should feel free to use the chat to ask questions, answer questions. And again, Elena Poverenti is here and she'll be able to assist in answering questions in real time on the chat. A reminder that this lecture is being recorded and being live streamed on YouTube and through Burrs. And so if you do not want to be recorded, And so if you do not want to be seen or heard on the recording, you should keep your audio and video off during that period. At the end, we'll stop recording and there'll be an opportunity to ask Frank further questions. Just a reminder that the Zulip platform is there for discussions about the course and the exercises. Exercises after. There were some updated exercises and lecture slides, which I posted on Zulip this morning. And Sarai has posted the slides for today's lectures and the exercises on the chat. So you can haven't got them and want to download them, you can. Okay, Frank's second lecture on metastability will focus. On metastability, we'll focus on Kawasaki dynamics. And so, Frank, I'll turn it over to you if you share your slides. I will share my screen with you now, and I'll open my file in full screen mode. Okay, everything visible, it is okay. Okay, so welcome back, everybody. Yesterday, Aiden and I gave you a quick panorama of the area of metastability for interacting particle systems. And we started talking a bit about background, motivation, and a bit of history. And then we started to talk about mathematical setting, which involved a configuration space, a Hamiltonian, a reference measure, and these three things together built an equilibrium. Together, we build an equilibrium measure that describes the system in equilibrium. And then we supplemented that with a Markovian dynamics, again in very general terms, not specifying any details yet, that captures the non-equilibrium behavior that lies at the heart of metastability, because metastability is a non-equilibrium behavior. It's about transitions between phases. And a very key thing was a formula that links the metastasis. Was a formula that links the metastable crossover times that we're interested in to some basic tools from potential theory, predominantly harmonic functions and capacities. And I tried to explain that this is that they play a major role when you really want to compute things about metastability. And I also recalled two complementary variational principles for capacity: the Dirichlet principle. Capacity, the Dirichlet principle and the Thomson principle that turn out to be very powerful computational tools. And I was trying to explain why these tools are there and how we can use them in order to really get our hands at the key metastability quantities. But yesterday everything was sort of quite general. I didn't talk about any specific models. And it is now time to become more concrete and to see how these tools and these ideas. These tools and these ideas, and these principles can be used and can be made to work in specific settings. And that's what this lecture and the next two lectures are going to be about. So today we're going to focus on Kawasaki dynamics on lattices. And in particular, we're going to think of a large finite block in either the square lattice or the cubic lattice. And we're going to imagine particles hopping. Particles hopping on the vertices of those lattices, and they have some sort of attractive interaction that you will see later on that makes them want to glue together to form a droplet and to condense into a limit, into a liquid, sorry. And we will be addressing the question today: how do the particles actually form a droplet on their way from being On their way from being single-dilute particles representing a gas to a really filled lattice, which we think of as a liquid. And we're going to ask questions like how long does it take the particles to do so? And what are the relevant parameters in your model that correspond to the behavior of metastability? So that is what we are going to talk about today. Today. So, sorry about that. Yeah, so we're going to analyze metastable behavior for a lattice gas. And we're going to make this lattice gas evolve according to what is called Kawasaki dynamics. And I will explain this, I will define it as we go along. And in simple words, And in simple words, what we will be dealing with is particles living in a finite box. These particles can hop around between nearest neighbor sites. So that's the motion. They will feel an attractive interaction when they sit next to each other. So they like to sit next to each other. There's a kind of von der Waals attractive force. And we're going to imagine that these particles can be created and annihilated at the boundary of the box. At the boundary of the box. And we're doing that because we want to think of this box as actually living in some big gas reservoir. And so when particles enter the box from the gas reservoir, we are going to think of them as being created and when they leave as being annihilated. And we do that in order to bring the problem down to a finite problem that's nicer mathematically to deal with rather than having to be involved with this entire infinite gas reservoir. This entire infinite gas reservoir. So, one can do these things too, but that's not what we're going to talk about today. And the question will be: how does the system nucleate? So if I start from an empty box, how long is it going to take before the box is completely full? And what is the system going to do in order to make that happen? So, I've listed here five Five names of people who have been deeply involved in understanding and working on Karasaki dynamics. And En Solivieri and Elisabetta Scoppola from Rome started with this. They were the first to really look at this in detail. And then Anton Bovier and Francesca Nardi and I sort of joined later and it became a really nice adventure with lots of interesting mathematics. With lots of interesting mathematics going on. And we have been thinking and working on these problems and versions of this in the past couple of years. Now, Kawasaki dynamics is a dynamics in which particles hop around. And this means that because particles are conserved when they are inside the box, as I said, they can be created in annihilated. I said they can be created and annihilated at the boundary of the box, but inside the box they're conserved. It means that we're dealing with a conservative dynamics. And conservative dynamics typically in statistical physics are a bit harder to deal with than non-conservative dynamics. For instance, if you have easing spins flipping up and down, there's no conservation of the number of plus spins or minus spins, but for particles there is. And that usually causes some non-locality in the problem. And that non-locality is in the problem. In the problem, and that non-locality will turn out to be really interesting here. In particular, when you want to grow or shrink a droplet of these particles gluing together because of their attractive interaction, particles must arrive from the boundary to the droplet, or they must go from the droplet back to the boundary. And so, there's a non-locality which, as we will see, makes the problem challenging and interesting. The problem is challenging and interesting at the same time. In particular, we will see that when this gas is building a critical droplet, and from the first lecture you know that there is something like a critical droplet that is the threshold for nucleation, then it turns out that this droplet can have all sorts of interesting motions of particles around the border, and that will turn out. And that will turn out to lead to a shape of the critical droplet that is more complicated. And so we will have to get into issues of geometry of the critical droplet as we go along. Okay, so that is the setting that we're in. And now I come to specifying what exactly the model is that we're going to talk about. And there are four. Going to talk about, and there are four ingredients to defining Kawasaki on this finite box with what we would call an open boundary where particles can appear and disappear. So, we're going to start in two dimensions. At the end of the lecture, I will also tell you what we know when you want to do this in three dimensions. And we're going to start by imagining a large square box centered at the origin. Centered at the origin, and which we call lambda. And we're going to think of delta minus lambda as the interior boundary of this box. There is no exterior boundary of the box because that is where the gas reservoir would be, but we only think of a finite box. And this boundary is special. Now, if we want to describe a lattice gas configuration, then we have a configuration. Configuration, then we have a configuration space that in our case now would be 0, 1 to the power lambda, where 0 means the vertex is empty, and a 1 would mean the vertex is occupied by a particle. So this describes all possible arrangements of particles in your finite box lambda, and eta is a collection of. And eta is a collection of values eta x, where x runs over this box lambda. And that is our configuration space. Right, so here's a picture of such a lattice gas configuration. And here you would see that the ones indicate the location of the particles, and the zeros the vacancies or the holes. And you see that there can be only one particle at a time, so there's extremely Particle at a time, so there's exclusion. Two particles cannot sit on top of each other. And the boundary of this box, the internal boundary, is important because that's where particles can actually disappear or reappear. But once they are in the interior, they can only move around. And I'm going to specify that in a second. So, having defined our configuration space. Defined our configuration space, we need to define our Hamiltonian. So, this is a function that to every configuration associates an energy. And we're going to write down the lattice gas Hamiltonian. And the lattice gas Hamiltonian is written up here, and it consists of two terms. There is a term that captures the interaction between neighboring particles. So, if two particles Neighboring particles. So, if two particles are at vertices X and Y that are neighbors of each other, and they're both occupied, so they're both one, then they have an attractive, they have a binding energy minus U, and this energy is negative. So there is a kind of glue between particles in the sense that when they're next to each other, that then the energy of the configuration is lower. And I do this for Configuration is lower. And I do this for every pair of neighboring particles. So this is the attractive part of the Hamiltonian. And then there is a part that is coming from an activation energy. I need to give every particle in the box an activation energy. So every particle makes the energy increase by a parameter delta. And this is necessary in order to represent. In order to represent the effect of the reservoir, I imagine that I have a gas and I look in a certain window, and that would be my box that I want to look at. And the outside reservoir I have removed, and I've said I'm going to replace you by a condition that says you need some energy to bring a particle into this box. So, this delta essentially is a Essentially, it is a parameter that controls the density of particles inside my box. And so, this is a classical lattice gas Hamiltonian with an attractive interaction and an activity part, sometimes it's called chemical activity, in order to be able to control the density of particles in your box. So, there are two very important parameters in this model. Parameters in this model, u and delta, and we will play with them as we go along. They're very important. Now, we need to next talk about a dynamics. We need to say, okay, these particles are going to evolve. What are we going to allow? Well, as I already indicated before, we are going to allow particles to hop. So, a particle can hop. So, a particle can hop from one side to a neighboring site. So, that essentially means that between these two neighboring sites, a zero and a one are going to be interchanged. That respects, that captures the hopping. And there is this special role of the boundary saying that at the boundary, so in the internal boundary of my box, particles can be created or annihilated. That would mean that a zero can turn into. mean that a zero can turn into a one and a one can turn into a zero. So going back to this picture, inside the box, the ones can only move around and they can also move to the boundary. But on the boundary, there's the initial, the additional phenomenon that a zero can turn into a one and a one can turn into a zero, which we would associate with thinking that the particle has entered or left the box, mimicking the effect of a gas reservoir. Of a gas reservoir which we do not have, but we mimic it by this boundary condition. And now, having specified what possible moves are allowed at all, we have to say with what rate these moves are going to happen. And Kawasaki dynamics is nothing other than a metropolis dynamics based on the Hamiltonian function that we have defined. We have defined at an inverse temperature beta. So that means that you go from a configuration eta to eta prime when in order to do so, you respect the two allowed moves. And you do that at the rate that is e to the minus beta times the positive part of the energy that you would get after the transition and the energy that you have at the moment. So this is the standard. Moment. So, this is the standard metropolis analysis dynamics that you get once you have specified a Hamiltonian and it has an inverse temperature beta as a key parameter. And again, we may think of the outside of a box really as an infinite reservoir, which has all been replaced by a particular boundary condition. And we can think of e to the minus. We can think of e to the minus beta delta as the density of the particles inside the box. So the delta capital delta controls the density of the particles in the box. Right, so we can play with that particle as a control parameter. So for instance, you see that the moment you want to make a particle enter, that will raise your energy by raise your energy by delta and that will only happen at a rate e to the minus beta delta and that's why e to the minus beta delta is essentially the density of particles in the box okay now we're going to look at this problem in a certain regime and this regime And this regime will be a regime of low temperature, so beta goes to infinity. So it means all upward energy moves are costly and are very difficult to do. And all downward moves are for free because they occur with rate one. So climbing in energy is something that is difficult for the system, and that is typical for a low temperature description. Description. And we're going to pick our activity parameter delta in between u and 2u. And we will have to see why that is an interesting choice. And it turns out that this parameter choice, u can be any positive number you like, but as soon as the delta is between u and 2u, it turns out that you are in a metastable regime. It turns out, and we will have to see why that is true. See why that is true. That your gas is sort of super saturated, it likes to condense because if it creates a big liquid, then it will really lower its energy because delta is less than 2U. But it's also not terribly supersaturated, so that one would not have a situation where Would not have a situation where particles would come in the box very rapidly and sort of immediately condense because that would not be a metastable situation. That is certainly a physically reasonable situation, but it doesn't correspond to metastability. So we will have to see why that regime really makes sense and why that is interesting. So it's a regime where, yes, the condensation will happen. The condensation will happen, but it will be difficult for the system to do. And it turns out that there is a certain integer which we call LC, and which is the upper integer part of the quotient of U divided by 2u minus delta. That will play the role of what we will see and what we will call the critical droplet size. And I'll have a lot to explain to you where this comes from, but I wanted to. Where this comes from, but I wanted to mention it immediately here. And the fact that we pick delta between u and 2u means that this number is not 1 and it's not infinity. It's some number between 2 and infinity. So we're talking about some interesting length that is not infinity, and that's also not the length of a single particle. Okay, so we will see where that comes from. Now, there is a little non-degeneracy assumption that we have to assume. We would like this quotient not to be an integer itself, so that when you take the upper integer part, you really move a little up. And this is to in order to avoid certain degeneries and ties in the computation that. Would sort of unnecessarily complicate the computation, but wouldn't really contribute anything interesting. Okay, now I'd like to start by giving you a little bit of a feeling where this number LC comes from, and it is also going to be our first steps towards understanding what really is the threshold in this. The threshold in the system, in the model that we've been describing, that prevents these particles to just come in and nucleate immediately. And the way we're going to get our hands at that is in two different ways. One is a static computation, and one is a dynamic computation. And I want to explain both of them to you now to give you a feeling for that. To give you a feeling for that. So, what I would do is to say, suppose I would take, I would like to take an L by L droplet. So, in this picture here, it would mean an L by L square filled with ones and all the rest zeros. So, if I would ask myself what would be the energy of such a configuration, well, that would be easy. That would be easy because you say in L by L squared, there are L squared particles, each gets an activity delta. So there would be a contribution plus delta L squared to the energy of such an L by L droplet. Now, however, in that droplet, there are lots of particles sitting next to each other. And if you count how many pairs of particles sit next to each other in an L. Sit next to each other in an L by L droplet, then that's exactly 2 L times L minus 1. So those are the number of phases at which these L squared particles touch. So the gluing energy will be minus U times that number. So this is the energy of an L by L droplet of ones inside this box and the rest zero. And if I plot zero. And if I plot this as a function of L, it is a parabola that starts at zero, then goes up, reaches a maximum at the value times u divided by two u minus delta, and then goes down and actually goes down and becomes very negative because of the fact that delta is between. That delta is between you and you. And so this is sort of telling us that the hardest droplet to create is the droplet with the highest energy because the metropolis dynamics has trouble moving up. And therefore, a droplet of size u over two minus u squared should be something like a critical droplet. That should be something like the barrier. Should be something like the barrier. However, we agreed that this number would not be an integer, so LC is just the first integer on top of that. And the reason why we do that is to avoid non-degeneracy. And so the L C is just to the right here, and it's essentially telling us that every if I take an L C minus one times L minus. Minus one times L minus L C minus one droplet, it's still going to be subcritical. It will be before the tip, and an L C times L C droplet will be just beyond the tip and would therefore be called supercritical. So, by this very simple computation, just looking at some energy computations and sort of thinking that probably the lowest energy that you can get is by. Lowest energy that you can get is by forming some quadratic droplet. We will have to talk about that later. You see that this number LC plays a key role because it is the size of the square that you need to conquer in order to fill your box. Because L is equal to zero would correspond to an empty box and well, a box of very large. And well, a box, a very large box, would correspond to a very large L, and then you would have a very negative value and you would be very supercritical. So there is something about this L C that seems to be right. But this is only a static computation. I haven't done anything fancy yet. But we're on our track to beginning to understand what a critical droplet should be. Okay. Okay, well, I can sort of discover this same critical barrier also when I start to think a little bit of the dynamics. And so let me again do an argument that should convince you that this L C is a really important object by saying, let me take some kind of droplet of size L and let me try to grow. And let me try to grow on the side of this droplet a bunch, you know, a whole bar of particles. Suppose I want to I have an L by L droplet and I want to add a bar to this droplet. I want to grow it by a bar. What happens? Well, when you make a particle enter the box and your energy goes up by delta, when the particle glues itself to the boundary To the boundary of this droplet, you go down by minus u. Then you need to bring in the next particle, you go up in energy by delta. And then you glue that next to the particle that you had. So this would be a protuberance, and you add it there, and you go down by 2U, and you continue doing that. Each time you bring in a particle, you go up by delta, and each time you tuck it in the corner. Delta and each time you tuck it in the corner to the next to the previous particles that you attached on, you go down by 2u. And when you're done, you will have added a bar to your droplet. So this one is this one where I've been adding a bar. And if you look at this picture, then the highest energy is this particular droplet here, and it is an energy. And it is an energy 2 delta minus u higher than what I started out from. And if so, this is the barrier that you have to overcome when you want to grow a bar. If I read this whole story backwards and I say, well, how much do I have to go from here to there in order if I would remove this bar? Because if I remove it, all the arrows turn around. All the arrows turn around, then if you look at what is happening, then you have that energy here. So there is a cost for growing a bar of length L, and there is a cost for removing a bar of L. And lo and behold, those two will become equal exactly when L is again u over 2u minus delta. So also in the mechanism of what it costs. Of what it costs or takes to add or remove a bar, you see this thing, this number again coming back. And again, we have decided to take as a, to assume that this is not an integer, so that L C is the upper integer part, so that these things cannot never form a perfect tie in order to make things a little bit easier. So, with that, I have explained both in a Have explained both in a static and in a little bit of a dynamic way why this critical length, this critical droplet size LC is so important, because it really represents the size of a droplet that is the hardest to create, that is the barrier between having an empty box and having a full box. And my last slide for the break is. Slide for the break is this slide here, in which I'm announcing what we're going to try and do with this information. We're going to think of starting the system off with an empty box. There are no gas particles around. We think of this as a gas situation. It's very, very dilute. Then you will see that particles start to come in. A particle comes in alone. A particle comes in alone, probably it leaves the box before anything else happens. And if I wait for a very long time, I will see: oops, there are two particles in the box. Maybe they go and sit next to each other, maybe they dissociate again and leave the box. And if you wait long enough, it will happen sooner or later that you create a critical droplet. And once you have done that, you will see that. You will see that the system energetically goes over the hill, and that this critical droplet will grow and grow and grow, and eventually will fill all of the box. And when all of the box is filled, we say, bingo, nucleation has happened, and I have a liquid. So that is the kind of thing that we're trying to do. And I will have to go after the short break into details about what About what exactly this critical droplet is. And there will be things going on that we call protocritical droplets, so droplets that are almost critical. There will be canonical versions of those, non-canonical versions of those. There will be motion of border of particles around the border of the droplet. And I will have to go deeper into the geometry of this critical droplet. We know that it is something like an L. That it is something like an LC by LC particle, but well, roughly, and I will have to explain that. And then, when you go over the hill, you have your nucleation. And we will have to come to grips with what exactly this critical droplet is. And there's a story to tell. And how long does it take for the system to create this critical droplet? Because that will be the most difficult thing. Be the most difficult thing to do, and the time it takes to create that critical droplet will really be the nucleation time, and a few more properties around that. So, that's what I'm going to zoom in then after the break. So, let's have a small break. Okay, Frank, there's one question from Jens asking for confirmation of his understanding of Of these particles visiting all these prototypical states. He asks, he says, well, if LC is not an integer, we never quite reach a stable state unless we keep changing along the boundary. Is that L C is an integer? No, L C is an integer. So it means that an L C. I think he meant U minus, you know, the fact that you had to move slightly away from. You had to move slightly away from that critical energy. Yeah, I did that in order to avoid ties. It's like it's some kind of arithmetic non-degeneracy that you want to do. And I will go much more deeper into what is this, a protocritical droplet, and what does it look like, and what is this motion along the border. Exactly. And okay. Yeah. Yeah. There's a question from Tommaso. He's asking about the density of particles within lambdas kept fixed. Is then the case that when a particle is created automatically, one is erasing along the boundary? No, I do allow particles to enter, and that doesn't mean that another particle has to go away. When I said the dense. Go away. When I said the density is e to the minus beta delta, it means the average. So it means if I look at a vertex, then the probability that there will be a particle there will be in equilibrium e to the minus beta delta. But I'm starting from a non-empty box. This box has to fill up nucleate and then it's completely full. But in But in you know, this e to the minus delta is basically the density of the reservoir that I imagine around myself. If I would have a reservoir of density e to the minus beta delta, it would shoot particles into the box in a way that is very similar to what my boundary is now doing. I'm living on a finite box, there is no outside will because it's much nicer to Side will because it's much nicer to work on a finite box. But the effect of this delta is as if I would have a density reservoir that has that density e to the minus beta delta. Okay? Okay, I think maybe that there are more questions, but I suggest we take an honest to God three, four minute break, and then we'll come back and deal with the questions that are here, if that's okay. Okay, very good.   Okay, so there's um several questions here. So okay. Questions here. So, in no particular order, Francesco is asking: if you have more than one species of particle, could metastability caused be caused from repulsion between the different states, different species? Interesting question. It is possible to deal with more than one particle. I had a PhD student, Alessio Troiani, who looked at that case, sort of black and white particles, and depending on the And depending on the, then there's a U1 and a U2, and there could be a Delta I and a Delta two, and the possibilities become very rich. You can have things like checkerboards and various things. So, yes, we can do that, but it also becomes geometrically much, much harder. And you can allow repulsion and Repulsion and attraction, but you have to have enough attraction so that the system really wants to nucleate. Otherwise, you're not in a metastable regime. See, Roman had a question about the sort of separation of the energy increase when a particle enters the box and the decrease when it attaches. He says, I have difficulty with the delta in the computation because if the particles are already there, I don't need to grow the energy by delta. Well, just glue it. Delta. Well, yeah, well, you pay the delta when you get in. And then one, the particle moves towards from the boundary to this box, nothing happens. So when I say this, it means it really enters at the boundary. And then any of the traveling towards a box, it doesn't do anything. I haven't indicated here. It's a good question. And then you go down only by you when you really attach it. You really attach it, and you need to do that if you want to grow a boundary. So, I'm not looking at what here in this picture at what the particle is doing when it's already in the box and travels to the boundary of this thing. I'm only looking at the moments when something really happens in the energy landscape. And Mark Holmes, by the way, can people unmute themselves, Sarah? Because if they want to ask directly, then Mark is asking about the growing and shrinking squares, and he's asking about a shape theorem for a square underline. We will see that because we're in a low temperature setting, droplets always want to be as close as possible to a quasi-square. And this comes from a discrete isoperometric inequality. Isoparametric inequality. Discrete isoparametric inequalities are not easy. They're actually harder than the usual continuous ones that we know about a sphere with maximal volume and minimal surface and stuff like that. But this plays an important role, and especially when the temperature is very low, it's very hard to climb in energy. And the system tries to do this in the easiest way possible. Way possible. And that's why this dynamics has a tendency of wanting to grow droplets in the form of squares, quasi-squares, where you are adding a bar and adding another bar, because otherwise it's energetically too costly. But that's a key point in the later analysis. So you may have indirectly just dealt with this. Shenji Yang was asking why square. Was asking why square, why not rectangle? Because they look like they're locally minima, too. Yeah, they are locally minima, but globally not. It's much better if you have a very elongated square, if you would sort of break it off and put it into a more square-like, you get a lower energy because you have much more, you don't change the number of particles, but you benefit more from the gluing. But these are delicate. But these are delicate issues. It's not immediately obvious, and it's hidden in the isoparametric inequalities. Okay? Yeah, Roman had a follow-up. I should have picked this up earlier. He was saying, in his view, you may have a lot of particles already in the box. It's not sort of one at a time. Yes, it's very hard to create them because every particle that you bring in the box makes the energy go up. But, yeah, and in principle, you could say, well, I have three or four particles floating around independently. One of the things that you will have to show is that the system doesn't want to do that. It doesn't want to create six droplets. It's so hard to create droplets that the easiest thing it can do is create one droplet and grow this layer by layer. And that's what is actually happening. Okay, so shall I move on? Maybe. We didn't deal with everything. I'm going to try to answer some of these privately. Okay. Okay. Okay, but there's also time after the second part. I'll be happy to continue that. Okay. So we now need to go a bit more into detail about what this critical droplet is, because that will be crucial for the fine analysis that I'm about to present to you. That I'm about to present to you. And we already know that somehow this critical droplet is a bit like it's somewhere in between an L C by L C droplet and an L C minus one by L C minus one droplet. So what exactly is it? And this turns out to be an interesting thing. So we're thinking about two configurations, the empty box and the full box. And the full box, and they represent for us the gas where there's nothing, and the liquid where everything is filled. And the Maito-Bush stable regime is such that it's hard to go from the empty to the full box, but the full box is really the lowest in energy, as we already saw from this parabola computation. And we're asking ourselves. And we're asking ourselves: what is the settle point between these two configurations? What is the lowest set of configurations that with your allowed moves you have to move through in order to go from empty to full? And I'm going to give a description. The description requires a bit of attention because there's something interesting happening here with Kabbalah Sarchi dynamics that has to do with motion. That has to do with the motion of particles around the border of the droplet. And this is an interesting thing, and it also provides us with a level of richness and mathematical challenge that is nice. I'm first going to talk about basic protocritical droplets. Protocritical means I'm almost critical, I'm still waiting for one particle to arrive from the boundary of the box, and I'm over the hill. And there are certain nice protocritical. And there are certain nice protocritical droplets. One is an L C minus one times L C quasi square with a single protuberance attached to the longest side. And there's also a version where this protuberance is attached to one of the shortest sides. So either the side of length L C or the side of length L C minus one. And here's a picture of an example of a simple protocritical droplet, which Simple protocritical droplet, which we call canonical protocol critical droplet. And this shape is one of the shapes that is lying on the boundary between this empty, on the saddle point between the empty and the full set. And one of the exercises that Elena and I have prepared is for you to do that computation and argue. computation and and argue that this is a droplet that for its volume has its has its smallest has the smallest lowest energy given the volume that it is given here. I mean if I want to fill my box all particle numbers will sooner or later have I have to go through. I have to have one, two, three, four particles until I have filled my box. So I'm looking for shapes. So, I'm looking for shapes that for a given particle numbers have a lowest energy, and there are discrete isoparametric inequalities, not difficult in two dimensions, but non-trivial in two dimensions, that will tell you that this is one of the shapes that has the lowest energy given its volume. Now, what happens is that before the next particle comes in, Before the next particle comes in, it's possible to have motion of particles around the border of this droplet. This particle can start to move around, but it turns out that when this particle is close to the boundary here, the corner, it may allow other particles to sort of land on top of it. And it's possible that this protuberance facilitates the motion of particles on top to move around the corner to the Around the corner to the other side. And this is an interesting phenomenon. When you first see this, you say, It's not possible. But actually, there are some pictures in the exercises that show you that this is possible. So it's possible that particles start to move around the boundary of the box. And what happens is that since delta is larger than U, all paths that are such that you never exceed Such that you never exceed your current configuration in energy by more than U will happen and will easily happen before your next particle comes from the boundary of the box. So this droplet starts to wobble around through motion of particles around the border even before the next particle comes in and tries to attach to itself. And in fact, what What happens is that this set D has a certain structure. I will talk about it in a second. And then once, so all these protocritical droplets play a role. And then at some point, there's another free particle coming in and saying, yeah, here I am. I go to the protocritical droplet and I attach myself. Curtical droplet, and I attach myself and I begin an applause because I say to everybody, We have now gone over the hill, all of us together. And that is what is happening. And this set of protocritical droplets has a certain dumbbell shape. There are the simple ones that are quasi-squares of size-length LC minus one times L C plus a protuberance. And then there's a whole bunch of things. A whole bunch of things that you can obtain by sliding particles around the boundary of the droplet, and there is a set that one can describe, and it's not easy. And I decided not to go into details here. And this is done in an exercise so that you can get a feeling for this interesting phenomenon of motion of particles around the boundary of the droplet, which is possible because you can move, you can. You can make moves of cost U before the next particle comes into the story. Okay, so there's a rich structure which we have under control. And so at this moment, we are done with really understanding the geometry behind our problem. There is an empty set, it has a certain, it has Certain, it has zero energy. And then there is the full set where the box is entirely full that would correspond to my liquid. And I've argued that for very large beta, which is the regime that we're looking at, very low temperature, the barrier between these two is really given by a whole family of critical droplets that are all lying on the saddle point. On the settle point between these two. And so here again, you see this paradigm picture where already when I showed this for the first time, I said, you know, this is very naive. These things have a structure. And indeed, the critical droplets here, they have a structure. It's a whole set of droplets that you can describe geometrically. And this is the barrier that the dynamics has to go over. So we have to ask ourselves how cost. To ask ourselves, how costly is it to go up this amount of energy in order to go over the hill? And that is what we're going to state now in a theorem. And this here comes the main theorem for this particular model. And it is built on the tools that I've been describing: this Dirichley-Thompson principle and test functions and test flows. Test flows and isoperometric inequalities and various stuff. And it says after all the smoke has cleared up, the average time that it takes you to go from an empty box to a full box. So this is what I would call the average nucleation time, is of a very simple form, apart from a prefactor that is tending to one. You know, tending to one, there is a constant here, and there's an e to the beta times another constant. And this constant here, this gamma, is exactly the depth of the hill that you need to climb out of when you come from empty to full. So it's exactly the high difference between this one and that one. That is what gamma is. And that is a computation. And that is a computation that you can easily perform. This energy is zero. This is the energy of the protocritical droplet plus the free particle that comes around with a flag and say, I'm here, I'm here, I'm helping you over the hill. And you can do a straight computation using the lattice-gas Hamiltonian, and you find this number exactly in terms of your parameter LC. So, this number is completely explicitly calculated. Is completely explicitly calculable. And it is the solution of an isoperometric inequality. It's a minimizer consisting of the whole class of these protocritical droplets, which have a rich structure. And then there is a pre-factor for which you can write down a variational principle coming from the Dirichlet and the Thompson principle. And this factor is for finite. Is for finite lambda not so easy. It is some complicated number. However, if the box is very large, this number simplifies and it is scales like log lambda, the log times the volume divided by lambda. And if you multiply it with this factor, it will converge to a limit. So for a very large box, I know what this pre-factor is. And this number 1 over NLC. 1 over N L C, N L C is given by this number here, and this is exactly counting the number of protocritical droplets that we have been talking about. And that is very reasonable because each of these protocritical droplets could be your gate to go from empty to full. And if I have twice as many gates to go through, Gates to go through, my average crossing time should go down by a factor or two. So the fact that this prefactor picks up something like one minus the cardinality of the number of gates that I have available is very logical. And if you go deeper into the geometry, this turns out to be given by a certain sum that is explicit here. And there is a scaling factor. And there is a scaling factor that depends on the volume of the box, and this has something to do with capacities of simple random walk having to travel from the boundary to, you know, in the neighborhood of a critical droplet. And that has a very nice scaling. And you see that since the critical droplet can appear more or less anywhere in the box, there's a proportionality factor one over lambda. Proportionality factor one over lambda, if I would bring it to the right. So there is a multiplicity here that you take into account. And the logarithm has something to do with the fact that two dimensions is a critical dimension for random walks. So the story here is: yes, we've been successful. We have a very precise description, including an energy barrier and something that has to do. Barrier and something that has to do with geometry of critical droplets and counting and stuff like that. And so it's a happy ending with a very sharp result that is as precise as you may wish at this point. So that's a good story, and there is the geometry of the critical droplet coming from isoparametric inequality. What is the given certain volume? the given a certain volume the the the the the the droplet with the the the you know the lowest energy and what if i want to climb from empty to full what is the the lowest threshold well there are many of them and we have captured them in a computation that goes into the deep geometry of the problem some of which is explained in the exercises so this pre-factor is usually not easy but we have a good Not easy, but we have a good thing here that is the if the box is very large, we have a very good description of this pre-factor. So, nucleation in a large box is now really well understood into a lot of quantitative detail. So, I'd like to have a few more slides. Have a few more slides in which I'm going to tell you something about what happens when you try to do this in three dimensions. So suppose you would say, well, I would like you to take a large cubic box in Z3. And again, same story, inner boundary of the box, particles can be created and annihilated. Once they walk in the interior of the box, they need to be preserved. Box they need to be preserved. There's an activation energy delta, there's an interaction energy between neighboring particles of size of strength minus u, a binding energy. So I'm not changing the model. I'm not changing the dynamics. The only thing that I change is that I'm now living on a cubic box rather than a square box. And the question is very legitimate to say: could you deal with that too? Could you deal with that too? What is going to happen? And it turns out that, yes, you can deal with that too, and we will pretty much find the same result. There are, however, a few things that become a little bit more complicated in three dimensions, which I want to quickly point out. Two, in particular, it turns out that there are two lengths that start to Lengths that start to play a role. One is u over 3u minus delta, and the other is 2u over 3u minus delta. Remember that the critical length that we had in two dimensions was u over 2u minus delta, upper integer part, but it's now two things that start to become interesting. And I don't want to go in too much detail here, but I do want to. Detail here, but I do want to show you some of the richness that is here, but this is becoming a bit more complicated now. We will have, again, protocritical droplets. We will need now to solve an isoperometric inequality, a discrete isoperometric inequalities in dimensions three, which is really difficult. There's a beautiful paper by Alonso and Serf in the late 90s solving some of these issues, and it's really. Some of these issues, and it's really combinatorically beautiful and challenging to do that. And in three dimensions, that is not easy. And it turns out that if I take the analog of the critical droplet size in three dimensions, that would be called an MC. That again, something like an MC by MC by MC cube is roughly the critical droplet, but it's a bit more. Roughly the critical droplet, but it's a bit more complicated. It can happen that on this cube, you actually attach a two-dimensional critical droplet on one of the faces. And then on one of the faces of that, you can stick a protuberance. I'm going to show you a lovely picture that Francesca Nardi made a number of years ago. And so it turns out that there are actually two times two length scales playing a role, a two-dimensional length scale. A two-dimensional length scale and a three-dimensional length scale. The three-dimensional length scale describes the size roughly of your cube, and the two-dimensional length scale describe what a two-dimensional critical droplet attached to one of the spaces should come. And there are certain delicate things about some parameter that could be either zero or one, depending on some arithmetic properties of these numbers, whether they're compatible. Of these numbers, whether they're compatible or not. I don't want to go into the detail, but I wanted to show this to you to see that there is a richness coming up, and at the same time, this can be dealt with. You can pin it down after a lot of thinking. So, let me first show this picture. So, this is what a critical droplet would look like. It's a quasi-cube or that. That and then on top of that, there is a critical droplet that, as we saw it in two dimensions, attached to it. And then here is this guy that comes from the boundary and wears a flag and says, I'm about to arrive, and we're all going to go over the hill by the time this particle tucks itself into the corner here, because then this thing will be so stable that the rest of the particles will rain on top of it. Rain on top of it. So you see here a three and a do two-dimensional structure in this thing, and this is all captured in the description of a whole bunch, you know, a rich set of protocritical droplets. And again, the energy barrier that this object represents is computable. It's not so simple anymore as before, and there are all these two lengths around. I don't expect you. Around. I don't expect you to be able to grasp this during this lecture. But the message is you can do it. And there is a lot of richness. And there is now two scales, a three-dimensional critical length and a two-dimensional playing a role. So, and here's a beautiful picture of one of those critical droplets that would represent the barrier between the nucleation. The barrier between the nucleation for the nucleation problem in dimension three. So I'm going to finish now. I'm almost done. Again, we will have a result of a very similar nature as we have in one dimension. The average nucleation time to go from empty to full, to go from a gas to a liquid, is apart from a negligible. A negligible prefactor, again of the shape a constant times e to the minus beta gamma. This is the barrier that you have to overcome. We wrote down a formula for this here. It's more complicated in three dimensions than in two dimensions, but it's all explicit and computable. And there is a prefector that again is the solution of a variational formula, and this comes out of, again, applying capacity estimates. Applying capacity estimates and Dirichlet principles and Thomson principle. And it turns out that by the sheer complexity of discrete isoparametric inequalities in dimension three or higher, it is not possible to really write down a simple formula for this object, not even when the box is getting very big. We know that it's going to grow like one over the volume, but The volume, but we only have bounds on this number. There's something intrinsically complicated in this prefecture, even though we can write down variational formulas for it. Right, so that concludes my story here. The take-home message is: yes, for Kawasaki dynamics, in two and three dimensions, you can make things work, you can build the general theory. You can build the general theory, you in the end end up getting a very sharp estimate about the mean transition times. It comes through computations that involve capacities, some of which you will see in the exercises. And there's a happy ending to the story in the sense that you can all make it work, and there's a beautiful theory behind it. Theory behind it. There's a geometric richness deeply linked to two-dimensional and three-dimensional discrete isoperometric problems that you have to solve. And that is mathematically nice, and this manifests itself into all the parameters, this gamma and this pre-factor kappa, in order to describe it. So it's really for. So it's really for Kawasaki dynamics the sharpest result that has been around, the sharpest result that is around, and nothing has been improved since that yet. So it's a very successful computation based on nice mathematics and nice behavior. So thank you very much. So Sarah will now unmute. Sarah will now unmute us so we can thank Frank for a terrific lecture, extremely clear, and beautiful results. Thanks, Frank.
