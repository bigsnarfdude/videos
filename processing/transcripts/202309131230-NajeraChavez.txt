So, here about the project actually, it's a follow-up, just providing more details about a short talk given by Carolina Melo yesterday in the Gong show. So, okay. The idea is also to motivate these new objects that I believe should be studied from the perspective of tilting theory. So, I will start with QA, a quiver, finite quiver. Finite quiver without loops nor two cycles so that I have I say to this a cluster algebra and not only a cluster algebra have a cluster ensemble so associate a cluster in symbol So, what's this? It's a pair of cluster varieties that are actually mirror to each other, mirror-dual from the perspective of the Grossiebert mirror symmetry program. So what's the rough description of these varieties and this map? So, as yesterday, we have to start with the Alatis N, which A lattice N, which is just free of rank R and to do a lattice. Right, and to this lattice I consider the algebraic torrent associated to them. So the A variety, it's just a very well-known object. It's a union of copies of tori n, where s is a seed mutation equivalent to the, say, initial seed defined by q and glued by some sort of mutation. And x, it's just, we want to think as the dual, so it's obtained by bluing dual toroid, blue by dual. A flu by dual mutation. So I will not explain what's a dual mutation. This is okay, like exchange relations, usual exchange relations. So this seed, it's actually good to think that it gives right to many things, gives rise to a basis. So every seed gives rise to a basis. Of the lattice N and the dual basis of the dual lattice M. And it also gives right to a quiver and an exchange matrix. So, this map here, it's actually on some sort of cluster map. So, it maps cluster tori to cluster tori. So, the restriction of P to A S is, well, first of all, it maps AS to X S, and it's a map between tori is a monomial map. So it's determined by its pullback. So from the co-character lattice of this guy to this guy, the co-character is N. So it's just a lattice map from N to M. But actually, if I think these lattices end up with their bases. their basis and I denote this with a sub-index F S this in this basis is just given by represented by a matrix and it's just the matrix associated to the state okay I'm sorry T N S T M F yes exactly thank you so much okay So much, okay. So, um, so okay, if b it's just a union of totalized L, S, so if this is A, this is an N, and this is S, X, this is an M, then to every seat S, Gross Hakin Kilan Konsevich construct for every seed. Every seed is a scattering diagram for this variety, right? So this is just living in the real vector space associated to the dual attes. Okay, we call this L R. Okay, and this is just, we've seen examples of this. For example, in David's talk, it's In David Stock, it's just a union of codimension one cones in this vector space. And inside here, there's actually something called the Fogenshoff cluster complex. Big cluster complex. Big cluster complex. And this is actually a rational polyhedral fan. Right? So, of course, like if we're in the let's say our quiver is the chronicle quiver, we will have like the complete set of rays. And here we will just remove the limiting ray. Okay. So what's the point of considering this guy? It's that, well, or this guy. That, well, or these gadgets, this is used to construct set of functions on V. And this guy, the cluster complex, codifies global monomials. So, what's a global monomial? I would just say it, not write it, are those set of functions that actually restrict to a character of some tori in the atlas. So, a global monomial, just if my variety is an A variety, this is just a cluster monomial. Yeah, so in the X side, this this This fan codifies what would be the cluster monomials for X varieties. So, already Carolina gave some remarks yesterday that these are like if V is A, then, well, let's say it's a G fan. And here the maximal cones, let's say the rays are G vectors. Are g vectors of a cluster variables. And let's say an i simplex, an i phase would be, my notation would be G S prime i. So this would be cone generated by a collection of Of I compatible or G vectors of I compatible cluster variables. Okay, then this is defined associated to Q through the theory of cluster algebra, not the KQ thing. If we have cycles, we need a potential, of course, if we want to do tilting theory or anything, or tilting theory. So the first theorem that was yesterday in a blackboard. In a blackboard and myself, it's that first of all, every column of this cluster complex is of the form B S minus one G I S prime for some I and some S, right? So, the key point here is like, okay, these guys were introduced by Groshak and Kilkonsevich, and they were not introduced in this form. So, this is like an equivalent way to describe them. And here we actually have to use some geometry to have this. So, for those who know, maybe this comment is that here we use that the X variety is a quotient of the A variety with principal coefficients by X. A variety with principal coefficients by the action of front-origer, and that the A variety lives inside the X variety with principal coefficients. So, this is like these two ingredients and some tropical geometry gives this description. So, there's some content in that statement. And the second is like, okay, we have cones, right? So we can either describe them by inequalities or by the array generators. So the inequalities are easy to get. Let's say the inverse image of a maximal cone. So if I put an R here, G R S prime, so this is a maximal cone because I attained the rank is defined Is defined by the system of inequalities. So I have to take the C matrix associated to S prime. I have to transpose it. I have to multiply by the matrix I'm working. And let's say coordinates N1 and to NR. These are coordinates of my lattice N, and I want. units of my life is n, and I want this to be greater or equal to zero. Okay, so this is a system of inequalities. And okay, and third, we also have a formula for the rank for the dimension of every cone. So if B it's an isomorphism, well, this is just an unimodular equivalence between two fans. So the dimension of cones will not be affected. But in case I have kernel, which is the most interesting case, the dimension of the cones. In case the dimensions of the cones can go down, so we have a formula in terms of relations among subject vectors, computing the dimensions, the dimension of a cone, say BS minus one of some given G cone. G con. Okay, so I don't have time to put the formula or to explain it, but we will see how relations among g vectors come into the description of, say, the normal vectors of these guys. Okay, so this can be thought of as a first description of the cluster complex in terms of C vectors. Here, I have to say that this guy is the C matrix. the C matrix I'm gonna put it CT R S prime C matrix associate that to S prime okay so now I'm interested in describing the race not only the the inequalities and in order to do this well at first instance we have to put some assumptions and we were able to do it or to have some progress for Able to do it or to have some progress for acyclic queries. So let me explain this. But before, let me just give an example. Yeah. And of course, it's going to be an A3 example because already you see something hopefully new. So if my quiver is just one, two, three, then the matrix associated to this quiver, to the initial seat, say it's just zero, one, minus one, zero, minus one, one, zero, zero. So the kernel. So the kernel is spanned by one, zero, minus one. So every cone is going to be have the inverse image of zero. So every cone is going to have this ray. Okay. So it's going to be a cone with a linearity space. So let me just write this cone with respect to the seed module of the kernel of the map BS. The map B S zero. Okay. And this looks like follows. It looks like this. This lives in N, which is the lattice of C vectors. So this is spanned by the class of the vector 1, 1. This has actually two C vectors, 1, 1, 0. That is the same of the class 1011. This is spanned by the class 1, 0. This is spanned by the class minus 1, 0, 0. minus one zero zero uh zero zero minus one this is spanned by the by this and this is spanned by one zero zero but it's the same to the class of the c vectors okay so this is the kind of funds that i would suggest to try to understand them from from the perspective of self things already okay in a second um there's also something that we can say here we have six um um six maximal cones and this Six maximal cones, and these are in bijective correspondence with the bipartite seats, so there's some nice combinatoric there. So, now let me go to my second aim to describe race of this cluster complex. Okay, so from now on, I will suppose three cyclic. So, this is just like a temporary assumption that we are expecting to drop in the follow-up. So, just like to so what's the key point here? So, this matrix has its components, some integer vectors that are either non-negative or non-positive. And those are the C vectors. So, there's a theorem by Nagao. By Nagao and myself from 2011 or 12, maybe, this and this maybe 11. It's that the so always Q basically. So the set of C vectors for Q, it's in bijection with the dimension vectors X, where X is with either a model of a ship. Which either a model or a shift of a model. So it's just in the derived category concentrating in degree zero or well into degrees, Q such that X is rigid and indecomposable. So we're going to use this description to hope to give the ray generators in terms of dimension vectors. Okay, so suppose Ci is a dimension vector of some X, okay? So some object in the dark category, some style complex contained in concentrated in degree zero, degree minus one, which is corresponding. Degree minus one, which is corresponds to a rigid model, in the compostable rigid model. So in this case, let me call hx to be this plane. This is a plane, would be the all the vectors in n that satisfy the equality b c b s times n equals zero. Okay, so this is just the equation of one of the hyperplanes defining this cone. Of the hyperplanes defining this cone, and the second theorem, Melo and Nahel Chavez, myself, it's that, well, the vector g xp, I will write and then I will explain plus g tau inverse xp is. Uh is normal to H X. Okay, so here I'm using G vectors in the category K B Rush KQ, but X is an object of the direct category, so I'm just identifying this systematically. And P it's just the filting complex corresponding to the algebra itself. Okay, and since I'm in the order. And since I'm in the hereditary case, this actually has a nice description that it's the sum over i equals to 1 to m of the g vector of the object xi with respect to p, where these are the modules or the complexes sitting in the middle of this mesh. Okay, so some of the Okay, so it's a machine-the derived category. And well, now let me just give an example of how this theorem helps to address the aim I'm I put there. Let me just put it here. So, theorem two helps to describe To describe race of this in some cases. So let me give an A4 example. Okay, so let's suppose I'm in type A4. And so the derived category looks like this is, let's draw some slice in the derived category. And let's suppose my X is something like here. This is Y. This is y, and let's say this is x1, and this is x2. Yeah, so the description I have there by using tropical duality gives me the following implication that the VQ applied to the dimension vector of X minus the dimension vector of Y is equal to the dimension vector of The dimension vector of I'm sorry, the G vector of X1 with respect to P. Okay, so this alternating sum of dimension vectors is actually hitting array in the G-fan. So its inverse image is going to be array of a cone. So this implies that dim x minus dim y generates its array of Of okay, so maybe you can just see how every such ray can give in this example at least be given as a difference of two dimension vectors of some objects. So then there's some beautiful combinatorics that arise because if my curves start to look funny, then the alternating sums start to look more nicer. And in general, well, I start hitting rays. I can hit some rays through this. Some rays through this process, like essentially by looking at some relations in the AR quiver. And let me just finish the talk by giving some differences between the cluster complex, the usual things you might have heard about, and these new guys. First of all, these guys do not depend. Uh on frozen vertices or frozen vertices and this these guys do depend on frozen because when you add more things you might kill the kernel for example okay so this is a huge difference between a cluster complexes and a cluster complexes another one is that this is always simplicial in the sense that the cons are generated by a base That the cones are generated by a basis of the dual of the lattice, and here we have linearity space and have linear space. So they are not simplicial. And here, something that's interesting is that this can be described from my point of view using only G vectors in the cluster category associated to Q, but here you need actually G vectors. On the K minus one zero of Proch KQ. So it's more related to filting theory than to cluster tilting theory, maybe. And something that's very interesting to me is that in the finite case, all these complexes turn to be unobstructed, are unobstructed. And this can have obstructions. So, I'm mentioning this because already the formation theory was mentioned throughout the talk. And let me just finish in my last two minutes, like some future research. And one of those is related to the deformation theory. The G vector of Xi. So it's the G vector of these guys. So no multiplicity, it's just of the objects. I'm sorry, that's the notation I'm using. So future. Let me just point like three main venues, like provide. Provide explicit or combinatorial formula formula for X cluster monomials. Second, there's a recent paper by Lara Bossinger about tropical totally positive cluster varieties. And well, she built some fans and they seem to be quite related to this. Seem to be quite related to this. Let's relate with Posinger's tropical totally positive cluster varieties. And the third one is related to one of my previous work with the Paulitrefinger and Nathan Newton, in which we Nathan-Newton, in which we use the formation theory of finite cluster complexes to obtain descriptions of universal cluster algebras via Hilbert schemes, multiplayed Hilbert schemes. So here we would like to introduce the X cluster variety with universal coefficients. It's also related to some previous work with Dara Bossinger, Boscofrias Medina and Timothy McGee, which we find the right notion of principal coefficients for X varieties. So now I'm interested in trying to address the universal coefficients. I'm going to stop here. Are we ready? It's just really philosophical, but so in your main theorem, you have the description of the cones by sort of c times b times n is positive. So. So this is part two of the theorem, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, well, it's not positive, it's like greater than or equal to zero. Sorry, almost positive. So somehow you're taking, I think if I've got the categorical picture right, you're looking at sort of virtual dimension vectors for one heart and Euler pairing them with the symbols from another heart and asking for that to be a positive number or non-negative number. Why is that a reasonable thing to do? Why is that a reasonable thing to do? Um, okay, it's um it just comes from tropical validity. So you would like to solve the equation p star of n lies in a g cone. So you would like to this to be a sum of positive integers alpha i s prime g i. s prime g i s prime for some um for some s prime and some alpha i s biger or equal to zero so this can be put in terms of an alpha vector times a g matrix then you use tropical duality to put the g matrix in the other side so that's fully in cluster theory there's no like representation theory reason why yeah i mean it's tropical duality which also has a meaning in representation Which also has a meaning in representation theory. So, so I mean, it's a, yeah, yeah. And then, yeah, you're solving alpha equals to zero. Yeah, sure. Yeah, so maybe I have a question, which is when you write B inverse of that G con, it looks a bit as if you were looking for that the race would be generated by like a. Generated by would be the vertices of the Newton polytope of some of the Newton polytope of the Calde-Bosch-Appoton function of some representation. Why the Newton polytope? I mean, because it would be the exponents, because the exponents of the Calderosha potential B E plus G, it looks like you are looking for B of minus E plus G. Okay. Plus G. Okay. But anyway, that's somehow the question. Is it somehow like what you are looking for? No, I didn't frame it in those ways. It's just like really everything comes from solving this equation and then just do some easy linear algebra. So I mean, if G, if you have a complete fan, this equation always has a solution because this point just lies in some chamber. So it has to be a positive combination of some G thing and you start from there. Do you think and just start on from there? And maybe, I mean, in term one one, like the key thing is like, like, like, like describing. So, actually, no, I don't think at all about Calder-Shapoton functions. I actually think like about the parametrization of set of functions by tropical points of the dual cluster variety. So, then this map actually, so this map that I'm putting here actually is it's like it factors. like it factors like this should be thought of as like the a cluster variety mean tropicalization it embeds into the x cluster variety uh max a mean tropicalization print then i have a sign change and this goes to x print with the max tropicalization here's where the g vectors live uh and uh yeah so um yeah so it's Yeah, so it's related to it comes from this map actually. So, so g-vectors live here, yeah, and it just comes from tropicalizing some maps related to the geometric picture of I described before. Any other question? Maybe just also like I was wondering, like, like where was the Poisson part? The Poisson part? I don't know. Sleeping? No, sleeping. I don't play a role at all. It's just like it's not the A varieties, it's the other varieties. Yeah, I'm just going to say that this is X C and this goes here like a fiber. So that's why. Okay, okay. So if there are no more questions and there seem not to be questions from the Zoom audience, let's thank Alfredo again.
