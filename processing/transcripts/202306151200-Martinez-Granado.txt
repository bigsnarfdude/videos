Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much for the invitation. It is a pleasure to be giving a talk to Misha. In this talk, I will be presenting some of the work that Misha and I did together during my stay as a postdoc at these settings, where Misha was. Where Misha was my postdoc mentor. And before I start with the last story, I would love to say a few words about Misha. It has been a great privilege for me to have gotten to meet you and interact with you regularly for these past three years. I just wanted to say that Misha is a great person to talk math with, as many of you know. He's engaging with the past and a deep grasp of many different With a vast and a deep grasp of many different subjects and psychotic knowledge of the right references, etc. But this is not the aspect I would like to emphasize. What makes him truly special is that he's a warm, thoughtful, and supportive person. He's an attentive and reliable colleague and friend. He's very generous with his time. We would spend many hours talking not every Sunday, every Sunday morning. Happy Sunday morning. And Misha, I wish you the very best. Thank you. So, let me start now with the math story. So, this talk is going to be about geodesic currents and the property, or I guess, two properties, but in particular, this kind of like combo with a name here, bounded back tracking property. Combo with a name here, violent back tracking property, which is a property of an action of a group on an R tree, or more generally, on some typically group therapic space. So let me start focusing on the case of a closed surface where the group in question is going to be a surface group. So an object you can study on a surface is a measured lamination. Is a measured lamination, which you can think of as a measure on supported on arcs that are transverse to a given lamination. So for example, here's a lamination of the surface S, and here's a transverse arc to it. For every transverse arc to this lamination, you have a measure, let's say lambda, that is giving. That is giving some mass to subsets A of this arc alpha. You can also think of this in the universal cover by lifting everything and you're going to get the variant picture and the dimension of the dead group. So, what distinguishes this man? What distinguishes these measures and transverse arcs is that these transverse arcs give are transverse to some collection of simple, simple geodesics, some line. And of course, an example of such an object could just be a simple multi-curve. So a collection of a disjoint, a union of disjoint simple curves, perhaps weighted. But generically, that's not. But generically, that's not how the picture is going to look like. A generic measure lamination is going to look like a measure supported on a collection of transverse arcs on some irrational lamination that is a lamination so that if you take a transverse arc and the intersection that you get with the lamination, the set that you get looks more like a The set that you get looks more like a can of their sum. So these are the first examples of objects I want to consider. So given such an object, one thing you can do is you can build a real tree with a very standard construction. So what is a real tree or not tree? There's a metric space such that for every X and Y in that space, there's a unique column between X and Y, which is also metric to. Between cent, which is also metric to an interval and r. So typically, this is how an R tree is going to look like. Consider it like a wild version of a simplicial tree. And how do you get a dual R tree from a measure lamination? Well, you leave the measure lamination to universal cover. That lamination splits the universal cover into complementary regions. Into complementary regions, you can consider those complementary regions as the vertices or points of the triggering there. So, those complementary regions are going to collapse to points. And then the distance between points is going to be given by the measure assigned by the measure elimination to the The transverse R to the lamination is minimal miles. So essentially, take all possible paths from one point to the other and take the one that you know is the infinite movement, the mature between the two points. If you do that and collapse by this equivalence relation, where points that are pseudo-distance zero become the same point, what you're left with is you're left with a tree. Is you're left with a tree in this picture here. You can see that these complementary regions get collapsed to points. And so the generic picture you would expect to get is something that looks like a tripod locally. So that's how you can get a real tree from a measured lamination. But it's not just any real tree. It comes equipped with an action of a dead group because the dead group is acting on the universal colour. The background is acting on the universal cover, and because this measure lamination, well, it's invariant under the action of the dead group, the dead group acts by isometries of this quotient metric space. So it's an R tree equipped with an action of isometries by the Dead group. And I'd like to emphasize a property of this action. Property of this action. So this action has a property that's called small, it's a small action. What that means is that if you look at the edge stabilizers of an arc in this tree, those edge stabilizers can be at most virtually cyclic. So in particular, in this example, if you think about it, well, what's a stabilizer of an edge of the dual tree? Edge of the dual tree, the stabilizer of an edge of the dual tree is going to correspond to, well, if you have, say, an open geodesic, then it's not going to, there's not going to be any obvious transformation, any element of the group that leaves the open geodesic invariant. So you're going to get a trivial stabilizer for the tree. But if you have a lift of a closed geodesic, then there's going to be a Mobius transformation. Then there's going to be a movie transformation that leaves the geodesic emborian, namely the Mobius transformation that has that leaves of a flow geodesic as it has its axis. And that MOBIS transformation is going to generate a cyclic group. So at most edge stabilizers, this dual tree can be cyclic in the case of surface groups. So dual trees to medge elimination are indeed small. They satisfy this. Small, they satisfy this order of smallness. And as the celebrated Scoras theorem in 1991 just claims that, in fact, any small action, I should also say involve, but let's skip that adjective. Any small action of a surface group on a real tree, which is small, comes from a dual tree of some major elimination on the surface. Of some major illumination on the surface. So this theorem is giving you some duality between some geometric object on the surface and some more algebraic or geometric group theoretic object, which is actually the real tree. So this duality goes even deeper. Let me briefly introduce the notion of geodesic current. So that is a current can be thought of as a generalization of the concept of mesh lamination, where you also allow geodesics that might be non-simple in the support of the measure. So, strictly speaking, a measure lamination is a measure on the space of geodesics of the universal cover of the surface. So, let me give you. The surface. So let me give you an example. So if you have gamma closure that has it on the surface, you can take the lifts, you can take the lift of gamma to the universal cover, and you get a condible collection of lifts. And you can construct a measure by taking the sum of the dirac measure supported on these lifts. Of course, this is an infinite measure because this is an infinite Measure because it's an infinite sum of dirag measures. But this measure on the speed of geodesics of the Euroson cover is locally finite. It's positive. And it's manifestly pi1 invariant because the action of pi1 permits the lifts of this closed geodesic. So a geodesic. So, a geodesic current is any measure satisfying these three properties. One thing I'd like to emphasize is that, in fact, any geodesic current can be approximated by a sequence of weighted curves. So, from this example, you can see that curves are examples of geodesic currents, and by weighting them, By weighting them, in these drag measures, you can approximate any geodesic curve. So, weighted curves are bands in the space of geodesic curves. And another thing that I'd like to mention is that, in fact, this definition that we just did for surfaces, this only used really the space of geodesics. Which in turn can be phrased in terms of a grammar boundary. So one can just apply the same definition Burbatium for herbolic group, and one can have a vision of an abstraction as a measure that is invariant, a measure on the space of boundary. So, how do you define geodesics? You pick pairs of Pairs of points in the gram of boundary minus the diagonal, and then consider measures defined on that that are invariant under the group. So geodesic currents also make sense for herbolic groups in more generality. But in the setting of surfaces, there is a much richer structure. So one of the features that one gets is a notion of indirect. Is a notion of intersection number constructed by Vonaho that extends. So it's a function, a continuous function from the space of geodesic currents across geodesic currents that extends the geometric intersection number, extends continuously the geometric intersection number. So, in particular, one can make sense of the intersection number of a current with any closed curve. It's not too difficult to see that, in fact, measured laminations are examples of geodesic currents also, because one can induce a measure on the space of geodesic by using the transverse measure given by the measure lamination. And so, one can make sense of intersection. And so one can make sense of intersection number of a major lamination with any closed curve. So score as duality actually gives you that. If you think about the translation length of an element in the group G that is the same as doing this dual tree. Considering this dual tree, that is the same as considering the intersection number with the corresponding measure elimination of the curve given represented by that element by one. So another thing that comes from this duality is that in particular, the translation length of this action extends continuously to geodesic currents because it's equal to an intersection number. It's equal to an intersection number with closed curves, which is by Bonahan's result, intersection number is a continuous function, and so it gives you a continuous extension. So as I said, one can also consider occurrence for herbolic groups. And so let me now introduce another property, which also plays, I mean, is the other term. Also, plays, I mean, is the other term in the title of this talk that is the term of a bounded backtracking property. So, roughly speaking, what bounded backtracking property says is that if you consider any equivariant map from the Cayley graph of the group to an R tree, so let's say that you have an action, call a group on an R tree and let's And let's say that still is the Kayleigh graph as some Kelly graph of gamma. And you consider some equivariant map from the Kayleigh graph to the tree. Orbit map. We say that this action has the bounded backtracking property if there exists a universal constant R, so that if you take any geodesic arc from the Kelly graph and take the image of that, that image is going to be contained in this in the Contained in this, in the R neighborhood of the geodesic going from Fx to Fy. So, in other words, geodesics are, so another way to think about this is that this equivalent map is a one-sided quasi isometry. Now, in terms of the tree, what this is telling you is that if you have a geodesic XY in the Cayley graph, and you look at its image in the R tree. In the R tree. Well, its image, it might track, it might have some sort of a spike, perhaps, but these spikes cannot be of arbitrarily large diameter. The diameter has to be bounded because of this universal bound for this neighborhood. So these spikes can be arbitrarily large. So, as examples, an example of an action that has the bounded backtracking property is not too difficult to see, but the dual tree coming from a major lamination has the bounded backtracking property. And it turns out that going back to the previous slide, one does not need to fix a target space to be an R3. One can also define one backlog property for other metrics. Property for other metric spaces as the geodesic spaces. And if the target space is not necessarily an R tree, in fact, one can see that geodesic currents also satisfy the Vanabach-Tracking property in the sense that for every geodesic current, not necessarily a measure elimination, there is also a notion of dual space, not necessarily an R-tree, but some dual space associated to. A dual space associated to it. The definition is similar to that of the dual tree, but it takes a little bit more care to define. But roughly speaking, the way you define this distance is by considering the measure. So you have two points, X and Y, in the universal cover. And you consider the measure of the set of geodesics that intersect that geodesic segment from X to Y transversally. These are geodesics in the support of the These are geodesics in the support of the current mu, and you take the measure of those and follow that and pseudo distance. So it turns out that this dual space is growing hyperbolic. And this is something we proved with Luca and Russell. And in the framework by Stephen Cantrell and Eduardo Regon-Reyes, they proved that these dual spaces have a bounded backtracking property. So they are examples of spaces. So they are examples of species with a valid backtracking property. Another example of source of actions with valid backtracking property, which is in fact the setting where the notion of bounded backtracking property appeared first, is in the setting of free groups acting on our trees. So Pirardel proved that every minimal small action of a free group on real tree has the bounded backtracking property by using an approximation of R. So, let me get to what Misha and Anna did. So, we proved something in relation to the boundary backtracking properties. So, for the setting of one-ended hyperbolic groups, which are parabolic groups with connected and non-indigram boundary, so typical examples, of course, like Fouxian, Fouxian, and certain Nucleinian groups. But it's a vast family. And one interesting property or structural property. Or the structural property that these groups have is that they emit a JSJ decomposition. It's a little bit technical to describe, but suffice to say that it's an algebraic analog of the usual JSJ decomposition for three manifolds. With the idea that you can recompose the group into a group of groups and analyze each one of the vertex and edge groups. Vertex and edge groups plus the vertex and edge groups of this graph of groups decomposition act in sub-trees of the real tree. So by understanding the action of the vertex groups and edge groups on these sub-trees of the real tree, for example, if one can prove that these actions and sub-trees of the real tree have the banded backtracking property, then because of these JSG. Of this JSG composition structure, there must be hope to put them back together and show that if one can show bounded backtracking property for every piece, one gets bounded backtracking property globally, for a global function. And that is indeed one can do. So, what we prove is that if gamma is a one-ended herbolic group and we run a small minimal function of minimal action of a such a group on a on a real tree then this action satisfies the bounded backtracking property so i'm not going to get into the details of the proof i'm just going to mention that the ingredients so it uses some work it combines work and girardell of girardel and scora for proving that each one of the pieces on the gravity composition certain sways a BBP property and then And then how do you put everything together? Well, to put everything together, we use the structure of three of a metric spaces, which Franov talked about today. So this is one of Misha and Franaf, and we use some of the combing results for trees of metric spaces to deduce the global boundary tracking property for the Boundable tracking property for the whole action of the group upon the tree. So we can show, therefore, that for a family of hyperbolic groups, one in the hyperbolic groups, small actions backtracking problem. And let me finish by saying the motivation or why I started caring about this. So in 1991, Bonagon conjectured. Bonerhon conjectured that, well, conjectured the following: He said that given a small action of a hyperbolic group on a real tree, the translation length of the group extends continuously to geodesic current. So just as it happens for the setting of surface groups where close geodesics or closed curves are examples of geodesic current, they are dense. Of JSI currents that they are dense in the space of JSIC currents. The same happens for conjugacy classes. Conjugacy classes of elements in a hyperbolic can be thought of as currents and their weight, their weighted scale versions are actually denser, the speeds of currents. And so it makes sense to consider this question, given that, for example, we know that the answer is, I mean, we know like we have. I mean, we know, like, we have we have some motivation to ask this question from the setting of surfaces. And so, that was the conjecture that I was interested in. And we can actually prove, at least in setting up one ended hyperbolic groups, this conjecture. Because additionally, what Misha and I can do is for any hyperbolic group, here it doesn't have to be one-ended. Here, it doesn't have to be one-ended. If you have an action with a bounded backtracking property of this group on a tree, on a real tree, then the translation length extends continuously to geodesic currents. And this is another result, is independent of the one that mentioned before. This uses some dynamical ideas that I don't have to talk about right now. But just to conclude, we have these different categories of actions of one-ended hyperbolic groups on real trees. And so we have these inclusions. So one thing I'll mention is that, well, this inclusion is proper. There are examples of actions with BBP, which are not small. And examples are given by. Examples are given by Catrail and IS. And this extension result extends previous work, like for free groups, for example, very small actions by Ilya Yakopovich. Also, the same result for torsion-free hyperbolic groups was proven also by Ken Trell and Regun recently. By can trail an elegant rays recently using slightly different techniques. So, I'll finish with some mentions of future work. So, one question that I'm really interested in and I'm working on radius is to understand in what sense we can construct duals to bound actions with bound back tracking property. So, is there some notion of a current? Current that plays the role of a dual, as mesh elimination plays the role of a small action. So if we think of BBP as a generalization of small actions in some sense, what is the corresponding geometric dual to it? And then maybe other notions, such as the notion of core in the sense of Girandel, of two actions with bounded marketing frequency. Okay, so I'm going to stop here. Thank you. Great, thank you. Great, thank you. Are there any questions? Just a quick question. Somewhere on one of those slides, you had the expression fruit of the tree. Was that just a poetic reference or was it a nickel term? It was more of a poetic reference. Yeah. In terms of pieces. Okay. Okay. Okay.
