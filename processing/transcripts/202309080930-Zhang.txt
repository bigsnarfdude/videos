Yeah, so in some sense, the work that I'm presenting here is not new. It dates back to a few years ago, actually. But somehow we are still pushing this project a bit further. So I guess it still makes sense to talk about it here. So, just in case that you have heard me or my co-authors talking about similar, giving similar talks, yeah, I apologize for that. Okay, so. For that. Okay, so let me give you a little bit of the background. So the project concerns the degenerations of hyperkiller manifolds. So the point is to study the degeneration of hyperkiller manifolds. So there is one piece of classical work which is very beautiful, which is the so-called degenerations of K3 surfaces. The generations of K3 surfaces. So let me maybe give you a very brief review of this piece. Review of this piece of story, K3s. So, if we start from an arbitrary degeneration of K3 surfaces, let's say F from X to C, which is one parameter, which is a family of K3 surfaces over one-dimensional base with one singular fiber. So this is the proper flat subjective family, which is smooth over C minus one point. This is the arbitrary degeneration of K3 surfaces. Then the classical theorem of Knuts and Manford and Waterman tells. Of Knut, Manford, and Waterman tells us that we can perform a finite base change. We can perform a finite base change and also a birational modification to make it into a so-called semi-stable degeneration. A semi-stable degeneration has very nice properties. So the total space is smooth, and the central fiber, Smooth and the central fiber, the only singular fiber is a simple normal crossing divisor. So, this is somehow a nicer model, a nice model of degenerations. Then, there is a theorem of Kulikov and Pearson-Pinkham, which says that under mild assumptions, for example, every component of the central fiber is KLA, under this assumption, then we can perform a further birational modification to make the canonical boundaries of the total space trivial. So, a further modification. So, a further modification, a birational modification, we can make it into a so-called Kulikov model. So, a Kulikov model is a semi-stable degeneration together with an extra condition, so semi-stable, so semi-stable, with an extra condition, which says that the canonical bundle of the total space is trivial. So, in some sense, every degeneration family of K3 surfaces can be somehow modified into a so-called Kulikov model. And the Kulikov model has been And the Kulikov model has been completely classified. So there is a classical theorem about the classification of the central fiber of the central fibers in Kulikov models. So let me say classification. Classification of the central fiber X0 in the Kulikov model. So there are exactly three types of central fibers that could appear in a Kulikov model. So this result is due to Kulikov. So this result is due to Kulikov, Pearson, and Friedman and Morrison. So the three types of central fibers are like the following, are like this. So first of all, the first type of central fiber is a smooth K3. So in this case, there is essentially no degeneration. So a smooth family of K3 surfaces still degenerates into a still, I mean, specialized to a smooth K3 surface. Then the second type of central fiber is slightly more. Of the central fiber is slightly more complicated. So, this X0 is a chain of surfaces which are glued together in this way. So, this is the second type of a central fiber. The first component is rational, and all the middle components, they are elliptic root, elliptic root surface, and the last one is again rational. So, this is the second type of central fiber. Then, there is a third. Fiber. Then there is a third type of central fiber which is more interesting. So this central fiber can be written as the union of some smooth surfaces meeting in a very special configuration. So each smooth surface is a rational surface. And if you look at the intersection of every component with all the other components, then you get a cycle of rational curves. Cycle of rational curves. So for each i, if you look at the intersection of di with the union of all the other components, then you get a cycle of rational curves. Then you get a cycle of rational curves. And moreover, the dual graph of the central fiber is actually a triangulation of S2. So the dual graph of X0. Of X0 is a triangulation of S2. So this is the third type of central fiber. So in a Kurikov model, the central fibers can only appear as one of these three types. So this is somehow a very complete classification of the central fibers that could appear in a Kulipov model for K-3 surfaces. If the second type and third type are a little bit more complicated, look a little more complicated to you. Look a little more complicated to you. You can think of the following examples. So, in P3, if a quartic surface degenerates into the union of two quadrics, then this is essentially a type 2 degeneration. And if a quartic degenerates into the union of four planes, then this is essentially a type 3 degeneration. So, if you have four planes meeting in this configuration, then this is a type 3 degeneration. Of course, if you want to fit it into a If you want to fit it into a Kulikov model, you have to make sure that the total space is smooth. So you somehow want to modify it a little bit, but I'm not talking about this in detail. Okay, so this is a very quick review of the case three story. Now we want to go a bit further and consider similar pictures for degenerations of higher dimensional hyperkiller manifolds. So now let me talk about degenerations of higher dimensional manifolds. The generations of higher-dimensional hypercalor manifolds. In higher dimensions, we still, I guess, we somehow still expect a similar picture, but I guess the picture is not, at least it's at the moment, it's not so explicit or so clear as in the case three case. So let's say if I have a degeneration family of hyperkalia manifolds, let's say this is the degeneration, degeneration. generation of hyperkiller manifolds with an arbitrary of dimension of dimension 2n with an arbitrarily bad singular fiber with an arbitrarily bad singular fiber in the middle then of the first result is the result of fugino which tells us that we can perform we can still perform a base change a finite cyclic base change together with a birational modification by rational modification By rational modification. Let me maybe write it down. Write it here. Birational modification to make it into a so-called minimal DLT model. So the base change is to get rid of the non-reduced components in the central fiber. And the birational modification is somehow to just run MMP to get a rate. to just to run MMP to get a together to get a reasonably good model. So because in high dimension, we don't really expect the results, the output of MMP to be smooth, right? So here we can only require the total space to be a minimal DLT model. So this is a result of Fujino. And also we can require that the total canonical bundle of the total space is trivial. So this is the first result. So, this is the first result in this direction. So, this is somehow a parallel generalization of the semi-stable model in some sense. And then, not only a semi-stable model, but Kurikov model, Kurikov model. Then, we still want to ask whether there is a similar classification of the central fibers in a minimal DLT model. So, for a classification of the central fiber y0 in such a minimal DLT model, there is Minimal DLT model, there is this very nice result of Kolar, Laza, Saka, and Gwaza. They studied this problem and get many interesting results. And for the sake of this talk, I only want to briefly mention that they also somehow classify the central fibers in three types, which are called types. Which are called type 1, 2, and 3, based on the neopotency of the log monodrome operator on the second cohomology of the general fiber. And then in each type, they computed the dimension of the dual complex of the central fiber. So the dimension of the dual complex, the dimension of the dual complex of the central fiber, in each case, they prove that the dimension of the dual complex is either is zero or n. Is zero or n or two n, depending on the type. So, and in the case of 2n, you should expect that the dual complex is somehow has the same cohomology, has the same rational cohomology as Pn. So this is their result. So that paper, of course, contains many, many more interesting results. And this is the one that's related to my talk today. Okay. So this is somehow, I guess, a parallel story for the Parallel story for degenerations of high-dimensional hyperkala manifolds. So, in this particular talk, what I want to discuss is not the general theory of degenerations, but some explicit examples. So, as you can see, in order to get a nice model, in order to get a Kulikov model for degenerations of fiberkiller manifolds, we have to somehow run the MMP to modify the central fiber to make it nice. But, you know, in some sense, the output of MMP is sometimes. The output of MMP is sometimes hard to control. So, we want to find some examples where this minimal DLT model actually has some modular interpretation. So, we really want the output of this MMP to be a space which parametrizes something. So, this is actually the point of this talk. So, I would like to show you two examples of constructing minimal DLT models. Minimal DLT models, or in some sense, nice degenerations of hypercalent manifolds. So, let me write down my main question, the main question that I want to study in this talk. So, let's say if I have given a family X over C, let me call it F. For simplicity, I assume it's projective. Let's say this is the generation family of K3 surfaces. So, let's say this is the degeneration. So, let's say this is the generation of K3 surfaces over a one-dimensional base C. So, over generic point, over general point T, I have a K3 surface. So, this is XT. This is the fiber XT. This fiber XT is a K3 surface. And then over the special fiber, let's say this fiber, the fiber is type 2. It's the central fiber of the type 2 degeneration. So, it's the chain of irreducible components. And for simplicity, let me just assume it has two components. Simplicity, let me just assume it has two components. So, this is the central fiber x0. So, this is the degeneration of k3 surfaces. Then, the question is: how can we construct a degeneration of high-dimensional hyperkalar manifolds? So, can we construct a degeneration of high-dimensional hyperkalar manifolds over the same base, over the same base curve C, such that, okay, let's say this is still the base curve C, such that over the point T, I have a fiber. have um i have a fiber which is the hilber scheme of endpoints of the of the fiber above of xt let's say this is the this is the fiber yt and over over zero i need something good so this is the fiber y zero so somehow i want to produce a relative a relative hilbert scheme of endpoints for the original family but i want to somehow modify the central fiber to make the total space nice so so this is this is my question so this would This is my question. So, this would be this would be a degeneration of Hilbert schemes or of high-dimensional hypertail manifolds. So, the question is how to fill in somehow nice central fiber, Y0. By nice, I mean, first of all, I want the entire family to be a minimal DLT model, or in some sense, the standard, the CUNY. Or, in some sense, the standard model for degenerations of hypercaleer manifolds. And secondly, I want the entire thing to have a modular interpretation. Okay, so in the literature, there are actually two existing constructions. But before I talk about either of the constructions, it's clear that the most naive way to construct such a family is to take the honest Hilbert scheme of endpoints, right? Relative Hilbert scheme. endpoints right right relative cable scheme of endpoints but the problem of that construction is that we get uh we get a central fiber which is too singular in some sense the central fiber is too small uh so somehow in order to get a nice family we have to we still have to modify the central fiber a little bit to make it a little larger so the first construction in the in the literature uh is done by nagai uh back in maybe 2008. so his his um his construction exactly follows from this idea Exactly, it follows from this idea. Since the relative Huber scheme of endpoints is not good, we modify a little bit. We resolve the similarities to make the photo space nice. So, this is exactly what he does. So, first of all, he look at the relative Huber scheme. So, this he look at the Hubble scheme. So, he look at the relative Hubble scheme of two points for the K3 family. And then, if you look at this is the family over the curve C. If you look at the central fiber, if you look at the central fiber U0. Fiber, if you look at the central fiber U0, you can easily see that the central fiber contains three components. Let me call them V11, V12, and V22. So the basic idea is that if the central fiber of the first family has only two components, then since you are considering the Hilbert scheme of two points, the two points can be distributed into the two components in three different ways, right? So eventually, you get three components in the central function. You get three components in the central fiber of this relative Hilbert 2. Then you can take a small resolution. You can take a small resolution to resolve the singularity of the total space to get Y, to get a total family Y. Actually, the way to resolve the singularity is just to blow up U along one of these devices because they are somehow whale devices which are not catchy. So if you blow up U along one of these devices, you get a better space. So blow up. So, blow up of U along V11, for example, gives you a small resolution of this U. Then this is the space that Snagaik constructed. So the idea is somehow very, very, very simple. And he proved that the space he constructed in this way is indeed a very nice space. So, this is a theorem of Nagai, which says that, first of all, Says that, first of all, this new family Y over C is indeed semi-stable. So it's actually semi-stable, meaning that the total space Y is smooth and the central fiber is a simple normal crossing divisor. And also the canonical bundle is trivial. Then secondly, because we are considering the generations of hyperkiller manifolds, so we naturally expect the syntactic form to be extended to the central fiber. But now the central fiber is a very simple To the central fiber. But now the central fiber is a synchronormal crossing divisor, so we somehow have to replace a usual normal holomorphic two-form by a log holomorphic two-form. So there exists a sigma, which is a holomorphic form with poles along the components of the central fibers, say omega 2 with log y0. So this is a holomorphic two form. This is a holomorphic two form such that sigma squared is nowhere vanishing. So in some sense, this sigma is indeed an extension of the syntactic form on general fibers to the central fiber. But as you can imagine, this construction is a bit, it is a little difficult to generalize this construction to Generalize this construction to Hilbert scheme of more than two points. Because, I mean, this whole construction relies on a very explicit description of the central fiber. But if there are, but if you consider more than two points, then the Hilbert scheme of such a configuration becomes very difficult to describe. So that's the reason why this construction works well for n equals two, but not for Hilbert scheme of more than two points. Okay, then. Okay, then this was the first construction. And then there is a second construction given by Google Browns and Hallowehulik, which are my co-authors. So they construct a new model, which is different, a Guelbranson Hallahule construction. They construct a very different model from Nagai's, and the construction itself is also kind of interesting. It goes a Of interesting. It goes along a completely different route. So let's say, first of all, I just briefly mentioned it. So let's say you start from a type 2 degeneration of K3 surfaces, let's say from X over C. We can think of C as A1. Then what we can do is to, first of all, do a kind of expansion. I mean, the so-called expanded degeneration. So-called expanded degeneration invented by Li and Wu. I should really, yeah, by Li and Wu. First of all, by Li, and then used by Li and Wu in other situations. After this expansion, we get a larger family, which I denoted as Xn over Cn. And this morphism I just denoted by Fn. And this Cn is now An plus 1. Now a n plus one. So this is a much larger family. And on this family, you have a GMM action. So this is the C star to the M action. So this is the first step called expansion. I will give you an example on the next board, but for the moment, let me just say this expansion is somehow like you repeat every fiber of the original family like that many times and then do some slight modification to get this. Slight modification to get this much larger family. So basically, you just repeat every fiber many times and fill in different modifications of the central fiber. So you get a, first of all, you get a much larger family. Then the second step, you take a relative Hilbert scheme of n points. So you get Hilber n of Xn over Cn over over Cn over the same base Cn, which is still a n plus one. So this is the second step. So from this larger family, we can take the relative Hilbert scheme. And on this relative Hilbert scheme, we still have a GMN action. So you might be wondering why this makes sense, right? Because after expanding the original family, we still have The original family, we still have a family with singular fibers. Then, by taking the relative hub of scheme, we still have the very bad configurations. So, the third step, I think, is somehow the magic. So, in the third step, we take the GIT quotient. We take the GIT quotient because on the total space, we have a GMN action. So, here we can take a GIT quotient. We can take a GIT quotient to get a family, which is like this. So, Hilbert scheme of Xn. Hilbert scheme of xn over cn uh this is this was the total space we can take the we can take the g m n we can take the uh quotient by g m n then we get a family over the original base c so c can also be thought as c n which is the base downstairs quotient by g m n so this this was the last step uh this this is the last step which is the git quotient so the benefit is that when you take a git quotient you have Take a GIT quotient, you have to throw away some of the unstable locus, right? And actually, the bad configuration, the configurations of the points that you do not want, say, for example, the configuration where the points lies on the singularity of the central fibers, they are precisely thrown away. So by throwing away the unstable locus, We have exactly these good configurations that survive. So eventually, this family can be expected to be better than the original Hilbert scheme of endpoints, the relative Hilbert scheme of endpoints of the original family. So by going these three steps, we get a Google Browns and Halloween-Hoole construction of the Hilbert scheme, of the modified Hilbert scheme in some sense. So this is the construction. So, this is the construction. It looks a bit abstract. So, let me give you a very explicit example. This example is, in some sense, the most elementary example. Let's try to consider the Hilbert scheme of only one point. So, we start from a family. Start from we start from a family from x to c uh which is something like this right this is the family from x to c so it's given by the equation uh it's given by sending a point x1 x2 to a point to uh to a point t uh which is x1 times x2 in the base so this is the original this is the original family which uh let's let's say there is one singular fiber then by the the so-called expansion by doing this expansion By doing this expansion, we get a much larger family. And this much larger family looks like the following. So let me see if I can draw it correctly. So this is this much larger family. So T0 direction, T1 direction. So this is my example. So this is my expansion x1 to c1 and to c1 to c1. Yes. So this is my expansion. So you can see essentially, so this family is given by sending, let's say, by sending so by sending T1 T2 to T0 T0 T by sending T by sending T0 T one to T. By sending T0T1 to T as a product. So you can see if we replace T by T0T1, we have an equation which is T0T1 equals X1X2, which so the total space becomes a singular at one point. Then we resolve this point. Then we perform a small modification, a small resolution of the total space to get a smooth space. So you can see that every fiber is actually repeated exactly C star that many times. see star that many times except the central fiber which is which is repeated um which is repeated along both along both coordinates and only at the point zero zero the central fiber is modified by adding one extra component so then we can take a hilber scheme of one point to still get the same family x1 to c1 and then by taking the git quotient then by taking the git quotient We actually get our original family back because, in this case, we can analyze the semi-stable locus, and eventually we will be able to see that the GIT quotient is precisely the original family. So, it's Moose, yes. Yes, so the equation for the original family is just given by T equals. Original family is just given by t equals x1, x2, right? Then, uh, then you expand the one-dimensional base into two-dimensional. So, basically, just by replacing t uh as t0 times t1. So now the total space becomes t0, t1 equals x1, x2, which is which has one singular fiber, one singular point. But this point has two small resolutions. You just choose either of them to get this pitch. Yeah. For higher expansions, basically you do the same. expansions basically you do you do the same you you you you do the same thing by replacing the base uh with by replacing the base curve by a larger dimensional affine space yeah so so this is the example this is the example when n is equal to one so uh it basically shows that this this procedure makes sense right because if you only consider the relative hilbert scheme of one point you should really expect to get the original thing okay um now i want to state now i want Now I want to state some of the results that we obtained and focusing on one particular aspect of the result, which is the part related to variation of GIT. Okay, so let me try to tell you, let me try to summarize the picture that I just erased. So eventually we had Raised. So eventually we had, let me relative Hilbert scheme of this expanded family, right? You remember, I just erased it. And we constructed this Gobranson-Halahulik space as a GIT quotient, which is this W modulo quotient by GMN, by this group GMN. Of course, with respect to a certain ample line bundle LK. So this has a map to the base curve C. has a map to the base curve c so this was the this was the construction this was like a two-line construction of the uh of the grubruns halohulic um construction then alternatively uh maybe let me put it here so alternatively alternatively alternatively we can also consider z prime which is not really the git quotient but we just Not really the GIT quotient, but we just pick the semi-stable locus and then take the stack equient. So we take the stack quotient of the semi-stable locus by this group GMN. Then there's also a map to C. So this is somehow a related second construction. This is the stack quotient. So yeah, so the Um, yeah, so the first theorem that I want to present, which is probably also what I'm gonna focus in in the next 20 minutes, is the following observation, actually. It's part of, it's actually an observation in an observation in the description of the singular locus. So, first of all, I mentioned that when we take the GIT quotient, we have to find the GMN, linearized MN. The GMN linearized ample line bound of LK. So there exists such an ample polarization LK for each case sufficiently large such that the following conditions are satisfied. First of all, the semi-stable locus is equal to the stable locus. So every semi-stable point is strictly stable. Strictly stable. So, and moreover, the semi-stable locus is independent of the choice of K. So, we have a series of line bundles, and no matter which line bundle you use to detect the semi-stable locus, you always get the same semi-stable locus and stable locus. And the second thing is that whether a point is whether a point in whether a point in W is semi-stable or not does not depend on the scheme structure. depend on the scheme structure. So whether a point P in W, which is the relative Hilbert scheme, is stable or not, only depends. Let me just say does not depend on the does not does not depend does not depend on the on its scheme structure. It's uh scheme structure. It's scheme structure. What do I mean by this? So as you can see, every point in W is a configuration of n points, right? Or it's a less n closed subscheme of in the total space xn. So this point itself. So, this point itself, this configuration itself has a scheme structure, right? So, the second statement is actually that the point P as a point in W is stable or not, does not depend on the scheme structure, and it only depends on the underlying support at the multiplicity. So this is a second statement. In other words, if you look at the Hilbert cheomorphism from Hilbert n to sim n, then Sim to SIM N. Then, if you look at one five, any particular fiber of that Hilbert charmorphism, either all points in that fiber are stable or all points in that fiber are unstable. So this is what I mean by it doesn't depend on the scheme structure, right? Because the fiber of any fiber of the Hilbert charmorphism basically just gives different scheme structures on the same combination of points. Okay, so this is the first theorem. And then the second theorem basically says that the Gorbans and Hallahouli construction does give us a nice total space or nice degenerations of Hada Keeler manifolds. So the second theorem. This is also a GHH, GHD. So, this is the second theorem, which says: first of all, let me just be very brief. There is indeed a modular interpretation. Interpretation. Interpretation. There is indeed a modular interpretation of the space they constructed. So, of Z. So, Z does parameterize some configurations of points, which I don't want to make precise today. And the secondly, the The family Z with the central fiber Z0, it is indeed a Kurikov model. So it is indeed a minimal DLT model, minimal DLT model with the trivial canonical bundle. And moreover, the total space Z, well, in this case, Z is not smooth. The total space is not smooth, but it has at worst finite quotient singularities, finite quotient. quotient singularities, finite quotient quotient singularities and the third the third result is that the dual complex the dual complex of the of the central fiber in this construction of zero, this is indeed the this is the symmetric the n-symmetric power of the dual complex of the dual complex of the of the case three digit of the case three digit. the case three digit of the case three degeneration family that we started from so if we look at the case three if we look at the if we look if we if you remember the the family we started with we started with it's a degeneration of case three surface with a central fiber given by two smooth components meeting along uh meeting along a divisor right so the dual context of x0 is like two points with one arrow connecting them and in this case the dual context of z0 uh as we compute z0 as we computed it's really the symmetric n-symmetric power of this of this diagram which means that it's an n n simplex it's an n-simplex yeah so this this is the third this is the third statement yeah so so this theorem basically says that um uh the the family z uh based on the construction of global halopholic is really is really a nice degeneration family uh of hyperkillar manifolds. Of hypercalor manifolds or of hyperstings of points on K3 surfaces. Yeah. You mean Z is the GIT quotient of the relative Hibble scheme of the expanded family with respect to the quotient of this W by GMN with respect to some ample line bundle. To some ample line bundle. The one in serum one. Yes, exactly. Yes, yes. Yeah. You mean Z prime? Ah, Z prime, in Z prime, we still use the same line bundle, but we take the stack quotient instead of the GIT potentially. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That one has a, yes. That one has uh yes, uh, because as you can see, the state the stable locus agrees with the semi-stable locus. So, every point in the in the in the semi-stable locus has at most a finite stabilizer, which means that Z has at most finite quotient singularities. But if we take the stack quotient, then we get the Limon for stack, right? Because we only have finite stabilizers. Yeah, so this is exactly my third, the third theorem that I want to write down. So, it tells us that if we consider, if we consider the If we consider the stack equient, if we consider the stack equation Z prime that I just erased, the total space still has very nice property. So this is also G H H Z. So if we consider the stack quotient Z prime, first of all, it is a Deli-Manford stack. And secondly, if we look at the morphism from Z prime to C as prime to c as um as um let's say as a degeneration as a degeneration of the moment for stacks then it is a semi-stable degeneration semi-stable family of the m stacks namely the total space is actually a smooth Dunning Mumba stack and the central fiber is indeed a simple normal crossing divisor moreover the canonical bundle is really trivial so it's a it's a semi-stable family of DM stack with trivial canonical bundle DM stack with trivial canonical bundle on the total space. And thirdly, for this family, we can also find a simplistic form. Yeah, the simplest form also extends to the central fiber. So there is a log2 form. There is a log2 form that is nowhere vanishing, nowhere degenerate. Which is an extension of the asymptotic form on all the other fibers, on general fibers. Okay, so this is the third theorem. Today, I actually want to focus more on the first theorem, the theorem that I just erased. So, if you remember what that theorem says, that theorem basically says that when we take the GIT quotient, That when we take the GIT quotient, we can actually find good linearized line bundles, good linearized ample line bundles, so that the semi-stable locus agrees with the stable locus. We find not only one ample line bundle, but a family of line bundles called LK. And the stable locus and semi-stable locus, they are independent of the choice of LK. And moreover, whether a point is stable or not does not depend on a scheme structure. So this is something that I actually want to. something that I want to that I actually want to focus on today because this has a lot to do with variations of GITs. Somehow I want to give a conceptual understanding of the first theorem that I just mentioned. So conceptual proof of theorem. Of theorem one. It's actually also a proof, but we already had a proof. Well, we already had a proof in a previous paper, but in the most recent paper, we just somehow came up with another proof, which somehow shows that the phenomenon that I just described is not a coincidence. So, for example, whether a point is stable or not does not depend on the scheme structure. depend on on the scheme structure this is not a coincidence it is really the it is really the pre-image of some locus in the in the in the symmetric power um yeah so so yeah let me try to give a conceptual proof of the first theorem um okay so um so so so so to to prove uh to to give such a to give such a proof uh let me let me maybe draw such let me let me maybe draw the following picture so we have the Hilbert N, X N. Hilbert n x n over c n. This is the relative Hilbert scheme. Then it admits the Hilbert charmorphism to the symmetric power, right? Symmetric power of Xn over Cn. Then there is also, there is also from here, there is also a quotient from the product, from the NFO product, N-fold fiber product. So this is the quotient. This is the quotient by this is the quotient by the symmetric group symmetric group S n or sigma n. This is the sigma n quotient quotient map. So yeah, so there are three related there are three related spaces here. So first of all, on this relative Huber scheme, I just told you that I will construct ample linearizations, LK. I will construct some. I will construct some ample line model LK, which carries the GMN action. So, the way to do it is the following. So, first of all, over the total space XN, we can find some ampere line bundle. We can find some ampere line bundle L, which is G M N linearized. So that I don't want to explain. That I don't want to explain. So basically, we have such an ample line bundle on the total space of Xm, which is the group linearized. So, how do we get an ample line bundle on the relative Hilbert scheme? Well, there's the standard construction. There's the standard construction by going through this universal family. So, let's say this is the universal family, which has two projections, one to the relative Huber scheme, and the other to the Hilbert scheme and the other to the total space Xn, and both maps to Cn. Let me call this P, this Q. So U, so the universal family U has two projections. Then this L K, it should be a line bundle on the relative Hilbert scheme. It is given by the determinant line bundle of P lower star, Q upper star of L to the power of K. So this. So, this is the line bundle LK that I want to construct. So, this is the line bundle living on the relative Hilbert scheme. As you know, when K is large enough, this is really an ample line bundle. And this ample line bundle carries the G linearization, which is induced from the G linearization of L itself. So, this is ample when K is sufficiently large. Okay, so this. Okay, so these are the line bundles LK that I mentioned in the statement of the theorem. But now I want to, now I need to show that the semi-stable locus and the stable locus with respect to LK are the same, which is independent of the choice of LK. And also whether a point is stable does not depend on the scheme structure of that point. So for proving that theorem, I need to somehow use all these spaces. To somehow use all these spaces and one auxiliary line bundle. The way to construct this auxiliary line bundle is to start from the is to start from the product. So from this ampo line bundle L, we can construct an ample line bundle here, which is given by the n-box product of L. So this guy is obtained by pulling back L from each component, from each vector, and take the tensor product. So this is clearly an M4 line bundle on the Clearly, an ample line bundle on the product. And then we realize that this line bundle is actually invarying under the symmetric group action. So, what we can do is to descend this line bundle. So, descend this line bundle to the symmetric power. Let me call this L prime. This L prime is also an ample line bundle. Yeah, it's also an ample line bundle. Then, furthermore, we can pull back this ample line bundle. We can pull back this ample line bundle along the Hilbert channel morphism to get a line bundle which I call L infinity. So this is a pullback. This is a pullback. Since it is a pullback of an ample line bundle, it's no longer ample, but it's very close of being ample, right? Because it is trivial along every curve that is contracted by the Silver Chromorphism. So this line bundle L infinity really lives in the boundary of the ample comb. So this is no longer, so that line. no longer so uh that line bundle is no longer uh is no longer ample but the point is that we just want to we just want to establish a relation between this between these l case and and this l infinity and together with all everything that i wrote on the on the right hand side okay so now let me let me try to show you why uh i had uh i had um the i had the results in the in in the statement of theorem one step by step maybe Step by step, maybe. So, step one. So, step one, we can start from the start from the right-hand side. The right-hand side is really the product of the product of actually it's the fiber product of Xn. So, the n-fold product. So, we can do a Hilbert-Mumford analysis on the right-hand side to find out the stable locus and semi-stable locus. So, maybe let me also give Maybe let me also give these spaces some names. So I will call this guy, I will call this space P. This anvil product, I will call it P because P stands for product. And this space, I will call it S because it's a symmetric power. And this space, I call it H because it's the relative Hilbert scheme. So just to make the notations a bit easier. So step one, we do a careful Hilbert-Manford analysis on the right-hand side to find out the stable. On the right-hand side, to find out the stable points and semi-stable points in T. So, what we find is: so, by Hubert, by Hilbert-Manford criteria, we can find out the stable and semi-stable points in P. So, the results, the conclusion is that the stable points and the semi-stable points are the same. And the semi-stable locus is also sigma and invariant. So, this loser is invarying under the symmetric. Under the symmetric group action. So, this was the first step. Then, starting from the second step, we do not really need to do Hubble-Mountford analysis anymore. So, the second step, we want to somehow pull back, we want to somehow take the pre-image of the semi-stable loci, or the image of the semi-stable loci under the quotient by tau. So, we proved some functoriality result. Factoriality result. We prove some functoriality results of the stable points with respect to finite group actions, with respect to finite group quotient. Some functoriality result with respect to finite group quotient tells us that the semi-stable locus in the space in the middle, so in the space S, it is actually equal to the image. Equal to the image of the semi-stable locus of the space on the right-hand side. It's the image of the semi-stable locus in P. And also the stable locus is also equal to the image of the stable locus in P. So these are given by the functoriality of semi-stable, some functoriality results with respect to finite group quotients. And since we know that they are the same, since we know by step one that they are the same, then we immediately, then we immediately we immediately then we immediately know that they are the same so the semi-stable locus and the stable locus are the same in the in the in the symmetric power so this this was the second step so the first step basically tells you that the stable locus and semi-stable locus agree uh in in this space and the second step tells you that uh they agree in this space now we want to we want to bring further to the relative hubo scheme so um so the third step um So the third step, so the third step, okay, so let me use the right half of the board with respect to what I just erased that is that finite group quotient. Okay, now we move to the third step. We want to bring the stable locus and semi-stable locus to the relative Hilbert scheme. To the relative Hilbert scheme. So we also proved some functoriality, functorality, functorality with respect to pullback. Functoriality with respect to pullback. So by this functoriality result, basically we know that the semi-stable locus in the Hilbert scheme will. locus in the Hilbert scheme with respect to L infinity. So with respect to the pullback of L prime, so the semi-stable locus in H with respect to the line bound of L infinity is precisely the preview image of the semi-stable locus in the symmetric power. And also the stable locus, the stable locus is also the pre-image of the stable. Of the stable locus in S. So these are given by the functoriality results. And then by step two, we know that the stable locus and semi-stable locus agree in a symmetric power. So they are the same by step two, which tells us that these are also the same. So in the relative Huber scheme, the semi-stable locus and stable locus with respect to the Stable locus with respect to the line bound of L infinity agree. So, this was this is the third step. And moreover, this step tells us that this step tells us that the semi-stable locus, whether a point in the relative Hilbert scheme is stable or not, is independent of the scheme structure, independent of the scheme structure. So, for this space and this space. So, whether a point in the red. Space. So, whether a point in the relative Hubble scheme is stable or not does not depend on the scheme structure, because as we see, the stable locus and semi-stable locus, they are really the pre-image of the corresponding stable locus or semi-stable locus in the symmetric power, which means that for any fiber of the Hilbert charm morphism, either the entire fiber is in the semi-stable locus or the entire fiber is in the unstable locus. So, the stability does not. So, the stability does not depend on the scheme structure of any particular point. Okay, so this was the third step, which tells us that everything in the relative Hilbert scheme is true with respect to this L infinity, with respect to this line bound of L infinity. But remember that for the theorem, we need the same statement to hold for Lk instead of L infinity. So eventually we still have to establish a relation between Lk and L infinity. Between Lk and L infinity. So basically, we want to show that the semi-stable locus or the stable locus with respect to LK agrees with the stable locus or semi-stable locus with respect to this L infinity. So no matter whether you use LK or L infinity, you always have the same stable locus or semi-stable locus. Okay, this would be the last step. I need to erase this picture, but I guess now it doesn't. Now it doesn't. Now it's okay. Okay, so for the last step, I need semi-continuity results in variation GIT. So this is the fourth theorem that I want to state today. So in some sense, this theorem is not. So, in some sense, this theorem is not new because the classical results in the ample and absolute case is already well known. But still, for this particular version that I need, we somehow gave a proof in our work. So let's say I have a morphism phi from W to S, and this whole thing is invariant under the. Is invariant under the G action. So phi is projective and S is an R phi and finite type base. Of course, G is a reductive group. And I also assume that L T for any T larger than or equal to zero is a G linearized is a G linearized line bundle on W. G linearized line bundle on W. G linear as a line bundle on W. And this L T is ample, is ample for T greater than zero. So when T is larger than zero, I assume that this G linearization is ample. But when T is equal to zero, well, I don't assume that L0 is ample. So L0 can be in the boundary of the ample cone. Then the result is that if we look result is that if we look at if we look at the stable locus stable locus with with respect to L0 with respect to this limit then it contains in the stable locus of a nearby ample line of a nearby ample polarization Lt which is contained in the semi-stable locus with respect with respect to Lt, which is further contained in the semi-stable locus with respect to L0. So this is the result. So, this is the result for t larger than zero and for t larger than zero, but very close to zero. So, basically, the theorem basically tells us that if the ample line bundle, if the g-linearization deforms, let's say this is zero, this is one, we only consider a neighborhood of zero, then the stable locus or semi-stable locus with respect to zero could be something like this. And the stable locus or semi-stable locus. And the stable locus or semi-stable locus with respect to a nearby polarization could be something like that. So when the line bundle specializes to L0, the semi-stable locus can only become larger, and the stable locus can only become smaller. So this is basically what the theorem states. So classically, I'm sure you all know that the classically, this is the theorem of Tadius and Dogachev and Hu. Tadius and Dogachev and Hu. So classically, this theorem of Tadius and Dogachev, Dogachev and Hu, if everything is ample and S is a point, then the similar statement is due to these people. So this is really just a small generalization of their classical result, which precisely fit in the situation that we want to use. fit in the situation that we want to use. Okay, and I also need to say that since L0 is not assumed to be an ample line bundle, you might want to ask what I mean by the stable locus or semi-stable locus, right? Because usually when we do GIT, we need to have an ample line bundle to talk about stable locus or semi-stable locus. So here the stable locus or semi-stable locus should be understood as the numerical stable locus or numerical semi-locus Numerical stable locus or numerical semi-stable locus. Namely, we collect all the points that satisfy the Hilbert-Manford criterion. So, so these are the stable locus or semi-stable locus with respect to this not necessarily ample line boundary L0. So, this notion is defined by the work of Carlina, Martin, Johnson, and Laza. So, they introduced this notion of numerical stable locus and numerical semi-stable locus, which is exactly what we need in the statement. What we need in the statement. Okay, so now based on this theorem, we can finish our last step in the argument. So we want to show that the stable locus and semi-stable locus in the relative Hilbert scheme H with respect to L infinity actually are the same, are the same as the stable locus or semi-stable locus in L. Or semi-stable locus in H with respect to L T. So this would be the last step. So step four. Step four. The most important thing in step four is to observe that as the as the notation suggests notations suggested, the limit of L K is actually L infinity. So we have constructed, we have So we have constructed a series of line bonds, a series of ample line bonds LK, right? And then we constructed a semi-empole line bond L infinity from a completely different way. So the most important thing is to realize that the limit of these LKs is precisely L infinity. Then we can use theorem 4 to relate the semi-stable locus or stable locus with respect to the two groups of line bundles. So the theorem 4 tells us that the theorem four tells us that uh tells us tells us the following so the uh the limit l infinity the stable locus for l infinity is contained in the stable locus of l t with respect to l t which is contained in the stable in the semi-stable locus with respect to l t which is further contained in the semi-stable locus with respect to l infinity right because when we when the line bundles specializes when the line bundles specialize When the line bundles specialize, we can only have a smaller stable locus and the larger semi-stable locus. So, by the theorem, we do get these three inclusions. But somehow by step three, as you can see, we already see that the semi-stable locus and stable locus agree for L infinity, which means that the smallest one, the largest one are the same. So they are the same by step three. So this immediately tells us that this one should be, all the inclusions should be. All the inclusions should be equal, right? This should be equal, this should be equal, and this should be equal. So, this basically shows that with respect to L T, the stable locus and the semi-stable locus agree. And also, since we know that the stable locus and semi-stable locus with respect to L infinity, they are independent of the scheme structure, and also they are independent of scheme structure. So now we know that these two things are. Things. Ah, actually, what I meant, I already meant L L K here. Yeah, so we know that both of these two spaces, they are independent of the choice of K because they are squeezed between the same spaces, right? So they are independent of the choice of K. And also, whether a point is stable or not is independent of its scheme structure. Yes, so this follows from. Yes, so this follows from the similar statement for L infinity, right? Because we know these two spaces, in these two spaces, where the point is semi-stable is independent of the scheme structure. So they are also, I mean, the same properties is also shared by the line bundles LK. Oh, okay. I guess it's exactly the time. So thanks for your attention.
