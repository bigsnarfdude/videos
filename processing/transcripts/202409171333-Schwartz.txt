Welcome, and I'm happy to be giving this talk today. I gave some thought as to what the best way would be to present to this quite diverse audience. And so as I go along, I'm going to be pointing out the things that I believe are the takehoes. So I want to mention this work is joint work with Naniel Haywigen, who's a PhD student working with me, and also Kevin Church. Okay, so why do people choose not to vaccinate? So I'm going to start with. Choose not to vaccinate. So, I'm going to start with the WHO definition of vaccine hesitancy. They define it as the refusal or reluctance to vaccinate despite available vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy is one of the WHO's top 10 threats to public health. We've heard about it several times before in this conference, so I don't think I need to go too much into it. Just briefly, what are some potential reasons for vaccine hesitancy? They could include mistrust in the healthcare system. Trust in the healthcare system, religious or cultural beliefs, concerns about the safety of the vaccine, or other costs or logistical barriers. So we set off to build a mathematical model that incorporated behavior specifically about vaccine uptake. And we wanted to predict the impact that vaccine hesitancy has on an epidemic, specifically the infections and the deaths, due to the emergence of a novel pathogen. So we just set this up. Pathogens. So we just set this up in the case of the next COVID or the next emerging infection that we see. We had in mind a respiratory infection similar to COVID, flu, something like that. And say that we do have a vaccine for this that's available. Say we have a vaccine that's able to block the infection. So in that case, can we quantify, can we use modeling in order to quantify what the impact will be? And with that, I'd like to kind of pause and redirect. Kind of pause and redirect us mainly because vaccine hesitancy. We kind of know what's going to happen here. It's going to say that we're going to need stronger vaccines and higher efficacy vaccines if we do have a substantial portion of the population that's not taking these vaccines. So it's not really a big surprise what the result would be in sort of a black and white sense. But I want to use the model to quantify this information. And I just want to mention for those of you that don't have a math modeling background the first day, yesterday morning, it seems like a week ago now. Yesterday morning, it seems like we could go now, but yesterday morning, I met a lot of people who are coming from the non-math side. And they had mentioned some maybe concerns about this math conference and perhaps not knowing a lot about math modeling. And so my aim here is to really emphasize what math modeling can do, how it can be used, what types of questions it can answer. And really, my overall goal is to get everyone who's thinking of collaborating with a mathematical modeler thinking of those questions. Mathematical modeler, thinking of those questions. Like, what questions do I have that I would like answered with a mathematical model? And I believe that that is your first step towards finding out who you'd like to work with and what techniques you'd like to use, what modeling techniques you'd like to use. And I think that might be the best way that you can get the most out of this type of conference by understanding what questions you're trying to answer. And so, with that lens, I'm going to go through the rest of this talk saying, you know, we had this question about how does vaccine hesitancy. Question about how does vaccine hesitancy impact an outbreak of an emerging infection, but how can we use the model in order to answer key questions, in order to tell something that we didn't know before? And so I'm going to be showing you how we extract information from the model to give results, hopefully, that the public can use or people can use, or at least we can start to get at how can we change behavior, how can we get at these questions about what really is needed, and how much can we ask of the models and what can we expect from them. And what can we expect from them? Alright, so the goal here was to quantify, and specifically, we'd like to quantify the trade-offs between vaccine efficacy and vaccine hesitancy on reducing the overall burden of disease. And specifically, you know, with any model, my view is the important first step is to ask where are you going? What are you trying to do? What are you trying to get out of your model? So, what can we do with the modeling? What kind of questions do we want answers to that we don't have? Answers to, that we don't have the answers to these questions other ways. What results can we extract? How can we quantify our results? What features can we capture? And what can our model results tell us about the problem that we didn't already know before? So specifically for this project, the questions that we undertook were predicting infections and also cumulative deaths over time with various levels of vaccine efficacy and also vaccine hesitancy at the same time. Also, we would like to use our model to determine which factors are most important. To determine which factors are most important for disease control and how does the basic reproduction number change with variation in these particular factors. And also, we answered the question which class of infected individuals, in our case, we separated the infected individuals into those with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms. So which class of those infected individuals were contributing most to the overall infection burden? So this is an SIR type of model. So we're back to compartmentality. Model. So we're back to compartmental modeling for this part of the afternoon. And so by SIR, there's S, I, and R in this model, okay, but it's expanded and we encompass other populations as well. So we've got S, I, and R, but then we've expanded this to incorporate more. We also have an E class, which is the exposed class. We have the vaccine class, and then we have these three different subgroups of the infected class, those with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms. And we have our little. And severe symptoms, and we have our recovered class here. I'll point out a few other things about this model. So, we have a vaccine given to susceptible individuals at this coverage rate, which is this rate P. And the vaccine has the effect in that it reduces the chance of moving to the exposed class by this vaccine efficacy factor phi. Okay, and so if we think of phi, if it's a perfect vaccine, then phi is going to be one, we'll get one minus one, this becomes zero, and then One minus one, this becomes zero, and there's no transport at all from your vaccine group to your exposed group. But we can have phi be any number between zero and one, even no vaccine at all if we have phi equal to zero. So that's one way that you can think about this. And then the rest, we have progression through the different classes, and we could reach the recovery phase here. Okay, and so this compartmentalized model is then translated into a system of ordinary differential equations. Our differential equations, okay, which we have on the right. I won't go through all the details, and then we have a list of parameters on the left. So these parameters, for those of you not familiar with these schematics and how they work, these schematic diagrams have the little letters over all the different arrows. Each one of those represents a rate. Those are the parameters. Kind of hear people referring to parameters. You're not sure what we're talking about. These are the rates that you get transfer between each one of the compartments. So then these values need to come from somewhere. And these values need to come from somewhere, right? Sometimes they come from data collection, sometimes in the absence of data, then people generally go to the literature and try to parameterize their model using reasonable estimates from the literature. That's what we had done in this case. And so now we have these estimates. And there will be error in these estimates that everyone knows. But these are estimates that we got from looking at the literature and trying to make our best estimated guess about what these values are going to be. Okay, so I think next. Okay, so I think next I have, yeah, oh, so now, importantly, this is how we incorporated behavior into our model. This is, you can think of this as a first pass. We wanted to incorporate it, but there's so many details that we don't know. And there's many of you in this room that are, I would say, a lot more invested and more experienced in taking apart all the different pieces of vaccine hesitancy and understanding the causes and how those behaviors may change or how. Those behaviors may change or how they have changed. We are taking a functional form, and this has been talked about in previous talks in this conference. So, we use a functional form to incorporate vaccine hesitancy into our model. And what we do is we're going to change that coverage rate. That coverage rate, we had it initially as a constant P. Now we're going to change that P into a function of time, and we include our functional form for vaccine hesitancy into that expression. Okay, in our case, we have P of T. Okay, in our case, we have P of T is going to be equal to K, which we define as the proportional per capita vaccination rate times 1 minus psi, which is the vaccine hesitancy rate. So again, psi is between 0 and 1, where 0 is no vaccine hesitancy. So in that case, everyone is taking up the vaccine. When the vaccine hesitancy is, the psi is equal to 1, that means it's complete absence of taking up the vaccine. And we can range anywhere in between that. And then we multiply this also by our susceptibles divided. Multiply this also by our susceptibles divided by the total population size. So that's how we incorporate this into our model. And this is a great, you know, this is a first step. Is there more that we can do and we should do? Yes, and that's why I'm here. That's why many of you are here. But I wanted to let those people who are on the other side know that this is what is meant by when you take a functional form to add something and incorporate it into your model. This is what is actually happening. The other thing I want to mention before I dive into the results is. To mention before I dive into the results, is there's not been a lot of discussion about how to get from that model to the results. So, I just want to mention a little bit about that. So, we parametrized the model by taking those estimates from the literature and giving a value to each one of those parameters. And then, we do use a mathematical approach, which I'm not going to go into now. For those of you on the mathematics side, it is all in the paper, and I encourage you to read it if that's your interest. For those that are not, I left that part out, but um, but then uh, Part out. But then for the results I'm going to show you, we took a simulation approach. And so, what is the simulation approach doing? It's using a computer program to numerically integrate your differential equations. What that's doing is that's taking each equation, which is talking about the rate of change per time, and it's integrating it into, turning it into an equation so you can get your output as a function of time. And then you can use that to predict in any time going forward or in the past what that outcome will be. Okay, and so that's sort of the trick about what we're doing here. Of the trick about what we're doing here, we take our equations, we numerically integrate them, and we have the simulation tell us what our predictions are going to be. Okay, and I'm happy to speak to anyone in more detail about that if that's what you're interested in. All right, and so here now for extracting the information from this and showing you how we can take this model and get information out. So first looking at the cumulative number of disease-induced deaths over 200 days. Now, it may be hard to see. So, the yellow line here is showing when we have an efficacy of Showing when we have an efficacy of once. That's a perfectly perfect vaccine. Okay, the black line at the top is showing when we have a 90% effective vaccine. Okay, and so this allows us to quantify how the efficacy of the vaccine has a direct result on the cumulative number of deaths. Okay, so what we can see here is that a vaccine with a 97.5% efficacy, that's going to be the pink line, there, the pinkish-purple line, second from the top. Okay, that would say. Second from the top, okay, that would save the lives of nearly twice as many individuals compared to a vaccine with an efficacy of 90%. Okay, and a perfect vaccine can reduce the number of deaths by 65% compared to a vaccine with a 90%. So we can use results like this to actually come up with a quantification for how well we predict a certain intervention can work. Okay, thus, high-effectivity vaccines can considerably reduce the disease mortality even when the vaccine The disease mortality, even when the vaccine is assigned to block infection. Now, from that schematic diagram in the beginning, we saw the vaccine was put in right at that first step before you even become exposed. So, that's the vaccine that's blocking the infection. It does not have a result. And once you're infected, does that stop you from seeing mortality? But we see that even a vaccine that is able to only block infection can have a result on mortality. So, next I'll talk about vaccine. This is the when we have vaccine hesitancy. When we have vaccine hesitancy. So now we're adding the vaccine hesitancy into the model. Okay, so we looked at mild, moderate, and severe infections. I'll probably skip over some of these results in the interest of time. In terms of the mild infections, we do find that when hesitancy is higher, we have an increase in infections. That's not terribly surprising, but we can quantify this. The peak of infection drops in half when we have vaccine hesitancy, so without vaccine hesitancy compared to when we do have vaccine hesitancy. Compared to when we do have vaccine hesitancy. Okay, so we can see that the peak of infection, the number of people that are actually getting infection, we can have that if we have vaccine uptake. Okay, looking at the moderate infections, here we notice a very slight shift of the peak to the right. Okay, so we can see that when we have more vaccine hesitancy, we get a earlier peak. Okay, we can shift that a little bit to the right when we have more vaccine update. Looking at the severe infections, we can see that we can compare. That we can compare that to the other mild and moderate infections. I'm sure you can't see the y-axis on each of these, but on the left-hand graph, it's at 1600 infections is the highest peak there. By the time we're at the severe infections, we've got 50. So the scale is quite different. So the mildly infected individuals are the ones contributing most to the infection burden. So that's something that came out of this as well. Also, we could look at the predicted deaths with vaccine hesitancy. I think I'm going to move ahead. I think I'm going to move ahead looking at the time. But also, as you would imagine, then we can see that when we have high vaccine hesitancy, we are going to have more deaths. Okay, and we can quantify what this is. So, about one quarter of the deaths could have been prevented if we had had vaccine uptake. And here's the main result that I'd like to talk about. So, this is giving a heat map, which is weighing the trade-offs between vaccine efficacy and vaccine hesitancy. It's basically answering the question of how. It's basically answering the question of how much of a vaccine efficacy is needed to compensate for the vaccine hesitancy that we're seeing. Okay, and so we've got hesitancy going from zero to one on the y-axis and across the bottom on the x-axis, we have vaccine efficacy from 70% to 100%. Okay, and so what we can see here is that if the efficacy is, say, 70%, then we only can see a 15% reduction with any hesitancy. With any hesitancy, but the higher vaccine efficacy, the more the hesitancy diminishes the return. Okay, and so this is a tool that we can use to weigh: well, how much is this actually having an impact on our results? So with a 95% efficacy, the reduction in peak infections ranges up to only so much, only 45% with the lowest hesitancy. And we can make these types of comparisons with a model and a setup like this. All right, so that is my present. And we can quantify this in a table. Quantify this in the table. I'm going to jump to the end, but there's a lot more results that you can get from such a type of study. There are limitations, which are the assumptions built into the model. It's always important to look at those. Here is a reference for this. I have a poster that I'm going to talk about, an expansion of this, looking at COVID specifically and including vaccine weighting. So that'll be out tonight. And I'll just conclude here saying that by quantifying the model results, we can provide specific guidance. So three examples of that. So, three examples of that are that even vaccines designed to block infection rather than prevent death can reduce mortality. Without vaccine hesitancy, we can see that the infection peak will drop in half and one quarter of the deaths could have been averted. And in terms of the trade-offs, if we say we want to reduce the peak of infection by 40%, well, if 10% of the population is vaccine hesitant, then a vaccine with 94% efficacy is going to be required. If 60% of the population is vaccine hesitant, then even a perfect vaccine would be insufficient. Would be insufficient. So, thank you very much. I'd be happy to answer any questions now or later, and that's it.
