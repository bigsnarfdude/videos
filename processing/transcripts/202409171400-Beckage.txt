Fast and curious overview of the work that our group's been doing. So it's going to be wide but kind of shallow. And that happens to be a glacier melting in Iceland. Okay, so this work started roughly 10 years ago with a group that was funded by CSYNC, Socio-Environmental Synthesis. Socio-Environmental Sentences Center. And it's interdisciplinary, includes social scientists, computational scientists, climate scientists, and psychologists. And what motivated our question originally was in the Earth system and climate models, it's generally a one-way direction where the human influence is determined ahead of time at the static scenarios or pathways, and then it drives the climate models, and you get feedback between the biosphere. You get feedbacks between the biosphere and physical system, but no feedbacks between the human system and the other components. Exception being IAM's integrated assessment models that do have economic feedbacks, but no real socio-behavior come on. And so this is how it would generally work. Have a scenario. It drives things like greenhouse gas emissions, land use, aerosols. That drives a climate model. You get projections. You get projections of future climate change and downstream impacts. Well, we want to incorporate feedbacks between the biophysical system and the socio-behavioral system beyond just economic feedbacks. So our first model, a number of years ago, used a theory of planned behavior, and we used a C-ROADS carbon climate model, and we looked And we looked at extreme events, much like Rebecca's talk. And we had a sensing and forgetting term where events entered memory and then left memory. So it was a process of habituation. And then we had a perceived risk, and that was translated into an attitude and modified by perceived efficacy and perceived social norm. And then that would change the emissions behavior. Change the emissions behavior, and it was a fully coupled system. And so we published that in Nature Climate Change back in 2018. This is some of the social processes, behavioral processes in that model. And the output was average global temperature, and the impact on perceived risk was driven by extreme events, much like in previous. By extreme events, much like in the previous talk. And we had a more explicit model for sensing and forgetting and for events accumulating memory. And then we had this thing that we now call reactivity, which was a functional form relating extreme events to perceived risk. So that was our first attempt at this. Here's just one sample of the results where you have an interaction between, so it's temperature. So it's temperature on the y-axis and interaction between perceived social norms and perceived behavioral control. And depending on the state of those variables, you could get temperature changes as high as six degrees or as low as below three degrees by the end of the century. So things really, incorporating human behavior really mattered and the interactions between social processes that people. Between social processes to be really strong. Okay, so then we developed what I'm calling climate social model two. And we incorporated different processes. Here are a list of the processes. And the second model and these are feedbacks. So, this particular paper was led by Fran Moore, who's an economist, so we had more political and economic feedbacks. Economic feedbacks. So, for example, endogenous cost reduction feedback as technology is introduced and becomes more widespread. There's a feedback that becomes less expensive and some more widely used. So, a number of feedbacks like that. And this was published in Nature in 2022. Here's an example of the kind of results. You see, very different. Very different carbon emissions, accumulated carbon emissions by 2100, depending on where you are in that parameter space. Here are some examples of interactions. So this is credibility enhancing and propensity for individual action. And here, this is a heat map, and it shows the emissions by the end of the century. And so up here, you have a strong interaction between those two components. Another example is if it biases. Another example is if you have bias simulation and have a fixed baseline to what you're referencing as an extreme change in climate or whether you have habituations that your perception of climate is changing over time. As you can imagine, it matters a lot in how people respond. So after that, we wanted to publish another paper looking at this. At this, how you would want to do this by looking at a variety of behavioral theories and also different climate models. And so, essentially to assess the robustness and sensitivity of our results to different theories of human behavior. And so, we referenced this paper by Harold Eister, who later became my postdoc, but was unaware of. Later became my postdoc, but I was unaware of his work here. But it turns out there's a lot of different theories of human behavior. I mean, a lot. I think he categorized like 90 or something. And so it becomes impractical to cover up 90 different theories. And many of them are not quantitative, they're more conceptual. So what we did was we were asked to do a review by nature and human behavior of how to incorporate human behavior. Incorporate human behavior into climate models. And so we kind of stepped back and said that we wanted to generalize these behavior components into processes around cognition, how we process and interpret information, contagion, the spread of information and beliefs through social networks, the social scale, so emergent social structures, and then the different kind of behavioral responses. And so some examples. So, some examples of what these processes could look like: cognition, risk perception, decision-making, habituation, contagion, social learning, social norms, et cetera. Social scale from individuals to nations, international communities, markets, and then behavioral responses that scale appropriately to those different social scales. So, that was our, I'm calling client social model two. We're now working on our climate social model three. Now, working on our climate social model 3, and we've incorporated other processes. We have a very explicit economic model, and we have a risk processing model that incorporates many of these cognitive processes. I'm not going to talk much about that, because Lou is going to speak about that here shortly. But each of these is a placeholder for a sub-model. And so, for example, if you look here at that, this is. If you look here at the risk processing placeholder, and then we have our risk processing model here. Don't expect you to be able to read that. But essentially, this is a visual representation of a set of ODEs where the stock variables are the square and then the circles represent different parameters. Here is a stylized image of what the different processes. Image of what the different processes are. And so salience, bias simulation, habituation, recency, reactivity, and then our state variable of interest is perceived risk. That's what folks use to decide changes in behavior. I think Lou is going to talk about that in more detail. So then I wanted to say a little bit about epidemiology, since this is the focus of this conference, a workshop. It's like many of you. So, it's like many of you, back when COVID happened, you're at home, you pivoted to work on something that you thought would COVID-related, wanted to make a difference and help out with that. And so at the time, I had my daughter, who was in high school, Megan, go out into parking lots of different stores and collect information on whether people were wearing masks, then estimate their Then estimate their sex and age. And then there's another high school student who, I'm Ms. Luckley, who did the same. And so they went out and collected data, and then I analyzed it and wrote the paper. And the basic result was there was very strong sex differences with males generally much less likely to wear a mask. I believe this was, I'm not absolutely sure, but I think this is when there was a mask banded. I'm not 100%. Ask men date. I'm not 100% sure. But males, much less likely, and then there was a strong effect of age, with people over 60 much more likely to wear a mask and comply than younger people. So young males were the least likely to comply with wearing masks, and elder females the most likely. So very strong effects of demography. So the other paper we undertook was an agent. An agent-based SIR model. And what we did was we had a social small world network and we looked at virus shedding and then we looked at basically three different protective strategies, like a global, globally mandated social isolation, so a lockdown, individually initiated social isolation. So if you felt like people around you were sick, then you isolate yourself. Around you were sick, then you isolated yourself. And then a viral shedding, which was proxy for wearing masks. If you wore a mask, then the amount of virus that you're exposed to went down. And so then we incorporate different stages of infection in this model from susceptible, pre-symptomatic, have no symptoms, and your viral local low all the way up to resistant. All the way up to uh resistant removed when you are um either died or or um were no longer and you get infected. And so again, we looked at our regression tree and it turns out wide variety of responses. So I think we have a population of 500 individuals in this model and from 12 to infected to almost everyone infected, depending on where We're in a parameter space. We're interested in looking at thresholds, and so just a few figures from this showing how we look at these data. And so this is a plot, and there's a lot of information in this plot. So on the x-axis is the social distance probability. So this is if there's a global lockdown, the probability of people Probability of people socially isolating. The social distance threshold, which is the size of these points. So small points mean you were very sensitive. And if one person that you interacted with appeared to be sick, then you isolated. Five, you're much less concerned. And so those are the slides and dots. And then the minor viral shedding is given by the color. So wearing a mask, you're going to be down here at a relatively dark color. And you can A relatively dark color. And you can see that as this probability of social distancing decreases, there's a rapid shift threshold where you go to potentially very high, fully affected populations. So that threshold is consistent with a percolation process, which generally around 0.7 or so, you have a percolation through a landscape. Here's another. Here's another same data, just viewed a different way, emphasizing the viral shedding. Again, you're wearing a mask, low viral shedding, low infection rates. As the mask either becomes less effective or for whatever reason viral shedding increases, again you reach a threshold where you get very rapid changes in effective population. Recently, we just received an NSF award to integrate. To integrate human risk perception and social processes into EPI models. And so this is kind of a figure from our proposal where we're going to incorporate cognition and so cognitive processes, social processes, which are basically contagion, and they're going to feedback on policy and general behavior in the context of some form of an SIR model. Here's a more detailed view where you kind of go into those different. View where you kind of go into those different processes, what we're planning on including. Again, it's going to be a system of differential equations, but maybe we'll do some agent-based modeling as well. And I think I have like 30 seconds, maybe. So, here are other considerations: social heterogeneity, networks, or if it's a class. Networks, or if it's a climate model, as Rebecca referred to, mentioned earlier, the spatial structure of where impacts are occurring versus where emissions are occurring, that spatial incoherence can be really important in how the system responds. Cognition and contagion means there's imperfect information, imperfect processing information, and then the time horizons at which the risk from acting or not acting play out, and then what you're Playout, and then what your modeling goal is: is it prescriptive, like what we should do, or if it's descriptive of what you would like to do? So these all matter. We are recruiting a postdoc, so if you know anyone might be interested, reach out to me. And that's the Rockies, much further south in New Mexico. That's outside of Santa Fe. I mean, excuse me, outside of Albuquerque. And quite a bit different from up here. Thank you.
