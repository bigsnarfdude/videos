You caution by the scalar matrices in the general linear group. So if we have here, if we have here an element, so an element inside the image is just a matrix. And since we have that, this is an have that this is an homomorphism so we will have that these two the product of the matrix is equal to some matrix product and scalar and this color because of the associative has to be a two cocycle so and when we have a cocycle we can define the matrix just by doing the following assignment just we in the row p in the column u In the column u minus 1p, we are assigned the value of the cosycle, the two cosycles. And if we have two different elements, two different matrices, so we will have that they are the same, but non-scalar and not trivial, not equal to zero. And if we just do the computation, we can start here and we go to the right, and this is just. We go to the right, and this is just the two cycles, and then this element compared with B. And in the other side, we also do this computation, and we arrive to here. And we just made the equalization, but we arrived at these two numbers, these two co-cycles have to be the same up to some two co-boundary. So we proved that just the multiplicate, this This multiplier is just the two homology with C star coefficients. So the way we see and the way it's really geometric, but it starts with something really algebraic that it was made by a woman that was named Claire Miller. Claire Miller was a student of Spaniard, and she doesn't have too many papers, but this paper is the But this paper is the unique paper in algebraic topology. And they say that the Sure multiplier is this second homology group can be computed in a combinatorial well. And how we compute, yes, well, we take this is the free group on pairs with elements in the group. And you can just send, well, And you can just send this pair to the commutator, and a word in this pair sent to the product of the commutators, and you take the kernel. And then you divide by some normal subgroup generated by four relations that in that time they were called the universal commutator relations. Some universal relation that should be satisfied for any group. Any group. And also at that time, there was some papers that they reduced it to five, and then at the end, they reduced it to four. And in that paper, what Miller proved was that she can able to find a hop formula. And this hope formula is what we know from HOPE. Yeah, it's just the you take a presentation and just you take this quotient by the commutator of the free group, the relations you intersect and then you quotient by the commutator of F F R. Okay and the way I see that pictures really geometric, this I imagine in my head, we will have here in the kernel. here in the kernel sequence sequence sequence of pairs that the product of the commutator is one in order to be closed and how we are going to read this is contravariant here we will have y n y n is going to be the monodromy i'm going to explain what is that of this circle and then x n Of this circle, and then xn is some conjugation, some conjugation you apply to this y, and then you product, and the product is just the product of elements. And well, here we have the first commutator, and so on. We have the product of all the commutators. And since this is trivial, we are going to find that this close. This is the, you can close the surface. And well, this was named in my opinion. Name in my PhD PhD thesis as G coverts. So let me say what is that and what is the mesh, the geometric mesh. A E cover this is something that you can define for any dimension, but it's between two surfaces and you put sigma to sigma prime, sigma sigma prime. Sigma sigma prime. And there are the dimensional closet-oriented smooth manifolds that also we are going to allow that they are not oriented in this talk. And a covernus between sigma to sigma prime is an n-dimensional oriented manifold such that the boundary is just this, this Johnny union of sigma and minus sigma prime that is the manifold with the reverse orientation. And you are going to be able to Orientation and you are going to say that two of the two of these elements are equivalent. You can find a diffeomorphism such as this diagram is commutative. So let's do some examples. The cylinder, but when I say the cylinder, you take as base space the cylinder. And then you imagine, well, what are going to be all the elements that are on the top? And that's when you project, you arrive to the cylinder. Arrive to the cylinder. So, for the cylinder, you just maybe let me start very here. First, you have to say, well, what are the principal diamundos over the circle? Over the circle, if you fix a point on the base space and a fixed point over the fiber, then you can just lift the circle. The lift, the circle itself, and then you can just measure the lift, where you arrive. And this is called the monodromy. And any principle you bundle over the SQL, you can construct an isomorphic type as the following. You take the group product, the interval, and then the two ends are glued. Yeah, choosing a fixed. Yeah, choosing a fixed element x. So the action is just by the right in the second coordinate. And these are all the isomorphic types of principal over the circle. Let's go back. So the cylinder, you have to choose an input, and the input is X. So what is the output? Yeah, the output you can think as you. Thing as you lift the cylinder itself and then you measure the monodromy in the output, and this has to be a configuration of the monodromy that is as input. Also, we have the case of pair of pans, but this is really special because there are principal G-bundles, such as in a G-demon-deformation retract, they are equivalent to principal G-bundles over the waist of two circles. And also, Circles. And also, you are choosing some base points that is in front of the pictures because you can put the base point in the back, but they are related by a cylinder. And they are given just if you choose X and Y as input, the output has to be the product. Also, the disks, because the disk is a contractible space, so the only possibility for So the only possibility for a HG or this is the trivial one. So there are not other, and the monodromy has to be the trivial, the neutral element of the group. And also I want to recall this. I will call trivial monodromy when you have a simple curve in your surface, such as the monodromy is the neutral element. So when you see, when you put in this, then you see the principle. In this, then you see the principal debundo is a trivial bundle. Also, these elements suppose you the base, the base space is a handle body. So, for that, you have to choose if the genus is n, you have to choose a sequence of n pairs, y and y e and x y, such that the product is the monogramy of the only output circle. output circle. Here we have, for example, just is y, you config, you have here the x, x, y, x minus 1, and you produce by y, the inverse of y, and then you have the commutator that. But also there are some homeomorphisms that they live in the mapping lead group, but you can realize by some millier relations. Miller relations, and we're going to just imagine that these are the same, yeah, these are the same, and how you can see that. Suppose you have the usual way you construct the torus, the torus, but here you have a square with a disk, yeah, that you drop it. And then you choose, well, there are x, x, y, y. So first you can glue it the x, but also you can glue it first the but also you can glue it further y so and these are these are the two different uh g coordinates that you obtain and there has to be the same okay so the million relations so the million relations was this uh four uh universal relations that you need in order to obtain the sure multiply so how i imagine is that you can cut over some Could over some trivial monogramy. So, for example, that the first one is that xx is trivial, but how you have xx and imagine as x as a line, but it has to be of trivial hormonal x. So, just you can turn here in the direction that is in the inverse of x, and then you have x produced by x minus 1. So the resultant. So the resultant cure has to have trivial monodromy. And you can arrange this in order to write to here. And you can cut it that. And there is a process of cutting and pasting. You cut, and you obtain two disks, two circles, sorry, and then you paste two disk. And so you have here a sphere. And we know that the principal d-bundled over the sphere are only bundle over the spherical are only the trivial bundle. So you can just arrive here and they are trivial. Also, there is another mean relation that xy, the inverse is just the permutation, the transposition of the elements. And for that, we can just maybe like I can put a picture. Yeah, we have x. have x y and here is y x so the way we read that is we first start with x then y y and then y x and this losses yeah and here we we we can use the old We can use the other, this one, yeah. So is xy. So we have here is going to be here is x. This is y x and this is y also. So notice if you could So notice if you could in this curve, this has to this cancel. So the trivial over this is a trivial monotromy. So you can cut and paste there and then you can glue the two genus in order to obtain one genus. This is just reduce you, this is the reduction of the genus in one. This is the obtaining. This is your thinking, and the two, uh, the rest two uh relations are the same. So you just that this was the third one, you you glue two genus in order to obtain one, and this one just you could you could hear and you reduce the genus by one. And Jan, some assumptions is that um this when we make this exponential is the conclusion. Exponential is the conjugation. Okay. Any questions? No? All clear. In that paper that was mentioned too many times, this is the paper with Emilio Dominguez that was just a research program for the Academic of Science. And he was able to show that the short multiply of Should multiply of abelian symmetric and alternative groups are trivial. The Bogomolo multiply. And really, if we put in another context, this process of cutting by trivial monodromy, you can choose a specific G-compony and could, could bitrivial monodromy. So you will arrive to some set of generators, but you can go in. you can go in through all the G-cover this and you can collect all these generators because that generators they don't allow to put anymore by exhaustion you arrive to something and this you can call it MG yeah yes for this MG so really what we proved in that paper but this is it's not right as a theorem it's just something that was is that the Sure multiplier is some of is some Multiplier isomorphic isomorphic to the Grotendic group of the commutative monoid generated by Mg. It's another way to find it, it's very combinatorial. So in that time, we believed that any group can be extended to a three-manifold if the action is free. And that was called by Eric the free extension conjecture that Rainer. Extension conjecture that right now we know that is false, and we proved as I told you for abelian, deaderal, symmetric, and alternated that it was also known by Rainy Zimmermann for Avalian Dieteral, and that they also proved that the extension is by a handled body. But then Eric came with a conterexample with a group of order 243. That is going to be something in the last part of the talk. Of the talk. And in a paper called Free Action on Surfaces That Don't Extend in Content Rendos, he proved that the free extension injector is false and also that the unitary evenness conjecture is false. And the theory of Eric was that if the sure multiplier is not generated by total classes, it's that one total classes, what we mean is g-cover this, that the base space is a is a That the base space is a torus or a disjoint union of torus. And if G has not spherical groups, two groups, then G affords a free surface axiom that don't extend. Okay, let me explain a little bit what we do, how to obtain that the Bocomolo multiplier is a complete obstruction for extension. Extension. And for that, we find that the Bookomolov multiply was already in the literature. That was something that comes from algebraic geometry. And well, Urban has made really a big motivation for that. And also on that time, we find that there are groups, because the ternary was for odd order, but there are true. For odd order, but there are terms of even order that has no trivial multiply. So maybe they could be extended. And the way to extend it would be is that you have this there, the platonic solid, and you can just connect it by the corners. And in order to arrive to some of these T corners, that could be the generators of the Pogola multiplier. And here is the. Here is just, I put it how to extend the Torah classes. No, yes. So later, Bernardo teaches us some construction from algebraic geometry, the blow-up. And for a real representation, you just construct the blow-up as the total space of the canonical bundle. So I put it here an example. I put it here an example because on that time I didn't see how to unravel the crossing of two lines. And we can see in two dimensions. In two dimensions, just you have the crossing of two lines. Then you just see a little bit closer and then you glue it. What? It was a movie span. And if you just follow here the direction, you arrive to the You arrive to the blue one, for example. We can arrive here, we have the blue one, then you go in this direction, you arrive to the red one, and when you arrive to the other side, you see that they don't cross. But the problem here is that in two-dimensional, this is not orientable. But in three dimensions, when we do the blow-up in three-dimensional table, so really, when you have Really, when you have some fixed point just inside of this platonic solid, the fixed point disappears. So what we arrive is that the only isotropic groups are cyclic of the edge groups of lines. And that says the theorem is that if a G is a finite group with free action over a closed orientable surface, this action extends. Surface, this action extends to not necessarily free action over a tree manifold if and only if the class in the Vogomolov multiply is trivial. In other words, I name as this, the Vogomolov multiply is a complete obstruction for extension of orientable free surface actions. So that was my motivation to make the non-orientable case. Orientable case to define as that as the complete obstruction. So, well, let's go. How to find the Bogomolov multiply for non-orientable free surfaces? Well, let me just make an algorithm. What we did is that the Ture multiplier can be given by the Miller relations. Then we see that they have different interpretations. We have the homological, the co-homological. The homological, the co-homological, the Bourdin's interpretation, and we have this with the paper I made with Emilio that our closed G covers could by trivial monitoring. So also we see which are the classes that could be extended and we see that they are the total classes. Just a cylinder, you copy the action until you arrive to radius zero and then you glue it so they can be extended. It so they can be extended, and then you just make the Vogomodo as the quotient of that. And we are we put the singular extensions, you apply the blow-up, and you arrive to non-singular. That was the graphs that Eric paint, and you just arrive to a disjoint union of circles. So in the non-orientable case, We have to find what are the all the relations for closed G coordinates. If you have a G cover this, but in the non-orientable case, you have to cool by trivial monodromy, and then you have to find the relations. But this is by exhaustion. And the fine, I call it NG because now in honor to the unoriented vertice, it's all this is the non-oriented. So this is the non-orientable Sure multiply. We have to find the Miller relations. Also, we are going to show that this non-orientable Shure multiply has some formula. And this was made by Gustavo. He found that this can be isomorphic with the two cohomology group with F2 coefficients. So very easy. And then we find the extendable element. Then we find the extendable elements, and the extendable elements are the total classes, but also the same idea for total classes can be works for climb bottles. Yeah, just you glue it with the reverse orientation. And also, there are some extendable elements. We have here a non-extensible element because in dimension to the unorientable this is not trivial, it's theta two. So we are going to throw to the garbage. We are going to throw to the garbage that that element, yeah, and these are all the elements that is the trivial that they define by with the trivial monogramy. The other ones are the projective spaces labeled by x, but with x of torsion 2, but not trivial. And I'm going to say how to extend that elements. Okay, and then Okay, and then since we throw out this element, this really makes easy all the Miller relations. And then we have to find an additional process because we find that there are some singular surfaces that cannot be thrown out by the blow-up construction. They remain fixed. So we have to do another thing. And this I call unfold. I call unfold that is that's the orientable double cover, and so we find with the same the isotropic groups are only the cyclics and the diedras. And then we also have to kill all these type generators, but they extend, so there are no problem. The Miller relation are these seven relations. Yeah, so let me explain how we find that relation. Also, we don't know if there are, they can be reduced to lower than seven relations. So, this is just by exhaustion, we do all the possibilities and then we write, well, this is so first, observe the first one. The first one is a multiplicative, very, very nice property of, and also, I think I have to go further. Yeah, these are the notation. The notation are this. The notation are this. I'm going to be the these pairs are for the torus, these pairs for the climb bottles, and this just uh set with two parentheses are the elements associated to the projective spaces. Yeah, the four ones that work for the oriental would also include that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is, yeah, we cannot uh have those four, and then you need to have yeah, that one, yeah. Yeah, that one. Yeah, I did a dollar calculation. I cannot arrive with that. And also here, we have two different for the handles, we have two different geometric models. And also for the handles, the not orientable handles, we have two different notations. This is y prime, x prime. So you have to change this sometimes. This is something. This is something that helped. Okay, so let me say for here, yeah, one that this is one is the projective space with trivial monogramy. So it's the trivial bundle. And this is represent the trivial bundle. And we know that the Klein bottle is the connected zone of two projective space or two. two projective space or two mobius band so is the connected zone of two projective spaces so we we want this property this is this is the tick theorem that and this is that x x y is divided by x the projective space of x and y so we assume that property is what we want and then And then we are going to call this the non-orientable commutator. The non-orientable commutator is because there are not too many parentheses. So this is x, x minus y, y. And suppose that is trivial. That means that you can close your client bottle. Client bottle. So when you do that, if y is trivial, then you can quote it and you obtain a principal debundle over RASFER. So this has to be trivial. So if that is, if y is trivial, then you obtain that x1 is trivial. And with that property, we say that x, x minus 1 is 1. So we have that the inverse of the projective space is just to put the inverse inside. So we have another Klein model, but suppose now that X is trivial. So if X is trivial, then X is the monodromy associated to this, the boundary circle of the Mobius band. So one of them keeps the Y. Keep the y and the other not. So here you arrive to that if x is one, you arrive to some trivial bundle connected with the predictive space associated to y. So if one is not trivial, we can, the calculations are really a mess. So we say, well, one is one. Yeah, you don't consider. And with that, And with that, that's you said you're throwing out the trivial the RP2s with the trivial bundles, so that's exactly this. Yeah, interesting, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're not okay. Another relation that with that, we have this one and also, no, another is climb plus client. Is climb plus climb is a tortoise, you can see here. The left part is a climb bottle, and you uh connect it with another climb border, but it's if you twist and twist, yeah, then you have a torus. So this in terms of my generators are that xyz minus one is equal to the product of two claim bottles. And with that, we can arrive. With that, we can arrive, we just make some calculations. And if x is equal to one, y is equal to x, and z minus one is equal to y, we arrive to this equation that the torus is this, and this is just this identity. That usually the torus is not the connected zone of three projective space. Of three projective space, but since we are throwing the trivial one, so they have to be in my magnotation, no? Okay, so we have then three, two, and four. And we want to get one. So there are two relations that you can find from this. Find from this that is this and this. And just it's very easy. This is a product of three predicted spaces. You can choose one, the last one, and you can put it here. And that is just this one. And with that, you can just use it with this element. And this say that this is equal to this. And they say that the product of two. Say that the product of 2x is x squared. So we have the first one. Okay. And the others, well, the others is, there are just climb plus torus is climb. Climb plus climb is climb. And putting by here, no? Kutin by here. So we have this one and this one and this orientable relation we cannot find. Relation: We cannot find it. So, at the end, we added, and thus, there are the seven relations for the Miller relation in the non-orientable case. This one is that the Taurus plus Taurus equal to Taurus. Okay. And well, this is a challenge because we really we tried to prove it because at the beginning, we saw some papers of client TQLT and there are some relations that in order to define. In that, in order to define a climate from English algebra, so in the G context, and there is some commutation between two projective spaces, and this is this, yeah, but we cannot prove that one. We know that it's true, but it's really difficult. It's a no mark cannot do it, and Mari is really good. So the definition definition, the definition of the non-orientable short multiply is discussion. The kernel, and this is another type. This is the free group generated by pairs of totals, client bottles, and projective spaces. And you question this is SG, you arrive not to. S G, you arrive not to the commutation, you arrive to the subgroup of squares. So, and this is the definition. So, some calculations, your calculations for C, the perfect group in one generator, we arrive to zero. And this is just an easy calculation. We have here that the torus with in that element, there are trivial. This is a Elements that are trivial. This is a consequence of the orientable relations. But then we can check the clients, the claim bottles. This is an X. Only I that one. That one is an X. So you arrive that they are same as the projective space. And so you can just check it only for the projective space. And then they have to be elements such that this, the exponent product by two is one. Product by 2 is 1. If x is not trivial, then this exponent has to be trivial. So the only is that for n odd, i odd in Paris odd, sorry, and for n even we have one generator given by the divided by two. So in the In the normal true multiply, this is trivial, but here we have a non-trivial element. For the deadral, Omar will talk about why is in odd case just one generator. In the even case, there are three generators. It's not so easy, but when Gustavo, he will prove that we have only the homology with F2 coefficients. with f2 coefficients just doing universal coefficient is really easy to do that calculation so and also this is something that you can it's really easy to to see that the the sure multiply in the non orientable case for the deira group is a generated multiplica generated by these elements if you choose this presentation with c this is the the rotation Rotation, rotation 180, I think. But notice that they are only projective spaces. Okay. And the homology and homology interpretation, this will be the talk of Homer, the next one. And the homology and comology interpretation of the Sure multiply is this is the usual hope formula for the sure multiply. And for us, you make the square of the three elements, but you have to coefficient by the square of the relations. And there is an isomorphism of the sure multiplying with the two cohomologies with F2. With the two homologies with F2 coefficients, that is the talk of Gustavo. Okay, so okay. But then I'm going to talk why is a complete obstruction, the coefficient by some extendable element. So maybe I'm going to talk first of this construction. The unfolding construction is just you take a G cover this over a surface, and we consider this surface could be orientable or not orientable, but there is a but there is a unique construction called the orientable double cover that is just to take the fiber over the two or the two possible orientations this is a unit construction and the unfolding of a g cover is the j coverance class of the pullback under the this projection so we find in some paper of clientic In some paper of client TKFT, that this is not only a construction, that this is a funter. It's a foul that you have the client cover this category. So you can start with this young union of circles and the coverings, the morphemes are coordinates of non-orientable surfaces. And there is a fontor just given by the orientable double cover to some category is to sync cove where the objects are one manifold with an orientative. one manifold with an orientable reversible orientation exchanging the exchanges the two the two sheets and the the morphins are compact orientable subspaces with a fixed point free involution that orientable reverse and these are in some morphines you just take the inverse is just given by the quotient and the equivalent version uh here we have an example uh how to find the mode How to find the Mobile Street? You just take a cylinder and then you choose an involution and you just identify these two lines. And this is something that we did when we construct the Mobius band from the projective space and you could inside a disk, and this is just. Disk. And this is just, yeah, maybe it could be a picture would you have here the project is pay. And here inside, we have some boundary sequel. And this is the same. This is the same on that. So suppose there is a closed neural interval surface S in this Commodus category, but this is. But it is bounded by a three manifold. So we only have to take also the orientable double cover. And the orientable double cover satisfy here is because also you are taking circles as your objects of your category. So you will have that the boundary of this orientable double cover has to be the orientable double cover of X. So we asked, did this also satisfy for the This also satisfies for the G-carbon G-equivariant case, and this is also the same construction. We have a category 2K cofg and also T-C and COPG, but we have here that they are provided by principal G-bundles over the sequel and principal G-bundles over the surfaces. And here, there are also principal G-bundles over closed one-dimensional manifolds. And there is an orientation reversing. orientation reversing involution on the base space, which commute with the action when you extend it to the total space. So indeed what we have here is an action of G cross theta two. And the G cover this is the same case. You have over a compact, this is orientable surface with fixed 0.3 involution. With fixed point-free involution orientable reversing on the base space could commute with the action. And suppose also that you have a G cones over a closed surface. So we have here a principal G bundle, and this extends to a tree manifold with a principal G bundle that is X M. So we have that the boundary of X is P, and they match the axiom, and also the boundary of M is S. So take the pullback by Take the pullback by the non-orientable double color, and it's the same, the same construction. This you can just construe by the pullback construction, and this satisfies that the boundary of Q, T-R, is P is the double cover. And so the unfolding construction, just send all that you can have fixed surfaces to something. fixes or faces to something that only you have physic graphs. So let me tell you about who are the extendable G coveries. We have the torus, that is something that is still inside and you copy the action until you have already zero. And also this construction also works for the climb borrows, as I told you before, but for the projective space with X, a torsion two element, but not Torsion two element, but not trivial. So, since it's not trivial and the torsion is two, then when you leave the client, the module strip, you have to twist two times. But as you twist two times, this is a cylinder. And when you glue a disk, you arrive to the projective space, but in the top, you have two disks. So it's a Yeah, so it's the order divided by two spheres. So you can just fill it in the same way. You just is this is an onion, an onion with the same action until you arrive to some fixed point in the top. So this shows that the project, the elements associated to projective spaces are trivial. They are extendable. So. So the definition, definition, the non-orientable Vogomolov multiplier, and then since I changed M to N in the Shur multiplier, I changed B to C in the Bogomolo multiplier, but not by Carlos. It's because it's the next word, it's the next letter. So you have to divide N G. you have to divide NG by the torus, the climb bottle, and the projective spaces such that all that one has to be trivial. So what we proved is that a free action of G over a non-oriental space different from the trivial bundle. This is important because that is not extendable. Extend to a non-Sarale free action over a three-manifold if and only if the element If the element in the Bokomolov multiply non-orientable case is trivial. So we define the Boca Multra as the complete obstruction. So let me give you an example that is trivial and an example that is not trivial. So this was two examples given in the paper ASU with Bernardo, Andres, Eric. And this was the The some group in order 64 that was in the same isoclinic class, that is just the semi-direct product of the cyclic group of eight order with the quaternions. And we have this is the representative of the Mogomodel multiplier in the orientable case. It's just a product of tutorials. Tutorials, yeah, that you cannot find a curve inside that has trivial monography, you cannot cut in the orientable case. But if you could into projectives, you can prove it that this is trivial in the sure multiply, in the non-orientable case. So I cannot finish the calculation if this, if the non-orientable Bogoman multiply is not trivial. I don't know. I don't know. What I proved is that the mesh of the orientable vocal multiply is trivial inside the other. And the next one is when we have to do something. This is the first example of the ERIX example, that example in 243 that has this presentation. And the Voccomolo, the generator of the Vogomolov. Of the Vogomonov is that one. So with GAP, you will other, so don't have two torsion. But with Sage, you can prove that all the clients borrowed are of this form. So remain that. There is this result by Bogomlo and Salman that tells that the Bogomo. That tells that the Bogomolo is the intersection over all the Abanian groups, but you can do an additional step. This is something that is in the paper of Salman in Journal Algebra, that you can only consider abelian subgroups of rank one and two. And what are there? They are the cyclic group or the product of two cyclic groups. The way to prove that The way to prove that in our content, in our geometric context, is because, well, I can say in words, Gustavo will prove that when you see what is the connection between the homology and the homological interpretation, it's not trivial. You have to do some dualization. There are some duality between the hope formula. Maybe I can put it here. We prove that the two cohomology of G, and let me put it with these coefficients isomorphic to the sure multiply. It's just and star for dual for the duality. So instead of to talk about elements in the Sure multiply, we can talk about dual elements and the characteristic class associated to that elements. So, if we want to prove that some element is not trivial, we have to check that this cannot be written as total classes. So, this formula, then you have to check that they cannot be restricted to absence of groups of rank one, but rank one, they have trivial short multipliers. Sure multiply. So you just cannot consider. But the trivial two, you have to consider. Yeah. And this is a formula also you can find in for a cyclic group. This is equal to the tensor product. And the way to here, you can go to Here you can go to the m here, yeah. If this is a subgroup, yeah, this m and the way to to send that is x tensor y, you send it to the class of x, y. So at the end, it's just a problem of to find that its own function is one or zero. Zero. So in the non-orientable Bogomolov multiply, there is also the same formula, only we have to take care which are these groups. The first one, gamma one, is the same. It's the abelian subgroups of rank one and two. This is the abelian quasi-commutator subgroups of rank one, two. I'm going to stay quite in sigma gamma three. Gamma three is the subgroup, the abbion subgroup sub torsion of torsion two. So we know that this has no torsion two. So we can erase this. And also we can erase this because all the odd cyclic groups has three trivial non-orientable turbulent. So only we have to check it here. And there are the following groups. There are the groups A. is equal to one. The Klein borrows. But we say, we show that they are not possible. They are only possible these elements. There are also cyclic odd elements. cyclic or odd elements. So this also is going to be an example in the non-orientable case. And I want to end the talk with some questions and also a comment on boardings is that we can prove this is just the map that go from the orientable boardings to homology that we know that is an isomorphism, but this is a map from if we A map from if we see the boardings, the map from the unorientable voltage, this is it was proved by Tom that it's surjective to C ta2. So, and the kernel is C ta2 also. So, what we what we have here is that the unoriented is related just by the is the sure the normal interval sure multiply plus theta two. Okay, and then some questions so do. Some questions. So, Dolt prove the following model form for the orientable form. So, what is the corresponding model conjecture? An unitary evenness conjecture, but that we I think is false again. Yeah. But if we have that something is not trivial for the non-orientable Bogomultiply, then this will imply a conterexample. So that could. A conterexample, so that could be a good way. This is something that is in the direction of Bernardo. And also, here I want to add that maybe we can check the topology of the extensions. The extension, maybe there could be also say that if there are non-orientable handle-body extensions, this is a question for Sophie. For Sophie. Well, we have all this construction that we know the netter problem that if for a faithful representation this is rational, then if the Bogomola multiply is not trivial, this gives a counterexample. So what is the non-orientable network problem? I don't know what is birational in that context. Maybe it's trivial. I don't know now, nothing about that. And then a question for Carmen, Julia, Rene, and Laura is that, well, we know that the SK group in dimension two of VG is the Vogon multiply. So, and I forced you to read this paper by Andrest of Ceta key stratifies. I think it's something we have only to do Ceta coefficients with Ceta2. But what is the non-orientable SK2? Non-orientable sk2 bogon multiplier that is p zero, but remember not for Carlos, and that's all. So, any questions in the Zoom audience? So, any questions or comments? Um yeah, so my question is you showed us a bunch of volations. So how do you know that's all of the valations the relation is by exhaustion you you consider all the cases all the connection between Toru Klein Klein Torus with the same with the same idea on Miller With the same idea on Miller. But how do you know, like, how do you know you don't have really long relations that involve like 10 different surfaces? No, no, because, well, you have the action on the mapping like group, so you at the end, you can just put it in connect by two. Yeah. Okay. And then also, I guess I'm a little, so this theorem, you say that the action will extend. The action will extend if and only if this class is non-zero. But I think there's something missing there, right? Because you've thrown away the trivial bundles in RP2. So, right, if the class is zero, what could happen is it could be bored into the trivial bundle in RP2, right? And I'm a little. Maybe, well, maybe we have to change to something that is not bored onto that node. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have to correct that. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. We have to correct them, yeah. Yeah, thank you. So, you have a question or a comment? Well, Carlos, thank you very much, and let's
