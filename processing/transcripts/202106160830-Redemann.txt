So, the next talk is by Stephanie Redeman from the University of Virginia. Okay, yeah, thank you. So, can you all hear me? Okay, just a disclaimer at the very beginning. So, I am a cell biologist by training. Okay, and so I'm not, you won't find a lot of Not, you won't find a lot of formulas or anything in my talk, so it might be slightly different. Also, please feel free to just interrupt me if something is not clear of what I tell. Yeah, just during my talk, ask me a question, okay? Or if it's too fast or too slow, just let me know. I feel like on Zoom, there's always the feedback missing of the other people because you kind of don't see them. So please, if there is anything wrong, just let me know. Okay. Yeah, so I assume you can. Yeah, so I assume you can all see my presentation. Yes. Okay, so I'll talk about metlotic spindles in 3D, and I'm going to try to give you an overview of what we do. And I hope that you can maybe see and identify things that might be of interest for you or that you think you could help me to understand what we are interested in. Okay. And so, in general, in my lab, we are interested in understanding how spindles. How spindles form in mitosis and meiosis. And you can see here three examples where you have a so-called mitotic spindle that's needed to segregate chromosomes, right, during mitosis and meiosis. And they are formed of mycotubules, which are polymers that during their lifetime constantly form and then they fall apart and they reform. So they are highly dynamic. Nevertheless, the structures of these assemblies that self-form are always very much alike. Very much alike. There's very little variation. And you can see here, for example, if you look, this is a spindle in frog extract. These spindles, even though every building block constantly turns over, yes, they can persist over many, many hours and maintain their shapes and their overall properties. And so we are really interested in understanding how these mycotubals, together with other components, can assemble spindles, right? So it's just a visualization. You can see you have microtubules, chromosomes, those would be. Mycotubus, chromosomes, those would be centrosomes, and then you have a lot of cross-linkers and motor proteins, and all of those have to work together to always form this bipolar arrangement of a spindle that ultimately can segregate chromosomes. And so as we want to investigate this spindle microstructure, you can see again, this is just showing you different data that's out. So this is expansion microscopy, so that's already very high resolution. Very high resolution. You can see chromosomes here, the mycotubals. And in red, you can see little areas where chromosomes, where mycotubules attach to the chromosomes. And this will be important later. If you look in the textbook, you can also see that you have these spindles and they're composed of mycotubules, which are kind of separated also in different classes according to their interactions. So you have astromicotubules that go and grow out to the cell cortex. You have a microtubular organizing center that makes microtubules, and then you have so-called kinetocoa microtubules that attach to the chromosomes, and then there's interpolar microtubles that kind of grow in that direction and possibly interact with each other. We're going to look at in the C. elegans embryo to understand this. And so, here again, you can see this is an embryo that goes through the first. Is an embryo that goes through the first division. Mycotubules are in grain, chromosomes are here in magenta, right? And you can nicely see how these chromosomes are segregated, and then the cell will split into daughter cells. So this is our model organism. And because I told you I'm really interested in understanding ultimately the mechanics of these assemblies, what we need is a really high resolution to study this, right? And so the image you see here is what you can conventionally get out of. You can conventionally get out of lead microscope, but you can see it's really hard to see individual microtubles. So, what we need is really a scenario where I can see every individual microtubal. I can see where it comes from, where it goes to, and who it interacts with, right? And in order to get to this structure, we use a technique that's called electron tomography. And just briefly, what we do is we can use really high pressure and rapidly phrase our samples. And rapidly freeze our samples. So it's a pressure of 2000 bar. And we freeze the samples with a rate of 20,000 Kelvin per second. And so that allows us a so-called vitrification. So there's no ice crystals, nothing. And we have a really nice structural preservation. So you can see this here on this image. I hope you can all see my mouse. In comparison to chemical fixation, where you don't have that nice preservation. We then later do a process that's called free. Do a process that's called free substitution. So we remove all the water, we add fixatives, and we ultimately put our samples in plastic. You can see this here. And then we cut the entire cell in little sections. You can see this here in this cartoon. And we basically have to collect every single section that contains the material. And then we take this to the electron microscope. And I told you we do a special technique that's called tomography. And this is slightly different from conventional electron microscopy in the sense of that we have a thicker volume. So we have a 300 nanometer volume that we stick in the electron microscope. And then just like if you go to the hospital and you have a CT of your brain where the camera rotates around your head, we stick the sample in and we rotate the sample in this electron beam and we basically acquire images from different orientations, which in the process called back projections are brought. Projections are brought into a three-dimensional volume. And just to imagine, you can see here in B, yeah, like a so-called tilt series. So these are images from different orientations. And in C, it's actually the same data set, but now we have aligned those images to obtain a three-dimensional volume. Yeah, so if we do this for our sample, you can see this is a tomogram, it's called, of a C. elegans spindle. You can see these are the chromosomes. They're a nice. You can see these are the chromosomes, they're nicely aligned. Now, spindle poles would be here, and these are just all sorts of vesicles. And because a spindle is a larger three-dimensional structure, we have to have a larger number of sections, so in this case, about 24, to cover the entire area in Z. And so, after that, we use a special software, which is called Amira, that allows us to segment out the microtubles that build the spindle. And it does it by taking a template cylinder. does it by taking a template cylinders that has the same diameter of the mycotles and it looks in every voxel if it can find this template and then it looks in surrounding voxels to see if it can find a continuation and so this gives us a model of these micotubals you can see this here those are all the green lines and we can do this for every tomogram and then we can use the same software to actually stitch it across z so by stitching i just mean we combine this one micotubal here to make it one microtubal Mycotubule here to make it one microtubule and not like multiple shorter ones. We can also add other features. So you can see this here: magenta again are the chromosomes, and in blue, do you see the nuclear envelope? And so once we do this, you can see this is an example. So this is now a complete reconstructions of every single microtubal that has made the spindle. So you can see those are here in green. And then you can see those are the chromosomes that are nicely aligned in the center of this spindle. This spindle. And you can also see here in orange, I have labeled mycotubals that specifically contact the chromosomes. Right here, they're highlighted again. And so for me as a cell biologist, this is, of course, really amazingly pretty. I guess what I had underestimated is the difficulty of now retrieving any meaningful data out of these reconstructions, right? Beyond just looking at it. And so, as I pointed out earlier to you, there's a lot of As I pointed out earlier to you, there's a lot of textbook images where you can see mycotubals that are classified in different groups. This is something very simple we could do. And so we just started to see, can we actually find those different groups people have described before? And so again, those were the astromycotubes that grow out to the cell periphery, the kinetic microtubules that attach to the chromosomes, and the spindle microtubles that kind of grow in this direction. And of course, And of course, we don't have any labels for this. So at the end of the day, we have to define who falls in which group, right? And so spindle mycotubles, for example, are defined by being localized in a certain conical region here. Kinetochormyotubles are defined by making contact to chromosomes. And again, we had to even define what does it mean making contact. So we settled for a distance of 250 nanometers based on. Nanometers based on features we can see in the electron tomography. However, as there had not been any comparable data, a lot of this is up to our definition. And so what we find is that the spindle seems to be composed of 20,000 microtubules on average, so that's quite a lot. Out of those, only about 500 are actually those that contact the chromosomes and eventually will facilitate the segregation of the chromosomes. So that seems to be. Of the chromosome. So that seems to be a rather small number. The next thing we could do is just look where microtubules attach to chromosomes. And so in mammalian cells, this kinetical region, so that's where the mycotubal is attached to on a chromosome is just a single small locus on the chromosome. You can see that here, right? Like if we draw the chromosomes, this X in the middle is the centromere. In C. Here in C. elegans, this region is spread along the entire surface, and so, of course, you can ask yourself: like, does this mean all the microtubules are equally distributed, or are there maybe hotspots? And so, another very simple thing for us was to look at the distribution of where microtubules arrive. And this is shown here by these little dots, and also like how evenly spaced out they are on the chromosome. And what we see is that if you look at the kinetic market. If you look at the kinetica microtubles per chromosome and the area, that there is a strong correlation that the bigger the chromosome, the more microtubules you can find. And what we also found is that there doesn't seem to be any preferred spacing. So all these different colors are different data sets we reconstructed in different cell cycle stages, so metaphase and anaphase. And so in all of these, you can see that there is not a single preferred distance suggesting that chromosomes are just. Suggesting that chromosomes are just, mycotubles are just really randomly attaching to the chromosome surface. The next thing one could look at is the length distribution of mycotubules. And so I mentioned earlier that mycotubals are dynamic polymers. So they, in their lifetime, they polymerize and then eventually they get very long, they start to depolymerize. And so that basically leads to an exponential length distribution. So you can see this here. And again, colorful. You can see this here, and again, colorful is our data. And so, because they grow and shrink, right, you obviously always have a lot of short microtubules and the probability for longer microtubules is lower. However, so we did this for the spindle microtubules and we see we have an exponential length distribution. If we do this for kinetical microtubles, we see that that is not true. Yeah, so this is a much more uniform length distribution with a cutoff at With a cut off at half the spindle lengths, okay? So they're not longer. And this for us was very interesting because if you can see this here, and you may have noticed, is that in all the textbook images, these kinetic microtubles actually go back to the spindle pole. However, looking at this length distribution, that can't be true, right? There are many shorter ones suggesting that actually those microtubules are not connecting to the centrosomes. And so because that was new and very surprising. So, because that was new and very surprising, we looked into other things, which I'm not going to show here. But you can basically measure, you can, by light microscopy, detect the growth directionality of microtubules. You can measure their lifetimes. And we did additional electron microscopy of earlier stages. And we were really convinced that in these embryos, the majority of mycotubals is made on the spindle poles. So they would come here, they grow out. They grow out, but then eventually they're not connected anymore to spindle poles, right? So, this connection is lost over time. And so again, this poses an important question to us, right? So if microtubules are made here and they grow out and then eventually they connect there, what has to happen for them to be disconnected to the spindle pole, right? So something must happen. And so we thought of different hypotheses. Happen and so we thought of different hypotheses. So, one, for example, is as soon as a kinetical microtubule has formed by connecting here, the plus end depolymerizes here, right? So, this end falls apart, but because it's fixed essentially on the chromosome, it will just kind of reel in the mycotubal in that direction. Alternatively, you could imagine that maybe all mycotubles constantly detach from the spindle pole, right? Maybe it's an aging effect. Right, maybe it's an aging effect, they are just released, or only kinetical mycotubals are released over time. And so, this is, of course, really difficult to test. It's impossible to look at this by light microscopy because we just don't have sufficient resolution. It is also very tricky to actually look at it by tomography because it's a static image overall, right? It doesn't really, it tells you it's a snapshot, but it doesn't really tell me what was before or after. Me, what was before or after. And so, for this, we collaborated with a group of mathematicians at the Flatiron Institute in New York. So it's the group of Mike Shelley, you can see him here, and Sebastian Furthauer was really key in this. And so they designed simulations that allowed us to really go through different scenarios, these three different hypotheses, to really determine what is actually going on. And so we have a lot of parameters we can feed, so the nucleation profile. Feed so the nucleation profile means where are those microtubules made in the spindle? So, where do they come from? The nucleation rate. So, how fast do they grow, for example? How fast do they fall apart again? So, this is, for example, the catastrophe rate. So, we have all these different parameters and some parameters vary depending on the hypothesis. And one parameter here, the minus n depolymerization, is something that no one knows really well because it's incredibly hard to measure. Because it's incredibly hard to measure. And so we have just put a number here that, based on literature, seems reasonable. And I'm only showing the successful case here. So I'm not going to show you all the different attempts. In black, you can always see the outcome of their simulation and colorful is our data. And again, this is the length distribution of the kinetico microtubles. This here is the length distribution of the spindle microtubles. This is the minus. This is the minus ends, so it's where the ends of the spindle microtubles were located. And this here is the number of different microtubles subclasses over time because, right, that also has to match. If we only manage to make 100 microtubles, then that model is obviously not correct. And so using the simulations, we could show that, in fact, microtubules are all made at centrosomes. They eventually, if they find a chromosome, become a kinetochromicotubal. Chromosome become a kinetic microtubles, but then they stochastically those kinetic microtubles detach from the centrosome. So, only kinetic mycotubles also are specific. We do not yet know how this happens, and there's different hypotheses. I don't know, I didn't put them here, which could be just because of mechanical forces, right? If you assume these microtubules reach the chromosome, then this NT will continue to grow. We know this, yeah, and so that would, if your N-K. And so that would, if you're anchored on one side and on the other and you continue to grow, you would slightly start bending. And that could be a mechanical rupture. It could also be due to specific enzymes like severing proteins that recognize those microtubules because they are around for a longer time. And so, as I said, we also wanted to just confirm these simulations, whether they are really true. And one way we could do this is a so-called Could do this is a so-called FREP experiment. And once this movie plays again, you will see here a little darker stripe. So we bleach an area of mycotubules. Okay, so it's dark, but the signal will recover and it will recover because mycotubules in this area turn over and new mycotubules grow in. And if we do this, you can see this is the simulation. So if you use the data from the simulation with real data, you can see that there is a very fast recovery here, which is Which is made by the spindle microtubules because they don't attach to anything, they just constantly grow and turn over, and a much slower recovery rate of about 20 seconds, which is by kinetical mycotubules as those are bound to chromosomes and much more stable. Okay, so the other thing is now that we find that kinetical mycotubals are actually not going to the pole, there was another interesting question, okay, because we know that there's really strong cortical forces. Strong cortical forces that pull on these spindle poles. And now, so if the things are not very well connected, right, you may ask, like, why don't you just pull out the centrosomes? And so previously, people believed that kinetic microtubles are just anchored to the centrosomes, but that doesn't seem to be true. And so we wanted to detect the interactions of microtubules. And again, this was not that straightforward for us because there's no data on what is an There's no data on what is an interaction of a mycotubule. Okay, so for example, how close do two microtubules have to be next to each other to even be interacting? What has to be the orientation angle? And also, like, when is a microtubule really bound to the spindle pole? Because the spindle pole is a membrane-less organelle. Okay, so it doesn't really have a membrane you can anchor to. It's just like a larger cloud of some protein. Of some proteins and smaller microtubules. And so we had to define all these parameters. And one way to do this is to just look in your data, right? So, what we did is we looked at the spindles and we picked different distances between the pole and the chromosomes and analyzed distances of mycotubals. And so, what we find is that when we look in this region here, there's not really a preferred distance, right? So, it's kind of variable. Kind of variable where microtubules interact. However, if you look at this area here, 75%, you can see a nice peak here at about 80 nanometer. And so this maybe suggests that 80 nanometer is some sort of a more relevant distance. Okay, so the next thing we did is we chose different distances. You can see this here again, at different orientation angles now, right? So this was this. Angles now, right? So, this was this angle here, and we counted how many microtubules would reach the centrosome, assuming this orientation, yeah, as a connection. So let's say we start here, yeah, so this microtubule would, in our assumption, reach the pole, right? Because it could make several defined connections and it would arrive here, okay? And so, if we do this with different orientations, we can see that like here at 35, 25, and 45, almost 25 and 45, almost all of our microtubles make it to the spindle pole. And of course, we also felt that it kind of matters on how many times you have to connect, right? Because let's say you have to connect 1000 times. It kind of seems a little over the top. But what we find is that most of the mycotubules in all these different data sets needed exactly one or two connections to reach to the centrosome, right? So this one here needs two. It connects here to the kinetical microtubules. To a kinetic microtubule, it connects to one spindle microtubule, connects to another spindle microtubule, and then it reaches the centrosome. And so, as I said before, what we found is that kinetic microtubules come from centrosomes. They are stochastically detaching from the centrosome over time, but they are actually anchored into the spindle network by interacting with spindle mycotubules. Okay, so the entire thing is some sort of network. Is some sort of network, yeah, and it's kind of held together by interactions which could be driven by cross-linkers or dynein, as is here, which is a motor protein. However, it's also totally possible that they're just held together by viscous coupling, right? Because the cytoplasm is really viscous. And if the mycotubes were close enough together, if things move, they would just drag each other along. It's just like if you stick a spoon in a honey jar, you can kind of lift it up as well. Up as well. Okay, and just to say what else we did, and this is just going to be very brief. So then, once we felt like we have maybe some sort of understanding on what's happening between the poles and the chromosomes, we wanted to focus on what's going on between the chromosomes, right? Because this region might be important for chromosome segregation. And so we turned to anaphase, which is the time where chromosomes are segregated. And just to put everybody on the same page. And just to put everybody on the same page here, people have described two different stages of anaphase and two different ways of how forces are generated to segregate the chromosomes. And so one idea is that these interpolar mycotubules here play a role, and the other one is the role of the kinetic mycotubles. And so in anaphase A, what people know is that you have this attachment here of a mycotubal, but it will begin to depolymerize. So you're attaching to it falling apart. Attaching to a falling apart mycotubal, and because this attachment is held stably, you can now move the chromosomes towards the pole. So, this distance here shortens. And then in anaphase B, these interpolar microtubles are sliding by motor proteins. However, this is not that clear, and they push the chromosomes apart. Okay, and so using again tomography, you can see this here, obviously, elegance, and now this is really just. Of C. elegans, and now this is really just the focus of mycotubules that sit between segregating chromosomes and again classified according to their interactions. And now, also in a mammalian tissue culture cell, so this is a Gila cell, we could find that also between the segregating chromosomes, there are subgroups of microtubules that are presumably made there and interact with each other, and that these subgroups, and maybe you can appreciate it here in this video, are actually. Video are actually totally capable of generating enough forces to drive the segregation of chromosomes, right? So we get rid of the poles, and there's this center here, and that can still push chromosomes apart. And so this basically is an entirely new model now, where we propose that these mycotubles in the center, by kind of a sliding mechanism, must generate forces to segregate the spindle. However, we still We still do not really know where forces are transmitted. So, whether they, for example, push on chromosomes, or if these forces are transmitted by interacting with microtubules on the other sides, it's also not clear which motor protein plays a role or if only microtubal dynamics would be sufficient to drive this process. And then, just to say, I mean, all these data can be used for other things. So, we were looking at how centrosomes can make microtubules and figured that. Microtubles and figured that by functioning as a sink and enriching free tubulin at centrosomes, you basically can increase the probability for polymerization by going over something that we call the critical concentration. So this tells us how centrosomes can function as a nucleator. We were looking at the centrosome structure and you can see there are smaller structures, centrioles, that always end up in the center of the centrosome. Of the centrosome. And so we use our data to understand how these little structures are positioned. And so this is done by active droplets. And we could also use the data to look at even higher resolution at the protofilament number of mycotubules, right? So you can see this here. And really try to understand how microtubules of different organisms maybe differ in their protofilament number. In their protofilament number, and thus in their dynamics. Yeah, and so I didn't talk about this at all, but again, we also do this in myopic spindles. Yeah, and so with this, I want to thank all of you, and I'm really happy to take any questions.
