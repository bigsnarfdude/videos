To speak, and in general, for organizing this very nice conference. As everyone else says, it's not the same as being there, but we do what we can. And since this is, I guess, the midpoint of the conference, let me say that I hope that I will enjoy the talks of the second half as much as I have enjoyed the ones that have taken place so far. So, again, as it says on my slide here, everything that I will talk about is joint work with Colin Ingalls and Owen Patashnik. And Owen Atashnik. Right, so one possible motivating question for this talk is a geometric question as opposed to an arithmetic one, namely which varieties can be, in some vague sense, described in terms of curves. So, one way to make that question precise is to say, well, if we have an irreducible algebraic variety over Irreducible algebraic variety over, let's say, an algebraically closed field, can we find curves which I've called C1 up to Cn such that there is a dominant rational map for product of the Ci's to V? That is to say, can we cover V by a product of curves? So the answer doesn't change if we say that the number of curves is supposed to be equal to the dimension of the variety. And since any two curves are covered by a common curve, it further By a common curve, it further doesn't matter if you insist that all of the Ci are actually the same curve. So, you could also ask this question in a more arithmetical way, to which the answer might be different. So, if we have this situation that I've just described in the first half of the slide, where V is covered by a product of curves, then when I look at the Eladic Galois representation attached to V, it is described in terms of those attached to the CI. terms of those attached to the CI. So we could say, you know, for which v can we describe all of the local zeta functions of v mod p in terms of those of the curves which cover which cover v. And so this sounds like a very difficult question to say the least. So you know this is not something that you sit down one day in your study and decide that you're going to solve this problem. It's one of those questions where you try to find small pieces of it that you can solve. So dimension one, of course, is So, dimension one, of course, there's nothing interesting to say. So, we start with dimension two. And furthermore, since I said that I'm only interested in dominant rational maps, that property is unaffected by replacing v by something birationally equivalent. So, we might as well just assume that v is minimal and look through our list of the classification of surfaces to see what types we might want to look at. And so, Sarah. At. And so Serge showed actually that the answer to this question in general is no, the answer to the question of whether the surface can be covered by a product of curves. So his counterexamples were in fact surfaces that are contained in abelian varieties. So I'm not going to get into that. I'm going to start from the other end. We'll start with, well, the first surfaces that you think about are rational surfaces and ruled surfaces. Well, by definition, a ruled surface is birational to the is birational to the product of a curve and P1. So the product of a curve in P1 is certainly covered by a product of curves, namely C and P1. So there's again nothing much to say about this. Excuse me. So let's next look at surfaces of Cordayer dimension zero. So well one such thing is an abelian surface. Well we're over an algebraically closed field so an abelian surface is isogenous to The surface is isogenous to the Jacobian of some curve of genus 2, and that means that the surface is dominated by the square of the curve whose Jacobian we're looking at. If V is a billiptic surface, then again, V is a quotient of a product of elliptic curves, done. If V is an Enrique surface, then, well, probably the place to start, at least for me, is to look at is to look at the K3 surface that covers the Enriquez surface. And that gets us to the fourth case. Well, what if V is a K3 surface? And so people who know me will probably not be surprised to hear that this is the one that I want to look at, since when I get to play with K3 surfaces, I'm happy. So we're going to talk about case four and one particular special family for which my co-authors and I were able to prove that the answer to this question is yes, and also to make some. Is yes, and also to make some more precise statements. So there are, in fact, some K3 surfaces for which it's easy to see that they're covered by a product of curves. And the simplest example here is if we start with an abelian surface A. So as I already said, an abelian surface is dominated by the square of a curve. And if I look at the Kumar surface of A, which is A mod plus or minus one, so A mod the involution. Minus one, so a mod the involution that the negation involution on the on the abelian surface, then that's a K3 surface, and it's a K3 surface that is dominated by the square of a curve. But most K3 surfaces are not Kumar surfaces. Now, in a paper of about 30 years ago, Paranjape gave a rather interesting construction, building on some work of Chad Shane. And I won't describe his construction in detail, but what he ends up showing. But what he ends up showing is that if you take a double cover of P2, well, okay, so a double cover of P2 branched along a sec stick, as Dan was just talking about in his talk, is a K3 surface. And if we specialize the sec stick, not as Dan did to be a diagonal one, but rather to be a product of six lines, so then Paranjape shows that a double cover of P2 that's wrenched along six lines is covered by the square of a curve of genus five. And so, the main goal of this talk is to describe the geometry of a somewhat related construction, one that is inspired by Paranjapis, but somewhat different. And it will give us a new family of K3 surfaces that are covered by the square of a curve. And this will, in fact, give us some maps of moduli spaces, on the one hand, moduli spaces of K3s, and on the other hand, of curves with some additional data. And we show that these maps are all bioreactive equivalences. Russian equivalences. And this is a question that is not discussed by Paranjape, but I would expect that the same sort of methods would apply in his situation. For all I know, the answer is different. And I should mention that this is something that I believe that is being worked on by Noam Elkees and Brenton Hastett and John Foyt, with whom the last is in the audience. So perhaps John will be able to tell us that they now know the answer to this question since we have not studied it. Since we have not studied it. Okay, so to start describing the construction, I want to talk about the curve for which the quotient is going to produce the K3 surface. So we start with an elliptic curve E and some points on it, P0, P1, P2, and P3. We take E3 to be an unramified triple cover of E, and we take D3 to be a double cover. And we take D3 to be a double cover that is branched along these four points. So that's not unique, but we choose, well, neither of these things is unique, but we choose one of them. So D3, of course, admits an involution that exchanges the sheets of the cover. And E3 admits a translation map of order 3. Since we have this non-ramified cover of degree 3, that's the same thing as a 3-isogeny. Okay, so we consider the fiber product C3, the fiber product. Product C3, the fiber product over E of D3 and E3. And well, so Z mod 2Z, as I said, acts on D3, Z mod 3Z acts through E3. So we get the product of those two groups acting on C3. And if we consider the surface C3 cross C3, well, each copy of it is acted on individually by G. And so that gives us G squared actually. So that gives us g squared acting on C3 cross C3. And of course, we also have an involution of C3 cross C3, which I've called sigma here, that just switches the two factors. So I consider the quotient of W not by this whole automorphism group, which would get us down to something less interesting, but rather by the subgroup generated by an automorphism acting on one copy and the inverse acting on the other copy, and also this map that switches the factors. This map that switches the factors, and this is analogous to the group that was introduced by Shin or Shane, I think he pronounces his name, and Paranjape in their slightly different situation, where Ji is a slightly different group. Okay, so I should also say that we have a map from C3 cross C3 to, well, C3 maps to E3, so C3 maps to E3 cross E3. maps to E3 cross E3 and from E3 cross E3 to E3 we have a map called summation. So we have a map from C3 cross C3 to E3 and this in fact factors to W and if you calculate the genus of the fibers of W over E3 it turns out that it is one. And there are some obvious sections as well so that makes W actually into an elliptic surface. And this elliptic surface turns out to have 18 fibers Turns out to have 18 fibers of type I2, at least when things are in general position. There are some special situations where there are relations among the PI that I chose on E to begin with, which cause some of these fibers to coalesce. But in general, W is an elliptic surface with 18 fibers of type I2. And the very nice thing that is mentioned in Pranjape with a proof that I have to admit we couldn't understand. So in our situation, we created our own. So, in our situation, we created our own. It turns out that W has an involution which is called lambda, and it acts on negation, it acts on the base by negation. Remember, the base is this elliptic curve. And then so that means that there are four fibers that are fixed as sets. And you can choose it either to fix one fiber pointwise and act as negation on three, or the other way around. It's better if you choose it to act to fix one fiber pointwise rather than three, because then the quotient. Because then the quotient of w by lambda, which we call k, is again an elliptic surface. So this merges the 18-type I2 fibers into nine I2 fibers. They come into pairs. And the pointwise fixed fiber turns into an I0 star fiber. I will draw the pictures of these later in case you've forgotten what they look like. And if you add these up, well, these each contribute two to the Euler characteristic. 2 to the Euler characteristic. And this one gives you 6. 9 times 2 plus 6 is 24. So the Euler characteristic of K is 24, which you may recognize as the Euler characteristic of a K3 surface. And in fact, that's what K is. So just to say, in other words, we found a map from C3 cross C3 to a K3 surface. So we found that K, this type of K3 surface, is covered by a product of curves. Product of curves. And in fact, the surface K has lots of other elliptic vibrations. So there's one that is perhaps particularly nice because it has three reducible fibers of type I0 star and one of type I3. So I should also have mentioned, in case you're wondering about a possible discrepancy, where here, where was it? Oh yes, so here this only accounts for Picard rank 15, whereas this accounts for Picard rank 16. accounts for Picard rank 16. I should also say that this vibration with an I2 with nine I2s and one I0 star also comes with a section of infinite order as well as a full level two structure. But more about that in a moment. And in fact we can completely describe the transcendental lattice of K, which is the H2 mod, the Picard lattice. And at least if you tensor with Q, it is isomorphic. It is isomorphic to the red square of q root minus three as a vector space over q with a suitable pairing. And I should say that this has to do with an exceptional isogeny of simple league groups of small rank. So to explain my notation here, u is the hyperbolic lattice spanned by two vectors x and y of norm zero. That pair. zero that pair with each other to one. So we look at S U of two copies of that for q minus three over q, and on the other hand to so of the same u plus u. So this minus two in angle brackets means a vector of norm minus two that has intersection zero with all the rest, and similarly for minus six. So this relation of transcendental lattices is connected to this exceptional isogeny here. And again, this is a generalization of something in Prancia's paper. Something in Pranjapi's paper. So, just to illustrate how you pass between the two elliptic vibrations, so here this horizontal black line is the zero section of the vibration with the D4 and 9A1s. This vertical bit consisting of the zero component in magenta and this component, this sort of middle component in light orange, and then these. Light, orange, and then these additional components in green, red, and blue. So then these long horizontal lines are the two torsion sections of the fibration, and this black line is the zero section. So each of these nine things consisting of a vertical line and a squiggle at the bottom is an A1 fiber. So yeah, I've somehow switched from the one notation to the other one. A1 is the same as I2. And on the other hand, the colors are meant. And on the other hand, the colors are meant to indicate the fibers of the other fibrations. So the blue curves here are one of the D4s, the red curves are another one, and the green are the third. And again, these three curves here are the A2 fibers. So this illustrates how, given the one vibration, you construct the other one. And in the other direction, it is a little bit more obscure because we don't have as many vertical curves and you don't have as many sections since the Mordelve group of this one is trivial. Group of this one is trivial. So here I've only shown a part of the construction. I haven't shown the zero section. I haven't shown the zero components of the A1 finance. Okay, so let me mention that this family of K3 surfaces that I've described is related to one that is in the literature already. It is related in particular to a family that has been studied by Garvagnatti and Sarty. So they classified Picarth littes of K3 surfaces. Picard lattices of K3 surfaces that have a faithful action of Z12Z to the fourth. And it turns out that when you look at the quotient of a K3 surface by such a group, you get a K3 surface with 15 ordinary double. And turns out that if you look at the case D equals six of their construction, so for K3s with 15 nodes in P4 and the corresponding covers, that these are over Q at least, the Picard lattices are the same. And that makes it fairly easy to prove that there is a corresponding. It's fairly easy to prove that there is a correspondence between their K3 surfaces and ours. And it really should be possible, although I haven't done it, to prove that there is a dominant map from our K3 surfaces to theirs. That would prove that the K3s and P4 with 15 nodes are also covered by a product of curves. Okay, so I haven't been following the chat. Are there any questions so far? None in the chat yet. I think we've mostly been saving them till after, but yeah, I'll continue that. Okay, so now I want to, so I've explained so far how you get from the elliptic curve and some additional data on it to a K3 surface. So now I want to spend a few minutes talking about how you go in the opposite direction. So K, as I said, comes with this elliptic vibration with nine I1 fibers and the I0 star. I1 fibers and the I0 star, and the I1 fibers come in three sets of three according to their intersections with the two torsion. So, okay, well, given K, I have a point on P1, which is where the I0 star is, and I have three sets of three points on P1, and that gives me not actually, well, okay, I could maybe rigidify it and get a point on M010 bar, but that means instead just say that I'm getting a point on a quotient of that. And well, M010 bar has much larger dimension than. bar has much larger dimension than has larger dimension than the moduli space of these k so there must be some relation among these 10 points and it turns out that what you get is you get sets of 10 points or i guess i should say you get one point and three sets of three points such that there is a map from p1 to p1 of degree three for which the first point is in a ramified fiber not actually the ramification point but the other point in the ramified fiber and then the three sets of three are all fibers so i have some All factors. So I have some notation for the images of these points: p0, q1, q2, and q3. And in fact, there's more because when I have this map of degree three, I also have the other three other points of ramification. And so we'll call those P1, P2, and P3. So now I have seven points on P1, and now things are starting to look better because, okay, seven points in P1 giving me three dimensions. That's kind of the same as the Um, that's kind of the same as sorry, um seven points in p1 minus three dimensions of automorphisms of p1. Um, so that gives me four dimensions. That should be the same as the dimension of a moduli space of k3 surfaces of p1 number 16. That should be the same as a moduli space of elliptic curves with four points. And in fact, we can use these data to recover an elliptic curve and four points on it. So I've found, so I've constructed a map from, so far from a map from the modulized paper. From a map from the moduli space of these Kumar surfaces with the vibration to some sub-variety of a quotient of N010 bar. So now I'm going to go to a cover of M14 bar. So I take, I have these four points, P0 through P3. I let E be the double cover of P, when branched at those four points, that's an elliptic curve. And I have six inverse images of these Qi. And it turns out that if I choose the origin in some sensible way, that I have four. That I have four points on E such that their differences are exactly the differences of plus or minus these three B's. You know, if you count these, it turns out that there are 12 of both of them. And these R0 through R3 are unique up to translation and negation, which is exactly what we want when we're constructing a point on the moduli space M14 bar. And this divisor is principle, which allows us to construct a, which allows us to relate this to a double cover. Allows us to relate this to a double cover ramified at R0 through R3, which was sort of the other thing that we had when we were getting started in this construction. And okay, we also have a triple cover of P1, and its branch points have been taken to be the branch points of a double cover. And that may remind you of what happens to an isogeny of elliptic curves when you pass to the quotient of both elliptic curves by plus or minus one. Now you have E mod E goes to E, so if you look at the induced map, E mod So, if you look at the induced map E mod plus or minus 1 to E mod plus or minus 1, that is a triple cover of P1 whose ramification points are exactly the same as the ramification of E goes to E mod plus or minus 1. And so that means you can pull back the double cover to E, and you get an unramified cover, which is exactly E3 to E that we had before. So there are some ambiguities which I don't have time to talk about today. For example, this vibration on This vibration on the K3 surface was not actually unique. And again, this triple cover is not unique, and the double cover is not unique. And by very good fortune, it turns out that all of this comes out in the wash. As I said, I don't have time to talk about this, but I'll just say we have these three moduli spaces of curves of genus 1 with additional data, K3 surfaces with a chosen vibration, and curves of genus 0 with some rocked points. And there's a With some rocked points, and there's a map from each of these to the next, which is what I've sketched already. And these moduli spaces are all irreducible things of dimension four. And with some careful analysis, you show that the composition of the three maps is identity, and therefore they're all birational equivalences. So in other words, a typical K3 surface of this type comes from a unique curve of genus 7 of the appropriate type. So just to state a few conclusions here. Here. So I like to think about concrete questions like how many points are there on some variety mod p. And what we've shown is that the etal cohomology representations for k are quotients of those for c3 cross c3. So if we understand the local zeta function of C3 at P, which of course may be difficult because C3 is a curve of genus 7, even though the local zeta function will break up somewhat. But if we have such a description, we can use it to determine the local zeta. We can use it to determine the local zeta function of k, although it still might be a bit complicated because we have to figure out which piece exactly it is that we're actually interested in. At a somewhat more highbrow level, this gives us a concrete illustration of some deep conjectures and some deep constructions. And in particular, there is a Hodge conjecture which says that nice cohomology. That cohomology classes should be induced by algebraic cycles. And this was unknown in general for abelian fourfolds of what is called V-type. I'll just say that these are closely related to the prime variety of the double cover of C3 over D3. These are really, we have shown that essentially one particular kind of abelian fourfolds of V type are the prims of C3 over D3. And so this makes this hot conjecture explicit for abelian fourfolds. The thought conjecture is explicit for abelian fourfolds of this type. And there's also a nice, very nice construction of the Kuga-Satake, or maybe better, Kuga-Setake de Linabelian variety, which should be a way of associating, well, okay, it is a way of associating to every K3 surface Nabelian variety. But there is a lot of geometry of this construction that is not well understood in general, and our results clarify it. And also, I should mention, though I'm running out of time. Um, though I'm running out of time here, I should mention that there is also some connection with the ideas of Kalagari on establishing potential modularity of K3 surfaces, since one of his first steps somehow is to relate a K3 surface to an abelian surface or a fake abelian surface, which has to be defined over a totally real field, because that's the only place where you know how anyone knows how to prove modularity theorems. I was going to say we, but that's presumptuous because I don't know how to do it myself. Presumptuous because I don't know how to do it myself. But all of the modularity theorems for abelian surfaces only work when you're over a totally abelian field. And so, if you have a map of moduli spaces of a degree greater than one, then I think that you're stuck before you even start, because you start with a K3 surface and you pull it back to an abelian surface over some unknown field, which doesn't have to be totally real. But if you have a map of degree one, then at least you have a chance. And I also wanted to mention this question. And I also wanted to mention this question of Letterveer, which I've already alluded to. So, Letterveer noticed that all K3 surfaces of all K3 covers of P2 with 15 nodes and all K3 surfaces of degree 8 with action by Z12Z to the 4 are covered by curves. And so he asked similar questions about all K3 surfaces with 15 nodes and all double covers, sorry, and all K3 surfaces with Z12, Z4 acting on them. That is to say, all of That is to say, all of Gabonatti and Sarti's families. And so the problem can now be solved for degree six. And we actually have, although I don't have time to talk about it, we have another construction that should give the result for degree four. This is somewhat more difficult, but it's based on a somewhat similar idea, where we start with a curve of genus three that is a double covering of an elliptic curve. We take an unramified cyclic cover of that, and we pass to a suitable quotient of its square. And then there is for. Square. And then there is a further quotient of that, and square gives us, and that gives us a K3 surface in a somewhat similar way. But it's more complicated. You know, the genus of the unramified double cover is 17, and things just barely work. And we've tried, but we haven't been able to do this in any cases beyond q root minus 2. So I should mention that there is some relation with what Rachel was talking about yesterday and also the question that Niels asked afterward. Afterward. So, this concludes my talk, and thank you for your attention. And if you have any questions, now would be a good time, but I will certainly be hanging out around on Zulu.
