Thank you, Marta, for a very nice introduction. And I would like to thank also the organizer for organizing this nice conference. It would be great to be in OHAKA, but anyway, it is great to listen also online, the very good. The very good presentations I heard so far. So I hope it won't be much worse than the others. I say that because I am not so much experienced with the Zoom presentations, so I hope it will go all right. I also would like to thank the organizers for the invitation to have the invitation to have the opportunity to to talk about the these results so this will be on oops why it is not already started it doesn't it doesn't move because of some or other reason yeah that's fine so the plan of the of the Of the talk is first formulation the problem and some historical remarks, then formulation the main results, which will be about the existence and uniqueness of an LP solution of the equation, will be considered, then a sketch of proof, and then the regularity of the solution. Unfortunately, I couldn't give parts about our slides about About our slides about numerical methods related to these equations. So, this work is joined with Alexander Davy, Sandy Davy, my colleague, and Fabian Germ, both from Edinburgh University. So, the formulation of the problem that we consider a linear A linear SPD. So the first part here is the very well studied second order parabolic SPD driven by a wiener process, multi-dimensional wiener process. And here, linear operators acting on the Operators acting on the solutions which are integral operators, these J eta star and J psi star, i psi star. The star means, I will explain later, that we consider the adjoint of these operators. So L is a second-order differential operator in this form. In this form, but here the adjoint is acting on U. Similarly, in case of M, which is a first-order linear differential operator in this form, and its joint is acting. So, here, in this part, you can recognize the Zokoi equation of nonlinear filtering, but there are Filtering, but there are these additional parts. So the J eta star is the joint operator of J eta, which is written here. The T is a linear operation on functions, which is a shift operator. The shift is with the ψ and with the eta. So the xi means here that it is a shift. Here, that it is a shift operation with the ψ, which is a random field, so it depends on T omega, the X variable, and also an extra parameter Z, which is from a Growth Z place, and where there is a measure new naught, another Growth X one, there is a measure new one, and there is an integration with. And there is an integration with respect to the z parameter which goes into it through this translation operator. So this is the equation we are interested in, a relatively easy equation. Sometimes it is called the stochastic integral differential equations. It is given on a probabilities. probability space, filtered probability space. The WKT is a D1 dimensional F T Vienna process and the N tilde is an F T Poisson-Martingiel measure and with structure measure N1, which is here. Right, I think I I explained this equation, but please ask questions if it is not clear. So the new i is a sigma finite measure on a measurable space, Gautig Zi with a sigma algebra script Zi. And then the coefficients, the sigma and rho are made. Matrix-valued coefficients, yes, if we go back, then you see that the sigma and sigma transpose matrix, as usual, row transpose matrix is in front of the derivations with respect to the xi and xj variables. So these are matrix-valued. Matrix valued functions of T omega and X. B is a vector-valued function of T omega X, C also vector valued of sorry, scalar valued of T omega X, and similarly, beta. So maybe we should remember that the sigma and rho, these are, as I mentioned, in front of the with taking the With taking the multiplication with the transpose matrix, they are in front of the second order derivations. The B is in front of the first order, C is the multiplication, and beta is also the multiplication, but in the as you see here. As you see here, MK in the part where we have the BNA process. So I am sorry, probably it's not easy to remember. Yes, please. Do you have just a finite number of random motions? Yes, but that is just for simplicity. It wouldn't be difficult to extend it to infinite numbers, but Infinite numbers, but in that case, the square summation of the corresponding coefficients with respect to the index of the Wiener process is required. So, that's but anyway, that's not a problem and the natural. And the natural measurability assumptions are assumed. The psi is an initial value, which is an LP-valued F-naught measurable random process. So what is the motivation? So this equation, which we consider here, is, as I mentioned, without the integral operator terms, it is the Zakay equation for partially observed diffusion. Partially observed diffusion processes, the nonlinear filtering of partially disturbed observed diffusion processes, and with the other term, this is the Zakaya equation, the corresponding Zakaya equation for the partially observed jump diffusions. So, this is the motivation, and so we would like to prove. Like to prove the existence and uniqueness of an LP solution to this equation because that gives us results about the existence of the density and the properties of the density. And also, we would like to investigate the regularity of the solution. Now, the Zakoya equation has enormous literature, so it is really difficult to Difficult to say anything more about what is already known about the equation. And also, the equation which we considered, which we are considering here is studied and there are existence uniqueness results for and regularity results for that equation. So the novelty is that we consider LP solutions and Healthy solutions. And if we look at the literature, even in the diffusion case, when no degeneracy condition is given, then a lot of regularity of the coefficients, so three times differentiability is needed. And we would like to show that in fact. To show that, in fact, if we do our estimates carefully, then only Lipschitz condition is enough. So, first the definition. What does that mean, LP solution? So, an LP valued FT adapted Cadillac process is called an LP solution to this problem. So, one is the equation, second is the initial condition. Initial condition, if almost surely this is satisfied for all t and for all phi smooth functions, compactly supported smooth functions. So you notice that we put the operators onto the test functions phi and this definition is then Definition is then understandable even in the case when, or or has a meaning even when the solution has no smoothness at all. In the usual approach, only one derivative is put there, but then at least one derivative from the solution is required. So, very brief historical remarks that. Historical remarks that the Zakaya equation has been intensively studied under the non-degeneracy condition, which is this one, sigma sigma transpose is greater than or equal than a positive kappa times the identity matrix. And then the L2 theory has probably most of a Most of you know is developed by Pardu, then Kulov Rozovsky and many others. Also, then regularity in LP spaces, sharp regularity was investigated, starting maybe with works of D'Aprato and an LP theory of Kulov was developed and also. Developed and also further results concerning the regularity of the solution under the non-degeneracy condition was done. What we would like to make here is we would like to do here is to show that one can make use of the structure of the equation that is that That is that the adjoint operator acts on you so that under minimal or less regularity than otherwise known in the literature, one can get the solution and further regularity. So, yes, what is the method when one considers non-degeneracy? When the non-generacy condition is not assumed, then one rewrites it into the non-divergence form. So that means already that some smoothness of the coefficients, two derivatives from A, A is the one half rho rho star plus sigma sigma star coefficient is needed. So already rewriting Already, rewriting means that we require some smoothness condition. And then one solves that the equation by the method of vanishing viscosity. For example, solvability in LP spaces was done or this. Done for these equations in a paper by Khruv Rozovsky. There was some gap in the estimates there, which then was filled in by a paper, a joint paper with Marty Gerenchir and Nick Kurov, and also extended to systems. And so generalize. And the equation which we consider now. Which we consider now the stochastic integral differential equation in non-divergence form was considered, if I am not mistaken, first in a paper by Dariotis and also Leghi and Mikuliavichus, and probably many others, the solvability. Um, the solvability in LP spaces considered in a joint paper with Siju Wu. And I suppose, and then I should, in fact, mention many other papers as well. So, apologies that my reference is so short and concentrate mostly on papers related to me. So, in the above papers on the degenerate On the degenerate equations, the main method of this or main tool is the Ito formula for the square or for the p power of the W12 norm or the W1P norm of the solution in order to get a prior estimates and also uniqueness and also. And also continuity of the solutions, so regularity in time. But in order to be able to do that, W12 valued solutions should be so the aim is to prove the existence of W1T valued solutions. And because otherwise, Otherwise, if the U is not in W12, then, or at least for DT almost everywhere, should be in W12 or W1P. If this is not, then Ito formula is not available, doesn't have a meaning. So, this means that the initial condition. That the initial condition should be already in W12 or in W1P. And it turns out that one should have at least three bonded derivatives from the coefficients, the mean coefficients, and then less from the lower order coefficients. So the first estimate, which we or the first theorem. Which we, or the first theorem, which I would like to present, shows that an LP solution exists if psi is only in L P and the coefficients satisfy only the Lipschitz condition and satisfy a linear growth condition, so the non-zero order coefficients and the zero order should be bound. Zero order should be bonded. Right, so I formulate the main result: the existence and uniqueness of an LP solution. So let K0 and K1, K and L be non-negative constants. The sigma bar and eta bar functions on that Z zero. Z0, Z1 spaces so that they are square integrable with respect to the measures there. And then the first assumption is a linear growth condition on the coefficient. So that is standard linear growth condition. But as I mentioned on the zero-order coefficients, we should have the boundedness. Here, the norm is missing that for the better. The better. And also, a kind of linear growth condition with where the coefficient is this psi bar function and eta bar function of eta bar here, psi bar there. And moreover, we want that not only square integrability, but these should be bonded as well, these eta bar, psi bar. eta bar psi bar. So this is basically the linear growth condition, but with bondedness on the zero order coefficients. And the second assumption is Lipschitz condition in the same spirit. And finally, the third condition is that the psi plus plus eto sorry that the identity function plus theta times eta should have an inverse and Lipschitz continuous inverse. So this is what I what I meant here. So there exists the lambda constant such that we have this estimate from This estimate from below, and also for the ψ, we have this estimate from below, right? For every theta from the zero, one interval. So, in other words, that means together with the previous condition on eta and psi, that the x plus theta times eta of x. eta of x is a bi-Lipschitz function and similarly for x plus theta times psi of x bi Lipschitz in x uniformly in the other variables. And one more that the derivative of the psi eta in x should be equicontinuous in x in both Continues in X, in balls, and uniformly with respect to the other variables. Then the first theorem says that if these conditions hold, then and P is greater than or equal to 2, psi is in L P almost surely, F not measurable, then the equation, the initial value problem. The initial value problem one, two has an LP solution and such that this estimate holds with a constant and depending on these constants listed here. Right, so the constant appearing in the conditions and the second theorem, so that was only about existence, the second theorem. About existence, the second theorem: if we have those conditions and the uv are LP solutions for some p greater than or equal to 2, such that this assumption 5 holds, which in particular says that the U is in L1. L1 and even the essential supremum of the L1 norm is finite. And that other part means, this is for the U and also for the V, and this other part means that it is in an L1 space, weighted L1 space, and even in that norm. And in that norm, the essential supremum should be finite. Now, this K1 is the coefficients of the linear growth. So, if we have boundedness, then this is zero in this assumption. So, if we have this extra condition five, then almost surely the U and the V coincide. Coincide. Let me see the proof first or sketch the proof first of the uniqueness result. The natural approach is that one considers two solutions. First of all, one should mention that it is enough. It is enough to assume that, or rather to say one can notice that if U and V are L P solutions and this 5 is satisfied, then in fact they are also L2 solutions as well. So V continues L2 valued. Continuous L2 valued solutions. Why? Because of interpolation, we have that in L P, P is greater than or equal to 2, and also we have in L1, so we will have in L2 as well. So we will have a weakly continuous L2, in fact. So then it's enough to estimate the expectation of the L2 norm squared for So for the difference, but the problem is that we don't have the Ito formula for the L2 norm squared here, because for that, we should have the U bar or U and V in the W12 space, but that is not. So then the natural idea is that we smooth the solution and write down. And write down or the difference, and write down the equation for the smooth version, and then take the L2 norm and take the expectation. So we smooth it with a smooth kernel and try to estimate to get it. And that's a natural idea. And that is what we do. So the smoothing can be done from the equation. Done from the equation, substituting the kernel shifted with x and integrated. So we will have for each x such an equation where the notation, so here you see these notations that an operator adjoint, so star, the joint operator acting on a function and then this, that means we smooth the we put We put the A onto the smoothing kernel. We integrate over the y of this product. So, this is the meaning of this here. And then one can estimate the L2 norm square, and one gets that that is the integral of certain terms here plus a local martingale. Now, these terms are written here. Here and probably very familiar for many of you. And the question, can we estimate these terms now? And it turns out that if one uses a Gaussian density for the smoothing, then one can have an estimate which is written here for each of these terms. And in fact, that we learn from a paper by Kurtz and Schljong, this very nice calculations that can be done. And once that we can done, then we have by this lemma that from the L2 norm of the smooth function. Most function u t bar squared such an estimate, which is nearly the form suitable for Grandois lemma. Just here we have the smooth version here, not, but that's not really a problem by standard stopping time arguments and then for two's lemmas and expectations. Lemmas and expectations, and then for two's lemma, one can easily get that it is zero. The proof of theorem two is a bit more difficult, and it has several steps in order to get it. First, we consider extra condition, additional conditions that the coefficient. Coefficients or the data, let's say, so psi is the initial condition. Here are the coefficients that they are compactly supported with a uniform support, and moreover, that they are differentiable and the derivative are bounded up to any order. So, this is the condition. The condition and under this condition, we have the following proposition that for each p greater than or equal to equation one, two has a unique L P solution. Moreover, this estimates holds. But we can prove this only for even integers p greater than or equal to two. And the interesting thing is that n depends only on these. Constants. So K naught is not there, K1 is not there, K1 is the linear growth and K0. So in the linear growth condition, you can find the K naught as the constant plus K1 times and the X norm. So the first part, the X is The first part, the existence and the estimate, sorry, just the existence because the first part is just the existence, follows from a joint paper with Sichu Wu, but the estimate is new and we can get it, as I mentioned, only for For even integers greater than or equal to two. Now, this proposition is proved by the following, so the second part is proved by the help of the following lemma that these following These following estimates that what we can do for even integers, that these forms can be estimated by the LP norms on the right-hand side. These forms appear if one would formally do the not only formally, in fact, the LP L P, the Ito formula for the P power of the L P norm, then such terms appear at the dt term, at the drift term. So clearly this should be estimated. But the point here is that these N1, N2 constants depend only on the constant appearing here. Appearing here. Again, there is no k1, no k not constant there. And also, which is important, that no constants about no bonds appear here for the derivatives. Only the Lipschitz bonds. The Lipschitz bonds appear in these. So, this is the main point here. And the interesting thing is that even though we had similar estimates, but there the constants n or n1 and two depended also on the bonds for the higher order derivatives. So, the important thing is that one should realize some cancellation when one uses cancellation of terms of coefficients with derivatives when one has the divergence form. So, that form what we or in the of the equation what we are using and What we are using. And in fact, these we prove by first proving a similar estimate for the smooth V and smoothed L L star V using the Gaussian kernel, somehow that organ. Somehow that organizes well that we can take care of that cancellation. Right, so if we have this proposition proven, then from the from the ito formula, From the ITO formula, using this norm which is introduced here, this L board face LPQ norm written here, which is estimated by obviously by the supremum norm. So once we have an estimate for the supremum norm, as in proposition one, then we have. Then we have an estimate for the U solution in this LPQ norm independently with a constant independently of Q. And so what we got in this way using proposition one that the solution in this LPQ norm is In this LPQ norm is estimated by the initial condition in the LP norm independently of the Q here for every Q greater than or equal to one. Which means that the solution operator which maps the initial condition into the solution is a bounded linear operator between these spaces Lp and In these spaces, LP and LPQ spaces. So, therefore, by interpolation, we have that this estimate holds for every P. And in this way, we have the estimate, the crucial supremum estimate for every P. In step two, we get rid of the P. We get rid of the smoothness condition, and additionally, only the support condition is assumed. Then the proposition is that there is for every L P valued initial condition, F not measurable, there is an L P solution and the estimate holds. So now we don't have. So now we don't have extra smoothness on the coefficients, just the Lipschitzness, but the support condition and then the n here depend only on these bounds. Then the proof is more or less understandable, I suppose, for everyone. We smooth the coefficients. The coefficients and then using the previous results for the yes, using the previous results, we have a solution for every epsilon, where epsilon is the smoothing parameter. Here, the smoothing is done with a C. Is done with a C0 infinity kernel, not with the constant kernel. And then one can show that the data, smooth data, satisfy the conditions of the previous proposition, proposition one, for every epsilon from a range. Here, the only difficulty to check that. To check that is again that the smooth psi and eta satisfy the condition on condition three independently with constant independent of epsilon. So once we have this, then by the previous proposition, we have the estimates, then for a Estimates, then for a subsequence, we can go to the weak limit in LpQ for every integer Q. From here, we get the essential supremum estimate because once we have such an estimate, right, then going Q to infinity, we can get this essential in the left-hand side, the essential. Left-hand side, the essential supremum estimate for the limiting limit u because that also satisfies the same estimate as the u epsilon. So in this way, we can construct the solution. One can show that a p cross dt modification is an LP solution, and moreover. And moreover, then one has the supremum, not only the essential supremum. And finally, step three: that we assume the assumptions one, two, three. Let side be an F naught measurable random variable with values in L P for P greater than or equal to two. Then we Then we show that there exists a sequence of data, so psi n, psi n, and so on, such that for a sequence Rn, so then Rn sequence of positive numbers converging to infinity is also exists such that the dn The Dn data where the n is that the dn data equals the original data well in the ball of radius n and it is zero outside. That the cutting or truncation of psi sigma and beta is an easy job, but the truncation of the psi eta Of the ψ eta is not really so easy. This is here the remark that remember that the x plus theta psi n, x plus θ n should be bilips because we want that, which I haven't said here, that the assumption one, two, three should be satisfied with. Be satisfied with constants independent of n. So this must be bilips. That means lip sheets and with inverse, which is also lip sheets. Now to truncate in this way is not so straightforward. An interesting thing is that this question can be formulated like this: we have a bi-lipschitz function. A bilipschitz function, we subtract the identity from it. Can we truncate this such that if we add back the x, we still have a bilipsitz function, and that the truncation should. That the truncation should approximate the origin. Interestingly, this question is investigated in the literature and the solution is known only in dimension one, which is trivial, and in dimension two. But in our situation, that can be done. And then, oops. Right that was that was done. And then finally, one can get the proof by using the previous proposition and then going. And then going to the limit in the same way. So repeating step two. Going so for every n, we have a solution u n. Then we have an estimate in the LPQ space for this. Then for a subsequence, we go to the limit, and then we can get also the supremum essential, supremum, supremum estimate. Supremum estimate. So, in the same way as before, one can get and fully finish the now very last thing, that the regularity of the solution. So, if we assume that the data has bounded derivatives up to some M. Up to some m up to order m greater than or equal to one. Additionally, to the previous conditions, and psi is WMP valued, so here is a mistake: WMP valued and F not measurable, then the problem has an L P valued solution. Has an LP-valued solution which is weakly catalog, WMP-valued, and such that the supremum estimate holds. If we have bounded coefficients, so k, sorry, that means k1 here, k1 is zero, so that means the boundedness of the coefficients, then u is strongly catalog. Strongly catalog as a WSP-valued process for every s less than m. And then the proof is just the main proof is again the estimates, which I skip now and just the references. So here is Constantinus, had an early work on degenerate stochastic integral differential equations. Differential equations. And then the results which I mentioned in this talk are in these papers, but not separated from the filtering problem considered there so that together so these results are not singled out. Results are not singled out, what I mentioned now in these papers. Then, some papers about LP solvability, earlier paper. But what is the new thing here that we require less smoothness on the coefficients, only lip sheets in order. Only Lipschitz in order to get Lp and less derivatives to get the solution in WP because we make use of the structure of an equation by the estimates which we or by the method how we estimate the terms we need to estimate. Right, there must be Right, there must be many other mentions. So, there is only a paper by James Michael Leahy and Mikolyavicius on the generated linear stochastic evolution driven by jump processes, which is related to our. And this is the paper where what I refer to, and then classical papers by Classical papers by Pardu Rozovsky on the subject. I think that that is all. So thank you very much for your attention. And I am sorry I had too much time, was too slow. Thank you for your attention. We thank you very much, Ishvan. Time is not a problem. We have enough time. We have the break. We have enough time. We have the break after that. So now it's time for some questions. So please remember to turn on your micro if you have some questions. Can I ask a question? Yes. I cannot, I don't know where to raise my hand. So good morning, John G. Very nice talk. I have a question about. I have a question about regularity. So when you state of your regularity, you say if the initial condition in WMP, then the solution is again in WMP. Why don't you have more regularity? So it's not clear for me then from the equation. I thought you had a second-order differential operator, right? Where is he? Yeah, we lost him. Yeah, I think he didn't want to answer your question. Yeah, he doesn't want to ask. Yeah, exactly. Somebody you can answer the question. His connection was not good. Connection connection one your micro, please. You have to mute your micro, Ishmael. Sorry, I now, no problem. I didn't want to escape from the question. I just apologize. So, could you repeat the question? I have this computer and I am very bad with computers. So, I say for me, do you hear me now? Hear me well? Yes, I can. Hear me well? Yes, I can hear you. Okay, so my question is about regularity. If I understood well, your equation is an integral differential equation, but the operator is second-order differential operator, correct? Yeah. If you consider now the integral operator, it is a, yes, it can be viewed as a degenerate second-order differential. Order, differential operator, the J can be viewed as a degenerate second order. And the I operator, should I go maybe back to the? Yeah, maybe the equation. I thought it was a convolution, like that the integral operator is a convolution, correct? Maybe I let me go back to the you have two integers, you have two pieces: the integral. The integral, which is the convolution, and then the second one, which is probably you can't see now the share the screen that is. If possible, so at the bottom of the screen, you have an icon. Too many things are open in my yeah, yeah, I understand the problem. Right, so share, and I have a very small laptop here. That's fine now. Thank you. Very nice. That's fine now. Thank you. Very nice. Yes, can you see now? Yeah, yes. All right. So, so then, so we have this J operator like here and here, and here we have an I. Now, if we look at the J operator, then the J operator is a kind of finite difference operator. So, a translation minus translation. minus translation with a with a function with a random field disk psi and minus the minus the function itself when it acts on phi this j here the identity and minus this so this is something like the when you would write down the Taylor formula for Formula for the function phi around x translating by the psi t. So this operator, right this corresponds to an operator when you have a jump jump process, right? And then the I is just Is just a first-order operator. So the integration, thus, this is happening for every Z, and there is an integration over the Z. Yes, so it is a. It is applied. It's applied to you. Sorry? It's applied to you. So it's an integral operator. It is applied to you. So, sorry, what was your Sorry, what was your further point? So I thought, you know, my question was the following. In the regularity result, you stated that if the initial condition is in WMP, right? Then the solution stays in WMP and it is catalog in WSP with S strictly smaller than M. with a strictly smaller than n of course strongly catalog it is it is strongly catalog it is weakly catalog as a wmp process and strongly catalog in as a wms as less than m pro value you don't have more you don't have more in terms of uh the week you don't have more mean uh higher mean a higher higher no because there is no uh no smoothing effect because the j can also be degenerate as i mentioned l can yeah so this is the job sigma sigma can be zero and then that is degenerate yes as a result the psi and eta at the extremes At the extreme situation, can be also zero or take lots of places zero, therefore, there is no smoothing effect from the J operators and either. That's another thing. If there is some non-degeneracy condition assumed in terms of the xi and etho. and and eta in fact here in term of the eta is needed then then one can have the the more more regular version then there is there is the smoothing but i consider here the the equation without any smoothing effect because i think in filtering I think in filtering, it's quite natural to consider this equation without extra non-degeneracy condition. Thank you. Thank you. This is clear now. Yeah, I missed completely the point. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the clarification. So, thank you. Are there some more questions? Are there some more questions? We have time for a couple, maybe of them. No? Can I ask another question? Yes, David. Happy to hear you. So in the beginning of the presentation, you said that you may try to look at numerical scheme for such equation. Yes, yes. I wanted. So, so what is the idea to use a finite difference in space and then we'll have a PC, for example? In fact, the only thing I wanted or planned to talk about is the time discretization for these equations and just backwards and forwards Euler methods and splitting methods. And splitting methods because splitting is very natural to consider for these equations. And yes, I have some result, but not yet carefully written down with minimal, I think, regularity on the coefficients for the splitting. But what kind of regularity? What kind of regularity in time does the solution have of the equation one? Because what kind of convergence rate do you expect then? The convergence rate, what I expect is one as already in time. Oh, yes, because you have finite numbers. Splitting concerning the splitting. Okay, and because you have finite dimensional noise. Sorry, finite dimensional noise. Yeah. But yeah, here it is finite dimensional. Right. And how do you split as a you split like a natural splitting would be equation? So one for for this, right? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry. The natural speaking is that one for the for the for this for an L star operator where sigma sigma transpose ij together with d i d j this is one let us call it L1 star operator thus separately an equation du equals L1 U DT one kind of deterministic plus Deterministic plus a stochastic which is fully degenerate, then the rho, rho star, ij d i dj would be an L2 and then the L2 star together with the Mk star that is the next equation is du equals L two. equals L two star U T plus M K star U T D W K. The first one is with the E, because then this is a solvable and fully degenerate part. Then this equation, so dU t equals this one and This one and then the third one dut equals this because this needs, so the term with the Poisson-Martingale measure part needs this term in the solvability. Again, these two together, if I consider the equation du three. du3 equals these two, then again a fully degenerate equation. And so that is how I would split. I don't know whether it was clear. So each part are solvable. Yes, each part must be solvable. And if it is fully degenerate, then one can have Have several methods for solving representation, method, night work variables. So, therefore, this is the splitting I would use in this case. Okay, thank you. And do you have more regularity in time that, so, for example, helder continuity, or do you think that rhoda continuity don't the problem here is the problem here is that we have um catlagness because we have the uh the um yeah because you have yeah yeah so uh so the uh so the regularity in time should be considered in other spaces and i i i don't know what what regularity one can have for that so at the moment for for such equation only can Such equation only cadlagness in strong and weak sense, what we can prove. And that's an interesting question, how to measure then somehow this catlagness, so to have something better. Can I ask something related to sorry? Can I ask something related to this? Yes, yes, Constantine was clear. You said you expect rate one with the splitting, but that doesn't it depend on which, I mean, if you measure NLP for P large, that that should drop, right? Exactly for this reason, because the regularity of the jumpy part drops, no? Wait, uh, so the uh No, no, no, I still no no no I still still um still um expect one regularity one because the I when I I when one would do the splitting splitting, then then one I would rewrite this the splitting by by synchronizing. synchronizing it with the with the other uh no but i mean as a simple i mean more more fundamental uh question i mean if we i mean forgetting about the equation if we have a levy process and we measure its regularity in time i mean i think this depends on the on the moment that one yeah Yes, yes, yes, yes. So, yes, yes, so I haven't solved that carefully then. But if you solve each part exactly, do you still have this problem, constantines? What do you mean exactly? For example, when Istven mentioned the splitting, the Isven mentioned the splitting. You have the last equation. So I look at this. So you don't discretize. You don't discretize. So you have this part. This part is exact. Yeah, could be. So maybe you don't have... I don't know, but maybe you don't have this problem. Yeah. I don't know. It's just a suggestion. So I remember I had already I had already some drafts about that, and it seemed to me that in at least in L2 version, that I can get in for that one, which I mentioned, the rate one convergence with the splitting. Yes, exactly, Solving Osdo. Solving all those equations which I mentioned. Thank you.
