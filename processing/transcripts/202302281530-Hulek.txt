Thanks very much. I'm enjoying that. So, I'm talking about bulk functions, certain bulk functions, modularized bases. And the point I want to discuss is this. In many cases, moduli spaces sort of, you can look at them from two points of view. I mean, you can look at them as a GIT moduli space. For example, if you have hypersurfaces. If you have hypersurfaces, or you could look at them via Hodge theory. I mean, they give the same modularized basis, but there is, when you then try, for example, to compactify things, there are quite subtle differences. And that is what this talk is going to do. So in particular, I want to look at modernized spaces which can be realized as open, and I mean to risky open subsets. So risky output subsets of some work for short. Examples are, for example, the postal hybridis. These are points on P1, possibly weighted points on P1. They've been studied extensively. Certain moduli of K3 surfaces have ball quotients, as moduli spaces which line ball quotients, typically K3s with automorphisms. Cubic surfaces. Cubic surfaces is another case, and organized spaces with cubic reflex also. We saw that in some talk this morning, and I'll come back to that later on. Okay, now in both cases, one has natural compactifications. So, you have the moduli space, and particularly when you classify, say, smooth hypersurfaces, these will be stable points. Will be stable points where you get something which is cross-projective. If you want to get something projective, you have to add this semi-stable points and you get your GIT. Things get a lot more complicated because for the semi-stable points, you don't necessarily separate the orbits, we may add the orbits of the polystable points. But anyway, you get a compactification. At the same time, if you look at it as a total function, typically the Typically, the difference here between the M and the D and gamma is hypersurface one or several devices. So you have to add those. That's the first step. And then again, you still get something which is not projective. And you can make it projective in several ways. And the most canonical way is to take the so-called Baylor Welcome verification. And for Walton. For wall versions, this means that this type from here to here, all you do is to add cusps, which are just points. For type 4 domains, you have to add more, for single spaces, even more, but here you just add a finite number of cusps. The Bailey-Borel compactification can be realized by automorphic forms. Take your automorphic forms, they form a Braille grain, finally generated. Rayleigh-Graham finally generated, you take the dot of that. But in general, there is no reason to expect why these two complexifications should be different. And sometimes they are. I'll discuss a few examples where they are isomorphic, but in other cases they are not. But we'll go through that. I'll give you some examples. Now, both spaces here. Both spaces here are very well. It's difficult to control the geometry near the cusps. And here again, for the GIT version, you could have quite nasty singularities. Typically, I mean, not exactly the examples I'll show you, but typically you get singularities which are not necessarily finite proportionalities. So you might want to designularize, or at least partially. Or at least partially designularized Euroline spaces. And in the case of GIT, there's a big machine related to Frances Kirwin where she does that. She does that in a very systematic way. And she developed that because she wanted to compute the homology of model species. In the case of the daily Bureau, you have a different world in the sense you can take toroidal compoundification. Now, toroidal Now, Toronto compactifications depend on choices. They depend on choices of fans. However, in the special case of bulk quotients, they are actually canonical. The reason is that the fan, well, the fan lives in some positive column of a real spectral space. And in this case, that is just one-dimensional array. There is no choice you have for that family. You have for that family. So, in this case, we have a natural colloidal content. Okay, so I'll go through two and a half examples where I want to discuss the relationship between the Hodge theory point of view and the sort of GIT point of view and how they. And how are they? The first one is eight unordered points, or this is also a hyper-elliptic curves of genus degree. And they can be, and I show you explicitly how that comes about as a ball portion. So we start with the Gaussian integers, and then we define a Hermitian rank two lattice. So a lattice of rank two over the ring. Over the ring G, and we equip it with Hermitian force. Here I wrote down two matrices. So that gives you Hermitian force. Now I take a round six lattice by taking one copy of the lambda one, two copies of the lambda two. That is the wrong file. I corrected that. Never mind. That is a P5. I thought. That is a P5. Excuse me. I thought we'd change the file. I came to your colleague just after lunch and said, can I change the file? Never mind. There are a few minor errors. We'll go through it. That's okay. Anyway, so this is a six-dimensional space. So this is a P5 of the P6, and it could take. P6 and it contains the five-dimensional group. Okay, and then I can take the unitary group of that lattice L, lambda. We are talking about now a discrete group, an arithmetic group, and I can have that act on D5, and the moduli space is an open subset in. We already have to remove a hypersurface, but it sits naturally in this plane. And then you can compactify it to. And then you can compactify it to the GIT. Yeah. And then, as I say, we have two compactifications, the GIT and the Bailey-Borel. And in this case, these two are isomorphic. So, and to go from your moduli space to the Bailey-Borel, it's two steps. First, you have to take the difference between the wall function and M. And this is where you add stable points, but points where you in M, you have. In n, you have eight different points. But you can have two or three points coming together, it's still stable, and this is what you add from here to here. But as long as, as soon as four points come together, it becomes semi-stable. Five is unstable. Four points is semi-stable, and that then corresponds to the cusp. So that is you add one more point, and that is the unique polystable points of the Of two points, each with multiplicity four. You could have four points with multiplicity one, one point with multiplicity four. That is still mapped to the same customer. This is the issue that the orbits are no longer separate. Okay, so that's example one. Example two is cubic surfaces. Cubic surfaces, I took Carlston Toledo. Carlston Toledo have a quotient moduli space. And now instead of the Gaussian integers, you take the Eisenstein integers. And then you define this lattice, 4 times VE and VE minus 1. Well, the E minus 1 just means that on that lattice, I take the standard H4 with the signature 4, 1. This is the 4 here, the 1 here, the minus. Here, the one here, the minus one here, indicates the negatives. Then we take again the unitary group. In this case, it's easier. You just have a very simple form here, take this unitary group. You have a ball, it's a four-dimensional ball, and you mod out by that. And then you get your modelized phase, and there should have been before divided by gamma, that was another of the types here. Okay. Okay, so to go from M to the bulb floor, you add one divisor, and that is the divisor where you have cubic surfaces with at most noise. I mean, we saw that again this morning for the three forecasts. Right, and to go from there to daily well, you have to add a unique cusp, and this. And this unit cusp there is one exactly one polystable point. That's the 3A2 cubic. That's this cubic, of course, change of coordinates. And it has, as you can immediately see, three A2 singularities where the relevant coordinates at coordinate points. So that's the picture there. And then we have 12 points, 12 unordered points. That's, I said two and a half examples. Those were the first two examples. This is the half example. And this is now a nine-dimensional version. And again, the GIT is isomorphic to Babylon Rel. If you want an example where the GIT and the Petable Reload. GIT and the payload rel are not isomorphic, you can go to cubic three-folds. For cubic three-folds, you get this 10-dimensional situation, and then the GIT and the variable rel differ slightly. It's not a huge difference, but they differ slightly. You have to blow something up and get a map. So the birational map between them has. The bi-rational map between them has to be resolved before knows how it is resolved. Right, um, I should have said something else right at the beginning. I'm reporting on joint work with Kazalina Marchin, who is of the Vioda conference, Sam Krushevsky, Radu Laza, who's also of the Vieta conference, and Yoto Maida. So, the work with Yotto Maida came second. Everything about eight points, which I'll talk about, will be Yut Maida. I'll talk about will be with NAIDA and the cubic surfaces cases is really I don't correlate. What's the draw? I haven't done here, I'll do it. That's also Eisenstein kind of. I'll come to that. Okay, so here we are. That's the actual answer. So this is a maximal variety based on the Eisenstein integers. They call them, it's called ancestral variety. It's also the moduli space of hyper elliptic curves of genus Ï†. And now this appears in the moduli space of cubic three volts. And it's in the moduli space of cubic three volts, what's called the hyperelliptic logus. So in this morning's talk, we had this configuration of hyperplanes mod gamma. After modding out by gamma, we had After modding out by gamma, we had two components. Here's one of them, and here's the other one. They are, it's also Bohr quotient, but in a slightly different group. These two groups are commensurable, but they're not the same. That is also a modular space of non-hyperelliptic curves of GS4 and also of elliptic unit field of K3 surfaces with a non-subject model of model 3. And that is the stable locus corresponding to where the Are corresponding to where the cubic three fold picks up, say, A1 circular system. Okay, that's that. Now, in each of these cases, in each of these cases, we have natural level structures. So, we have moduli spaces, which sit above them, and the two moduli spaces. And the two moduli spaces are related by a finite group. So for the eight points, it's clear what you can do. I mean, instead of taking unordered points, you can take ordered points. And obviously, one moduli spaces over the other via an S8 column. Now, also for the ordered moduli, ordered points of eight points. Eight points of P1. This is also a GIT problem. We have still SL2Z acting on eight copies of P1. So we can talk about the GIT moduli space. We take and talk about the compactification of copies. And the stability is the same. If you have at most three points coming together, it's stable. The minute you have got four points, you get semi-stable more by four. CMS label normal by five with five point semester. So that's a natural cover. And this is also related to K3 surfaces with automorphisms. So this is the topic of the conference. Let me discuss this in a little bit more detail. And these are certain lattice polarized T3 surfaces with a non-symplectic automorphism of order 4. So we take our eight points. We take our eight points, here they are, different ones, distinct ones. We take that equation, and that defines a smooth curve in P1 text P1. Now you add two lines, y0 equals 0, Y1 equals 1, and then you get the singular. You get something singular. So if you take the double cover, it's 4, 4, you can take the steady row, you can take the double cover, and you get the Double cover, and you get the K3 surface with singularities. But the usual way you can resolve your singularities, you get the K3 surface, and that comes with a natural automorphism with all both. So that's this picture. I don't use that picture in my discussions, but it's there and it can be okay. So again, this This organized space of ordered H tutors is an open set of a ball functions. And now you have to take a smaller group. And you can describe that explicitly. There is something if you have lattices, you have a lattice, a dual lattice by the lattice is called a discriminant group, and your orthogonal group acts on that discriminant group, typically non trivially. Typically, non-trivially. You can take a normal subgroup by saying I take all those automorphisms which act trivially on the discriminant. That is the stable, often called the stable group. And that's what this gamma m is. And again, that should have been on this slide, but never mind. So the quotient of gamma by gamma m is the S A. That's where the S A comes from. Okay, so. Okay, so we have the unordered case, we have the ordered case, and again, in the ordered case, we are again in the situation that GIT and Bay Borel here are isomorphic. So we get this diagram, and that diagram is an S eight equivariant diagram, and the world is nice and it all fits together very well. All fits together very well. So that's that. That was the level of situation for the eight points. So any questions at that point? So nice above is it below? Yeah, sorry? So for participations, are equal also below without a rubber? Yes. Oh, yes, yes. Yes. And these are the The vertical ones out of the state are cut. Sorry, when you have this non-symptotic automatism of the fourth, so you know which is the invariant lattice, the optionals, you know everything? Yes. Because if you need to construct the condo work that out in detail. Okay, and again, we have a And again, we have a GIT situation, so we can also, in the ordered case, take a button curving. And then we have, in this case, an isomorphism on the here also between the ordered curtain blow up and the throw up. And that's top this top horizontal isomorphism is due to Galado. Isomorphism is due to Galado, Carrot, and Sheffield. Okay. Just blurred about one thing. Well, we'll see what I'm sorry about that. I hate doing this, but I'm worried that I missed something. Okay, I just found I just walked on this. I don't Missed that slide. I don't know why. So that is a very crucial slide. So, because that explains what I want to think about. So, here we have the GIT quotient, here we have Bay Burr. And in the cases which I want to discuss, this is an isomorphism. There are some cases where this is not so, but in this case it's a isomorphism. And we have these two disintegralizations. We have curvin here. We have curvin here and we have toroidal here. So we can ask whether that isomorphism down here lifts to an isomorphism up there. And that's the question I really want to discuss here. I don't know why I missed that slide, but that is the question I'm told. So the question is how... There are no choices in both resolutions. There are no choices in both resolutions. Kirbin is a well-defined procedure. Kerbin is a well-defined procedure. Toroidal has no choice. So, questions which I want to ask you, and how do they compare, for example, for their topology, is the F which this birational atom isomorphism, are these spaces k-equivalent, are compact? So that is the question you should have in mind, and for some reason I so there is some reason why Blackboard's thoughts are compact, okay. Okay, now let's go back. Okay, so and this is why I got why I stopped here. So in this case, so I said in the unaltered case, I want to know whether that's an isomorphism. Of course, the same question is true for the ordered case. And for the ordered case, The order case. And for the ordered case, this is an RSM effort. That was proved by Galado, Kerry, and Scheffler fairly recently. But this does not imply that the MAM F, which I'm really interested in, is also an isomorphism because the Kerbin law is not necessarily compatible with that of the Gauro. So that is still hopeful. Now, for the cubic surfaces, we also have a very natural. We also have a very natural level structure, and that is given by the configuration of 27 lines. We have the 27 lines on the cubic surface, and that is a well-known abstract configuration. So, marking a cubic surface means we take the 27 lines and we map that configuration to a given fixed abstract configuration. That then leads to Then leads to a moduli space, which again is not obvious, but it's again more cautioned. So we have here the gamma n. As before, the gamma n is the stable monetary group. And the quotient of gamma by gamma n is the while group of V6 times plus minus 1. Now the plus minus 1, you can forget right away, that acts trivially on your wall, forget it. And the WS6 that the wild group appears is very, very natural. This is the automorphism of this abstract configuration of lines on a GPU surface. So that must come up in this discussion. Okay, so here we have this community diagram here, everything fine. Diagram here, everything fine, and the vertical maps are Galois by the Bile group of the cells. Now, now we are in a slightly different situation. For the eight points, yeah, eight ordered points, I said it's appropriately good GIT problem. Marked cubic surfaces are not a natural GIT problem. But there is a natural compactification and that was constructed by Melvuki. Was constructed by Melruki. It's a so-called cross-ratio architect. I mean, if you want, I can tell you a little bit about it, but it's a very, very classical thing where you look at tri-tangent planes, pins and GFDs, and cross-ratios of four points in P1. So Naruki constructed a natural compactification for the marked case, and this will now, in my discretion, take this the place of the The place of the J for the order. Okay. So again, same situation. Same paper by Gernardo, Kerr, and Chefia. So we have the moduli space of water qubits. They sit in this motion that I take the color model. I take Naruto. Orito. I take Naruto's project application and they proved that that is again 2021. And once again, as before, this does not occur in the F, where I work without the level structure, that that is also an isomorphism. Here there is even less reason because the Nairobi compactification and the verbal have very little to do with it. There's very different modes of Very different points of okay. Now, for 12 points, we also have obviously a level structure. I can go from unordered to ordered. Easy. And that also gives me an S12 cover that carries over to the GIT quotients. But in this case, it's unknown whether the case of Known whether the case of all that 12 tuple is actually a bulk version. I think people believe it is, but to my knowledge, Kondo's knowledge, we could not, it's not known that that modularized space is actually a okay, and now let me talk about the results. So, this question is F an isomorphism and how do the Isomorphism: How do the curving blow-up and the paroidal compare to each other? So, this is when I work with Yotomada. And we first look at the topology. Now, the topology is, there is, as I said, this Gerben machinery computer, the topology of GIT quotients, and that at the same time gives me the topology of. Gives me the chromology of the curving block. One has to be a bit careful. The Kerbin machinery gives me finite GIT, it gives me the intersection cohomology, which is not necessarily the same as singular cohomology, but in the case where I find a quotial similarities, it is. So for the curvant blowout, that always by construction has finite causal similarities. There I can use the curvat machine. There, I can use the querving machinery to complete the chromology of this test. And then, to get the chromology of the toroidal, it's not that hard. You go from MK to MGIT over to Beniborl, and then we can compare Beni-Borel to the toroidal by essentially a very, very simple application of the decomposition. So, one can go through that, one can complete that, and then. And then that's the comology, and here I just wrote down to you the Betty numbers of the spaces involved. And we see, for example, here for the curving law in the ordered case and for the ordered toroidal, we get the same bettinumness. And we better should, because by the Lido case-scheflip, these are isomorphic spaces. Spaces. But you can also see that without the ordering, the curving and the tolloidal do have the same details, much smaller. That comes because the reaction is killed most of the chromology. So just from the topology, we cannot disprove that that is a result. Okay, that's that. However, the first result then is that this F is That this f is indeed does not extend to an isomorphism. The termorphism, nor does f ingress. I can give you the proof. That's not so difficult. So what you do is we have the discriminant, the A1. Well, no, this could be where you have points coming together. Points coming together, and you have the exceptional revisor, which is irreducible both in the curving case and in the third case. And you work out that in the curving, the discriminant and the exceptional revisor do not reach transversal. Whereas on the toroidal side, on the bottom side, they do reach transversal. So the F cannot possibly be now. Now it could of course still be that it's a morphism, but then it would have to be a small contraction because all spaces have the same bit in number, so you cannot have a divisor being contracted. And then you can argue, well, if it's a small contraction, then the target space cannot be Q factorial, but it is. Cornell quantum communication is Q factorial, therefore this cannot be a new physical. Therefore, this cannot be morphism. You could also argue with topology. So, F is not a morphism in the same argument applies to the limits. However, it's still possible that the two spaces are abstractly isomorphic. And we want to ask a slightly different question. We want to ask whether they are k-equivalent. So, let me remind you what k-equivalence means. So, if you have two So, if you have two varieties xy, objective normal, and I call them they're called k-equivalent if you have a common resolution of singularities, which is birational over both x and y, so in particular x and y are birational, such that the pullback of the commodities to z is equivalent as q denotes. q t d The reason that sort of a natural motion to look at here is, for example, there is this story started by Batirev and going into motivic integration. If you have smooth varieties which are K-equal, then they have the same pitting numbers. And that's this behind the situation if we have the same pitting numbers for variants. If you have normal projects, If you have normal projective Q-Power style varieties, economic singularities, enough canonic abundance, then that case again, you are not in that situation, but it's close to our situation. That's why we said we should look. And the other point I want to remark and remind you of is that if you have two k-equivalent varieties, then the top intersection number of the canonical is the same. Of the canonology is the same for both. That's one way, and that's the way we are going to do it: how you can disprove that two varieties of k. Okay, so that's what we want to do. We want to disprove the k equivalence, and then once we have that, obviously we also know that the varieties are not abstractly isomorphic, they can't possibly be. And what we want And what we want to prove is that these topical dissection numbers here are different. And so, what we do is we study the canonical bundle. It's the pullback of the canonical bundles of ARL or GIT plus a number of the exceptions. That's the exceptional boundary in the toroidic case, that's the exceptional boundary in the coronavirus. And the MGIT and the Bailey-Borel are IC. T and the Belieborel are isomorphic. So we're really only concerned here with these multiples of the exceptional cases. Okay? And then, so to prove that, it's enough to prove that these numbers are different. On the left-hand side of the troidel, you can actually explicitly calculate. You get this number. And then for the e to the fifth, E to the fifth, we didn't compute it, it's quite a bit of work. But what we proved is it's a rational number which does not have five in the denominator. And then you can do what you want. I mean, these numbers cannot possibly be. And this is a through slice computation. Before, also, when I said that in the current blow-up, the discriminantly exceptional The discriminant, the exceptional curve in device are not transversal. This is also a numerous wise computation. If it's work, you have to do it, but it's not that way it's clear what you have. Yeah, let me make a connection with the minimal model program. So, classical results of Bay Borel in the NEET case, and Montfort in a more general section. Case and Monfort in a more general setting is that if you have this pair, Vorel and T, this is the discriminant, this is a log connector model and a log minimum model. And if you go to the toroidal and you add the toroidal device, and this is a log minimum. So you can ask where does the three over four come from? And the answer is if you go from ball to the log quotient, you have ramification of order four. Of order four along that device. So this is why that is the correct pair to look at. So these are log minimal, everything, good. And then what we proved is that the analogous statement for the curving floor is not true. This is not a local model. Okay. Now, that. Now, that's sort of quite interesting because there's recent work of Odaka, which says that the log minimal models, if you take the right pair, are exactly the so-called semi-tauric compactifications of the sensor flow. So what we prove is that this is not a semi-toric compactification. But that gives us another result, namely, we can then read We can then reprove that this here the map F minus 1 is not a morphism because another very relatively old result of Alexander and Engels says that the semi-tauric compactifications are exactly those in this case between the unique toroidal and bailiberal and in general because between any And in general, because between any type four domains, between any torato convertible level. So we proved that we do not have a symmetric convertion. But then we can't have a map from here to here, because then we would have a map from here to here, and that goes down to Baylor Road. So that Mk would then sit between the two spaces, and by Alexa F angles it wouldn't have to be symmetrical. B-semicular. So that is another proof that this map is not a morphism, and it's a proof that does not use any topology. So it's a different. Okay, that is the story of the eight points. Let me come to cubic surfaces. Any questions? Any questions? Okay. So, cubic surfaces. So, this is with Caselana Martis in Kuchewski and Plaza. And this is actually the starting point. So, we have this MGIT, we have payload, we have the two parts of options. And well, we asked. So, what we did was we actually wrote a long. We actually wrote a long paper, it's just appeared as a memoir of the AMS, where we compute the cohomology of the moduli space of cubic free fields. Okay, and then we follow the various cohomologies. And the same techniques obviously work for cubicle surfaces. So we notice that these spaces have the same topology, so we just assume one and f and we are what else can it be? Let's just quickly prove it. Let's just quickly prove it. And so we wrote down two or three wrong proofs and then started wondering. And that was the starting point. What we really wanted is to know that. Okay, so as I said, these spaces have the same beta numbers. F or F minus 1 is not the most. The spaces are not K equivalent, so everything like in the 8 points, and hence. And hence, also not as isomorphic as abstract varieties. What we also proved is that these spaces are equivalent in the quantity. It's quite interesting because you can compute the exceptional divisor here. That is a P3, and you can compute the exceptional divisor here. Devisor here, and it turns out that that is a different one. And it's a Tori, it's a portion of a Tauric variety by an S3. And we can complete that Tauric variety and we can decompose it in the brain and we can look at reaction. So we can actually compare the two varieties of the other side of the data. So, as I said, nevertheless, this average automorphism. Yes, this evidence is automorphism, and these varieties are abstractly not isomorphic, but by Carlado Kiracheffle, if you take the level cover, this becomes an isomorphism. And that's a phenomenon which appears several times, it appears in the eight points, it appears here. We're pretty sure it appears in the 12 points. There is still some work to be done. We're working with that. We're working with that. There's another cases, and I've not yet fully understood what the philosophy is, why it's different in the standard situation, and by going to the level structure, the Hodge theory and the Royal situation become suddenly more compatible. There is something the the the Hodge structure always sort of forces transversality. Transversality, normal crossings essentially, and normal crossing optic directions of finite groups. And the Kerbin doesn't do that in general, but it does seem to do it if you add sufficiently much better structure. But there seems to be something more systematic underlying these formula, which I haven't got, which we haven't fully discussed. That's that. Okay. Now, the remaining cases, so you can go through the Limosta. Case of five points. It's slightly tricky with these things. Yeah. So six and twelve points. And 12 points. Six points is essentially the same thing. In this case, we have three-dimensional portions. And for, yeah. So the case of six points behaves exactly as the case of eight points. And all the methods and the statements go through. With it of 12 points. Uh, with the twelve points, we're still working on this. As I said, we do not know whether in this case the ordered case is actually a co-portion. We're thinking about that. What we do know is that this here is not an isomorphism. That we do know. It's again by the same technique. We do point geometry here, and here we do a inverse voice. And here we do a Mills-Wise computation, and we can have some non-transversity versus some transversal intersection, and therefore we haven't yet fully understood the tough points really. So, then we still have some cases left. We have seven minus eleven points. Seven, nine, eleven points, that just doesn't quite fit in our framework because that comes with weights. That seems that's a different story. But the five points is also again a different story because, in this case, the group is co-compact. So we needed to get a compact function. There is no issue about the cusps. Okay, so as always, with slides, one tends to be a little Slides tends to be a little bit faster. Sorry, you would have interrupted me. I would have minded. Anyway, thanks for listening. And if you have any questions, I'm very happy to try to answer. Thank you.
