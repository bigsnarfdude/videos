Thanks. Hi everyone. So I'm Matthier. I'm well I have a PhD in psychology. I'm working with what I will see with Faxan, who's here sitting in front, with Kate, Charles, who just presented, with Jean-Mac, with Matthew Gargant, with Diana and with Lara. So we are a bunch of people here in social sciences to well with I'll talk about our survey. Our survey that they represented with Felix. Without further ado, let's start sharing. So, before going into the study, it is important to understand what is dramatic social change, because our study is really anchored into that framework. So, a domestic social change, as the word implies, is a change that is dramatic, but what does it mean? Well, a dramatic social change is an event that is sudden, that will Sudden, that ruptures the social structures of societies and it also forces changes in the behaviors of individuals and it also threatens itself. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic can be seen as a dramatic social change because it was sudden, it happened quite fast. I remember being in the lab working one day and two hours later, the government sent. Hours later, the government said everyone needs to leave, everything is closed, go back home and stay put on the further notice. It also structured in many societies as school businesses were all closed, so everything changed quite quickly. Of course, it forced people to adopt new behaviors, such as wearing a first mask, keeping two meter distance with others, or taking care of your child 24-7 for a period of time. And it also pretends the cell. And it also threatened the self, but also a threat to the self because we generated a lot of anxiety. People didn't know what was going to occur. Would we find a cure or not, a vaccine? So the 2019 was a dramatic stroke. And this is an overview of the pandemic in Canada. That's why it began in March-ish, March 20th, if I'm not mistaken, and actually it lasted until. Not mistaken, and actually it lasted until July 2022, over two years and a half almost with seven waves. And these are the data points that I could use in my presentation. Oh yeah, so we have something else to say about this. Given that the COVID-19 happened over a two-year period, it is important to consider the logistical Important to consider the longitudinal aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meaning that at the beginning there were a lot of cases and the government applied many policies to restrict the spread of COVID. During the summer, as a number of cases, the measures were lifted, but in the fall, they were brought back up again. So, all those fluctuations in the COVID means that it is important to consider. That it is important to consider those considerations to really understand how people reacted to COVID and also how it impacted them. Now, in terms of factors that are used to predict behaviors, so behaviors here, I mean behaviors in line with sanitary measures to prevent the spread of COVID. A lot of factors. Of COVID. A lot of factors were identified in the literature, and for this presentation, I'll talk about the individual and personal factors. As Mathieu mentioned earlier, our Felix, I want to call, but the name of our survey is COVID-19 Canada, the NATO world as we know it. If you want more information on the survey, you can, of course, talk to us. Or just Google the name of the survey and just be like the first. Survey and it will be like the first search on Google. There's a lot of information on the survey. We have reports, 10 or 12 reports on different topics that are published in the website, there are also links on our different papers. And the project could not have happened without all those partners. So as for the team, for those vaccines who's in the project, and it was Eric who was done this morning, Titan Stone, who's not here, but who's a professor in political. Who's not here, but who's a professor in political science at Meghan University? There's Ramain, there is me, and then there's a ton of students and other collaborators. Now, that project was developed with three goals in mind. The first goal was to understand and inform public policies, so to be a guide for governments, to help them adopt better measures, better policies that would be followed by the population. Disease that would be followed by the population with the goal to limit the spread of COVID, of course. We also wanted to understand the dynamics of social change, which is a subject that Raxon has been studying since the last 20 years. But before COVID, there was not really finance, and then COVID happened, and it became suddenly quite important. It was a rare occasion to really study a change while it happened without putting ourselves in danger. Well, without putting ourselves in danger this study, so we didn't have to go to a war zone to study social change, it just happened in Canada. And we also wanted to create community intervention based on data-driven interventions to help people cope with the changes provoked by COPE. Now, if I get a bit more about the survey, so we have 12 ways of So we have 12 ways of measurement with 2,600 participants. The survey is representative of the Canadian population in terms of age, gender, and province of residence. Participantship rate from time 2 to time 12 is about 7%, and it did trade through time of course. We used, as Matthew talked earlier, Atlanta missingness to be able A plan missing is to be able to ask more questions and to survey more concepts given the limited time frame that participants had to consult. Even if participants missed a wave, they were still invited to further wave. So in the survey, it's possible for people that have ensured time 1, time 4, 5, 8, 9, 10. So there's a lot of holes in the data. The survey is representative of the kidney population overall, but Population overall, but it's a bit less representative for Canadians with lower levels of education, French speakers, and indigenous people. And in the survey, to correct sampling bias, we use avoiding methods to try to reduce the bias north. And over time, this is quite important for the conclusions of our research: is that attrition is I. Research is that attrition is higher for the youth and also for people who were opposed to the measure, which means that over time there is a slight bias in the answers that we give. Now, in terms of what type of questions did we ask participants, so there is a whole list, but just to give you a f few example, in terms of behaviorous measures related to adherence to sanitary measures. To add events to sanitary measures. We ask currently: how often do you do the following? I'm a scale to 10 all weights. So maintain a social distance of two meters, wear a furse mask, stay at home as much as I can. So it's a typical Likert scale that is used in social sciences since 60 years or so. We also asked what spends what how many times per day do you do the following behaviors and we also ask them if they agree or agreed or not. Asked them if they agreed or not with the measures, governmental measures, both at the provincial level but also at the federal level. Other examples, well now examples for human factors to try to predict adherence to the behaviors. So for instance, indicate your level of agreement with each statement. In general, I have a clear understanding. In general, I have a clear understanding of the measures established by the Canada's Public Health Agency. Another case would be: I know what maintaining social distance mean when we wanted to survey two participants, understand what each measures imply. And we also ask which were the three most trusted information sources that participants used. And of course, we have a lot more questions. A lot more uh questions. Those are only a few examples that I'll be using on the studies that I will be doing. Now, our work for this presentation was guided by two research questions. The first question is, how did compliance with preventive measures evolve during the first year of the COVID pandemic? And the second question is, what influences compliance with preventive measures? So, first, we want to Preventive measures. So, first, we want to look at how it evolved, and then we want to predict how the evolved respected or not, or complied with different measures. I'll be presenting quickly three studies. In the first one, we wanted to identify trajectories of compliance during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with the level of understanding the measures and source reliability. In the second year, the In the second and third study, we are especially interested to see if to understand how to transit from one projectary group to another during various periods of epandemics. The first study. So, in the first study, we wanted to examine how the understanding of the measures being coded as yes, I understand or no, I don't, and sources we had a multi. And sources' reliability can influence compliance with 30 measures. We use three measures: social distancing, contact limitation, and mass forum. In terms of factor to predict trajectory groups, we use a level of understanding of the measures, and what type of sources of information do people use to get information or to keep informed on code. That study used the first eight. Used the first eight measurement time of the survey, so from April 2020 to May 2020. Participants in the survey were selected if they had answered to at least four versions out of the eight. And everyone had the first version time because otherwise they wouldn't be in the survey. So they had to have answered three between the second one and the eighth one. So the sample instead of being 2600 was about 2,600. Well, it's about 2600 parts. Now, here are the directory groups that Eric and Felix spoke about earlier. So, this is all, so those directories are identified by the software. As the user of the software, how we need to well, yeah, there's many things that we need to do, but to determine the number of directories, we mainly use a look at the big indicator and we determine. And we determine the number of the three based on the data that is closest to zero. So it's really a data-driven approach. So for social distancing, what we see is that we have four trajectories. A first trajectory in green, with people that mention that they always keep a distance of two meters with others, representing about 25% of our samples. The blue trajectory is not as linear, but it's Is not as linear, but it's still quite high, representing 38% of the sample. The orange/slash brownish trajectory represents 34% of the sample. And lastly, the lowest group represents 5.7% of the sample, showing that for this group, the respect or the advance with this measure diminished through time. A similar pattern emerged for contact limitation, with the exception that the That the lowest group has a wavy pattern, but other than that, it's quite similar. And the proportion of participants in each group between the two behaviors is also quite similar. And what is the take-home from this? Is that usually the most majority or the vast majority of our sample respected the measure to time with the exception of a small group for which it was less. Less now. This is for mask wearing. Mask wearing was not enforced in Canada until July 2020. That's why at first only a few groups wear the mask. And what this graph shows is that there there were groups wearing the mask even though it was not mandatory. For other group uh one of them could be to adhere to that measures. To adhere to that measures or the mass constantly. And for the other group, representing 0.5% of the sample, we can see that adherence slowly evolves through time to reach what, 6 out of the 10. So they were wearing a mask after the time, one might say. The key findings of this first study is that the lowest compliance group represents about 5% of the population. Population. What increases the risk of low compliance? So I didn't talk about it yet, but basically, what we did is what characteristic do people have in this group compared to the other groups. And what we saw is that lower understanding of the measures predicted belonging to the lowest podium groups compared to others. Yeah, and same thing with. Yeah, and same thing with being young and to the right politically. And also, the use of unreliable sources of information about COVID was associated to belonging to a COVID project. That is for the first thing. Now for the second. Well the idea behind that idea was that during the first few months of the pandemic, more and more measures were put in place to limit the spread of COVID. In place to limit the spread of COVID, then those measures were lifted as the number of cases diminished. And we were interested to see how people behave when the measures are mandatory and when the measures are being lifted. Did they keep engaging in those measures? Do they change? We're interested in that. For this study, we used two presentative measures, social distancing and style. All the annex here that's type of achievement that wasn't there. Typology that's been there, and we try to then predict trajectory belonging and also trajectory transition using different factors. In terms of measurement time, for the first trajectory, which was during the mandatory period, we used three measurement time from April to May twenty twenty, and for the second period, the lifting period when the measures were being lifted because the number of cases was dimension. As well as you mentioned. It was from May 2020 to June 2020. And for this study, as we only used three measurement waves per analysis, we retained participants who had at least two measurement waves per analysis. In terms of results, on the left panel we have the results for the mandatory measure when the measures were mandatory. On the right Measures were mandatory. On the right panel, the measures were lifted. In both cases, we identified three trajectory groups. The first group, that we call high and constant group, representing 40.2% of the sample. When the measures were being lifted, it's about the same thing. Second group that we call high and decreasing 53% of the sample, when the measures were being lifted, same thing. Measures were being lifted same thing and the same goals. Once again, the derivative group represents between 5 and 10% of the sample. So most of the sample adhered to the measures with a minority that didn't adhere as much. The same results were found for staying at home. Again, three trajectories, group belongings is about the same between the lif mandatory period and lifting period. Mandatory period and lifting period, but also with the previous behaviors. And this table shows the transition between trajectory group. And the way to interpret this table is that people being classified in the low and decreasing group when the measures were mandatory, 89% of them were also classified in the low and constant group during the lifting group, meaning that only 10% of those classified in the low and decreasing group In the low-inducing group, changed projects. And it's in similar results throughout. Basically, what this shows is that people are quite constant in their level of adherence, regardless of if measures are mandatory or not. So, in conclusion, for this study, what we see is that we have studied. What we see is that we have stability over the trajectory rather than a change, so not a lot of transition. In terms of predict term, we found that LF literacy was associated with higher compliance, with belonging with higher trajectory groups. Also, trusting science was associated with higher trajectory group rather than lower ones. And perception of prevention. And perception of provincial social norms, meaning that stronger perception was associated with sustaining or changing to a higher compliance social group. What does this mean is that the more people saw other teenagers as following the measures, the more they belong to a higher trajectory group, or it increased the chance for them to go from a low trajectory group when the measures were mentally to a higher level when the measures were being. And the final study uses the same method as the second one, but here instead of looking at periods when the measures were mandatory to lift it, it's the endverse. So the first trajectory that would be used are when the measures are lifted to sit transition when the measures were mandatory. We again used We again used three predictive measures. The measurement time when the measures were being lifted from summer twenty twenty to early fall, and when the measures were banned again was during the fall. So during the summer, measures were lifted because the number of cases diminished and then were brought back during the fall. So similar results, but not presented in the paper form because we didn't have time to do so. Paper form because we didn't have time to do so. Sorry for the difference in the graphs. But here, for maintaining a social distance of at least a distance of at least two meters with others, when the measures were being lifted, we see three groups. The lowest group is always again 8.6% of the sample. When the measures were again mandatory, what we see, there's also this low, well, this low aluminum screw, we think 10%. Low advance group representing 10% of the sample, but here we see that the level of adherence tends to rise through time. This makes sense because this period is when the measures were mandatory compared to where they were not. Basically, so that means that the group with the lower level of adherents kind of got the message from the government or understood the measures of it and increased their adherents. Whereas for the two other groups in the measures, Two other groups, and the measures were lifted or mandatory, they remain the same. So, we here, we see a lot more people transitioning from one trajectory to another, especially for people who were classified in the lifting period being in the low and increasing trajectory. Well, only 72% are also identified in the low inconsumption group when the measures were Low encounter group when the measures were mandatory again. But twenty seven percent of the of that that group moved to a higher judgary group, which kind of indicates that when the measures are being lifted, okay, I didn't respect that that much, but when they are they were monitoring, I engaged a bit more. Question? Yes. So that's 27% of the 80%. So it went from 8% to 10% of the idiots that are. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. And which is a limit of this methodology? Because since there are always a low percentage of people specified in the lowest group, while lower percentage, as you said, represent even a smaller number of retatals. And for the other two trajectories, the results are similar as before, so showing not that much transition. So this is. So this is okay. Well, this is for, we looked at masks wearing when the measures were not mandatory and we examined transition with social distancing when the measures were mandatory. So we wanted to examine how does mass scoring will affect social distancing or be associated with social distancing when there's a change in the level of the measures. For mass coring, when the measures were not mandatory, When the measures were not anatori, since map was introduced early in the summer, with that explained why the trajectories are either increasing or high and stable. And for social distancing, well, again, we see two high groups of ideas with one that doesn't do so much. And here I'm going to read the slide because I just wrote it this morning, so I'm sorry about that. So here what About that. So he wanted to see whether max burring had any influence on social distancing compliance when it was reinstated, since both measures have a similar objective, which is to limit the spread of the virus. What we observe here is that even people not wearing the mask during the summer, during the lifting period, so mask wearing, people do not wear the mask, so people transfer here during the summer, they tend to move a group that has. A group that adhered to social distancing when the measures were enforced more ebook. And for the medium high group for mask wearing, we observed that people respected less at all distance since once they started wearing the mask. Meaning that for people here classified in the medium group for mask wearing when the measures were lifted, usually, well, what we saw previously. Usually, what we saw previously is that about 80% should do classified here, but only add 65% and the 25% appear, meaning that people who wore the mask that were classified in the medium group, rather than being also classified in the medium group for social distancing, were expected a bit less social distancing compared to others. Meaning that or it's a sign that if I wear the mask, I might not need to keep a social distance as much with others because I wear it. With others because I relevant. It's like those two measures are different. One against GL, but once again, one against GL. The key finding for study three is that when we showed another application of joint trajectory, examining trajectory between two different behaviors or two different variables, once again we have stability for I group of compliance. Compliance and since time is out, I'm just gonna move to my take-home message. So, what we see is that for many behaviors that we examine, the risk group is about between 5 and 10%. And different factors can predict monetary group level, such as health literacy, level of understanding of the measures. Understanding of the measures, trust in science, presumption of social norms, and I'll let you read the limits by yourself. And what now, what can we do now that we have those data or that we have a better understanding of those measures? Is that variables of behavior and perception are crucial to understand compliance. Crucial to understand compliance, which is quite useful at the moment to understand COVID, but also for further crises or in other situations. We could also explore other human factors to try to predict belonging to trajectory groups, such as anxiety, perception of risk, worries. For instance, perception of risk, we know that the older people get, the more they tend to belong to hydrogen groups, which makes sense because older people were more. Sense because other people were more at risk of having severe consequences from quote. And that's all. Thank you. Do you have questions?
