I'm sorry, I have to interrupt. So, every last speaker of a session would be the chair of the following session. So, if I am the last speaker of the first session, then I would be the chair of the next session. For example, Next session, for example, in our case, um, Barbara would be the chair of 1130 session. So and with this with this way, we go ahead and we don't have to assign any new chair or something like that. So, anybody in that session would be the chair of the next. Chan would be the chair of the next session, the following session. Thank you very much. Okay, sorry, you go ahead. Hello, everyone. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, now I'm going to share my screen. Okay. So, can you see my screen now? Yes. Yes. Okay, good. Thank you. Good, thank you. Okay. Hello, everyone. My name is Hawan. I'm currently a PhD candidate from the University of Waterloo. And today I'm going to give a talk about the double-sided cues with market markoving, arrival process, and abandonment. This is joint work with my supervisor, Dr. Chi Ming-he, and this work has recently been published in Stochastic Models. Here is the agenda of my presentation. Since the methodology we used to solve this queuing model We use to solve this queuing model is the multi-layer MMF process. So, I'm going to briefly discuss this methodology before we discuss our queuing model. So, let's start. First, let me introduce the background of this problem. The double-sided queue is a queuing model that each side demands service from the other side. And this model was first proposed by Kendall in 1951 as a passenger taxi service system. taxi service system where passengers come to a taxi station to take taxis. So let me use this diagram to illustrate the idea of this problem. So in this diagram, we use circles to represent the passengers and squares to represent taxis. And the different colors mean different types. So as you can see, we have three different scenarios: empty system, passenger skew, and taxis queue. So when there is an So, when there is neither passengers nor taxis, it is an empty system. Then, from this empty system, if the passengers arrived first, we will have a passenger's queue. When there is a passenger's queue, once there is a taxis arrived, we will have a matched pair leaving the system immediately. Otherwise, those passengers can leave the system without matching after a period of time. Once all the passengers get matched, all about Get matched or abandon the queue without matching, the system comes back to the empty system. Similarly, if the pass, if the taxis arrived first, we will have a taxis queue, and we can have a max pair leaving the system if once there is a passenger arrived. And from this graph, you can see those two queues, passenger skew and the taxes queue, can never coexist in the system. And this is a very important property of this system. This system. And there are a lot of interesting literature about this double-sided queuing system. In the 1960s, Doby and Gibbons started the queue length of a double-sided queuing system, but they didn't consider the abandonment and they assumed the post-non-arrival process. And then in 2002, colony started the double-sided queuing system with abandonment. And actually, those double-sided queuing system with abandonment has been applied in many other stochastic systems like period. Many other stochastic systems like a perishable inventory system, financial market, and organ transplantation. More recently, Aden and WISE studied a multi-type customer sub-site queuing system, but they considered more general matching rules such that whether or not two sites can be matched depends on their types. In terms of methodology, matrix and analytical method have also been applied in double-static. Also, been applied in double-sided cleaning systems. For example, in 2000, Takahashi studied a double-sided cleaning system with finance phase and they assumed the array process follows its Malcoving array process, but they didn't consider abandonment. And in this year, we studied a similar system, but they considered this experiential impatient times. Our model is similar to their model, but we consider this market markov. This market Markovian arrival process. So we have multiple types of customer and we assume discrete inpatient time, which is more general than the exponential inpatient time. So later, I will give a formal definition of our model, but before that, let's first take a look at the methodology, multilayer MMFF process. So MMFF process is a very useful tool and it has been applied to many real life It has been applied to many real-life systems like the dam control and the risk models, and of course, in QE models. And in damp control, the water level can be modeled as an MMFF process. And in risk model, the suppliers of an insurance company can be modeled as an MMFF process. Then in QA model, normally we will track the age or the workload of the system. In our work, we will define In our work, we will define an edge process. So, what is MMF process? Here is the basic definition of an MF process. An MMF process is a two-dimensional stochastic process. As you can see from the diagram, one of them is the fruit level, and the fruit level can go up and down. And the change of the fruit level is driven by the underlying mark of chain, 50, and the states of this underlying mark of chain come. The this underlying mark chain can be participated into three subsets: S, S minus, and S zero. When the underlying state is in S plus, the fruit level can go up. When the underlying state is in S minus, then the fruit level can go down. And of course, when the underlying state is in S0, then the fruit level can remain the same for a period of time. Now, multi-layer MMFF process fruit fruit. Process through the fluid flow process in which the changing rate of the fluid level is modulated by layer-dependent continuous time. So, for example, in this sample path, we assume there are three different layers, and in each layer, it has its own underlying mark chain and a corresponding changing rate. Then, what we want to do is we want to put them together. So, we need to define the transition on those borders. For example, here we have L1 equals 0. example here we have L1 equals 0 and L2 equals 3. So we need to know if the flu travel equals to is on the border. We want to know how long the flu travel will on the border and how they will leave in the border whether they are going to live in by increasing or leaving by decreasing. Another transition probably we want to define when the fruit level approaching the border either from below or from above, we want to know the probability of the fruit level passing. Of the flu travel passing or reflecting or entering the border. So, in total, we have six cases: like up closing, down closing, up reflecting, down reflecting, up entering, and down entering. So those six cases are expressed by those six meters. So now we have a well-defined multi-layer MMFF process. What we want to find out is the joint stationary density function. The stationary density function. Here is the definition. Since the fruit level can stay on the borders, so we have probability mass function if the fruit level equals to those borders. And for all other fruit level, we have the distribution function and the density function. Here we put the mass function and the density function into a vector form here, the border p and pi. So then we can have the, here is the result. Then we can have the here is the result. Under certain conditions, the final result can be expressed in a matrix exponential form. And the main part is here has been highlighted in red. And the remaining, like this C plus, C minus, and gamma, is used to determine the underlying states and their changing rate. So, but if the MMF, the changing rate of the MMF process, The MMF process can only be positive one or negative one. Then this C plus and C minus become identity matrix, and the gamma can be removed. Therefore, all we need actually is the red path. And that's exactly what we need for our QA model, because in QA model, the changing rate can only be positive one and the negative one. So later, you will see in our QA model, our final result is very similar to Final result is very similar to this threat path. So now we can go to our QA model. Here is the formal definition of the QA model. First, we assume that passengers arrive to the queuing system according to a market-Markovian arrival process denoted by D0 to DK. So we assume they are capital K different types of passengers. And we can find out the arrival rate of each type of passengers lambda k and the total arrival rate. And the total arrival rate lambda. And of course, we also need to define the inpatient time distribution for each type of passengers, like this. Then, similarly, we will define the arrival process of taxis. This is another market marking arrival process denoted by B0 to BH, which means we assume they are capital H, different type of taxes. Now, we can find out the Then we can find out the average array rate for each type of taxis and the total array rate, mu h and mu. And of course, we need to define the impatient time distribution for each type of taxes. Now we want to ensure the stability of this QE system, which can be expressed by these two formulas. So FKM means the proportion of type K passengers. Of type K passengers with infinite impatient time. Lambda K is the arrival rate of type K passengers. Then put them together is the arrival rate of type K passengers with infinite impatient time. Then we do summation from K to from zero to capital K. We got the total arrival rate of passengers with infinite impatient time. Of course, this rate should less than the This rate should lessen the total arrival rate of taxis. Otherwise, the Q length of passengers will go to infinity. Similarly, we want to ensure the total rate of taxis with infinity in patient time less than the total arrival rate of passengers. Otherwise, the Q length of taxis will go to infinity. And next, we will define the age process. Since we H process. Since we consider two sides of customer, so we can have the edge process for each side. But as we as we mentioned, those two queues can never coexist in the system. So the edge process can never be both positive at the same time. So we flipped one of the edge processes upside down. In our case, we flipped age of taxes upside down. Then we will have, we define the We will have, we define the 80 as the age of the system. Now we have the age process. Now we need to know the underlying states. We need to have three, the underlying state consists of three parts. First, we use ST to track the type of the passengers or taxis at the head of the queue. Now, since we are using a COVID-19 process, we need to know the underlying state of those two. State of those two arrival processes. We use IAT to track the underlying state of the passenger's arrival process and IBT to track the underlying state of taxi arrival process. Then we put those four parts together, we get a continuous time Markov process, and we define it as the age process. But still, this age process is not an MMFF process because we have just Process because we have jumps. So, what we do is we add fictitious periods to replace those jumps. So, for down jump, we replace them with linearly decreasing periods. For the up jumps, we replace them with linearly increasing periods. Then we will have a well-defined MMFF process. And this MMF process is special because the changing rate can only be one and the negative one. And the negative one. So now we can have the joint stationary density function for this MMFF process. Then we do sensory. We sensor out those fictitious periods we just added. Then we come back to the edge process, but still we have this joint density function for the edge process. Here is the result. As you can see, now we denote as fx. So the joint density function for the edge process is very similar. For the H process is very similar to what we got before for the MMFF process, but now we need to do normalization because we do the sensoring, then we need to normalize those constant vector u plus, u minus, and p. So now we have the joint density function for the H process. Now we can have all other queuing quantities we are looking for. Like for example, here I give one example for the matching rate. We define the matching as. Rate. We define the match as the number of pairs of matched passengers and taxes per unit time. So, in this expression, the first summation, this part, actually is the probability that there is a taxis Q. Then, the D minus B0 actually is the arrival process of passengers. The match actually is the arrival rate of passengers. Then, put them together is the just then put them together is the matching rate of matching rate when there is a tax queue. Similarly, the second summation is the probability when there is a passenger skew. So this part actually is the matching rate when there is a passenger skew. We add them together, we get the total matching rate. Then if we want to know the matching rate for specific type of passengers and taxis, Of passengers and taxis. All we need to do is using the underlying states. So here we use this EH. So then this probability becomes the probability when there is a type H taxis at the head of the queue. Now DK means the arrival rate of type K passengers. Then put them together is the matching rate of type K passengers and the type H taxis. Similarly, this EK. Similarly, this EK together, which means there is type K passengers at the head of scale, and the BH means the arrival rate of type H taxis. Then we add all of them together, get the total matching rate of type K passengers and type H taxis. And here is the summary of all the queuing quantities we can find in our paper. Like, for example, we can find the served. Like, for example, we can find the served probability and the abundant probability, the waiting time of served inputs, waiting time of abundant inputs, and the mean waiting time, and the queue lenses. And of course, we can find all those queuing quantities for individual types. Next, let me give you a simple example. In this example, we assume there are three different types of passengers, and they are arrived process for a market marking arrival process, and they are. And they are different inpatient type distribution for different types of passengers. And for the taxis, we assume they follow a posting distribution, but this person distribution can be decomposed into two independent arrival process. And actually, this in together, this is a special case of marking the Markovian arrival process. And of course, we assume they have different inpatient types. Inpatient type distribution. And then this is the result. For example, for the matching rate, this 0.638 means in one unit time, there are 0.638 matched pair of type 1 passengers and type 1 taxis. And of course, we can find all other queuing quantities for each type of passengers and the taxis, like the served probability, loss probability, at the head of queue, loss probability. At the head-of-scale loss probability before reaching the head-of-scale waiting times and queuencies. And of course, we can also find the density function of the waiting time of served passengers and taxis. And from the graph, as you can see, they are quite different because they have different arrival rates and inpatient time distribution. Last, let me summarize our contribution of this paper. First, we introduced a First, we introduced a very general double-side queuing model with multi-types of customers and environment. Next, we construct this multi-layer MMF process to analyze this queuing model and we can find a number of queuing quantities. And the averaging is quite fast. And currently, some interesting queuing models are under investigation. One of them is the double-sided cues with bad. The double-sided queues with batch markoving arrival process and abandonment. So, this model is similar to what we present here, but the difference is we consider the B map. So, with this B map, we can have multiple units arrivals at the same time. So, for example, if we can have six passengers arrive at the same time, but the capacity of the taxi is four, then we will have partially matched cases. Because out of these six, only four of Out of these six, only four of four passengers can be matched at this time, and the remaining two will stay in the system for further matching. Another team system we are investigating now is the standard PE model with multiple type of passengers. Their arrival process follows the same market mark of the arrival process, and their service time follows this fist type distribution. Distribution, and of course, the abandonment time, inpatient time are different, and it's quite a general distribution. And that's all my presentation. Thank you very much. Any new question? Any question? I have a comment though.
