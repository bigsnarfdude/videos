So, just to kind of set the scene of what sort of question we're trying to answer here. So, there's an idea, certainly I think it's a pretty well-known idea that if a ring has nice homological properties, you expect it to be nice in lots of other ways. So, here's maybe the most classical example. Here's maybe the most classical example of this. So, we have a commutative local Noetherian ring that has finite global dimension. That means it's a regular local ring, and so it's a unique factorization domain. So this is very common sort of phenomenon in commutative algebra. And I'm always jealous of the commutative algebraists and all their nice tools and asking, well, can we steal some of them? But of course, I think we all know. But of course, I think we all know that this is much harder to do in non-commutative algebra. So, for instance, we still have open questions. I believe if someone knows of a counterexample here, please let me know, but I think this is still open. So, if you have a non-commutative local Noetherian ring, a finite global dimension, must it be a domain? As far as I know, I don't think that there's an answer to that. And so, more in line with the types of With the types of algebras we're looking at in this conference. So, the famous conjecture here by Artin Taton Vandenberg is that every Art and Schelter regular algebra should be a domain, maybe even an Ethereum domain. So, for me, I won't generally assume that algebras have finite GK dimension, but if you're willing to assume that, then maybe you expect these to be an Ethereum. So, this is known in a lot of special cases. So, dimension. Special cases. So, dimension two, in Artin and Shelter's original paper, they wrote down all of the examples and they're all Netherian domains. Even in Dimension two, where you throw away the Netherian hypothesis, James also classified all of those and their domains, even if they're not Ethereum. Dimension three, there's this famous classification. Again, they're all in Ethereum domains. Dimension four, it's known that if you assume the algebras in Ethereum, If you assume the algebra is an Ethereum, then it will be a domain. But beyond that, it's open in general. And even in the case where the algebra is Kazul, so if you try to make things maybe a bit nicer, we just don't have any information in higher dimensions. So for me, just kind of the fundamental question that I'm interested in, if we have nice homological properties, how can we deduce nice ring theoretic properties, especially? Nice ring theoretic properties, especially in the non-commutative case. So here's a list of some nice results in this direction, just kind of for inspiration. So I'm going to just make up this term nearly local for a ring if R mod the radical is simple R Timian. So matrices over a division ring. Local means mod the radical, it's actually a division ring. So let's see if R is Netherian and Rs Nitherian and has this nearly local property. Well, maybe we would like for it to be a prime ring. At the very least, we can say modulo the nil radical, then it is a prime ring of a very special form. So it's a matrix ring over a local domain. If we have a connected, graded, noetherian Ausland irregular algebra, there's a result of Levasseur that this is a domain. A domain. Another one says that if we have connected graded algebra satisfying a polynomial identity and it has finite GK dimension, then it's a domain. And kind of in a similar flavor here, if we have one of these nearly local rings that's fully bounded and Ethereum, and it has finite global dimension, then a similar structure theorem here. It's matrix rings over a local domain. So lots of really lovely results. But in each of them, there's some sort of strong restriction, either a strong ring theoretic restriction. So, here we can't prove that the ring is prime. We have to kind of mod out the nil radical. Here, this is a, I would consider the Ausland irregular property, a very strong homological assumption. Polynomial identity or fully mounted. This is kind of close to mutative. So, this is kind of where the You know, where the general results stop. And just one thing I want to point out: a term that's going to come up a lot in this talk. So, these rings that end up being matrices over domains, they have an interesting property called being a piecewise domain. So, you can say that a ring is a piecewise domain with respect to some family of orthogonal item potents. If, well, essentially, you know, we know that these. Well, essentially, you know, we know that these item potents are going to give us zero divisors because they're orthogonal, but the idea is that essentially the only zero divisors that exist come from those. So if we have x and y in two corners of the ring and the item potent matches, if the product is zero, then x or y must have been zero. So it's like a weaker version of a domain. So just a few warnings here. So a prime ring doesn't have to be a piecewise domain. Have to be a piecewise domain. So maybe your prime ring has no non-trivial item potents, but it has lots of zero divisors. That won't be a piecewise domain. And in the other direction, so something as simple as upper triangular matrices over a field, this will be a piecewise domain, but it's not prime. It's not even semi-prime. And also matrices over a domain. So these are examples of these prime piecewise domains. So you can sort of. Piecewise domains. So you can sort of think of things close to this. Okay. So, what are we doing in this talk? So, now's my time to remind myself to mention this is joint work with Dan. So, the idea is we're going to present one method that you might try to use to prove that a ring is a domain or a prime using some sort of homological information. The goal is to, one of the goals is to The goal is to, one of the goals is to remove a lot of these strong ring theoretic hypotheses. So we don't assume that a ring is an ethereum or close to commutative or anything like that. And the kind of the generic homological assumption we're going to make is that we have a Kazul algebra, which is maybe not so strong on its own. But there is a trade-off, of course. So the homological requirement, rather than just having finite global dimension, it's going to be a lot more intricate. It's going to be a lot more intricate, so we're going to need to look at the structure of a next algebra and make some demands of that. So, let me just say a few things about Kazul algebras and some of the homology of graded algebras here. Presumably, this is known to a lot of folks, but just in case. So, we'll be looking generally at, you know, when we're looking at algebras, they'll be graded over the integers, positive integers. The integers, positive integers, but or sorry, the natural numbers, but we'll want each piece to be finite-dimensional here. Often we'll look at the graded Jacobson radical, so that's kind of the radical in degree zero plus the rest of the ring. If you take the quotient, you're going to get some finite-dimensional semi-simple algebra. And looking at the projective dimension of that quotient over the algebra. That quotient over the algebra sort of tells you everything you would want to know about the global dimension. So it'll tell you about the graded global dimension, and in most cases, it'll tell you even just the ungraded global dimension. So the AS regular algebras are going to happen when that degree, well, we'll require that that degree zero part is just the field. So that's a connected graded algebra. But we'll be looking at some techniques where you can. We'll be looking at some techniques where you can have lots of item potents in the degree zero part. And so, you know, in this case, especially with the Art and Schelter regular algebras, if you want to know what the global dimension is, you're just going to look at a minimal resolution of the degree zero part here. All right. So the X'd algebra that we care about here, it's X'd from K to K with the Yonida product. And it's famously holds a lot of information about the algebra. Holds a lot of information about the algebra. So, for instance, even just to compute it, you're going to have to generally write down this minimal resolution. If you want to understand the global dimension, assuming it's finite, this algebra will tell you what the dimension is. And again, most significantly for the types of algebras we're concerned about here. So, you can detect exactly when an algebra is Art and Shelter Regular by looking. Is Art and Scheltra regular by looking at the X algebra. So A is Art and Scheltra regular if and only if this is Frobenius. Okay. So, you know, if you have some experience with this, you know that in general, it's not easy at all to compute. But Kazul algebras let us cheat a little bit. It's a little easier to compute this. This. So, what is a Kazul algebra? So, it's going to be a connected graded algebra so that when we take this minimal resolution, each term is generated. So, this is obviously generated in degree zero because it's a cover of this. Then the next term is generated in degree one. The next term is generated in degree two, and so on. And one of the consequences is that these algebras have quadratic relations. Of quadratic relations. And so, you know, we've seen this sort of presentation already at this conference. So, if we think of this free algebra as a tensor algebra, and we write down this quadratic relations in this way, we can define what's called the quadratic dual. So, we'll look at the dual vector space, same dimension, but a different vector space. We'll take the tensor algebra over that. If we view If we view, let's see, this dual as V dual tensor V dual, we'll just take the kind of the vanishing set for our original set of relations, and that becomes our new set of relations. And so this quadratic dual gives us kind of a simple computational way to just kind of chug along and compute the X algebra. So this Port-Kazul algebra gives us another way to write down. To write down that X algebra. And also, you know, there's kind of this double duality that kind of lets us go back and forth between the two. All right. So if you, again, I'm sure plenty of folks are familiar with this. If you're not, probably the most classical case would be commutative polynomial algebras. And then the quadratic dual is going to be the exterior algebra. Exterior algebra on the vector space that generates it in degree one. And these skew polynomial algebras that we've seen, these are also examples of Kazul algebras. Even just for a quantum plane, maybe if you write down the relations here, you can see that it, yes, these are some sort of, I don't know, maybe a quantized version of the exterior algebra, something like this. Okay. So, all right, so what is this idea in trying to prove? In trying to prove that these rings are prime. So, there's, we learned about this method from the following paper. So, it's a paper by Guo called On the Primeness of Art and Scheltra Regular Kazul Algebras. I always give thanks to Jason for pointing out this paper to us. I think there were probably several years where he was perhaps the only person outside of the author who was maybe aware that this paper was out there. So, it claims to give a proof that. So it claims to give a proof that Kazool Art and Schelter regular algebras are prime, which would be a very nice result. Unfortunately, as far as we can tell, there's some issues with the proof, but there's a lot of interesting ideas there. So a lot of what we did was we spent a lot of time just going through and trying to pull out what seems to work and how can we adapt it. So there's this very generic construction that kind of understood. Generic construction that kind of underlies everything here. So let's take just any additive category and any object, and then any functor from the category to itself. And there's a ring that we can construct. So Guo calls it the orbital algebra. So it's a graded ring. So the degree I part, we look at homomorphisms from the ith iteration of that functor applied to the object back to. The object back to the original object. Now, to multiply, so let's say we have something in degree I and something in degree J. Let's see. So I want to multiply F times G. So what I'll do is I will shift G up essentially so that I can compose it with F. And that's my product. That's all there is to it. And this gives us a ring, it's an associative multiplication. So, just to give you a few examples, right? So, this is just very generic, but it encodes maybe some unexpected things. So, some very simple constructions that we can recover from this. So, for instance, if we take, let's take A to be any ring, let's take the category of finitely generated projective modules, maybe the opposite category, and we take the module A itself, and then we take this endof. And then we take this endo functor, which just twists the module by some endomorphism or automorphism. And you sort of wind through what this does, and you end up with just kind of a skew polynomial extension. So something very well known. Something else that might be familiar to folks in the room. So there's this construction of a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring, and you can set up just the general machinery. Set up just the general machinery in such a way. So, if we look again at an opposite of a category here, quasi-coherent modules over a scheme, you're given some automorphism and an invertible sheaf. And if you, again, if you just are very careful in how you write down the functor and you go through the formalism here, you end up exactly with that classical construction of these twisted coordinate rings. And well, the one that we'll be using most often. That we'll be using most often: a next algebra. So, if you have a nice enough abelian category and you pick the correct derived category and you look at the translation functor, and again, you just sort of run through this, this orbital algebra will be the X algebra. So, all of these things are special cases of this very general thing. So, the idea, you know, again, this goes back to Guo's paper, is that we, you know, To Guo's paper is that if you write down the correct conditions on the functor and the object, then some nice results might fall out for the algebra. So here's one example. It's actually a little easier. So here, the conclusion will be that we get a domain. And it's easier than sort of the prime example. So let's start with our category and our endo functor. And let's say that we have the following two things that are true. So first of all, Things that are true. So, first of all, if you shift f by this functor as many times as you want, and then take any non-zeromorphism, we're going to demand that it's an epimorphism. So all of those non-trivial maps are epimorphisms. And then second, if we have one of those epimorphisms and we shift it, we want the result to still be an epimorphism. So it sort of preserves epimorphism. The second one might be satisfied trivially, like if Satisfied trivially, like if f is an equivalence, if it has some inverse, this will be true. So then the conclusion is that this orbital ring is a domain. And just to prove to you that this is a very formal construction, I think we can run through the proof pretty simply here. So let's, it's enough to take two homogeneous elements and multiply and see that we get, you know, non-zero products. So take two non-zero homogeneous elements with their various degrees. Okay, so can you. Okay, so condition one will tell us that in particular G is an epimorphism because it's non-zero. Condition two says that, well, if we shift it by the right amount or by any amount, that power applied to G is still an epimorphism. But then F is non-zero, so when we compose, it's got to be non-zero by the epimorphism. By the epnomorphism property. And actually, that's all we need to prove that it's a domain. Very, very formal. And I say all that just to, oops. Oh, actually, yeah, sorry. One thing I wanted to say. You know, there's pretty well-known cases where, you know, one of these skew polynomial extensions is a domain or one of these twisted homogeneous coordinate. One of these twisted homogeneous coordinate rings as a domain. This very generic result includes both of those, which is not to say that it's a terribly deep result, but the idea is that it has the potential to kind of generalize these ideas perhaps in some new directions. Okay. So here's a condition that will tell you one of these orbital rings is prime, and it looks a lot more intimidating. And it looks a lot more intimidating. Let me just say that the proof is just as formal as the other one. It just, you know, there's more data going into this. So if we have a category, an endo functor, and let's say we have an object that has a particularly nice decomposition. So what does nice mean? Well, first of all, so when I write s, eventually these will be simple. That's the idea here. They don't have to be simple now. So, first of all, if we take any one of these and kind of shift it by f and then map to another one, as long as the morphism is non-zero, we want it to be an epimorphism. It's a, you know, satisfied if this is a simple object. Second one, so if we have an epimorphism of this form, and then we shift it further by a power of f, we still want it to be an epimorphism. We still want it to be an epimorphism. Again, there's some cases where that trivially is satisfied. And then, third, if we have some sort of non-trivial map, oh, sorry, if we have two distinct sum and here, then you can shift one of them far enough to find some non-zero map between them. So if the first two hold, then this orbital. Then this orbital ring will be a piecewise domain. And the item potents that this domain property is with respect to it are the item potents from the decomposition here. And if you have all three together, then you actually have a prime piecewise domain. So that's all extremely formal. And most of the rest of the talk will be trying to make this more concrete. This is more concrete. So, trying to put this to work in some cases that we might care about. How am I doing? Okay, can pause. Questions on these very generic conditions so far? Somewhat? Oh, maybe I screwed something up here. I could be wrong, but I didn't think so. Not to be a domain, maybe for some other property. Maybe I'm wrong. I'll check afterwards. Okay. All right. So the original application of this idea. Application of this idea, the functor that Guo wanted to use was a syzygy construction. So, you know, in the cases that we're looking at, these graded algebras, you can take a projective cover, so a minimal projective map here, and then the kernel there is a syzygy module. And what's nice is that, you know, we can get at information about the X algebra in terms of HOMs out of the Syzygies. out of the syzygies. The issue, very subtle issue, is that this is well defined on objects, but not on morphisms in general. So we have to be very careful if we want to treat syzygies as a functor. So here's a very basic example. So if we take something like an exterior algebra on a two-dimensional vector space, so if we take a module that's not strictly generated in degree zero, so Generated in degree zero, so we've got maybe two generators in two degrees, and here's some very simple map that we can define. So, you know, how do we want to define a morphism here? Well, the idea is you want to sort of lift to the projective cover and then restrict down here. The trouble is that there's lots of lifts here in the middle that give you a commuting diagram. And these lifts, the idea is. The idea is this morphism back here, it depends on which one you chose. So there's some sort of non-uniqueness here. We've got to be careful. So when are we able to define a functor? So again, the condition we really need here is a unique lift so that we get some unambiguously defined map on the syzygies, the kernels. So what sort of makes things work here is if we have What sort of makes things work here is if we have any graded morphism between these graded modules, let's say they're both generated in degree zero, then we get a unique lift to the projective cover. And so this Syzygy functor is well defined on this particular morphism. So that sort of suggests which category of modules we want to use. So beyond Kazool algebras, you know, Kazool algebras, you know, even if your algebra or your ring is not Kazool, we can talk about Kazool modules. So a module is Kazool if its minimal resolution has each term generated in degree I. So then if we take the syzygies of this module and we try to take its projective resolution, well, okay, the syzygies are generated in degree one. So this, you know, this is now our zero term is generated in degree one. Generated in degree one. Our first term is generated in degree two, and so on. So it's like a Kazoo module, but everything's shifted. So if we kind of shift back, so if we do a graded shift here, now we have a Kazoole module because this is generated in degree zero, degree one, and so on. So the idea is that if we take syzygies and then shift the degree, we get a well-defined. We get a well-defined functor on the category of Kazoole modules, so that additive subcategory. And it also sort of behaves nicely with respect to short exact sequences. So that's where we're going to try to apply this general or this generic machinery. So if we just translate the generic result. The generic result about orbital rings here, we end up with the following. So let's say we have a Kazoole module over one of our nice rings, and we have a decomposition, and let's say it's also semi-simple. So we're going to decompose it into simple parts. So we're going to consider two conditions. So the first condition says, anytime you have a, oh, by the way, let me just emphasize, every time, maybe I should here, just for every. Maybe I should here, just for everybody's sake, define F. So I'm gonna use this a lot. So this is syzygies and then we're going to shift. Is that okay? Okay. All right. So let's consider the following two conditions in this situation. So, first of all, the first condition says, Um, the first condition says if you shift up one of the sum ands by this functor and then map to another one, um, every time you do that, the kernel has to be kazool. Kind of an unusual condition. And the second is that, you know, if you have any, you know, any two sum ands here, there is some index, or sorry, some degree here. Some degree here, where if you take x from one to the other, you know, with the proper grading, you get a non-zero space there. So the first condition actually gives you a characterization of when this x algebra is a piecewise domain. And if you take both together, then it's actually a prime piecewise domain. Prime piecewise, don't they? And again, this is still pretty abstract, so I'm going to keep trying to make it more concrete as things go on. Okay, so what sort of situation might we want to apply this? So, as I mentioned before, we were interested in Kazoo algebras. You can actually use it a bit more generally. So, there's this more general definition of a Kazoo ring. More general definition of a Kazool ring due to Balins and Ginsburg-Sorgel. So if you have a graded ring, you want the degree zero part just to be a semi-simple ring. We don't even need algebra or a field anymore, really. And again, the minimal projective resolution. Well, really, the condition is that the degree zero part is a Kazoole module. So that minimal resolution is generated nicely. As before, this is kind of a quadratic ring in some sense. Ring in some sense. So if you take the degree one part, it's some bimodule over this semi-simple thing. And you get a theory of quadratic duals similar to what you have for Kazool algebras. You have to be a little bit careful. There's left versus right duals because this base ring here is not commutative anymore. But outside of that, things work pretty nicely. And so these quadratic duals. And so these quadratic duals still compute various X algebras, or maybe more properly, they should be called X rings. And you also have this kind of double duality that gets you back to where you started. So in particular, why does this matter? If you have one of these Kazul rings, you can realize it as an X algebra over its quadratic dual. And so that's what sort of puts us in position to apply all of that. us in position to apply all of this machinery. Okay. So there's going to be two conditions that come into this. So the first one, so and sorry, by the way, you'll notice from this point From this point on, I'm going to go back and forth between the notation r and lambda. The idea is r is the ring that we want to prove is a domain or prime, so sort of like our Art and Schelter regular algebra, lambda is a dual or an X algebra associated to it. Okay, so let's say we have our graded lambda and S is this degree zero semi-simple part, and F is our favorite functor again. So if Lambda is Kazul and we And we fix a decomposition of that degree zero part into simples. We'll say that Lambda satisfies the Kazul Syzygy condition if, so this should feel familiar by now. So if we take any two of these sum ands, we take large enough syzygies of one, or you know, you know, we go as far up as we want, and we map to the other one. We want the kernel always to be Kazoo. It's a bit of an unusual condition. But I think it's pretty straightforward to kind of read. And then the second condition that's going to come in here, some sort of quiver connectedness. So this is back on the original ring side. So again, we decompose the degree zero part. We look at the item potence coming from that. We get some division rings on the corner. We get some division rings on the corners, and we can define a quiver associated to R. So there's one vertex for each item potent and the number of arrows. We look at the corners and we just ask, you know, what's the dimension as a vector space? This is a little bit non-standard because you have to maybe pick a side and there's probably better ways to do this, but really it's just so that we can have a quiver to write down. So this is going to be called the underlying quiver and we And we use the term strongly connected. Some people use the term path connected. If between any two vertices, you can walk a path in your equipper. All right. So again, if we specialize the machinery here, we get the following. So if we have a Kazul ring, we'll look at the following two conditions. So the first is that the quadratic dual satisfies this Kazul-Syzygy condition. Kazul-Siziji condition. And the second is that the underlying quiver is strongly connected. So the first condition exactly tells you when your Kazul ring is a piecewise domain. And actually, what's nice is in this setting, the two of them together exactly tell you when you have a prime piecewise domain. Yes. In fact, maybe. In fact, maybe it'd be good to write down here. That's what it looks like. That's what it looks like. Oh, yeah, so there's a statement. And if you want to know when it's a domain, there's something analogous. So if you have a Kazool ring, again, the degree zero part is S, it's a domain exactly when, well, you want no item potents, so this degree zero part should be a division ring. And then A division ring, and then the quadratic dual should satisfy the Kazul-Syzygy condition. And in this case, there's no one simple here. So you're just looking from that single simple to itself. So back to the original situation where we were looking. This tells you exactly when a Kazoo algebra is a domain. So a Kazool algebra is a domain if and only if, when you look at its X algebra, it satisfies. Algebra, it satisfies again this syzygy condition. In this case, both of these are just the base field k. So every map from one of these high syzygies back to k, the kernel has to be consumed. And if you want, you can sort of stretch this and try to get back some, you know, there were all these, some of these nice ring theoretic results at the beginning. So here's kind of a ring theoretic result. So let's just say we have a local ring. Let's just say we have a local ring and look at the quotient division ring and write down the x ring associated to that. If this happens to be Kazoo, and if it happens to satisfy the syzygy condition, then your local ring that you started with actually must have been a domain. So there's some ring theoretic information. Okay. So maybe let me just pause there. So There. So, what I'm going to do next is talk a bit about some applications of this. Sorry, this sort of condition where you have maybe like a non-connected algebra, you have some item potence. When can you prove it's prime? But questions so far? If it is connect, so that that would be this, right? Yeah, yeah. So, you know, it turns the ring theoretic question into some sort of representation theoretic question about the dual. Yeah. Yes, that's right. That would be wonderful, but unfortunately, you know, I don't know of a shortcut yet. But yeah, so it is non-trivial. It's very non-trivial. But it's, again, it's an equivalent characterization, so somehow it's exactly what you would need to know. That's exactly what you would need to know. Did I see another question? Yeah? Yeah, so that's in the kind of this non-connected case, that's right. Yeah. Oh, you mean the particular decomposition that you choose? The particular decomposition that you choose, um, that should be actually fine in this case because you know this is semi-simple, but you know, yeah. So if you have two different decompositions, you use just kind of basic module theory, the pieces will be isomorphic to each other. Yeah, so if you pick a decomposition, it'll tell you about any possible. It'll tell you about any possible decomposition. Yeah. Okay. So let me say something about actually proving some rings are prime. So the goal here is to look at maybe some twisted collabio algebras of dimension two. So we've heard a little bit about these. I'll just kind of remind you. Let's see. So we've talked about enveloping algebras a few times. So if we have an algebra. If we have an algebra over your favorite field, it's twisted collabia of dimension D. So, first of all, you take A, you take a projective resolution as a bimodule, and that should be have finite length, and then each term should be finitely generated. And the second condition is this, you know, this Vandenberg bimodule condition that's come up several times already. And of course, the case. And of course, the case where this is collabiow is where this invertible y-module can be taken to be the original algebra. And so we, you know, for connected graded algebras, twisted collabio is the same as art and shelter regular. So you can think of this as kind of a non-connected generalization of art and shelter regular algebras. So in dimension two, there's a bit known about the structure theory. There's a bit known about the structure theory. So, one thing that we know is, as I mentioned, for a lot of these results, we don't really need to say much about the GK dimension. So here, if you want to know exactly when twisted collabio algebra of dimension two is an ethereum, it happens exactly when the GK dimension is finite. So that, again, from what we know about Art and Schelter regular algebras, this is sort of what you would expect. Algebras, this is sort of what you would expect. But you can actually prove this without any sort of classification. Classification becomes a bit harder. On the other hand, there is, you know, we can say something about the structure here. So if you, let's say you take a quotient of a quiver algebra and my grading on the quiver algebra is just going to be the usual one. So it's all of the arrows have weight one. Then you can actually say. You can actually say what the relations look like. So, there's some sort of mesh relations that are pretty well known to representation theorists. So, all of these algebras have those types of relations. Something that kind of controls the GK dimension, so if you write down the incidence matrix for this quiver, so look at count the number of arrows between any two vertices, the spectral radius of that is going to be at least two. And when it's equal to two, And when it's equal to two, that's exactly when you have finite GK dimension. So something about the kind of the size of that quiver measured in terms of the spectral radius. So what we can say using these results is the following. So essentially for lots of quivers, you get prime algebras, but we don't know exactly how many. So if we have So, if we have one of these graded, twisted, collabio algebras of dimension two, let's also assume that it's Kazul. That means we can use these results. And we have to assume every vertex in the quiver has at least two arrows leaving it. So it's some sort of non-degeneracy condition, if you like. So, in that case, the algebra is always a piecewise domain with respect to the item potents from. With respect to the item potents from the vertices here. And it's prime exactly when the quiver is connected. You can't separate it into two pieces. And that's actually equivalent to being path connected or strongly connected. So in this condition here, the degree zero part is just, you know, it's a product of copies of the field, one for each vertex. And that underlying quiver that came up before is just that. Came up before is just the quiver cue we have here. So the proof is pretty involved, but I just want to say a little bit about what goes into it. So because we have all of this information, most of the work that's involved is just verifying this syzygy condition, right? So this is where all of the hard work happens. So this X algebra, it has a pretty You know, this X algebra has a pretty explicit representation. Um, and so there's a nice result here due to uh Li and Wu, which says, you know, if we, it's a little more general than this, but in our setting, so if we have a quotient of a equiver algebra, if it's Kazul, then it's twisted collabio if and only if the X algebra is Frobenius. So it's like a non-connected version of this result for Art and Schelter regular algebras. Shelter regular algebras. So, what's involved here? So, you know, this is our functor that we're looking at. So, the idea is: if you have a Frobenius algebra that's very small like this, so because our algebra is two-dimensional, this X algebra terminates after degree two. And, you know, putting all the information together, what we do is we look, you can look at the possible. So, if you look at these maps and you sort of decompose the kernel. Maps and you sort of decompose the kernel into indecomposable parts, you can sort of very roughly classify what happens when you apply F many times. And essentially what happens is, you know, all of the bad cases go away, only the good cases left, and all of the indecomposable pieces are forced to be Kazool, and therefore the kernel of this was Kazool, and therefore you get your Syzygy condition, and that makes everything work nicely. Work nicely. So, what's a concrete case where this might give you some interesting information? So, pre-projective algebras are a famous class of collabio algebras. So, if we have a quiver, let's say gamma, it's double. You take the same vertices, you take each arrow, you add a new arrow that goes. A new arrow that goes in reverse. And so the pre-projective algebra has underlying quiver given by the double, and then it's got these particular relations. So it's known that they're all collabio of dimension two, as long as you know, gamma, as long as it's not finite dimensional, essentially. So there's some cases where it's finite dimensional. So there's a result of Bayer, Geigel, and Lensing that says. Geigel and Lensing that says if your quiver is connected and sort of tame in some sense, then the pre-projective algebra is both prime and Ethereum. But there's plenty of quivers out there that won't give you an Ethereum pre-projective algebra. But for a lot of these, we can now say that they're prime. And as far as I know, I don't think this is known. As I know, I don't think this is known outside of the Netherian case. If somebody knows of a reference, please tell me because I'd love to know. But so, again, applying this result to the setting of pre-projective algebras, we can say as long as your quiver is connected and every vertex has at least two edges incident with it, then the pre-projective algebra is, actually, I should have said it's not just prime. Actually, I should have said it's not just prime, it's a prime piecewise domain. So we've got that extra condition. Okay. Okay, so let me just wrap up with some kind of open questions here. So there was this restriction for these twisted Calabio algebras that every vertex had to be the source of two arrows. That really is necessary if you're going to prove that it's a piece. If you're going to prove that it's a piecewise domain, so as soon as that is omitted, so for various choices of quivers, the pre-projective algebra is not a piecewise domain, but by that same result, it still happens to be prime. It's just not a prime piecewise domain. So it seems reasonable to think that all of these twisted collabio algebras of dimension two, as long as your quiver isn't disconnected. Quiver isn't disconnected, that these should be prime, but it's going to require some sort of adapted methods because all of the results here give you prime piecewise domains. So you would have to have some sort of method that allows for prime rings that are not piecewise domains. And of course, the biggest open question was the first one, right? So back to the conjecture. To the conjecture that all let's just focus on Kazul, Art and Shelter regular algebras, Sping domains. So, you know, this results on when a Kazul algebra is a domain, it translates the question purely into the world of Kazool-Frobenius algebra. So the new question, just as challenging, but maybe gives you some new insight, is that if you take any Kazool-Frobenius algebra, does it satisfy? Algebra does it satisfy this Kazul-Syzygy condition? So maybe someday we'll know. Today we don't. But that's all I have for today.
