Thank you for the introduction, and many thanks to Jach and all the organizers. It's really a very nice event. It's such a oh, doesn't work. It's a picture now. Great. Thank you. So, yeah, thanks a lot. I kind of maybe I need to move it a bit. So, my topic today is on singularity formation. Of course, that's a very challenging. Information. Of course, that's a very challenging topic. So the focus is on models at the moment for fluid equations. Let's start from hydrodynamics. And we have the most common suspect, the Euler equation. And then in the incompressible region and on the entire space or torus. So I don't have complications from boundary and usually in two or three D, that's physically relevant. So here often So, here often we consider the vorticity form. So, we take the curl-off velocity, which satisfies the equation. And the velocity is recovered from the vorticity by the bills of all. Of course, there are many, many interesting questions, and the one I'm going to speak today is the singularity formation. Right, okay. And you know, in two D. And you know, in 2D, so here we have a transport turn and a stretching turn. In general, stretching is bad, but in 2D, this one, so in 2D, this one is gone. Okay, so here it's zero, and we only have a transport equation. So at least the regularity problem. The regularity problem is known for 2D Euler. Okay, but for 3D, so now we're in 3D. So that's the real question here. There is a long history of study on this topic. And so I'll go just briefly say that goes back to. Goes back to some reduced models for Euler. And here there are different ways of reducing the equation to simplified or simpler models. One is by dimension reduction. And another one, urally symmetry reduction. Reduction. And there's one more type. It's referred to as staudic models or shell models. Very different from the other two. So here basically you just consider Fourier coefficients and the interactions between different modes. Each area is a vast area. And again, I'm just going to focus myself. I'm just going to focus myself on this one, okay, today. So, all of the developments in this area have led to some important breakthroughs in recent time. For instance, the work of Chen and Tam Hong, the singularity formation for 3D Euler, and a bit earlier than Nase, no result of opportunity. Okay, so for this part, you can refer to Yao's lecture from yesterday if you paid attention. Paid attention. So, I'm going to be brief. So, now I'm going to talk about the developments before those significant results. So, namely, study on simplified models. Thank you. Okay, so this goes back to quite a long time ago the work of constantly light. Light and mild. So they proposed a 1D model based on the form of the vorticity. So they say, okay, let's just look at 1D and then the equation takes the form. Okay, let me put here. So the first reduce the dimension brutally to 1D and change the And change the gradient to a derivative like this, and they forget about transport because they're supposed to be a good one. And in one day, we do not have a build of our law, right? So the similar relation is given by here. So the H is the Hilbert transform. Transform. Okay, so you can recover the velocity u from the vorticity through this identity. Okay, and you need to fix some kind of a gauge, for instance, mean zero, or you fix at one point. Okay, uh, okay, so and for this one, it only contains the stretching one, and if you notice this identity. Is this identity that tells you we have an equation like this? And let me just tell you what is Hubert transform quickly. It's this integral, singular integral with the kernel one over x. It's a It's a degree zero operator. So the Hubert transform F, it's like F. Okay. That means here, again, very brutally, just look at the scaling. That's like omega squared. And you notice that's a Ricardi type of ODA. So you expect for the probable data, you expect finite time blow-up. Blow up. And indeed, they are able to find the exact solution for this equation. And from the exact solution, you can easily identify a class of initial data that tells you it blows up at finite time. Then, of course, this is it does not. It does not have transport. So then we go further to the degrees model where we put back so we put back the transport here, okay, and they even put a parameter a. Put a parameter A here because, really, the difficulty here is about the competition between the transport and the stretching effect. So, for such a generalized model, there are many, many scenarios. Let's see. Anyway. And so there are many of them, and that depending on practicing, depending on three effects. So of course, initial data. Initial data. You need to find the right initial profile. And another depends on the value of the A. So you expect that for small A, this one, of course, does not play a dominant role. Does not play a dominant role. So, stretch instead of the big balls. And also, that depends on your domain. So, are you on the entire space or you're on Taurus? Okay, 1D Taurus. So, here there are many, many results. If I just mention a few names, Chen, the group, and our Jendi again. JD again, and a lot of other papers. Okay. So, here you might think a 1D problem, how difficult can it be? But in fact, it is difficult. So, the methods they use are quite sophisticated. Roughly saying they need to find some nice profile first, and then they need to perform a stability. Form a stability analysis. Okay. Okay, so let me now move on to another model. Oh, great. Thank you. Nice. Thank you. Thanks. So now moving on to a model from plasma physics, magnetohydrodynamics, with Hall effect. I'm going to forget about the flow. So in the situation, ions are very heavy, they move slowly compared to electrons. So we approximate the situation just by the evolution of electrons. Just by the evolution of electron equation. So here we have the magnetic field satisfying this equation. And Gauss' law tells us divergence free of the magnetic field. So this one, if we take We take the current as the curl of magnetic field, then we rewrite the equation. It goes like this. And you realize that now here, this is the transport term, and that is stretching. So it's So it's whoops if you look at Euler again. So that's just one simple comparison. But in fact, if we look at a generalized version, say here. Okay, so Okay, so here we put a, like the generalized SQG or alpha SQG, we put this operator in between up to the negative alpha power. And when alpha is zero, of course, that's the electron MHD. And when alpha is a half, it's actually SQG, surface quasi-geostrophic equation. Equation and alpha x one, it's correlated, okay, and it goes this direction becomes more singular. Okay, um, so the electron energy is much, much worse compared to Euler. Okay, um, and you notice that the stretching here is stretched by a second derivative of the B, basically, so it's terrible. Basically. So it's terrible. And of course, this one in general, the singularity issue, it's very, very limited. The understanding is very limited. So our approach is just to follow the footprint for hydrodynamics. So let's see. Okay, we look at 1D models as well first. Models as well first. So we again we kind of do the same thing. Just look at project everything to 1D. So I would have and I'll just put a plus here, the sign, okay? Because it doesn't really Because it doesn't really matter. You can do a verb, a change of variable to get to the other side. And also, I'll put a parameter for this stretch one, which is the one actually the most singular. And I have no idea about the behavior at the moment. And again, the Biostafa law takes the same Same similarity, okay, in 1D. Okay, so for this model, without any dissipation, and when A is not zero, we know nothing, basically. So when A is not zero, I always need some dissipation here to get to local positives. Okay. But that's not the focus of today. So let's just see. Of today. So let's just see we don't have dissipation. And what we obtained here is that so we simply have a transport equation here. So we show that. So we show that we do have local anantic solution. And second, we can find there exist some initial data such that the solution develops a singularity at finite time. Time, okay. So, what is the scenario, right? Why? So, why can we see? How do we see this possible? So, what kind of a scenario do we have here? Okay, so here, let me draw a picture. For the initial profile, this is a transport equation. This is a transport equation. So, one feature we use is that it's transport. So, if we choose the data with the right sign and the right symmetry, and if that's what we choose, then the transport goes this direction here. Okay, so this is one second, it has a maximum Second, it has a maximum principle. That's not difficult to say. So that means for such a profile, the maximum point, minimum point, they don't change. So they just move with the trajectory. It goes all the way. So eventually you see at this zero, there is a derivative goes to infinity. Goes to infinity. But how can you say that goes to infinity at finite time, right? You need to prove it happens at finite time. So then we look at this quantity and the derivative of this quantity satisfies every Cartier type inequality. So then you know if you choose the right data, then it does happen at final time. Okay, so this is the one DCH. So, this is the 1D situation. And again, here, really, we use this transport feature. And if we have to consider this one, I'm out of idea. Okay, so don't know how to do that. But of course, again, if you use perturbation and the stability analysis for small A, you expect such phenomena should still happen, right? Okay, so that's that's. That that's that's um in the progress. Um, I do want to mention uh two things. So, first of all, um, how do we see this singularity like in a different way? So, let's take this complex wide function, the current. function the current and Hubert transport current and then you can derive that this satisfies the complex Burger's equation so then you possibly get this idea where it comes from right okay so this is one second I want to mention a work by Silvestre And we call around the time, we look at a different 1D model for SQG. It's transport as well. And the drift U takes the form the lambda that's half la plus to the power s and here we'll transform theta. From theta s, it's in this range. So, for such a model, they were able to construct initial data which develop finite time singularity. And I want to compare briefly between this one we have and another one here. Okay, so I'm going to be economic. To make use this part, and so let me remind you: what is this? This is a half Laplace, and in 1D, it's the same thing as here. And we notice that the Huber transform finds its negative identity. So, in this case, if S is one, this drift. This drift, the u takes the form H H negative theta X. So what we have, J, it's negative H B X. So you notice that the same degree, but different symmetry, there's extra Hubert transform here that changed things. And you can regard this as a kind of ending point. Of a ending point or boundary case of here. Okay, so in any way, that's sort of connection. Okay, so here's one thing. And you might think it's too artificial. And I'm not going to defend myself. So now let's move on to a bit. Hi, you are. This is my name. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Oh, thank you. Thanks. So now let's move on. Two and a half D. And this is not a model. It's really a special case for the electron energy. And what does it mean by two and a half? So we consider. So we consider the answers like this. So here, of course, that's the vertical direction. Okay. And A B only depends on horizontal variables. Okay. Okay. So that's what it's referred as two and a half D. Okay. And so now the little AB satisfy this equation. Okay, so here we are again here. So here we are again, here we are in 2D by this. It's negative BY, BX. When you just stare at this system, you might notice there's something interesting here. The first one is a transport equation, transport by the gradient B, which can be terribly bad because B satisfied this equation. And the numbing part of B equation does not depend on B. So here we are trying to search in some like singularity scenario. At the moment, we are not successful. There are some hints of how we should approach this. Should approach this by, I'm inspired by the works of the previous results for hydrodynamics, like Algindi, those people. So basically, you need to find a nice profile and then analyze the stability or instability near that profile. And one And one, to look for such profile, common approach is that you look at steady states. And fortunately, here there is a rich family of equilibrium. So here, the whole equilibrium family. There is a shear type. For instance, both A and B only depends on X, or both of them only depends on Y. And there's another clause, it's the radio. So both A and B. Both A and B are radio. Let's stand back radio for a while. So here one observation is that all the equilibrium of Euler are equilibrium of this pole. But beyond that, there are more. Beyond that, the more. So at the moment, we are quite far from finding a right profile to build up a singularity scenario, but we did find some other interesting things. I mean, really, so we need to find a profile. And we need to do stability or instability analysis. And in this situation, instability does not help. Really, what you need is stability. And there are real experts in the audience. I'm not going to get into detail, but just saying that for fluid equations. For fluid equations, stability is rare, instability is more often. So it's not that easy to find a right profile which has stability. So in any situation, I'll tell you what we are able to get. So we look at we look at one shear type of Shear type of steady state. So the A is Y and B it's trivial zero. And that corresponds to the original variable. It's the zero zero one. Okay. And here at the moment, what we are able to do is that we That we add this then a diffusion here for the B component. Okay, so I'll put a star. So what we can show is that for some proper initial data, we can find a global solution near such steady state. In higher order sublime space, for instance, H7, H6, this is A, this is B, okay? And there's decay estimates. But of course, what we have here does not give us any clue about. Clue about this problem we try to understand, and what I can say is that it's like a big board of a puzzle, and the board is very sparse at the moment. There's a long way to go. But if you think of this situation for Euler equations, hydrodynamics that took many decades. Decades going from 1D model to the results, the recent results for the actual 3D Euler. In the last few minutes, and I want to mention another result, which is more relevant for the physics community. So, let me first write down the result and explain. So, this is with a student. With a student. So we consider both, just the dissipative situation. Okay, so full dissipation, just a regular electron MHD. MHD. Sorry. So, what we showed is that we find regularity criterion. So, of course, it's a local well post. So, we find no mod regularity criterion. And second, we find the existence. The existence the existence of determining with number and this tool naturally indicates the existence of dissipation cutoff. Okay, so now I'll explain what is the low-motes regularity criterion we have. So we give conditions on both A and B, but only on low frequency. Okay, so the low modes part. And existence of a determinal wave number is the sequence of work we have with the Alexian. Have with LXI and other collaborators at USC. So we prove that we can find a wave number such that if two solutions coincide below such wave number, then they are the same in energy space asympatically. So both of them are saying that the high modes are not essential. They are dominated by the low modes. The low modes are By the law modes. The law modes of the solution describe your solution essentially. And here it implies dissipation cutoff, which was argument of Komogro going back to this Q41 theory of tournaments. So it says the same thing. So the low modes are the essential. The essential information you should care about for fluids, dissipative fluids. And why we care about here, and that's because in physics community, they are still debating whether such thing exists or not. And then there is a particular paper by this one. They said numerically, so there's numerical evidence saying that no dissipation at all precisely for this model. Yeah, so but again, it's a numerical. And one, the way I try to understand this that because it's a numerical, they cannot do simulation. Do simulation for very large wave numbers. So they may not just get up there. So the wave number we have here, it depends on time and it can be very big. So I don't think they are totally wrong. It's just not big enough, the wave number they use. So they didn't see this dissipation cutoff. So thank you very much. Stop here. Stop here.
