They are joint work with Hector Pastel from Chile. So, all the new things, but before the new things, let me give you a little bit of background on what I'm gonna do now. Gonna do now. So, what we want to do today, we want to look at families of elliptic curves. So, I am interested in families of elliptic curves. So, I want to look at things that look like squared equals, oh, and let me fix once and for all k a number field. Okay, so throughout the stall, k is always going to be non- So, K is always going to be a finite extension of Q. And I'm going to be looking then at families of elliptic curves over K. So I can look at something like that, A TX plus B of T, where A and B, you can think about them as rational functions in T, or even if you want, I mean, just polynomials in K. Okay, in one variable t. So, what I am going to be looking at, so if I look at this family, we know that, so I mean, every time that I specialize at t, so if I fix a certain t k, right, as long as the discriminant of, sorry, this is non-zero, this is going to give me, so if I denote this by Me, so if I denote this by, say, Et, the family, right, I have a curve ET0 specializing, which is a nice elliptic curve over k. I mean, so I can say in particular that the set of k points, so it's the model of the group, it's a finitely generated commutative group. So we have something like that. So I have my free part. So, I have my free part and my finite part. This is this model of value, right? And the question that I want to do today, the question that I care for, is I want to know how does this rank R, so this RT, what we call the rank of the model-wheel group. And what I want to know is how does this vary when I vary? When I vary T within my field K. So I'm going to vary T and I want to know how this rank R T okay varies with T. So to be more precise, I mean I could be wanting to know what is happening if I look at the set, say, Gi, right? And I define this as the sets of T because In k or whatever you're working, such that drt is equal to i, I could wonder what is this set? Is it finite? Is it not? So that's the kind of thing I'm wondering. I'm gonna not focus on this set, but I want to start motivating with that set. I hope it's fine. Okay? So I want to know, for instance, is this an infinite set? Is this fine? So I, any number. So, I any number, well, which is natural. So, I, any natural number, and you might wonder what is this set? How large is this? Okay? This is, I hope it makes sense to you, but if you have questions, please stop me. So, what I'm going to do today to be dealing with the question of how this rank varies within the family, today I'm going to use surfaces to deal with that. So, today So, today we use surfaces and be patient. K-3s are going to come to the picture. But so, let me start by introducing the kind of surfaces that we are going to be looking at. And they are going to be what we call our elliptic surfaces. So, I'm going to be looking at an elliptic surface. So, I'm going to say that x, so an elliptic surface, say over k. Say over k is going to be the following data. So is the data. I give you a surface, smooth projective, algebraic surface. I give you a morphism to some base curve B and I also give you a section. So let me draw and let me tell you what I mean by that. So I have my surface, it comes with It comes with some surjective morphisms to some curve, projective curve B also smooth, projective, make my life easy. And so P is this, what we call the vibration. I have my surface, I have a curve, and I also suppose this is not always the case for people that work with elliptic surfaces. For people that work with elliptic surfaces, but I do. And suppose that I have a section for this vibration. So a map that when I compose with pi, I get back the identity map of B. Okay? So I have a section. Pictures worth more than a thousand words. So let me draw you one. So here is my surface. Here is my curve P. Okay, and then I told you I have this map pi. Do I have this map pi, right? It goes through B, and what I'm doing, right, is saying, well, oh, I didn't finish my definition, let me finish here. So the fibers, every time I take a T in B, what I want, and for this to be definite over K, so I want that I have a section which is definite over K, that the map, I can think of X a surface over K, B a curve over K, and this section is definite over K as well. This section is definite over k as well. And then what I'm saying is: well, I have a fiber above t, and the condition that I want is that the genus of the fiber, so that this is a smooth curve of genus one, for all but finitely many t's in B. Okay? Well, that's um so I want that So, I want that this, and I want something more just to make my life simpler, but I mean, and also for my results to hold. I want that I have at least one similar fiber for the vibration. So, this is one condition, and this is the second condition. So, I have a singular factor for this prediction. And as I told you, so I draw this picture. And as I told you, so I draw this picture. I drew this picture to help you see things. And so my section is a curve. So it's just, by the way that we define, right, is a copy of B inside the surface. So a section is something that is here. And so why do I choose to work with surfaces to deal with the problem of how does the rank vary? Well, I choose to work. Vary while I choose to work with surfaces because above the generic point of B, I have a genus one curve, a smooth genus one curve. And the fact that I have a section gives me a point in this curve. So it gives me a K V point here, making this into an elliptic curve over Kb. So this lets me use. This lets me use what I know for Junus 1 curves over function fields to deal with this problem. And that's what I want to do today. And then I can go back. So this is an elliptic curve over Kp. And the Mordau-Veil theorem, as I'm assuming then, that I have a singular fiber, so I'm already with a non-trivial fibration. So, I have the Mordeuville theorem here that usually goes by the name of Languene Rau that tells us that the set of Kb points of this guy here, the generic fiber, that's the note is by E eta, so E eta Kb, this is also a finitely generated commutative group. So, this also has a rank and a finite part. Okay, now we can. Okay, now we get to the point where I can say something about this set here. So thanks to the work of first Lineron and then Joe Silverman, so Andr√© Neron and later his result is refined for the case of elliptic surfaces by Joe Silverman. So I mean what Neron was doing is he was looking at Was doing is he was looking at vibrations of bitter varieties, the fibers, and the basis doesn't, it didn't have to have dimension one. So it's a more general setting than what I do here. But Joseph Roman restricted to the case, to that setting here. And what their theorem says is that specialization lab, so when I go from the generic fiber to the special fibers to the smooth special. Fibers to the smooth special fibers, this is an injective map outside a finite site. So, this means before that the rank of the fibers of the special fibers, so this is used to denote the rank of special fibers. This rank is at least the same as the rank of the generic fiber. And why is this nice? This is nice because this allows me to go back to this set here and say that, well, if I is smaller, so let me, as I told you, they show this for, I mean, for all but finitely many points, so for all but finitely many t's. So, this allows me to go back here, and since this is holding for all but finitely many t's, this set here has to be finite every time that I pick an i smaller than my r, the generic rack. So g is finite if i is smaller than the generic rack. Okay, and that's why. And that's why I chose to look at this GI for the beginning, because I can indeed say something about them, but from now on, I cannot say nothing more about these guys. But so we know something, but we still don't know. So now the question remains is what is happening for the remaining GIs? So if I look at GR, GR plus one, and so on, how large are they? Are they also like maybe finite in the beginning? Like maybe finite in the beginning and then not, or are they maybe large for R and for R plus one, and then maybe not later. So, what's happening later? Well, there are, I mean, a conjectures that if you would order elliptic curves by height, you expect that your rank 100% of the time is either R or the rank R plus one. But this is a conjecture, it's not shown. So, since the It's not shown. So, since I do not, I mean, I cannot say much more about the sats, the question that I want to deal today. So, today, I am interested in the following question. So, we know that the rank is at least R. And today I want to know when can this inequality be made to be strict? So, and when this happens, we say that the rate is going to jump. So, today we want to. So, today we want to kind of investigate rank jobs. So, I want to know when do I have this happening? When is this inequality a strict inequality? Okay. And well, and of course, I'm going to get there. I want to do this for x, k3. Okay, that's what I want to do today, and that's what. That's what I want to do today, and that's where I'm going to get to today. And moreover, maybe I can say this now, I usually wouldn't do that. So, as I told you, I mean a silverman, he built up on work of Andre Neron. And what Neron, when he's dealing with higher-dimensional bases, and what he shows is that the specialization map is injective outside a standard. Outside a sin set of B, a sin subset inside of B. So I don't expect that you know what a sin subset is, so I can introduce this already now before I go on. So my board has been locked. See, yes, okay. Okay, great. I think one side is probably enough. So, what is a thin set? As I said, let me just write here, write neuron, show the specialization. So, when I go from the generic fiber to the special fiber, which means I fix some special value of t. Outside, so everywhere except in a thin subset. So what is a thin subset? So this is a definition that goes back to Serb, but even the motivation to this definition goes back to maybe Hilbert. Maybe Hilbert, even, and the definition for synth sets is the following. So here I can take V, any algebraic variety, but for our talker, taking projective, but doesn't matter. Projective, and K is our field, but doesn't have to be like number field. Number field or variety over k and I'm gonna take t a subset of points of vk and I'm gonna define I'm gonna say that t is seen inside this set V K if it is contained so if T is contained in some set Z K union K union phi i of Yi K where Z K is a proper Zariski closet of V and this phi I's are generically finite dominant morphisms. So they are just covers of V with degree at least two. So just think covers. So it's like a Zariski density turbo property, right? You are, and this, sorry, let me put a union for finitely many such guys. So you're thin, if you can be squished into. Be squished into a union, which is finite, a union of Zariski closed set, which is proper Zariski closed set inside of your variety of VK, the set of K points of the variety, together with a finite union of this images of K points via covers of your variety, okay, of degree at least two. At least two. And that's when you have thin. So help me out here. If V is P1, what do I have to show that a set is not thin? So if V is P1, I want to show that some subset is not thin. I want to do this later, so I really need help here, right? Okay, there's a lot of speaking. Okay, there's a lot of speaking, so I do all. So I have VRP1, and I have to show that for any finite number of covers that I give to you, right? So I give you finitely many, I don't know what they look like, but I have this finitely many covers of degree di, di at least two, right? And I have to show, right, that this set that I'm going to call whatever, I don't want to call T because T was first name. Called T because T was for thin, so not thin, instead N. I want to show that for every time that I give you these covers, right, I have a point here that falls far from these covers, right? Every time that I give you finitely many covers, I can still find a point that doesn't lie there every time that I do that, right? Right? So there is a point. So given any set finite list or set of covers, right, there is always a point of P in N K which is not in these images. Right? I I can get far from them. Every time that I give you a finite list of covers, I can just get away from them. And so now I get to the point where I can tell you what is kind of known then. We want to do ranked drums for K-3s, and I can now go back to. Now, go back to well, let me complement what I want to do today. So, I want to show that I have a rank drop. I want to show that I have a rank drop not only for an infinite set of fibers, but also for moreover for a non-sense set of fibers. Okay, is this clear what I want to do now? So, I want to show that I. Now? So I want to show that I have a rank jump on a nonsense subsex of fibers. Okay? So if I reformulate maybe my set, right, I can rewrite. I can rewrite G was not a great sense because, well, for ranked drums, right, either I would take the union of all the GIs for I at least r plus one, and that's, I mean, that's what I'm gonna do here, right? But I'm gonna give a name down to this set because so I'm gonna call, instead of working with the set GI that I introduced there, Gi that I introduced there, I'm going to be working today. I will replace now the set GI by the set Fi, which is such that R T is at least I. Okay? Because that I have a little more control. I mean, it is also very interesting and very nice. Very interesting and very nice to study the set of fibers that have rank precisely a certain number, but that's not what I'm going to do today. So today I'm going to be looking at a set of fibers that have ranked jump. So what I want to look at, so today rephrasing what I just wrote in the blackboard, I will show that SR plus one is not sin. Is not sin in the notes. Right? So that's what I want to do today. And this notation is going to get a little more complicated because when I started, I defined an elliptic surface. So what's this data? X together with pi, right? But as you probably all know, when I'm working with K trees, I can have a lot of. Working with K trees, I can have a lot of pies, such pies. So I have a lot of, I mean, like possible vibrations. So when I'm working with some surface, and so with K trees that can have many elliptic vibrations with sections that are not of product type, and this is the one class where this can happen, I will keep pi in the set definition. So it's of f r plus one, pi. Yes. Comma pi, yes. Sorry, for P1, what's the difference between a thin subset and a finite subset? Ah, no, so a finite subset. So let me give you an example of a set which is not finite, but it's in the squares. Right? Every number, so the set of t squared, right, is inside the image of the map from the one. Of the map from P1 to P1 that takes T to T squared. It's a map of degrees. But this is not contained a property or it's the post set. The empty set. What do you mean? I mean it's contained in this union. What is this in the definition? So you take T, the set of squares. Yeah. What is the Z that you take in the definition to show that it is thin? To show that it is thin? I mean, you can take any finite z here, but this is a thin set because of this part here. But this is an infinite set. You can take even z equals at one, which is redundant because it appears here. It's not an issue. I see, I see. Is it okay? So any power, all the squares, the powers, they are simple. And it's actually a very nice question because it allows me to say that. That when I started studying this, it was really not clear at all that the set or the rank jumps, so this is the rank jump logus, that this is going to be a set which is not sin. I knew and we know from many results, from many people from before, including, I would say, one of the first people was David Hoalish, by looking at like root number variations and so on. Number variations and so on, you knew that it would vary, so you would have rank jump on a large set. But every rank jump that he would show, for instance, was on a set that was sin. And all the rank drum that comes from doing base changing is happening on something which is sin, right? Every time that I do base change, the rank drum comes from the base change, which is. From the base change, which is a map of degree, whatever. But it's inside this. So it's also things. So it was really not clear that you would have something which is not same, even though you expect that half of the time you're going to have regal equal to r plus one. So you expect that this is a large set, right? But that it's, I mean, I would say that not saying I see this, right? And something between, right? You would say, like, Joe Silverman was expecting. You would say, like, Joe Silverman was expecting to have some kind of a density result for the rank drop. You have so far many results was showing that this happens in an infinite set. And today, what we are doing is saying, no, okay, it's more than just an infinite set. It's a set which is not thin. So you are far from being really density on the sense that he wanted, but we are much more than being just a very large set. It's more than that. It's more than that. And so, kind of informally, what you want, right? What if I say that this set is not a thing, I'm telling you that there is no finitely, sorry, no finite, non-trivial list of polynomial conditions that can be used to describe it. You cannot describe this set with a finite list of just polynomials, which are not just maybe trivial polynomials. So I find this a very nice result. Nice result somehow. But let me tell you a little bit of what we knew before. And so what did we do? So no results for rank drunk. And now I will not tell you everything that is known. So let me rectify this by. Rectify this by saying some known results because I could stay here one hour telling you all people that worked on reg drums. I kind of mentioned one here that did this without even really wanting, but there is a lot of results from this vibe, variation of the root numbers. But I'm going to tell you some which are not from the vibe of variation of root numbers. And one of, I mean, you have a lot of constructions that already go. That already go back using Way's changing to the home, where he took a rational elliptic surface with modern variable rank as large as possible, namely out of eight, and he did three base changes and then he got rank jump of three by doing three very specific base changes. So, on the 50s already, there was this kind of construction of base changing, and then a lot of people. Base changing, and then a lot of people use this construction and others use this to produce elliptic curves with high rank on with high ranks. And this is started, so this was first the lifted card with rank 11 due to Nehru, and then. 11 due to Nehru, and then there were a series of papers that came maybe in the 80s or 90s with curves of rank 13, 14, and so on. And then there was this result of the year 2000 by Henry Billard, where he shows that, and now he's using really, I mean, they were also using the surface, but it was really specific surfaces. And now he deals with a class of surfaces, namely, surfaces that are. Mainly surfaces that are rational over Q. So this means that I have a birational morphism defined over the field Q. Okay, so it's a restrictive condition and the pi, the vibration known as a trivial, then he used height theory to show that f r plus one is infinite. And then, well, I started looking at his paper when I was a student, and one of my goals was to kind of improve this result somehow. And that's what I did. Then this is, so this I will put in 1999, but I think it was published a little later. And this also, I think it was published in 2011, but I think it's, I was working on that much before. And then my hypothesis will be that I have. My hypothesis will be that I have k uni rational, right? So it's already much nicer, and I don't need the hypothesis of is a triviality, then I have f r plus one is infinite. And if I put plus extra hypothesis, where extra hypothesis means essentially that I have two conic bundle structures. I actually just needed one, but I didn't see this at the time. But I didn't see this at the time. So, but extra hypothesis, I actually get, and this is quite nice, that r fr plus 2 is infinite. Okay? And so then later I retook this, as I said, at this point, we have nothing about being sin or non-sin. And I met Dan Logran at a workshop a few years ago, and his question by watching. And his question by watching a talk on a work that I had done generalizing this to families of abedian varieties, which is also, we get some similar results. And then he's asking, is this rank jump in a non-sin set? I mean, people were starting again to revisit Hilbert's main theorem and so on and thinking about synth sets. And so he asked this, and I said, I have no clue. I mean, if you look at one basic. I mean, if you look at one base change, it is steal just by the way that we construct it. But it could very well be that the set where the rank grows, where the rank jumps, is not steal. And then together with them, so and this was published last year, but the result is from the year before, we show actually that if your surface, so here you have a rational, but I have Have a rational, but I have x is geometrically rational. So just any, I mean, as you know, right, rational elliptic surface, and I assume that I have a bisection for the vibration with a smooth bisection of arithmetic genus zero. So of genus zero. So in this case, we show that That FR plus one is not sin. And moreover, if actually the fabric is not the one that has two I0 star fibers, then FR plus 2 is not seen. And for the one that has two I0 star fibers, the problem is that if we have a two torsion definite over the ground field, then also F R plus two is not same. Then also FR plus 2 is not z. So we get a lot of places where FR plus 2, essentially for most cases, is also not zero. So this was also, for us, was something that we didn't know if we had to expect this or not. But then I will get to the point of today, finally. So to the new result. So to the new result, and as I already told you, it's about k3. It's a rational elliptic surface. I see, okay. So it's a geometrically rational elliptic surface, and so this means that you can realize it over the algebraic closure as a blow-up of the plane in nine points in the pencil of cubics. So, nine base points of a pencil of cubics. So, uh So, but the surface is definite over K. Okay, and also so is pi. So, the surface, the section, everything is definite over k, but I can realize it by going to k bar as a blow-up of the plate. Which is... So today we decided then with Min Hector to look at this. To look at this, what is happening if I leave the realm of geometrically rational elliptic surfaces, which is what is in this blackboard here, everything is a rational elliptic surface. And so what we show is this is the main theorem today. Today, of my talk of today, so this is and it goes as follows. So, I have I an elliptic vibration, so an elliptic K3 surface. So, this means that I'm assuming implicitly that I have a section, okay? A section okay for this vibration, and I'm assuming, moreover, which such that I want it to be known as the trivial, which is so such that pi is known as a trivial, and I also want it to have no non-reduced fibers. And I have to say that this hypothesis, I mean, I just don't state it differently because I didn't write it with a lot of details, but I'm pretty sure that I can remove it and replace it by has at most two non-reduced fibers. Or maybe three if I put more hypotheses on it. But I think I can replace it by, okay, three. It by a K3, which is non-isotrivial, elliptic, and has at most two non-reduced fibers. This is much better because if you have classified and look at elliptic vibrations inside K trees, you see that it's normal that they have a lot of non-reduced fibers, right? A lot of nice vibrations will have non-reduced fibers. So I don't want to avoid them, but for today, the proof that I will give to you. For today, the proof that I will give to you actually needs this hypothesis, okay? But I'm pretty much sure that I don't need it. So assume that there is this other vibration loop from x to p1. So everything is definable for k. K then the following are equivalent. The following are equivalent. So first, the set of K points is a risky death in X. Second, F R plus one bytes, this set here, I'm putting K just to be kind of Kind of more precise, this is infinite. So, as we actually wrote in our paper, we wrote, pi has the rank jump property, which means that it has infinitely many fibers for which the rank jumps. And third, F R plus one inside of B or P1K and B or P or P1K and the set is not C. So that's what we showed. And so this is one result that we showed. We have other results. We have special results for other classes of other types of K-3s, assuming a little more. So the following are equivalent. Of course, that some implications are just trivial, right? You agree with me? You agree with me? Which ones? What is clear to you? Right? If it's Zariski dance. Well, you said non-thin implies infinite. Definitely, right? Non-stain implies infinite. I agree. Also implies... If you have an infinite set here, you have the risky density, right? If you have the rank jump happening to infinitely many fibers, I also have the risky density, right? Also, have the risky density, right? And if it has the risky density, I mean, Mirau's theorem, which bounces the torsion uniformly, also tells us that I will have rank jump, right, in an infinite set. So, a lot of things, I mean, the hard part, right, is to show. So, what we want to do today, well, what is missing essentially is that one implies three. One implies three. That's what we're going to show. Okay? And let me tell you that Ethereum is not empty, but I guess you believe me, huh? Do you believe me? Yes. Okay, but still. So, okay, we start. Example. Example. So I start with, for instance, For instance, extremo K3, I start with an extremo K3 and me start okay with an extremo K3. So this means right that the P car is the maximum over C and I have well extremoelliptic K3 with respect to the vibration. So pi, the vibration has Uh model value rank so it's of pi is zero, right? Okay, so of course I can define this concept over a number field upon just passing to C. This makes sense. Okay, so I'm gonna take an extreme okay 3, define it over a number field, which means that the geometric PR rank is 20. Okay, and I know, right, thanks to Shioda, I know. Right, thanks to Shioda in Oslo, that this extreme OK3 will have plenty of elliptic vibrations, right? And some of them will even have positive model value ranks. So upon passing to the field where this positive model value rank happens, I am in this situation. Right? So other elliptic K trees with R bigger than zero, in particular over the field where this vibration is defined, and we know that there is a number field where this vibration is realized, I have positive Mordovio rank. So over this field, I can play this result. And I will guess that the rank jumps from. And I will guess that the rank jumps for five in a non-since app. And there is a lot of extreme okay trees with non-reduced fibers. For instance, the 112, thanks to Shimada Zangor, is this right? Extremal semi stable and elliptic K trace over a field of characteristic z. Field of characteristic zero. Algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Right, so there I will be able to produce examples, but also from my papers with Alhichi, the classification papers, there are not many examples. I mean, with, I mean, in all lists, we find federations that will have even positive rank. You have even positive rank and non-non-reduced fiber, but the majority of the vibrations have more, I mean, have non-reduced fibers. But for instance, if you take the K3 with a non-symplectic involution that fixes a genus 1 curve and only one rational curve, this has two elliptic vibrations, namely one that has an I2 and another one that has nine I2s. So I can play this for those vibrations. So, I can play this for those vibrations. Okay? But I hope we can play for many more. So, now I have five minutes to give you an idea of the proof. So, I will really, I'm very sorry that I spent so much time on the motivation and so you know in the proof, but I'm here the whole week to clarify to those who care to know what goes on in the proof. But the proof is very much motivated by what is the proof of the proof Motivated by the work of Bogomalov and Schinkel. And so we introduce, so where in their work in the year like 99, 2000, they introduced this notion of salient multi-sections in order to show potential, I mean, potential density for elliptic surfaces, for Elliptic surfaces for an equal surfaces and for some catry surfaces that have a so they introduce basically what we do is that we tweak we modify the definition that they give to fit our i mean what we want to do so what we do is we introduce a type of multi-section a new type of multisection Which is what we call salient, but for the vibration and a given finite set of the base, then we show that the fibers of new are of this type essentially where Essentially, where the fibers means there is a Zariski open of the base where the fibers are of this type. And we also show that multisections of this type, so of this given type, so-called that means salient, they give rate jump upon base changing. So I'm sorry. So, I'm sorry I didn't explain a little bit what I meant by Reynolds upon base change. And by that, I mean that I have my starting vibration, I have my multi-section, say C, okay, and I do the base change by this. And then, well, I'm gonna look at so this here gives me a new elite. Gives me a new elliptic vibration. Every section of here pulls back to a section of here. In particular, the model vehicle rank of this new vibration is at least the same as that one here. But I have a new section, which is the section that comes from C. So what I have to do is to be smart to make C give a new section which is Z linearly, which is not dependent on the ones that came from. On the ones that came from the pool match, of those here. So I have to create C in a way that gives something new, but moreover, C has to have infinitely many rational points so that I can go back and specialize, right? I want to use, I mean, here I can know by Silverman that for all but finitely many coins in CK, the rank is that rank. In particular, when I Rank. In particular, when I go back for all but finitely many guys in CK, the rank of this specialization by this F is going to be larger. Okay? So, but I have to do this in a way that it's working well. And the concept that we use is that which is salient for pi and for t. And being salient for pi and for t means that, so I will be very sketchy, but means that when I look at this map, so I'm also. At this map, so a multi-section has a map to the base which I call f, and I want that f is rammified. So all the branch points that me rewrite, so all branch points of F are in the open set of good reduction minus the finite set T. So if all So, if all the branch points happen here, then if you have some multisection of that type, the base change has to give something new. And why is that? Essentially, because if the base change wouldn't give you something new, okay, when I would, this means that I would be able to write something like n times this new section, right? This new section, right? So there would be something, say that this section here, C is contained here with a sigma, right? It would be, I think, I don't want to write sigma composite with F, something like that, okay? But the point is that I would be able to write the intersection points of C, right, with any fiber of the vibration pipe. Of the vibration pi, okay, they would be lying. So, C intersection with any fiber of my vibration would be lying in a set which is a torsor for the n torsion points of the elliptic curve. So, being a torsor is telling me that they all have the same number of points. Points. So it cannot be ramified there. But I just suppose that all my ramification is here. So I am getting this contradiction from the fact that my ramification lies in this special place here. And then my next step would be to show that multisections that come from this vibration knew any different elliptic vibration than pi. I mean, elliptic vibration that pi are giving you something which satisfies this definition. And the harder part, I guess, is to show that this is happening in a non-synth set. And for that, usually what you have to do, you really have to use the fact that you have many fibrations, sorry, that you have many fibers and not only one. So for that, you call your set T the set of branch points. So you start. So you start. Remember that I asked you, I went one minute over time, I will stop. Remember that at some point I asked you the question: Is what I have to do to show that a subset of P1 is not san, right? So I said, look at all covers and try to find a point that lands far from this cover, right? And what I do to get to this is: well, I fix a given set. fix a given set of sorry a given finite set of covers of the base and I call T the set of branch covers sorry of branch points of this cover and then I show that I can take multisections from new that are salient for pi and for this bridge therefore getting precisely what I wanted and getting that let me conclude That let me conclude here. So I get my list of covers, remember? P1K. Okay, so what is happening is here I have my fiber. So this is a fiber mu minus 1 of S. If I did it all correctly in the previous steps, this has positive order value rank over K. Okay? Okay? If I did it correctly, the ramification is different. So this is a curve. This is geometrically an integral. Right? So now I can really look at this diagram. I have a curve of genus one. This has different branching. This means that this has genus at least two. By Fauci's theorem, this is finitely many k points. This has an infinite set of. This has an infinite set of k points. So, of course, that I have a point that comes from here that doesn't come from here. Because that's precisely what this fiber product is. Just finitely many points. So, just by using foutings, I can just conclude that I have points here that don't come from here. And as a matter of fact, I have a lot of them. So, this is happening on a nonsense at the right job. The right job. So that is a very sketchy, and I'm not proud of doing it so quickly, proof. But as I said, I'm here the whole week and I'm happy to talk about this. Thank you.
