Of the last day of our workshop. So, for the first talk, we are very happy to have Professor Junshenwei from University of British Columbia. And Professor Wei will give us a lecture on singularity formations for some fluid equations. Thank you. Okay, first of all, I want to thank the organizers for inviting me to give a talk here. I also want to congratulate. I also want to congratulate the organizers, Jahao, Alex, and Sasha for organizing such a successful and wonderful meeting. It's my first time to give a talk in front of a food people. And I have learned quite a lot in this meeting. And I think it's a very good combination and different growths can then different techniques, different results. You know, different techniques, different results. This is a very successful region. Congratulations again. And I hope I can meet you all guys next time in person in Bang. And if you next time we go to Bang, please come to visit UBC. You can pass by Vancouver to have a short stop by. All right, so today I want to talk about two problems. Uh, problems. Uh, the first one is uh nematic nickel crystal flow, and this is a joint work with uh Lai and Fang Huanin and the Zhang Yeo Wang and the Yifzhou. And the second one is Nanda-difficcious galaxy, and which is well-known equation. And this is a joint work with Zhang and Zhou. And this talk will be based on some group methods developed in joint work with Davina and Deputy. Work with Davina and Depino in the paper in 2020, as I'm going to mention. So, let me start with the first problem, Nemetic and Nickel Crystal. So, what is a Nemetic nickel crisp? So, this is a couple of system between Navstokus. Okay, so this is a Navstoka, this is a phenomenon, this is a pressure, and then the And then the uh the uh harmony mic, okay. So, what is the company? So, the harmony mic give us force right to the Navistochus, and the Nava Stokus give a transport. Okay, so this is the equation I'm going to consider, and this Ypson zero is called is one for the Riemann number. So, okay, so uh, this is a model of. So this is a model first proposed by Huang Hanlin in Fang Haning in 1989. This is a simplified version of Echerson and the Nestle model for Namako Liquid principle. So as I said, this is a beautiful system coupling two important PDs, the compressible Napostoccus and the Hamilton mic. So as I maybe repeat, the Hamilton mic provides force to the Provides force to the Navstokus, and the Navstukus provides transport to the Habi mic. So, for the incompressible Navstokers, they exist and the uniqueness is well known and also open questions. So, I will not, I will skip this one. So, let me start with the harmony-my flow. Okay, so this is a geometric flow, and the simple. And the simple is long-trivial geometrical flow. And for this problem, Shuwei in 1985 proved the existence of global weak solution. And then Chen and Shuwei generalize to high dimensions. So these are the global weak solutions. Now for the block, so this global weak solution we have. So, this global week solution we have block, okay? So, for blood solutions for the combined micro, Kohong and Geda in 1989, and also Zeng and the Din, they use a topological degree to give examples of finite time block in high dimensions. But dimension two is the most interesting case because it's energy critical. So, the first example of a block was due to a Zhang Ding Ye in 1990. Zhang Jing Ye in 1999, 1991. And for the boundary value problem, for one correlation of Hamburg-Myflow, which can be reduced to a scalar equation. So Hammer-Meyer flow is a system equation, but if you assume one corruption, then this becomes a scalar equation. So the proof, the existence of a block, the first example of block. Example block, but for the boundary value problem. And Rafa and Schur in 2013, they gave a new construction proof, which is a construction proof, but for the quarter problem, for the problem in the whole space, again, for the same scanning equation, and they can find the precise block rate, which is a NOC square over T minus T. So gradient will block. Gradient will be like a NOC square over T minus T. Right. So with so the question is in general domains. So with Juan Davina and Manuel De Pino, we had a paper appeared in two last year. And we considered the Hammer microflow in general domains and average number of points. So the first result is give a key is gave points and gave us more time. Then you can construct some initial data, some boundary data, such that this problem block is precisely at this k-point and with this block rate. And furthermore, we show that this block is coordination k stable. So for example, if k equals one, the block is coordination one stable. Core dimension one stable. Core dimension one stable. So there's one direction which is which is unstable. I'm going to discuss that later. So this is the first result about the finite time block, multiple finite time block. So the second result in our paper, we discuss how we can continue the block. The block. So, if we have a block solution as in the first theorem, and then what you can do, you can change the direction of your vector field. And then this blob can continue, okay? From T less than capital T to T greater than capital T. And the blob rate is just changes sign, okay? Change the T to T capital T minus. So this blob, you can actually continue. And it's like a smooth blob. It's like a smooth block. And in that paper, we also discuss so-called spontaneous block. So you can have solutions that for T-Nescent cavity, which is a perfectly smooth. Cavity, which is perfectly smooth, okay. And then suddenly, when t greater than cavity, and you have a reverse bubble, okay. And the bubble rate will be need to be different before, because here the bubble rate is a log score, but here it's a log over t minus t. And all these are stable, are sort of stable. Okay, you can discuss that the stability. Stability. So these are the three theorems we prove in that paper. We are one must have forward barbarity, reverse body, and spontaneous bubbling. And as a result of these constructions, and we have a non-uniqueness of weak solutions. Because you can basically start any solution and then you can pull up those blocks, okay, at anywhere. At anywhere, and then you have so it's an infinite many weeks on global weak solutions for the problem and recently we can also generalize this result to three dimension and you in three dimensions uh for a unit ball in R3 and you can find a polar solution for the Hammerby flow. Solution for the harmonic flow, which blows up at a small ring. Okay. And the ring, the size of a ring, is precisely square root of t minus t. And the block rate is like a two dimension. So this is a small ring in three dimension. And the block happens at a square root of the Q minus T. So I think this is quite a. Quite an interesting block, which is because it's sort of a point block in three dimensions and with a small radius, okay, square root T minus. Okay, so this is how my flow. If there are any questions, please stop me anytime and I will be very happy to answer questions. Okay, so let's go back to the micro equal request of flow. Equally crystal flow. So, this is a problem we want to consider. And again, we want to consider the existence and the block of solutions. And for existence, there are many results. And this is Nin and Shangya Wang. And they prove global existence of Lero Hoff, a weak type of weak solution. And then they also prove. And then there was a proof of uniqueness of this narrow hole. This comes from the Nava Stokers. And there are many, many relative results, tons of papers. I just put some of the waters here. And in the MIS3, it's a little bit different. It's a difficult problem. And Fan Huang and Sangya Wang, they prove the globe, the existence of weak solution, but they have But they have some condition on the orientation field. So they assume that the orientation field stays on the up sphere. So this is the condition. And with this condition, and they prove the global existence for the weak solution. So the global existence of weak solution for GNO initial data in dimension 3 is still an open question. So, what I want to discuss today is the finite time singularity. And for finite time singularity for mimetic and eco-crystals, and so they are read the experimental results. This is experimental results. And there are also numerical results. And they found singularities. They call it defects. They call the defects, okay, for the nymph and decrease of. But theoretically, it's uh, the only result available is uh Huang and the Nin Yu and the Wang in 2016. And this is a very simple example, but it's not cheap example. In finite block in R3, so they take a senator in R3, and you take this effect. And you take this effect of this velocity, which is xy minus 2z. So it's the simplest velocity. And you assume the world rotation field is quotational. And then the system, then obstacles just disappear, okay, because of this, you choose this special velocity, and the system becomes. And the system becomes a scalar equation. It's like the Harbour Demon flow, but with some extra term, with this R5R. And by using the Zhang Jing Year technique, and they prove the existence of finite template. But there's a small drawback of this example. And this example does not satisfy the no-SNP boundary condition. The no-snip boundary condition. So, whether or not this example is the effect of the boundary condition or is a real block in R3, this is unknown. Because this example does not certify the no-sniff boundary condition. Okay, so what I'm going to discuss today is the What I'm going to discuss today is a finite time block in dimension two. Okay, our first result says we can construct a finite time block in dimension two. So first, let me introduce some notation because this will I will need this one later. So I call W is the degree one stationary hublomite, which you can write down exactly. Which you can write down explicitly. This is the degree one hardware mic from R2 to S2. And so this one at infinity is 001. So this is degree one. And this will be our basic profile. Now, for this degree one harmony mipe, there are six invariants and all of them will be important for us later. Or be important for us later. First, you have a scaling environment. So you can rescale your solution x over lambda. This is still a solution. This is the main cause of block, right? The scaling environments. And then you have a translation environment. So you can translate your center. And then you have the three rotational environments. So you can rotate around the Z by some angle. Around the z by some angle, the z-axis by some angle, or the x-axis by some angle, alpha, y-axis by some angle, beta. So you've rotated your solution, and this is also a solution. So all together, we should have six parameters, okay, in the to describe the degree one Hubble micro. Okay, so let's set up this recall. Next recall, we work on the dimension, two-dimensional domain. So you can take it one to the whole R2 or any boundary domain, okay? And this will work. And as long as the domain is smooth and the result holds. So we have, we don't require any symmetry on the domain. So this is the result, the first result. The first result for the Lamatic equal crystal. So it will give k points inside the domain. Now they assume that t is the black of time. It's something small. And the epsilon zero is one over the Riemann number. So the Riemann number is also large. And then we can find initial categories. And then we can find initial conditions and the initial data, okay, velocity and the initial rotation field. And then the solutions to the Nabeka nickel crystal flow grows up precisely at these points. And they can be characterized by exactly by the order six parameters. So you have translation, scaling. Translation, scaling, and the three rotations. Okay, now the important thing is what is the limit? Okay, what are the scaling? So, this lambda, the scaling parameter is T minus T over log square. And so, case I J goes to Q J, this is prescribed. But the rotation, you cannot prescribe rotation at your block. At your block. The rotation is rotation around the C is a number which is coming from your initial condition. And this is because of the instability in this rotation. I rotate here one thing. And for other two rotations, you can just prescribe, they just go to zero. So this is the description of the finite employee for the maker nuclear soul. For the name so in two dimensions and in any boundary domain, right, and uh uh uh and this is the the black array and furthermore the phenosity we have some uh uh uh estimate for the phenocity so the phenocity basically is like a number j to the mu minus one where mu is something less than one so I will I will I will discuss more I will discuss more about the process behavior of the phenocytic later. But the pressure is singular. So, phenocity is sort of singular, and the pressure is also singular. We have all this estimate for phenosynthesis and the single. So the first remark, actually, if we go to the proof of our proof, what we found is the velocity actually blows up. The velocity actually blows up in finite time. And the blob rate is like a norm. Okay, you're absolutely finally a log. So, this is something strange, something interesting, because for 2D lab stokers, we know that all solutions are regular, are smooth. But because of the orientation field, because you are coupled, the orientation. Harper, the rotation field. The rotation field gives you a singular force. And this singular force is so singular that you make the velocity field a block. The Navstroke is also blocked. So this is some new phenomena. You have block in the two-dimensional incompressible circles because of the rotation field, the cycular force. And the second remark: so, in the theorem, we need this number small. Okay. And so, why will we need this number small? Okay. So, and the main reason is this NAPSOKUS and the harmony-mide flow, they are fully coupled, okay? And they have the same scaling environments. scanny environments so so you have uh you have this for this system you have this is scanny environments okay for the for the uh for the full system so as a result of the scanny environments if you look at the the problem in the linearizer level is a fully coupled so you cannot decouple the this two problem okay and this is a fully coupled this is two problems so you cannot The two problems. So you cannot say, I just studied the Humber My flow, and then I studied the Stokes operator. And no, I'm just completely coupled. So that's why we need this couple is weak coupling. We want this one to be small, but it's a fixed number. It's a fixed number. And the trajectories of the six parameters and for the And for the scaling parameter and the rotation around the C, and so we have this non-local OD, and this gave us the generic block rate. And also, we have the dynamics for the translations and the dynamics for the other two rotations. The other two rotations. And so recently we also worked on the nickel crystal flow with a boundary. Now, nuclear crystal with a boundary, then the boundary condition is a free boundary condition and it will become sort of like a warping boundary condition for the velocity. And for this problem, we also have boundary block and the interior block and the And the key estimate we need is so nuclear estimate for the ozone-type operator for this type of free boundary problems, free boundary condition, which some this it seems in the literature this kind of operator has not been studied with this kind of boundary condition. Okay, so maybe what the main Here you are the main idea of the proof, and I want to introduce the so-called pybonic in the outer group. So, let me just introduce the inner outer group for the harmonic flow. Let me explain the scheme in one bubble case, and then I will say how we overcome the difficulty for the numerical nickel crystal. So, this is So, this is a Hubble My flow. And at the main order, you want to look for a solution like this. Okay, so you have six parameters. This is, you want to look for a solution with this profile. And you want to prescribe all these parameters. Want to derive the dynamics of these six parameters. Parameters okay, so what is the inner outer green? So the in outer green, we uh so there's this has been introduced by Modica yesterday. So we so we're looking for solution. This is our our answers, okay? And what we do, we we're looking for solution with some cutoff times phi and the plus plus i. So phi, you see that I'm using. phi you see that i'm using the inner variable for psi i'm using the original variable okay so this is like uh a zhumi yin okay this is the outer problem okay so five solves the inner problem but it only solves in a big in a in a in a ball okay in a disk uh r times lambda and the process solves the outer problem and so how does the coupling And so, how does the coupling? Okay, now for the carbon bioflow, this is how they couple. So, the outer problem enters into the inner problem by the potential. The inner problem enters into the outer problem by the cutter function. This is how we do how we distinguish the inner and the outer. Okay, so the main question, as Jia Hao mentioned, Uh, Jiao Hao mentioned yesterday, is somehow this is arbitrary, okay? You have this eta, which is uh the cutoff, the radius R. So the main question is how to choose a radius R so that the in the outer problem decouple. So, okay, this is the main technique of this in-out agree. So, how do we choose R? What are the restrictions for R? Okay, the VS R. And I hope this will answer. And I hope this will answer the question from Howell yesterday. So first, the R times number should be stay in the self-similar regime. Because you want to deal with the inside the network region, because outside the square root of T minus T is the ODE. ODE takes over. So you want this. You want your region to be inside your self-seminal. Yourself seminar. And of course, you want your R to be as large as possible. Because the reason is when R is large, the outer problem is more regular. But then this is a problem. When R is large, the S V for the inner problem get worse. And so, and then the nonlinear terms get worse. And so there's a trade-off, okay, between R. Okay, you have to choose a You have to choose a reasonable R, a shoot for balance. And in the Humber Mine flow, the shoot of balance is this one. It's T minus T to the minus one four. Okay. And this is, we choose this one and this, the inner outer will work. All right, so let me now look at the inner problem. So inner problem, we use the inner variable y and the tau. And so we change and the inner variable. And so the inner variable, the answers just become the degree one solution, the harmonic micro. So the inner problem is a semi-linear, is a linear parabolic problem. Okay. And for the growing to work, we need to find the inner solution which has fast spatial decay and faster time decay. So you need to have both space and time decay. space and the time decay because in order to the the uh the this two this uh will work so so a model problem is is a shorting of operator you take a shorting of potential and you suppose your your error has decay in time and then you decay in space and what you want is the question is can you find a solution to this problem which decay in space the same decay in time The same decay in time and the decay in space. But at least, of course, you don't expect this to hold everywhere. You only expect this to hold in the individual regime, in the regime in the self-seminar, in the self-seminal regime. So, this is the model problem we want to consider. Now, so in liquid theory, this is by Freytoholme. You just use the Freighthom, some was organic condition, but for parabolical problems. But for parabolic problems, we don't have freedom. So we need to develop sort of like freedom theory for the parabolic equations. But our problem is worse than that. And the problem is, if you look at the kernel of this linear operator, it's not even L2. So you cannot talk about orthogonality. There's no way because let's look at the kernel. Now, this kernel has six dimensional. Now, this kernel has six dimensional kernels, and you have mode zero, and which decays like a one of R. And it's not in L2 in two dimensions. It misses L2 by law. And you have translation mode, and this is L2. This is good translation mode. But then you have two rotations, which is not good, which is just bounded. So you can minus one. And the model minus one, you cannot use any L2 theory, you cannot talk about orthogonal energy. Okay, so that's the main problem. So, so in this paper, in the paper with Juan Davina, Mandela de Pino, and we solved in the problem model by mode. And for translation mode, it's easy. We have organic condition, there's no loss of R. For mode zero, this is the zero, this is the scaling and the rotation. And we have the also under the was organic condition, we lose a little bit r, okay, we lose a little bit r now for the mode minus one, we also lose some r, we lose a log r. So in these two modes, you lose log, because you don't have the L2 orthogonality, you lose some r. And for the other modes, you don't lose r. Okay, there's no loss of r. Okay, the slow loss of R. So, this is the theory for the Hamilton Microflow. So, let's go for the Nameka nickel crystal to the fourth system for this system. So, what is the natural idea? The natural idea to consider this one as a perturbation of the harmonic microflow. Okay, but unfortunately, so we can think about the Epsom zone as a perturbation parameter, right? A perturbation parameter, right? And this is a perturbation term. So now you think that this problem may be decoupled, but no, these problems are not decoupled. So if this one has a mode k and then the velocity times the gradient w will also become mode k. So in other words, you cannot just say, oh, this is a Human map and I do away the. My and I do away the third document warp ether. They're completely coupled. So, what we do is we need to develop a theory for the Hamberman flow without losing any R. And then we use Epsom zero as a perturbation, okay? As a perturbation to close the loop. Close the door. So, but let's look at the Harmony Map theory, theory of Harmon Map. For mode zero, we know some R. And for mode minus one, we would lose a log R. So in both zero and model minus one, there's the problem with this perturbation approach because you lose some log R and R depends on time. Okay, R depends on time. Okay, R depends on time. So this is basically like a tau to some power, and this is basically like a log tau. So we need to revisit the Hammer Micro. And so this is the loop we use to solve the full system. So for mode, the maximum is the same For mode zero, okay, let's look for the mode zero. The interesting, okay, this is the structure of the problem is this fourth and temp is a pressure temp because it's a motor server. So we can put this fourth and temp to the gradient peak, to the pressure. So in this way, So, in this way, if you're model zero, you lose some r, it does not matter because this term is a pressure term. It's like this term is not here, okay? Because it's a pressure term. Now, for any mode different from zero, we need a theory that we don't lose any loss of r we need we need a theory which lose any r and so. Any R. And so the main problem is about minus one, which is the translation. Now, in harmony by flow, this is the harmonies, you know, mode. Okay, you just use the maximum principle, you are done. But for not stookers, and this is a problem. This, because this will lose some log if you use maximum principle. And we're not allowed to lose any. were not allowed to lose any uh any any uh any lock okay this is not allowed to lose any so so the worst mode is the mode minus one which is the translations so what we're going to do is to introduce uh introduce uh two parameters the chance the the rotations alpha and beta and then we introduce the two orthogonal conditions and with And with these two orthogonal conditions, and then we can develop a new linear theory without losing any log R. And then the loop can be improved. So this is how we go for the motor minus one, for the rotation one. So we add the we add the the the the the corrections okay to improve the error for motor minus one for the two rotations and we use the was organic condition motor minus one get a dynamics for alpha and the beta and and then this will give us a better inner solution okay now thanks to the structure of the forcing because the forcing is a divergent form so the stoker system behaves better system behaves better. Now, for the sluice, so it's important that we have this structure for the Laflucas, okay? The force is a diversion form. So then we can use the Sonikov estimate and we can get rid of the logarithm noise of diagonal entries in the authentic. Because in general, Because, in general, if you estimate the Aussian tensor in the off-diagonal of the Aussian tensor, you're going to see the log. But our problem is divergence-free. So all these logs will be just cancelled, okay, because of diversity form. And so in this way, you don't lose any log R and this and then you can And then you can, the whole loop will come back. So this is the linear theory for the motor minus one, the new linear theory for the motor minus one. So assume the wastrogandic conditions, and then we can have found a solution which decays in time. Now, the solution will not decay in space because the problem is only is the R2. The operator is not. The war plate is like R2, and you don't expect your solution to decay in space, but the solution will decay in time, and this will be good enough for the whole, okay, for the whole loop. Okay, so this is the first part of my talk. And if there are any questions, please stop me and I can have some rest. Maybe I can ask a quick question. So, how do you choose the initial data? Oh, so the initial data is come from, yeah, this is a very good question. So, the initial button, of course, come from the answers, okay? And then how you solve the linear theory? That's important. The linear theory will give you some initial answers, initial conditions. So, you have to choose back from From the linear theory, you choose your initial condition. Yeah, you have to choose a good initial condition to get the linear theory. And that's why we lose the stability of the bubble is unstable because of the rotation, the rotation around the z-axis. And this is the precise reason. Thank you. Okay, so in the second part of my talk, in the last 10 minutes, so I will talk about the new Nandao-Nipschis-Gaybeck equation. So this is a well-known equation in magnetics, ferromagnetism. And so this is a couple equation. Equation between the shorting of my flow and the Hammond my flow. Now, if alpha is one, this is the shorting of part. And beta is zero, then this is the shorting of flow. Now, if alpha equals zero and beta equals one, this is the human flow. So, so, so, so, so this. So, so, so, so, this, this problem is a quite interesting bridge between a couple between two important flows, Schrodinger my flow and the Hammer mic flow. And this is an important system in magnetism, okay, modern magnetism. So, this is the problem we want to study in R2, in the whole R2. Now, there are many, many results on Godobi exists on the partial recognition. Anglo-existence and the partial recognition. This is tons of papers. And the problem in two dimensions is almost done, but in high, I think in high dimensions, it's still open. In high dimensions, still open. So about the stability, okay, of coordination. The degree M solutions for the quotational Nanda Lipschitz geberg and a very nice result by my colleagues and Gustavsson, Khang and Tsai in 2008. So they studied the quotation case for quotation and studied the stability for this flow. Nanda, if she's. A flow, uh, Nanda Nifshi's cable, and they later they improve also in dimension for degree grating the swing. So, this is uh, this is the co-tension case, the stability for the Nanda difficulties. Now, for the block, uh, for the Nanda Difficulties gateback, for the shooting of my flow, this is a well-known result by Mayo, Rafael and Rodienski. Rafa and Rodensky in 2013. And for the harmonic micro, as I just discussed, this is Rafael and Shur, and we did for the general case. So a long-standing question is, do we have finite temperature for the Lambda difficulties gay, but for general alpha beta? Not for any alpha, beta essence, alpha square plus beta square equal to one. Equal to one. Now, so there's a formal computation by van der Berg and Williams in 2013, and they showed that in the corrutational case, you still get this lab rate for the LG, for the Nanda Life Sheba. And so, in the quotation case, last year, this preprint by Xu and Zhao, and they use And they use Rafa and Mel's technique for the quotient problem for the co-otention again. So what we want to discuss next is the general case without any symmetry assumption and using the in-out of GUI method. So we're going to deal with the general case and construct a finite employee for the Nanda-Lipschi scale. So this is the So this is the record: this is the Hamlet mipe, station Hamlet mipe, decrease one Hamlet mipe. And we have three rotations, okay. And we write the Nanda Dipsy's gay back in this form, which is then which is so we don't have this is a much better form with A plus U T plus a B and the U where G. The B and U which UT and equals the Hubble Might. So this is a much better form, but in person, A is positive. We assume A is a positive. So if A equals zero, and this becomes, this is the Schrodinger flow. And if B is zero, this is the Harmony flow. Okay, so this is our second theorem on the Nanda difficult gay. On the Nanda difficult gave back equation, and so we found give small time and we found the initial conditions U0 so that the solution blows up precisely at this place, some point. And more precisely, we found some angle, one gas star, such that the solution blows up with this angle. Both are with this angle, okay, at end. So initially, you start with even with zero angle, okay? With even with W equals zero. But at the end, you're going to get a new angle. So this is the instability I'm talking about. This is the instability because the rotation around the z-axis, this. Around the z-axis, this angle cannot be prescribed operating. You only come from your equation, come from your limit. And you get a simple operator. Okay, so we have the land local dynamics for lambda and one ga, and this is same to the similar to the lambda lifts to the Hamlet micro, but now the B. But now the B, give you some corrections to the right-hand side. And so we need some sign conditions. The B enters in this sign condition as well. And then we have the non-local diagrams for the two rotations as well. Okay, so what is the main difficulty for the non-diversions, Gabriel? So, So, in the harbour by flow, an important tool is the maxim principle. We use, because it's a parabolic, we use the maxim principle. And for the non-donific scale bag, the problem is we don't have maximum principle. That's the major problem. And there's no maximum principle. You cannot use the maximum principle. So, we need to develop a new linear theory, which is. Linear theory, which is free of a maxim principle. We don't want any use of a maxim principle. So how do we do this? Okay, so let's look at the linear theory. Let's linearize around the bubble. And we expand in the Fourier modes as in the Hubble microflow. Okay, and this is the warp data in the Hubble microflow. Now, the plot. flow. Now the problem is this is a complex and we have a plus ib in front of dt in term of d tau. So this is like a complex parabolic equation, a plus ib. Okay, so our aim is before we want to sort of get some sort of freedom alternative, get a freedom theory. So wonderful solution that decays both in space and the time. Both in space and the time for all modes. Okay. And then the green will work. So, how do we do this? We use the energy method, the energy estimate, and use our sorghumic condition and use the representation formula. And the important, a very important tool is distorted Fourier transform, which was introduced by Five Year in. Introduced by five year in this morning. I think this is. So again, the main problem is motor minus one. So for all motor logic equal to minus one, our technique work. Okay, we energy estimate and the representation formula. Now, the main problem is the model minus one. That's the main trouble. Okay, so for model minus one, if we don't use the maximum principle, then we're going to lose r squared. The lose R square by energy. If we just use the energy estimate, we lose R square. And this is the main problem. If we lose R square, then the loop cannot, because this will be too big for the non-linear terms. So how do we develop a theory without a loosened R square, without the maximum principle? So here we use the destructive Fourier transform. So this So this operator L minus one certifies the maxim principle. So that's why how we did it for the for the Hammer Mic. We use this maxim principle. But here we cannot use maxim principle. So after shootable transformation, this operator is like a six-dimensional Laplace for R close to zero and two dimensional Laplace for R go to infinity. So you have different dimensions for R close to zero. Dimensions for R close to zero, R close to infinity. And so, in this paper, in the mechanical crystal paper, we have some bound for the heat kernel. But if we have the compressed form, how to get a bound for the heat kernel? For the complex heat kernel? And so, unfortunately, we can use the destroyed Foyle transform. We can find the explicit one. So, what you do is you You take the canonic form of this L minus one, and then you introduce Fourier transform. This is a Fourier transform, and then this is the measure, okay? The density measure. So we need to estimate the eigenvalues for this problem and estimate the density of this measure. Of this measure. Okay, and fortunately, we have this big paper, which is 345 pages by Krieger and Meow and Shark. And using this, okay, this is remarkable work, you know, and we can find all the estimates we need for the generalized eigenfunctions and the spectrum measure. Now, with this, Now, with this generous estimate, with this estimate, we can find the Duhamer formula and we can get all the estimate by the estimate, the reposition formula, and we found the estimate which just lose by log R, okay, by log R. So I think this is, my time is almost up, and I stop here. Thank you.
