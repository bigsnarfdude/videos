Okay, now it started to record. So I'm going to go ahead and read the presentations because we're really happy to have with us here Professor Tina Liacerad and Professor Christos Loreira. Professor Tina Liacerad is a professor of computer science at Northeastern. She's also a core faculty member at Northeastern Science Institute and Institute for Experimental AI. She's also an external faculty member at Santa Fe Institute in Vermont. Member at Santa Fe Institute and Vermont Complex Science System Center. And before being at Northeastern, Tina was an associate professor of computer science at Ruggers and a member of technical staff and principal investigator at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. She has ample experience in all of these fields. And she has given over 200 invited talks and 14 tutorials. She has over 100 peer-reviewed publications and her all. Publications and her algorithms have been incorporated into systems used by government and industry extensively. She's also served as program chairs for the ACM SIGKDD and the Network Science Conference and the International Conference of Computational Social Sciences, all of which are basically the premier conferences in their respective areas. So, thank you very much for being here, Tina. We're very happy to have you here. Very happy to have you here. Professor Susalura is a professor of mathematics and chair of the graduate group in applied math in the University of California in Davis. For his contributions to discrete mathematics, optimization and algorithms, he has been elected a fellow of both the AMS and the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, SIAM. And in 2020, he won the Farkas Prize of the Informs Optimization Society for his work in optimization algorithms. And in 2018, Algorithms and in 2018, he received the Distinguished Teaching Award, the College of Letters of Science and Science, and in 2013, the Chancellor's Award in Undergraduate Research Mentoring. And in 2017, he won the Golden Section Teaching Award of the MAA. So he's been distinguished by all of the mathematical societies in the US, which is very impressive. He's directed 15 PhD dissertations and over 60 undergrad theses. So you can see he's So, you can see he's had an ample effect on a lot of people. So, very thankful to you both for being here. And maybe I'll let Guido also ask some of the questions, maybe to guide the conversation, if that's okay. Okay, sure. I have many questions. I'm certainly happy to ask maybe the first one. Maybe the first one. So, I guess one question that is very important for people maybe who are finishing the PhD or considering to go on a postdoc or maybe completing the postdoc. Is there a strategy that you should pursue if you want to go to a lab or if you want to go to a university? Are you going to be doing an internship or are you going to try to apply for a grant early on? Should you try to apply? Early on, should you try to apply for a grant together with somebody more senior or maybe do something individually, like a postdoctoral fellowship award? I mean, this applies both for universities, but certainly also for labs and institutes such as, you know, I know the Santa Fe Institute has several programs and also postdoctoral fellowships. Who are the people? I mean, how should somebody decide on which of these opportunities to consider and where should this person try to? And where should this person try to get an ideal advice on how to write a successful application for this? You want to start? I'm happy to defer to you, so why don't you go first? Okay, let me try to start, get going. So, first of all, thank you for giving us the opportunity to talk about career development. I think it's an important topic. I think it's an important topic that is not covered very often. The one thing I want to say is that in data science, mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science, there's so many career directions that one can have that is, in some sense, impossible to give advice that is going to apply perfectly to everything, right? So, let me start with that disclaimer. So, my approach to things is normally to ask the question to young people. The question to young people: Where do you want to be in five years from now? That's the question I always try to ask my PhD students, my postdocs, I mean, everybody, right? So where do you want to go? Because depending on where you want to go, I think the advice needs to be tailored for that purpose. So let me give you two quick examples of what I mean by that. So, for example, if you want to, you tell me I want to be teaching in a liberal art college in the next five years. In the next five years, well, then that really requires that you probably make your teaching portfolio very strong, right? On the other hand, if you want to be working for a national lab or you want to be working for Google, I would say that really requires that you take internships very seriously and do your legwork of finding internships. So the advice really needs to be adjusted. And I don't mean to And I don't mean to, I mean, sometimes it's hard to decide. So I can tell you for sure that sometimes students don't know. I mean, do I really want to be a professor? Do I want to work in industry? Well, my answer to that is if you're not sure, that's an even better reason to try to find out internships, for example, to be sure that you don't like industry. Let's say 2D. Even if you say, I'm going to be a professor no matter what, maybe you should try to. Professor, no matter what, maybe you should try to experiment a little bit precisely because you are not completely sure with other options. And then once you know where you're going, I will say, then try to find mentors of the place where you want to go. So let's say you decide, I want to be in a national lab, I want to work for industry. Okay, let's try to find somebody that you can talk to. What was necessary for that person to go to be where they are right now? And then you start making. And then you start making the steps into that direction. But finding the direction where you're going is the first step. I will start, I'll stop there and let Tina say other things and contradict me or whatever. I don't know. No, thank you very much, Jesus, for setting that up. And thank you, Pablo and Guido, for this opportunity. I think I would start with this. This is the best explanation I've had between the difference between academia. Between the difference between academia and industry. Industry is like going home and living with mom. Mom loves you, mom gives you a lot of money, mom washes your clothes, mom says how beautiful you are. But if you go out and party too much, or if you want to watch certain things that she doesn't want you to watch, then tough luck, right? It's like, no, you've gone and partied four times this month. You can't do this, or you can't like perhaps work. This or you can't like perhaps work on a particular thing that you want to work on because it's like under my roof. Versus in academia, it's like living on your own. Nobody will come and say good job. Nobody ever will come and say, you know, good job, right? You don't make as much money, right? Nobody does your laundry, makes food for you, right? You are in a way having a startup. You're doing it all yourself. You have to hire people. You have to get money. Of course, there's an issue. To get money, of course, there's an education mission, and so part of that has to do with your personality, right? Would you prefer to be at home living with mom, or would you prefer to be living on your own and doing everything yourself, but then you have to do everything yourself, right? And of course, this can change over time. The other aspect of it, especially in terms of academia, and I'm speaking about America because that's the one that I know the most. Academia in America is kind of like a mafia, right? So you really need to work on your social networks, right? And I know I'm in the Network Science Institute and I like thinking about networks and relational dependencies, but it's really about your social networks. So for example, with my graduate students, as soon as they join, I'm like, you need to have what I call showings in these conferences. In these conferences. So, in network science, people mostly publish journals, but there is a network science conference. You submit an extended abstract. You have to do that. Like, you cannot call yourself a network science PhD student or a network science researcher if you have no showing in the network science conference. I don't care, right? And especially since the barrier to entry is so low for, for example, network science conferences or computational social science. Science conferences or computational social science conferences, because you just have to write one-page extended abstract since it's not a publication venue, it's a presentation venue, right? And so that way you slowly build your social network. And of course, when you go to these meetings, you don't want to be in the corner, right? You want to go talk to people and you're not there to really attend all the talks. You're there to talk to people and like catch the guys, you know, the guy who has power, right? The Godfather's eye, right? There's I, right? And I can tell you, at least for me, I was outside of academia for nine years. When I graduated, I did not want to go into academia. I thought academics were weird. Then I realized I was weird. And the only reason I was able to go into academia after nine years was because the godfathers of data mining thought I was good. That's really it, right? So throughout that nine years, I worked with them, I published with them, I was present at conferences. I was present at conferences, I was giving talks, I was participating in tutorials and workshops, and they wrote me letters. Like at the end of the day, again, I hate to be so blunt, but academia is a mafia and it depends on what your social network is and you need to work on your social network. Your work will not speak for itself. It's not like you, like if you saw Piccolo MP and you put it out there, like, oh, people will read it and they will come after you. No, no, no, no, no. You have to learn how to market your work, how to build your social. How to market your work, how to build your social network, and at least for academia, that's the most important thing. Um, and I'll stop there. Thank you. Wow, this is super insightful. I believe, I mean, at least from my take is that, okay, first, it is really important to think ahead a little bit because you really need to lay the foundations that are needed for you to be taken seriously as a candidate, especially in academia, but also in industry. I mean, part of your I mean, part of your comment, both Jesus and Tina, was that you need to do that preparation. Maybe two questions. One is for the industry, what could be a preparation for somebody who wants to go for a job on industry beside from applying for an internship before? Is the network aspect maybe also important in there now, especially now that so many people are, you know, we see many. We see many professors who also have either a secondary affiliation or leave academia for industry. And the other one, maybe also in relation to this contrast between academia and industry, is I recently had a conversation with a postdoc and I very casually asked him, because a lot of my students actually are debating this question, whether they want to go to industry or academia. And I know that in secret, a lot of people That in secret, a lot of people are thinking about industry for many reasons. But this postdoc said something that I was intrigued, or I mean, I wonder what you think about it. What he said was that at least he felt that it was not very well seen when people wanted to go to industry, that the gold standard would be actually to stay in academia. And that's kind of the, you know, kind of the higher ambition. Ambition. Because I didn't feel the same. I mean, I didn't feel like that. So I thought it, you know, that's first, I don't think that's true. I think that there are many good reasons for going to industry and there is a lot of good opportunities in there. Nonetheless, I'm really curious to hear your thoughts about that. So, Tina, why don't you go first this time? Okay, thank you. Yeah, so at least in terms of At least in terms of industry in machine learning, data mining, like the Googles, the Facebooks, the Amazons, as I understand it, one way that they pick their interns now is whether you have had a paper at a talk conference. Because they get so many applications that you have to have some kind of heuristic. And when I first heard this, I was like, this is crazy. This, I was like, this is crazy. Like, you know, it's crazy to expect a graduate student, for example, to have a paper right at a top conference right away for condition of doing an intern at Google. But that's what is happening, right? And again, it links to that social network, right? So these companies are all at these conferences. And so if you have a paper and you go to their booth and you talk to their people, or they have these kinds of receptions. They have these kinds of receptions, so on and so forth. It's really about, like, oh, yes, I am smart and I did this work, but you know, you have to go and sell yourself, market yourself. And publishing papers in these top conferences is one of the ways of going. The other way, again, building your social network, I'm going to repeat this over and over again, is to have people email the folks in industry on your behalf. I do this all the time, right? The time, right? You these guys get 300, 400, 500 applications. I have no idea, you know, it's in hundreds, right? And so I'm like, oh, my brilliant student, David Liu, has applied. Please watch out for his application, right? David may not get it, but at least he's on the point. And it's the same for faculty hirings, too. You get 400, 500 applications, and so using your social network to make sure your application doesn't fall. Work to make sure your application doesn't fall through the crack is extremely important. And I'll stop here and turn it to Jesus. So I completely agree with Tina's assessment. I think creating a network is a must. I also agree to some extent to the analogy of the mafia in academia. I mean, there's a lot, it's a little bit more of a, yes, I mean, especially because for many, many, many years. For many, many, many years, academic jobs were literally done by your advisor calling somebody else in a school. I want to believe that that culture is starting to change a little bit, especially with a lot of the calls for diversity, inclusion, equity. I think it's a slow change, but I feel that from the time I was a graduate student to now, things have started. To now, things are starting to be a little bit more balanced, I would say. But it's still the case that definitely there's a prejudice against what Guido was saying, that maybe some people consider a non-academic job. Oh, are you really sure you're going to go into industry? I will say to the young people in the audience or the people that watch this video is that don't be guilt into doing something you don't want to do. So academic jobs are not for everybody either. Academic jobs are not for everybody either, right? I mean, it's, I mean, there's nothing wrong with being happy working for Google, making $175,000 a year. There's nothing wrong with that. I think I can tell you from my experience, I have had, as was mentioned, I have had 15 PhD students, let's say, finish their degree and go for jobs. And more and more, I mean, I would say by now it's about half of them have decided to be. About half of them have decided to be in an industrial setting, and I think all of them are very happy because it feeds their family and personal decisions. And this is something that you should never forget. I mean, you're going to be spending years working for a company or working for a university. You should like it. I mean, you should enjoy it. I will tell you my favorite example of what I mean by you should enjoy your job, teaching. I have students that have come to me and said, you know, I hate. Students that have come to me and said, you know, I hate my TA. I really don't like it. I love doing research, but I don't like my TA. I just hate it. And those are the, in my opinion, those are people that are perfect candidates to become, you know, work for a company and do very creative work in a company where they don't have to necessarily, I mean, even in a company, I will argue you still need to be a good communicator and you need to be a good team member, et cetera. So bad communication will not get you higher anywhere. Get you higher anywhere, so remember that bad communicator, you will not get higher. But I will say that academia, to some extent, you really need to have a certain liking for teaching, right? Because if you don't like teaching, you're going to be doing a lot of that every day. And well, anyway, so one of my students didn't like that. And he's now working for Google and he's super happy. I mean, he has been thriving. He's now a manager level kind of thing. And I think that's important. And I think that's important that you enjoy what you're doing, that you know yourself and say, I don't like this type of interaction with people. So let's see, the other thing is maybe try to find your real interests on many levels. I mean, look at yourself, look at your prior, what made you happy, right? That should help you find the right direction to go. I'll stop there, maybe. Thank you, Jesus and Tina. So, do we have any questions from the other participants in the session? Okay, otherwise, I'm happy to continue with my own questions. Like part of this strategy building, I think, is an important one because. I think this is an important one because this requires planning and time. And especially when you talk about a network, this is something that is not only up to you, but it's up to, you know, it depends on things that where you start laying these foundations sometime in advance. And I think maybe that's a tricky part, especially, you know, maybe people come from different institutions. Say, for example, at certain research institutes like Max Planck, PhD students traditionally don't do any teaching. And so Teaching. And so, but maybe even at places where people have teaching, like TA ships, sometimes people will do more or less. Like if they have a fellowship, maybe they don't have the obligation to do teaching. But then, you know, this teaching portfolio can be important when applying for a particular postdoctoral appointment. Maybe somebody says, okay, I want to apply for a postdoc in numerical analysis, but then it is not credible from the background or from the TA experience that this person could. TA experience that this person could actually teach courses on that subject, and that can be an issue. So, would you say that already at an early stage, a student would therefore need to try to get those 3A sheeps on the topics that are important, or how important would you consider this specific direction of the teaching in the portfolio of an individual who is going to be applying for an academic position? For an academic position, um, you want me to go, maybe? Okay, I definitely think that if your plans are to be an academic, especially if you're if you think that you are going to be in a small liberal art college, which they are advertising a lot these days, by the way, you really need to plan ahead and make sure that you have some teaching experience, preferably being. Preferably being, let's say, the main instructor at UC Davis, the senior students get a chance to become what we call associate instructor, which is essentially being a professor yourself, right? You design the class, you design the exams. There's a faculty member that will watch over your shoulder to make sure that you're not screwing up or making big mistakes, but you are in charge of everything. And this kind of experience, we decided to provide them. Of experience, we decided to provide them to our graduate students precisely because we know the market requires that. So, I mean, you can get a very nice teaching, very, very nice teaching opportunities if you have teaching background or let's say you did a considerable amount of teaching. Some people don't want to do that and they go more for fellowships. I mean, I have a few students that have become more like, okay, I want to do lots of research and not necessarily a lot of teaching. Necessarily a lot of teaching, and I will say those people end up trying to get a career either, let's say they apply for a postdoc in an R1 institution where there's okay, they're not gonna look as strongly at the teaching portfolio. That's the reality. If you apply to the Harvards of the world, to the MITs of the world, I mean, they're not gonna look, I mean, they're gonna look at your great papers for sure, right? But if you have just one calculus class teaching experience, that's not gonna be a problem. Teaching experience, that's not going to be a problem, I would say. As long as your letters say that you are the best, you know, the latest Donald Newt, or that you're working extraordinary new results in algorithms or whatever. That's really what they're going to be looking at. But that's not true. At what stage, what stage are you talking about? Talking about faculty positions or also postdocs? I think that for getting both postdocs and faculty positions, you need to tailor already. For example, postdocs, there's a lot. For example, postdocs, there's a lot of postdocs in small liberal art colleges such as Harvey Mott. I mean, Harvey Mott is a great school with great people, but their postdocs teach much more and therefore they're expected to be extraordinary teachers as well, right? I mean, the expectations of teaching at Harvey Mott or Williams College, I mean, these are excellent colleges and they pay really well, but the expectations that you're going to be able to teach really well versus if you, you know. If you know apply, and again, the level of postdoc and also permanent faculty, I will say the attitude is very similar. If you're going to be permanent faculty at Harvey Mott, again, you need to have a strong record of teaching, very good teaching. Innovation, for example, are you good with online teaching, for example? You have created a new, completely new online course on something, right? If you are applying for a faculty position at a place. But faculty position at a place more like an R1 institution, you know, the UCs of the world, or maybe the University of Illinois. I think people are expecting your research program is going to be super strong. Maybe they will be interested in you becoming a good teacher, but the main criterion, the top criterion for sure will be: is this person going to be able to be a very strong researcher, bring grant money, and that kind of stuff? Yeah, I agree with that. So, just a couple of things that have come up. One is your letter writers are extremely important. And so, I have a colleague who became university distinguished professor, and I was like, okay, you don't need any letters anymore. And he's like, no, no, no, I still will need letters when I get to the Pearly Gates, right? So, at least in academia, this notion of like you need good letter writers, even for industry to get in, right? To get in, right? So you need people who are fair and stable, and there are not that many people who are fair and stable, but you know, which is part of again the social network in terms of who writes good letters. Now, putting that aside, if you're affiliated with an institution, there are people who come to your institution to give talks, attend those talks, right? I can't tell you how often like there are these folks who are coming and giving seminars. It doesn't matter whether it's a distinguished lecture or whatever, but students or post-looks don't attend. And it's like, this is the. Post don't attend. And it's like this is the perfect the guy is coming to your house. Go and attend the guy's talk. Or if there's a meeting that they're arranging for the graduate students to meet with a visitor or postdocs to meet with a visitor, attend those. Talk to them about your work. That's how you spread your ideas, right? So then in terms of teaching in particular, which was the question, I think it really depends on how much you like. How much do you like to explain what you've seen, right? So, for example, one of my students, Leo Torres, I know he's an excellent teacher, even though he didn't teach, because when he gives talks, you know that he's thought about it thoroughly. He can answer all your questions. He is excellent at explaining it. He doesn't put the burden of you understand on you, the burden of understanding on you. The burden is on him to explain it in a way that you would understand it. That you would understand it. And in fact, most faculty talks, right, for the tenure and tenure track positions are to see how good of a teacher you are. It's not for you to showcase your research, but okay, you know, you have done all this excellent research. How well can you explain it to a broad audience? Right? And so I feel like a lot of at least computer scientists, let's put it this way, my people, they don't spend enough time thinking about what is the Time thinking about what is the best way of presenting this idea. You're like, oh, I solved it. Proof by, right? No, no, no, no. Step one, step two is how are you going to describe this to your grandmother, to the kid in the street, to you know, your colleague who's a chemist, to an undergraduate? And that makes you think about other things. So it's not necessary, except for again, as Hesu said, yes, for like teaching schools, you they. Schools, you they really do want you to have some teaching background. But for R1, it's really how well you are at explaining yourself, and that takes a lot of time. Like, you know, I have a colleague who actually writes a script for all of her talks. Can you imagine that? Do you know how long that takes? That's a lot of work. But her talks are beautiful. I am not going to do that. I only did that for my first talk. Only did that for my first talk at ICML when I was a graduate student. And so I had a 25-minute talk and I actually wrote a script and I memorized it. But now I just get up there and just say it. But imagine she's a senior person. She still does it. And when you ask her for her slides, she will send you the script because she wants you to understand what her slides are saying. This is a lot of work. Most of us will not be willing to do it. I'll stop there. Yeah, wonderful. Yeah, no, that's a great piece of advice. Yeah, no, that's a great piece of advice, I believe. So, and I think this also goes hand in hand with the point that you made earlier about building a network and promoting your work, because I see a lot of very important contributions that don't get the recognition that they should. And just because they are not well presented or not well articulated or not sufficiently advertised, I think that taking the burden of the explanation on yourself as a On yourself as the researcher actually goes a very, very long way in terms of the impact of the work because people don't understand the work, they cannot use it and cite it, I believe. So in the same direction, one thing that I have seen happening more and more is that some people are trying to use these short videos. I mean, now at these big conferences, you know, there are. Big conferences, you know, there are these virtual posters that are accompanied by short videos. Or many times, graduate students take the initiative of working on these blogs where even topics from class, you know, they try to digest them and put them in websites. Is that something that you would, you know, consider valuable for somebody who is looking for a candidate? Or is that something that maybe is just for those who are maybe trying to think about Be trying to think about science communication, but that is not going to be, you know, I will say the following. Doing something that distinguishes you from the rest of the pack. I mean, I wanted to say, first of all, before I forget it, actually, this is very important to say this to everybody. UC Davis has a job advertisement right now for the mathematics of data sciences specifically. Data science specifically. So, if you know, if you are interested or you know somebody that could be interested, apply. We are waiting for your application, okay? Especially this audience. I mean, we really want people that like geometry and learning and all that. Anyway, but going back to the topic of I think it's very important that you want to distinguish yourself. And one way that Tina mentioned already is that your letters by the letter writers that you get, I will say there's even more. I would say that's even more than just getting a great letter grider. You can also ask, actually, write to somebody in the department. For example, me, right? And this, here's an example. You want to apply for the job at UC Davies and you've met me right now. I mean, you've seen me at least once. You write to me and then you say, my application is there. We met in Oaxaca conference. Can you please look at my application? That distinguishes you. So doing things that distinguish your application. You so doing things that distinguish your application is definitely something I will advise, and one of them is what the example that Guido gave: that you create some videos for your present, for your papers, but there might be other things. I mean, let me put it this way. Do something that distinguishes you for sure, but do something that is natural to you, that is going to really make you look well, right? If you are not into making videos, maybe that's not the best. Maybe that's not the best, the best strategy, but if you are into making videos, do it, right? Why not? I tell you one story. When I was a graduate student, one of my colleagues is actually now a very well-known mathematician, Robert Greist. You guys maybe know him from topological data analysis and things like that. So, Rob, when he was a grad student, we were graduates together and he did the following. He had a postcard on his application. Remember, I applied when the dinosaur. Remember, I applied when the dinosaurs were alive, right? And back then, the dinosaurs sent every application in paper. So all the applications were done in paper, not the internet, nothing like that, not matjobs.org or anything. So Rob put a postcard on his application with a beautiful picture. And he says, you want to know what this picture is? Invite me for a job interview. And it worked. I mean, he got tons and tons and tons and tons. I mean, like, everybody remembers this about his application, right? This is about his application, right? So you can think of what it is for you. Make a beautiful picture, a nice table. I don't know what it is, but you can think about your work. You love your work. Try to make it look well. I mean, try to make it presentable in a way that people say, wow, this is creative. This is new. That's my advice. Not necessarily videos, but do something that you really can create and show as your own. Yeah, I definitely agree with that. I think the aesthetics matter. Now, of course, unfortunately, we live in an era where there is so much material out there that you have to, in a way, market yourself more than, for example, when I was in graduate school, right? So you see this, for example, when a student has a paper, they do a tweet series on it, right? So for people to see it, right? And like this would be. To see it, right? And like, this would be so much, so foreign to me, right? When in, like, I finished my PhD 20 years ago, so this was like, what, what? Like, there was no Twitter back then, anyway. But I think from my perspective, it's just, there's that. There's like, what are good ways of marketing yourself? The other one is take every opportunity to talk about your work. And the more you talk about your work, the better you get at talking about it. And then if you do get a chance, And then, if you do get a chance to give a talk somewhere, give your best work. Not this thing about, like, oh, well, maybe people have heard this or, you know, this is not very new. Give your first album. People want to hear about your first, you know, the work that you're the most proud of. Don't give work in progress because they're going to ask you some questions that you haven't thought about and you can't answer it. So give the work that you're the most comfortable with. That you're the most comfortable with, you are the most proud of, you thought about it the best, and practice, practice, practice. I mean, I can't say enough about practice. You have to practice. Otherwise, I have to add, I ask my graduate students to practice, and I practice my talks actually. I mean, I don't write a script, but I do practice my talks before I give my talks. Yeah, well, I think that's very useful. Well, I think that's very useful, a useful, very useful piece of advice about giving talks and giving your best, talking about your best work. Because certainly, you know, it's very tempting, I believe, me to talk about the new subjects or the subjects that maybe one thinks that can be interesting to some particular audience. Maybe in some cases it's appropriate, but for sure, what is going to show the best profile? This profile. That's very useful. Yeah, I guess I'm sorry if I may interrupt you. The one thing that I feel like I didn't quite address is like which postdocs do you go to or apply for, right? Apply for postdocs where you like the topic area, where you have done the research on the mentor and you see where the other postdocs on that mentor have placed. It's extremely important, right? So if you place with somebody who's very So, if you place with somebody who's very well known, but that very well-known person doesn't really care about advertising for their postdocs or showcasing their graduate students, then you will suffer. In a way, like I see my job as a PhD mentor, as a postdoc mentor, I'm your agent. You do the excellent work. I go talk to people, right? I'm your mouthpiece, right? About how good of a job you've done, and so on and so forth, right? And so on and so forth. And so doing some background research in terms of how good of a mentor the person is, who, you know, where have people who went to his lab placed, et cetera, is extremely important because it means that they care about where people land and not just about their lab and themselves. Yeah, I cannot agree more. I mean, I think sometimes, and also you see this with graduate student applications. Applications. I mean, they everybody wants to apply to MIT. Everybody wants to apply to Harvard. But I mean, they might be unhappy there because nobody pays attention to you, right? I mean, it's way more important that you have a mentor that actually is going to connect to you, talk to you, take the time to develop your career. And that's something that is indispensable. You get to know those people by networking and hearing opinions of the graduate students and the postdocs. You can ask the postdocs, are you happy in that lab? Ask the postdocs, are you happy in that lab? I mean, was it worth it coming here? And they can tell you that the real life, no, no, I hate it. Or some people tell you, I like it a lot, so you should, you should apply, right? Yeah, okay. And anyone wants to add something? I have another couple of questions. I have a question, if no one else does. Thank you so much for finding out the. Thank you so much for putting together this opportunity. So, as a I'm a postdoc currently actually applying to faculty positions. And so, actually, I had a question about grants. When the first time to do that is, I really haven't gotten much. I haven't had any experience about it or seen anyone go through it at my level yet. And I'm just curious when is like the first time to do that, who you should write grants with, or yeah, anything. Or, yeah, anything any thoughts you have on that? Thanks. So, I think the expectation, at least in applied math and math departments, is that you have, I mean, the moment you are going to come to the, if you haven't applied for a grant, still apply for the job, okay, for a tenure-track job. I would say the expectation for grants in mathematics or applied mathematics departments is mostly that you have tried. You have tried that you want to try. And in some R1 institutions, to get to give you tenure, the dean might be a little bit more amenable if you have received the grant, right? But there has to be a record history of you trying to get to grant grants, let's say before the tenure case comes. If you are a recent hire, you're not like you're a postdoc and you're applying for tenure track jobs, mathematics departments and applied math departments will look at your application. Applied math departments will look at your application favorably, still. I mean, oh, you know, not many people, it's not yet a culture that, oh, you must have applied to a grant already, right? I will say that maybe that's changing a little bit. I mean, I have had, for example, two of my postdocs try to apply. They didn't get it, but they tried, you know, and that's, I think that's considered a plus, right? That they tried. But it's not a necessary thing to get a job, I would say. Thing to get a job, I would say, still. Maybe CSD problem is different. Maybe Tina can speak to that. Yeah, so I think the notion of getting grants is more about the fact that you can support a research group, right? That you can, especially in CS, that you can have students that you're funding. Because in computer science, I think, unlike math, still in a lot of math departments, the students come and, for example, they TA and through. For example, they TA and through that they support themselves. But in computer science, it's not like that. Maybe at best you'll get the first two years of the PhD program, but then after that, your advisor is supposed to fund your research. So it's really about the fact that you can maintain a research group. Now, this, of course, varies based on like if you're doing theoretical computer science, perhaps you don't need to bring as many grants, right? It's like you and a student or so. But like graduating. Student or so, but like graduating students is important, right? And so, well, how are you going to graduate a student if you can't support that student, right? Now, perhaps you'll get lucky and all of your students will have like the NSF GRFP or some other scholarship or something, but that's kind of rare. The one thing as a young person, just a couple of things to remember. One is initially your grants are probably going to get rejected because you don't know how to write it. Because the way that you have to write it is like Way that you have to write it is like, oh my God, you haven't funded me on this yet? How are you breathing? Like, I don't understand that you're still living. Like, this should have been funded yesterday and I am it, right? And so we don't usually write that way, right? It's a lot of rhetoric and stuff like that. And then, and so for that, actually, one of the things that helps is actually serving on the review panels. And the NSF program managers, for example, in America are supposed to talk to you. They really want reviewers, right? Really want reviewers, right? If you want me to reach out to somebody, I will reach out. I always do this. I'm like, hey, how about this person? I've done enough reviewing. And being on these NSF panels helps because you get negative examples. You don't learn how to write a good one, right? But you learn what's a bad proposal, which is good, right? At least you have some examples of bad ones. And then the thing to watch out for as a junior faculty is in some places, unfortunately, the senior faculty may prey on you where you will write. On you, where you will write the proposal with them, and then they are the lead PI and you become the co-PI, right? And that is not cool, right? So, if you are working with a senior faculty in a department and you are the junior faculty, you should be the lead PI and he should be the co-PI, just for promotion reasons and other reasons. And, anyways, you're probably going to do more of the work than the senior faculty. So, right, and so you will probably have a mentor, it's extremely. Will probably have a mentor. It's extremely important to have a mentor in the department that you go. And so the mentor can help shepherd you that way to not being taken advantage of by senior faculty where you do all the work and they get most of the credit. Yeah, I think it's very important to have a mentor for the reason that was just explained, not to be in some sense over, not to be abused, because sometimes it can happen. There are some abusive relationships. Happen. There's some abusive relationships. That unfortunately is still the case. I do think that the expectation for junior faculty is that you will show a lot of energy on your research side. For example, if a very senior professor is not writing, trying to submit a grant every year, that's a little bit like, okay, well, that person is not going to have a research group anymore. Not going to have a research group anymore, whatever, right? But if you are not showing at least the energy of doing that, that might be, you know, considered negative. I agree with that. And again, when you are considered off for tenure, you have the people look at how many students have you graduated, their jobs, etc. And I think computer science has a disadvantage in the sense that you definitely need to have. Disadvantage in the sense that you definitely need to have money to support students, like Tina mentioned. I mean, we at mathematics, of course, we have the TA ship, so your student can stay five years TA ship, but remember that that means that that student is not going to do any as much work as they should, right? In some sense, because they are half the time teaching. So, I try to get fellowships for my own students simply because otherwise they're not going to get work done, right? I mean, it's definitely. Going to get work done, right? I mean, it's definitely a very important factor for them to be able to do full-time dedication to the research. Yeah, and the other thing is don't be scared about writing grants, right? There is so much help. Every university, especially every R1 university, has help in terms of writing grants. There are people who can review your grants. You can ask people that you trust to review your grant. I review a lot of career grants. Grant. I review a lot of career grants for folks. You know, there are these career workshops that NSF runs, you know, where you get both positive and negative examples of good and bad career proposals. And again, for everybody, like they're, you know, when you write your grants first, they get rejected, but then, you know, you start getting grants. So don't get, you know, like, oh no, this is not going to work out for me, right? Don't get discouraged. And then diverse. Don't get discouraged. And then diversify, right? So, not only apply to NSF. There's lots of other avenues, right? Especially in America. Like, if you think about the military-industrial complex, like they all have money and, you know, that they're happy to hand out to people if you just write it in a certain way, write the proposal in a certain way. Thank you so much. I have actually a question, if I may ask. Please, please. Thank you. Thank you very much for this very nice and insightful discussion. The question that I have is: which one is more beneficial when we apply for postdocs or faculty position working on what? Working on a wide range of subjects, but have little amount of results, or working on basically one specific subject, but having more results. Which one is more beneficial when we have the reason that I am asking is because for myself, I mean, I have worked on those methods. Methods, theoretical stuff, topology and geometry, both actually, and their applications for complex network analysis. When I see some, I mean, it's in the sense of range that I have worked, it's very unusual, as people say, but when you compare it with people that have much narrower work, but maybe twice. Maybe twice of my papers. Which one is more beneficial? This is, and another question also related is how we can make a balance between working on theory methods and applications simultaneously. Because some things that makes me happy is working on theory, but some things that makes me even happier is that seeing the thing that I have done is also. The thing that I have done is also beneficial for people. But it's hard to because these two communities are very different. I have been in theoretical maths, conferences, workshops. It's totally different environments than what I experienced, for instance, in complex network conferences. So many people much more active, much more talkative. You know, it's really. you know it's it's it's really different environment and it's hard to uh you know it's two opposite sides and of course it's nice to have this experience but it's also hard to balance to make a balance between thank you very much um so let me try to first talk about your first question many working let's say in a diversity of topics versus just focusing your energy on just one topic Focusing your energy on just one topic. I will say I will love to have colleagues that all want to work in many things. That's what I will prefer. I will say it's more typical for young people like you at your academic age that people tend to specialize on something, and then once they are kind of established on that, they might start moving. Right, so but I think you have a chance to sell yourself the right way if you actually do your homework. For example, suppose I'm just going to give you an example. Suppose you tell me I have published in theoretical results in topological data analysis, and at the same time, I have done applications to image processing, right? So those are your two fields that you have worked on. Work on. Well, I will say that in that case, you definitely want to try to respond. So you need to tailor your job application to show, well, that's your strength. You should sell yourself as somebody that has this ability to do many things, right? You need to do your work in the sense, your homework in the sense that you need to network, maybe with two communities, right? That's a possibility that you can share that say, I'm able to talk to the I'm able to talk to the image processing people, but I'm also able to talk to the topological data analysis people, right? I think you don't have to be just in one area to be successful. It's just a little bit more difficult because you need to do more work, but you can be working actively in two fields, right? And just be mindful of the network that Tina and I keep telling you, right? Who's going to be your network? Who's going to graduate letters? And then when you apply for. To and then, when you apply for a job, if you really have strengths in two or three different topics, make sure that the three different people in those topics know that you're applying, right? For example, let's say that I have an applicant that is very strong in data science and at the same time is very strong in topology. That's great, right? But then you should write to the data scientists on the committee as well as the topologists in the department, right? You need to network with everybody that you can. You need to network with everybody that you can. So, use your diversity to your advantage, right? If you have really the ability to talk to many people, for example, you're very good with talking to computer scientists. At the same time, you're very good talking to mathematicians. That's great. But then you need to use to your service. Don't be ambivalent in some sense, right? You need to do the work of communicating to both what you need to do. And let's say your second. And uh, let's see, your second question was about uh, sorry, I forgot now the that was the sorry, well, I'll let I'll let working on theory and applications. Well, I would say that you naturally would like to start choosing something that you like the most normally, but if you really, really are good at both and you really like, enjoy both the same way, it will show in your work. I mean, you will really be able to. Able to, I think, keep up with that. In the case of my students, for example, I really recommend if they're really going to apply to jobs in the area of data science or optimization, they need to have both. I mean, I would say in these areas, it's impossible to have absolutely no experimental papers or that at least they know that you know how to deal with data, right? Or that you know how to run an algorithm or implement an algorithm. Otherwise, I think it's not believable that you are doing, you know. That you are doing, you know, I mean, it's more in mathematics. Let's say, if you're applying for a job in just in geometry or in topology, then they don't, in some sense, they don't care as much. I think they find that they are more like, oh, your papers is all that matters, right? Are they publishing good journals, right? That's all they care. They seem to care that way. In data science, you need to be able to do data as well as theory, I would say. So it's good that you have, if you have both, it's good. I think that's very good. Good, I think that's very good. Yeah, so I agree with Jesus. The one thing is that, so you have to think about when you're coming out on the market, right, and you're applying, where are you applying to, right? So, and where your publications are being, you know, where are your papers being published? And so, as a junior person, I agree with Jesus that you need to have a home. You see, and this is one of the actually big issues with junior people. Issues with junior people who have worked on many different things. Are you a computer scientist? Are you a mathematician? Right? And yes, I know there are these like joint hires now, but those become even tougher, right? So there are lots of people who say, oh, I'm a computer scientist, but then like a computer science department says, well, where have you published? And like, well, I've published in nature and science or whatever, right? And the computer science department says, you're not a computer scientist. That's not what we publish. Right? And like, wait a second, it's nature and science. And, like, wait a second, it's nature and science and proceeds to the National Academy of Sciences. Like, those are just tabloid, right? You know, I'm exaggerating, but the point is: like, do you have, if you're calling yourself a machine learning person, do you have a paper in International Conference on Machine Learning? It's unfortunate. It's very narrow-minded, but that's the way it is, right? And so, as a young person, you really need to have a home, you know, that mafia that's part of you. And so, because of that, it helps to focus on one subject. Helps to focus on one subject. In terms of theory and application, so if you pick one, collaborate with people who are good at the other, right? And in fact, this is, for example, what happened in the collaborations we had with Pablo and my student, Leo Torres. So Pablo showed me this paper and it was like, okay, sounds good. It was, I think, Nature Pristina and National Academy of Sciences. It was like, okay, fine. Then Leo joined and then Leo is like, oh, look at this beautiful Ethereum I found. Look at this beautiful theorem I found. I'm like, how am I going to compute it? We went back and forth for two years, poor Pablo and Leo teaching me topology. And I'm like, okay, this is fine. But it wasn't really that, like, like light bulbs weren't going out until like Leo's like, oh, but we can compute it in this way. I'm like, oh, you got my attention there, right? And then there were applications, and it's such a great paper. And so, but it was just like poor Leo and Pablo suffering. And Pablo suffering through two years of me saying, What? Because I'm an application for this. Like, what? Like, okay, cool, but if I can't compute it, I don't care about it. So there's some of that. But it was a great partnership. It was a great partnership. And we were so lucky that Pablo was there because at that time, Leo really needed a mentor that knew a lot of math. And so it was a really good tag team. And so these kinds of things happen. And it all started with Pablo showing me. All started with Pablo showing me this paper, which I wasn't that excited about. But he's like, look at the topology of it. No, I mean, it was amazing to be able to collaborate with the two of you because then we could actually get something done. Because let me spotlight myself, I guess. Yeah. Well, with you and Lil, all I remember is lots of Spanish going by. I bet something's like, oh, she's an idiot. She doesn't know what topology is. No, I mean, it's, I guess, but. I mean, it's, I guess, but I guess I agree with Jesus because I'm, you know, I'm working in a math institute. So for me, it's hard sometimes to justify some of the publications that I've come out with. And sometimes they're not taken into account. They're even like a little bit puzzled by them. Not that paper, because that one I think was so good that they were like, oh, yeah, you did this. So you're okay. But I have another paper or some other papers on like network science and network analysis that. Analysis that they kind of don't really know how to classify them. But you know, I'm kind of beyond the point where that matters. I'm kind of this I do because I can. So I don't, you know, you should probably be a bit more careful than that as you're kind of coming up and, you know, growing in your academic life. I think I should probably also speak for a couple of the audience members, maybe. So, what about like people that are So, what about like people that are in like the master's level and they want to go to a PhD? Or the people that are like in a postdoc position and they kind of want to do a lateral move, maybe like move countries or move institutions. Maybe those, you know, probably issues that we haven't touched on all that much. And I'll take a back seat again so that I let you have the spotlight, whoever wants to go for. I probably wants to go first. So, I mean, lateral moves from, let's say, one country to the other. There's definitely, I will say, I'll tell you just one story. I mean, I know people that in Germany, they are, I mean, I'm very familiar with the German system. And it seems to me that overall is a little bit harsher with young people because the permanent positions are slightly different. The permanent positions are slightly more unavailable. And in the US, for example, there's many small colleges that hire at least their teaching jobs, right? In Germany, it seems to be a little bit more of a pseudo-sum game, right? Either you get the job or there's nothing for you, right? And there's even an age, like a time limit that you can apply 12 years, I believe. You can only apply for academic positions up to 12 years. So if you're going to do a lateral job from Germany or A lateral job from Germany or Europe in general to the US, I will say, try to do it. Uh, let's say, don't wait too long because the stories I can tell you, sometimes people wait too long. And then when you apply for jobs in the US, they're going to say, well, this person has never taught in the US. We're going to hire this person as a tenured, as an assistant professor, right? I mean, maybe you have a lot more experience by then, and you see if you feel offended, well, they want to hire me as an assistant professor because I have never taught in the US. I have never taught in the US. So I will say a lot of the people that successfully transfer from the European market to the American market, they do it in their earlier careers as a, they come as a postdoc, for example, typically. They do a second postdoc, and then they start moving into the American system, so to speak, right? Master's programs. I mean, if you are in a master's degree and now you want And now you want to do a PhD, perhaps? I will say it's very good for you because we sometimes like to hire, prefer to hire a master's student than to hire an undergraduate student. But at the same time, funding might be limited in the sense that if you already have a master's, we will make you an offer for three years. That's typically what happens in American universities. The amount of years that you get offer funding is reduced by the number of years that you. Is reduced by the number of years that you were in the master's program. So just be mindful of that kind of situation. I think I'll stop here. Maybe Tina has other reactions to the question. Yeah, I think it's absolutely right. The one thing with the PhD program, at least in America, and I would imagine this is the case elsewhere, is how good you are at doing research. It's about your aptitude for research. So if I was a master's student, Research. So, if I was a master's student and I wanted to apply for a PhD program at the institute that I was in, I would try to do research with some professor and definitely persist, right? So, just because the first professor says, oh, I'm not taking any more students, don't stop there, right? For example, read a paper of the professor, right? Ask them about it. Most professors have office hours. Go to their office hours. Like, if I get a cold email, oh, I want to do research, that doesn't really excite me. That doesn't really excite me. But if I get an email from a master's student who said, Oh, I read this paper of yours and I have a question about it, I want to come talk to you, then I'm more interested, right? I'm like, okay, here's my office hours, come talk to me. And then that could develop into a project where you would have a paper. And basically, in America, it's about how good you are at research for the PhD. And if you have a paper, then even better, right? Even if it is on archive, for example. And then with the country moving. And then with the country move, I completely agree with Jesus: moving early and utilizing your social network. Again, the problem is in America, we can only look to the front of our nose. We don't really look beyond, right? And that's why when we organize workshops, for example, my European friends always complain, How come you guys don't invite us? And it's really because I'm not thinking of you. That's really it. Like, you know, you're not in my frontal cortex. You're not in my frontal cortex to think about, like, oh, maybe I should invite this person from Europe. And so it's more about coming to conferences that are happening in America, tapping into your social network, et cetera, et cetera. And then the one thing I do want to say is that there is help out there, right? You're not by yourself, right? So yes, there's a lot of work. There's a lot of practicing and it's like really time consuming, but you're not alone. Really time-consuming, but you're not alone. There's lots of different avenues. Like, if you're a woman, there's CRAW, so Computing Research Association for Women. There's the Grace Hopper Conference. There's the, I believe it's Association of Women in Mathematics. There's lots of different areas that you can reach out to to get help. You are not alone. So, yeah. And there are a lot of fellowships that you should consider applying to. For example, Applying to. For example, let's say since we are in Mexico officially, right? So I should mention CONACIT, there's something called UCMexus, for example, that connects University of California with Mexican scientists or researchers. Or if you are a postdoc, you want to do a postdoc in the US, and you are Mexican, you can apply for these fellowships to come to California. I mean, there's all kinds of funding opportunities, and I would say be aggressive on funding. I would say be aggressive on funding opportunities that can let you get you a job, at least a temporary job. I mean, that's a good thing to try. I mean, think of the Sloan Fellowships, there's the Fulbright Fellowships. I mean, if you're transferring from another country, especially Latin America, I think by applying to such fellowships, you open the door. So, for example, I'll give you my favorite example. I talked to a lot of people in operations research and Research and Georgia Tech is one of the biggest schools in operations research in the United States. And they tell me the story that they never had a Brazilian student, right? In 1980, they had their first Brazilian student. And that was excellent, right? That Brazilian student is excellent. Well, now Georgia Tech is full of Brazilians, right? It's like they every year they get 20 Brazilians to come to the PhD. And this is the kind of thing that there are relationships. The kind of thing that there are relationships that need to be formed. I mean, when I first arrived at UC Davis, there were no Mexicans at all, and now we have a bunch. I mean, so there's these connections that Latin America or the European countries, you can develop connections to certain institutions in the US and that's very, very, very profitable. German institutions, for example, the DAD gives fellowships to come if you have a, it comes from Germany. It comes from Germany. I mean, I don't know the funding situation right now, but I have had DAD fellowships people come for one years, two years to do research in the US, right? Yeah, definitely the homophily angle. Sorry, just one thing. Definitely the homophily angle that Jesus just mentioned is very important. So you would see like these departments where there are a lot of Greeks or there are a lot of Indians or there are a lot of Iranians or Indians, or there are a lot of Iranians, or there are a lot of Mexicans, right? It's just, you know, like attracts like. And so that is a door to get in. So sorry about that. No, totally agree. Correct. I just wanted to add to Jesus' comment about Germany. Yeah, so since I myself did a postdoc, it was in Penn State and then back in Germany. Was in Penn State and then back in Germany, and then I got this position in the US. So, but one of the things that I see that, so certainly, you know, people like people who apply for a postdoc, this is certainly very, very international. But one of the opportunities that some people use with success are these fellowships from the DAD or DFG or also Fulbright. I mean, Fulbright will sponsor students from Europe to come to the US and spend a period of time. And spend a period of time there. So, and go ahead. And for Americans, don't forget to apply the other way. For example, Japan has fantastic fellowships. Yes, very fantastic fellowships. I mean, and you get every, I mean, NSF, there's a Japanese NSF fellowship every year that you can apply for. You can spend two years in Japan. China, I mean, there's a lot of opportunities in China, it's a little bit more restricted, I will say, these days because of the I would say these days because of the tension between the US and China, but there's all kinds of opportunities to go abroad. If you're American, don't hesitate to go abroad. I mean, there's great opportunities abroad. I mean, in the UK, for example, I mean, you always see announcements of opportunities abroad. Maybe also, you know, the long programs at the research institutes, this is also a big one that people use. And sometimes they also have postdoctoral fellowships, like ISO. Fellowships like at ICERM or at IPAM, you know, or at MSRI. So, a lot of people go and spend, you know, some time in there, and that's where they build their network and, you know, and prepare themselves. Maybe. And now there are some collaborations between certain of these research institutes in the US and European institutions, including the Max Bank Society. Okay, so we have more questions, topics to discuss. I have just one more question, Guido, if it is possible. Of course. I mean, so long as the panelists have the time, so I hope they do. Thank you. It's just about this going abroad. What do you think about having visitorships, like short times visit short period visitorship? A short period with internship three, four months, up to six months in different places during your post-like based on Europe, for instance, Germany, and going to US to three, four places for up to six months. Yes, I have had many visitors myself from Germany that come from one semester, for example. I think, in fact, my understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe you have a fellowship in the in Max Planck. Believe you have a fellowship in the in Max Plan? Is that where you're at the end of my PhD? Yeah, in Max Planck, sometimes the DFG gives fellowships to go, specifically to go outside for six months or for one year or something. And I mean, of course, what you need in that case is a sponsor, right? You need somebody in the US that is willing to take you. But I mean, if you again, if you have a network, again, the network issue, you can find somebody to say, yeah, sure, come for six months. We can work. Yeah, sure, come for six months. We can work on something. I'm sure we can find a project together or whatever, right? I have had several German students come in that way, PhDs that were finishing, you know, they were in the last year of their PhD, but they want to go for six months to the US, do something else, or just drive in California, I guess. And yeah, people come and people write to me about possibilities like that. And I will encourage everybody to try to do that if you can. Everybody to try to do that if you can afford it, because if you have the time and the funding, that would be great. But also, I mean, if you want to come to an American institution, we always need people to teach. Now, just remember that normally means that you're going to be teaching and you're not going to have as much time to do research. I had a German student ask me to come and we could find for this person a teaching position. That was not the problem. The problem is that then there's no time for. That then there's no time for really talking to me, right? They're just teaching essentially. So that depends on what you want to do, right? Sorry, even a visitor should do this type of teaching or? No, I mean, again, some visitors come, they come with some fellowship and they just do research, they come to visit. They really are visitors, right? Okay. Other people come, but they say, well, I need extra money because I'm coming with my family. Can I teach a class? And that's something we can arrange. And that's that's something we can arrange. Uh, because some I mean, some people bring children, or you know, they have family, you cannot afford to be just with one fellowship or something. There's all kinds of, yeah, depends on your personal situation in some sense. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, the more people that know how great you are, the better. Yeah. You know, you just have to go and tell them how great you are. How would they know how great you are while sitting in Leipzig? They wouldn't know. So, you know. So, you know, yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's that's such great comments. I'm just going to reiterate a couple of things that God said that I were actually like, when you said that you have to go to talks by like visitors, that's how I got my first postdoc, actually. I talked to a professor that was visiting and I told him about the stuff that I was interested in. And he said, oh, this professor in my department has a grant and he has money for postdocs. And he has money for postdocs. So I cold-emailed this other professor that I didn't know. And he's like, Yeah, great, come give a talk. And that's how I got my job. So that was like, you know, that actually does happen. I mean, this was a while ago because I didn't finish my PhD last year, but still, you know. And then these visiting positions in IPAM, for example, that's how I met Tina because she was the organizer of the culture analytics program a while ago. And that's how I ended up being there. That's how I ended up being there for several months, looking into all of these things. And we ended up writing a paper together eventually. So I think you should really definitely take advantage of all of these opportunities, which are very open and very, I wouldn't say accessible because everything's competitive, but definitely they exist and you should go for it. I don't know. Maybe we should. I don't know if anyone else has any other questions, but maybe we should wrap it up so that. But maybe we should wrap it up so that we can let Tina and Jesus enjoy the rest of their days as well. We'll have them here forever. Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you very much.
