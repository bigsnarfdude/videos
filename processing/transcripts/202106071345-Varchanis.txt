I have to say, I'm a postdoc at the lab of Amy Shen and Simon Howard in Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology. Our motivation for this work are the experimentally observed instabilities in worm-like micellar solutions. When you pump a worm-like micellar solution in a cross-load apparatus, like the one Apparatus like the one presented here, it has been observed that for low values of the flow rate or the Weisenberg number, the flow is symmetric. However, after a critical value of the flow rate, the flow bifurcates and we get these asymmetric flow profiles with strong birefringent strands. A similar phenomenon was observed very recently in the flow past a cylinder. In the flow past the cylinder in a tunnel. As you can see here, for low values of the Weisenberg number, the wormlight micellar solution, the flow was split equally above and below of the cylinder. However, after a critical value of the flow rate, the flow bifurcated with this pitch fork bifurcation here, and the fluid preferred to pass either above or below the cylinder. This is a steady state, and we have the State, and we have both these configurations are bi-stable flows. Also, as it was mentioned also before in a previous presentation, when a sphere sediments in a worm-like micellar solution, we can see that after a critical value of the Weisenberg number, which is defined by the density ratio between the sphere and the worm-like myself or solution, the terminal velocity does not, the sphere does not. The sphere does not reach a steady velocity, but instead there are oscillations in the motion of the sphere. Finally, when this worm-like micellar solution was also pumped in a channel with flexible cylinders, it was observed that initially the flow became asymmetric, and then we observed also oscillations in the flow, periodic oscillations, which resulted to chaos, to non-periodic. To non-periodic oscillations. So, the goals of our simulations in this project is to answer the following questions. First, can we simulate accurately the flow of entangled worm-like micellar solutions? When I say entangled, I mean worm-like micellar solutions that exhibit a non-monotone flow curve, giving rise to shear banding. Giving rise to sear banding, and at the same time, they exhibit strain-hardening effects, as you can see here in the caper, which gives rise to elasticity, to strong elastic effects. And the second question we wanted to answer is, can popular consecutive models predict the experimentally observed instabilities in the cross-lot and in the cylinder? So, to do so, we employed for three popular considerations. Three popular consecutive models, and the fourth that I will analyze in a while. The first model is the diffusive Johnson-Sigalman model. At this point, I should stress that in all the cases that we will examine, we will use the diffusive variants of the consecutive equations in order to account for a smooth transition between the bands when the flow is zero-banded and also to guarantee uniqueness of the numerical solution. Guarantee the uniqueness of the numerical solution, which does not depend on the initial conditions. So, back to the model. The Johnson-Siegelman model, as you can see here, is a single tensorial equation that features five parameters. The elastic modulus, the relaxation time, this Xi parameter that governs the affinity of the chains, and the solvent viscosity, and the stress diffusion coefficient. Sear banding arises in this model. Banding arises in this model from the definition of the objective derivative, which, as you can see here, is a linear combination of the upper convected derivative and the lower convected derivative. When xi attains values lower than one, the flow curve is non-monotone and shear banding effects are predicted by the model. The next model that we will employ is the diffusive Gizakus model. Here you can see, again, is a single tensorial equation. Again, it's a single tensorial equation that features five parameters: the elastic modulus, relaxation time, the mobility parameter, the solvent viscosity, and the diffusion coefficient. While in this case, C orbandic arises from the non-linear stress term in the Gisekus model. The next model that we will use is the Vasquez-Cook-McKinley model, the so-called VCM model. In this model, this is a model that has more features. This is a model that has more physics than the previous models. It is assumed that the worm-like micellar solution is in the worm-like micellar solution, we can find two type of micelles, the long micelles, which are called species A, and the short micelles, which are called species B. As the flow evolves, the long micelles break and give species B, and Species B and the short micelles reform giving species A. As you can see, this model is quite more complex than the previous models. It is two tensorial plus two scalar equations, while it exhibits seven parameters. And in this case, shear banding arises from the breakouts of species A to species B. We will also introduce a modified version of this. Version of this of the VCM model. There are also some other modified versions of the VCM model. In this work, we will present one more, which we will call MVCM model. In fact, the MVCM model is exactly the same with the VCM model. Nothing changed except for the definition of the breakout rate of species A. As you can see here in this modified version, we assume that the breakout rate We assume that the breakout of species A is proportional to the trace of the conformation tensor instead of the double dot product of the deformation rate tensor and the conformation tensor of species A. And the physical meaning of this is that micelles break proportionally to their stretch. As they are stretched more, they break more easily. So, in order to estimate the So in order to estimate the parameters of the model, we have to calibrate them in a real worm-like micellar solution. We will use this specific worm-like micellar solution, which has been used in many studies in our lab and has been pumped in many microfluidic devices, also characterized in shear and extensional flow. Here you can see the linear data. It can be fit very nicely with a single mode. Nicely with a single mode maxwell relaxation spectrum. This is the case for the Johnson-Siegelman model and the Gisekus model. They reduced to a single mode Maxwell relaxation spectrum in the linear regime, while the VCM-like models reduced to a two-mode maxwell relaxation spectrum in the linear regime, which as you can see here, it can fit very precisely the spectrum of this worm-like micellar solution. Of this warm-light micellar solution. Regarding the CREology, here you can see the flow curve, the stress versus the CR8. As you can see, it is strongly CR banding with the plateau spanning four orders of magnitude in the CR8. The way that we estimated the parameters for its model is the following. Initially, we found the elastic modulus in the relaxation time from the small amplitude oscillatory data. Small amplitude oscillatory data, and with those given, we perform non-linear regression to the other parameters to the flow curve and the extensional data that I will show in a while. Finally, the only parameter that we cannot estimate from rheometric data is the diffusion, the stress diffusion coefficient. So we went to the literature and we found some values measured in such type of worm like myself. In such type of worm-like micellar solutions, and we assign the value of the diffusion coefficient to be of the order of 10 to the minus 11, which is representative for such type of worm-like micellar solutions. Here you can see the flow curves as predicted by each model and minimized by the non-linear regression process to the experimental data. We start with the Johnson-Siegelman model. You can see that. Siegelman model, you can see that it cannot fit well the flow curve. We get an enormous jump in the CR8 to fit this plateau. Here are the parameters. On the other hand, the Gisecus model can make a very nice fit to the experimental data. The curve is still non-monotone. However, it can capture very nicely the experimental data. Here we also have the prediction for the V. The prediction for the VCM model. Again, the curve is non-monotone, while it can capture very nicely the data with a smaller jump in the CO rate. And finally, the MVCM model, which can also capture the data with giving a smaller jump in the CORE. Here you can also see the first planar extensional viscosity, the predictions of the models compared. Of the models compared to the experimental data that they were fitted. I have to repeat that we fitted simultaneously the flow curve and the first planar extensional viscosity as measured in the cross-load. So, starting with the Johnson-Siegelman model, we all know that it predicts an infinite extension of viscosity. So, for sure, it cannot capture the extensional data of this world-like micellar solution. Proceeding to the Gisecus model. Proceeding to the Gisecus model, we can see that the model underestimates the extensional data. It is not possible for the Gisecus model to predict at the same time CR banding and extension rate hardening. However, the VCM model and the VM VCM model can make a very good prediction, predicting at the same time shear banding and this extension rate hardening response to capture the Response to capture the first planar extensional viscosity of the worm-like Mancellar solution. So, after we have estimated the parameters of the consecutive equations that represent the rheological response of this worm-like micellar solution, we proceed to the first benchmark test, which is channel flow. Here we have the worm-like micellar solution flowing in a Resolution flowing in a channel, a very small channel, microfluidic device. As you can see here, the width of the channel is 400 microns. And here the material experiences only CR deformation. So we will evaluate the CR banding effects predicted by its model. The boundary conditions that we use for the momentum are no slip and no penetration. Momentum are no slip and no penetration. We assume fully developed flow, one-dimensional planar simulations, and creeping flow of the Reynolds number is equal to zero because of the very small scale of the geometry. The rest of the dimensionless numbers that govern this flow are the Weisenberg number, the dimensionalness diffusivity, which, as you can see here, based on the value that we assigned, is very low. Assigned is very low and representative for work-like Myceler solutions, and we also have the viscosity ratio and the parameters of its model. Finally, I have to say that regarding the constitutive equation, since we have this diffusive term, we apply Neumann conditions, no flux conditions at all the boundaries of the geometry. Here you can see the predictions of each model versus the experimental data. Versus the experimental data measured by PIV. We start with the Johnson-Siegelman model. As you can see here, with the blue symbols, are the velocity profile UX versus the width of the channel for Weisenberg number equal to 2, while the red symbols is again the velocity profile for Weisenberg number equal to 10.5. We see that the Johnson-Siegelman model, excuse me, does not present the vehicle. Model, excuse me, does not predict any evolution in the flow profile as the one-simple number is increased. However, it can predict a nicely sear-bounded flow. The Gizikos model can give a better prediction. It can predict this evolution in the flow profile as the Weissenberg number is increased. And this is the same case for the VCM model and the modified VCM model, which again can make a nice prediction. Again, we can make a nice prediction regarding the measured experimental data in this channel flow. Now we proceed to a much more difficult benchmark test, the flow in the cross-lot, the flow of the worm-like micellar solution in the cross-lot. Here, the flow is mixed. We have flow incoming from these two inflows in the cross-lot, then the fluid is. The fluid is stretched in the stagnation point and heads toward the outflow boundaries. At the inflow boundaries, we impose fully developed flow with a mean average velocity. We also employ 4% rounded corners at the cross-lot, at the convex corners of the cross-lot to avoid the stress singularity. At all walls of the geometry, we impose a no-slip, no penetration condition. No slip, no penetration condition and outflow boundary with flow rating position at both outflow boundaries. We perform two-dimensional planar simulations again under creating flow assumption and the governing dimensional numbers for this flow are the Weisenberg number, which in this case is based on the apparent extension rate and the status. Extension rate at the stagnation point, the dimensionless diffusivity, the viscosity ratio, the viscosity ratio, and the model parameters. We will compare the predictions of the models versus the measured asymmetry parameter, flow asymmetry parameter, which compares the amount of the flow, the flow rate that heads from one inflow to this outflow and from the same inflow to the outflow. From the same inflow to the other outflow. Here you can see the predictions of each model versus the experimental data. For the Johnson-Siegelman model, we can see that the asymmetry is predicted correctly. However, the magnitude of the asymmetry is predicted correctly. However, the critical Weisenberg number is predicted quite earlier than the experimental one and also the Experimental one, and also the flow becomes transient at earlier values of the Weisenberg number. On the other hand, the Gisekus model over predicts the value of the critical Weisenberg number compared to the experiment, while it cannot predict the magnitude of the asymmetry at high values of flow rate. For the VCM model, we went up to Weisenberg numbers equal to two. Weisenberg numbers equal to two, and we could not get asymmetric solution. We were getting symmetric solutions, and after Weisenberg two, then we were getting transient solutions. We also had some problems with diverging, with code diverging. So the last convergence steady state that we could get is at Weisenberg number two without any sign of asymmetry. Regarding the MVCM model, we can see that it can predict. Can see that it can predict almost correctly the onset of asymmetry. Also, it's very close regarding the magnitude of the asymmetry, as you can see in this figure. Here, we also make a qualitative comparison of the flow fields. This is the experimentally measured birefringence in the gross lot for Weisenberg number equal to 1.8. 1.8, and here we saw the predictions of the Johnson-Siegelman model, the Giesekus model, and the MVCM model for the same value of the asymmetry parameter, not the same value of the Weisenberg number, only the MVCM could have a near quantitative match with the experiment. So we saw at the same value of the asymmetry parameter. As you can see here in the Johnson-Siegelman model, there is a qualitative There is a qualitative difference in the stress field because the maximum of the stress is not located at the stagnation point but is located close to the convex corners of the cross load. This is not the case for the Gizekus model and the MVCM model, which as you can see, they can make a nice prediction also regarding the stresses with the maximum of the stresses at the stagnation point. Finally, we proceed. Finally, we proceed to the most difficult benchmark test: the flow past the cylinder in its center, where the kinematics is mixed. Here, the fluid experiences both shear deformations at the side of the cylinders and close to the walls, and strong extensional deformations at the wake of the cylinder. Here you can see the flow geometry. The boundary conditions are more or less the same. Fully developed flow at the inflow, open boundary condition of the outflow. Flow, open boundary condition of the outflow, no slip, no penetration conditions at the walls of the geometry. Again, this is a microfluidic device. The radius of the cylinder is 20 microns and the width of the channel is 400 microns. So we can safely assume creeping flow and two-dimensional planar simulations. Again, the dimensionless numbers are the same, the Weisenberg number, the dimensionless diffusivity, the viscosity. Diffusivity, the viscosity erasing, the model parameters. And again, we will test the models versus the flow asymmetry parameter, which in this case is defined as the difference of the velocity at the two sides of the cylinder over their sum. So we start again with the Johnson-Siegelman model. You can see it predicts the critical. Predicts that the critical Weisenberg number at the way, way low value of the Weisenberg number compared to the experiment, for the experiment is around 60. The Johnson-Singleband model predicts this, the critical Weisenberg number at Weisenberg number around 6 or 7, while again the Gisekus model over predicts the critical Weisenberg number is about 150 compared to 6. 150 compared to 60 for the experiment. As in the gross lot, the same scenario we encountered here with the VCM model. After a while, we were getting transient solutions, which were not asymmetric, but the stress was pulsatizing behind the cylinder. And with the MVCM model, we can see that we can achieve a very nice agreement, both regarding the onset of asymmetry as well as for As well as for the magnitude of the asymmetry parameter. However, the MVCM model predicts the flow becoming transient, periodic at a lower value of the Weisenberg number than observed in the experiment. We also here plot some contours of the magnitude of the velocity profiles to show a very interesting fact. Very interesting fact. In the experiment, as you can see here, for any value of the Weisenberg number, when the flow was bifurcated and asymmetric, there was no negative weight behind the cylinder. However, the Giesakus model predicts a strong negative weight behind the cylinder, and the MVCA model also is less pronounced the effect in the MVCA model. However, they are strikingly different. Strikingly different from the experiment, which does not predict any negative weight. We are still working on it and trying to figure out what is causing this qualitative difference between the predictions of the models and the experiment. Regarding the fact that we didn't encounter asymmetric solutions with the VCM model, while with the NVCM model, we can, we could. VCA model, we could find these asymmetric solutions, despite the fact that they have very similar, almost identical SEAR predictions. We think that it has to do with the extensional response of these two models. The VCM model predicts always a non-monotone curve, a tensile stress difference versus extension rate in extension when it's fitted to non-monotone CR data. Non-monotone shear data. I mean, if the flow curve in shear is non-monotone, then also the extension curve will be non-monotone. This leads to an under prediction of elasticity for this specific worm-like micellar solution, which is entangled, highly entangled, and strongly elastic. On the other hand, modifying the breakouts rate of species A can Species A can lead to a monotone flow curve, as you can see here. And this is the same case with the Johnson-Siegelman model and the Gisecus model. And using this monotone flow curve, we were able to reproduce accurately the experiments with the worm-like micellar solution. So, to conclude, we performed a comparison among popular consecutive models for entangled worm-like micellar solutions. We have solved the consecutive. We have solved the constitutive equations in complex flows with highly non-monotone flow curves. All the models give near quantitative prediction in SEER. The Johnson-Siegelman and the Gisekus model give qualitative predictions in extensional and mixed flows because the extensional response is either overpredicted for the Johnson-Siegelman model and underpredicted for the Gizakus model. The MVCM performs best in complex flows. Performs best in complex flows. The VCM model exhibits a strongly non-monotone tensile stress difference when the flow curve is also non-monotone, which can become monotone by altering the breakout rate of species A. And this mono. However, this non-monotonicity may be applicable to other worm-like micellar solutions, not the one that we examined. The Gizepus and the VCM models are numerically easier to solve. Easier to solve, and the results of the VCM-based model compensate for the high computational cost. Thank you for your attention. We cannot hear you, Pam. So sorry. Yeah, I was muted, so I wouldn't be bothering you. Thank you very much for the talk. It was very detailed. Was very detailed. You have several questions, so let's do a few before we go to the discussion group. And the first one is Pierre. Hello, do you have some interpretation for the physical meaning of the diffusive stress term in your concept equation and also for the corresponding boundary condition associated with the Laplacian operation? With the Laplacian operator, there is some boundary cognition for the full stress all along the boundary. So what about the spec in your constituent equation? Yeah, the stress diffusion term when performing numerical simulations with sear-banded flow curves is a necessity, at least for so complex simulations where you can't have the disparate. Where you can't have the discretization to solve the constitutive equation without this diffusion term. It has been shown in the literature that if you use a small value for the diffusion coefficient, then you can get consistent results and smooth transition between the bands. Regarding the physical interpretation, I think that based on the works in the literature, it represents. Literature, it represents the length scale of the diffusion between the two bands when the flow is shear-banded. Now, regarding the boundary condition, we use this because it's the most established in the literature, the no-flux, and the most easy to apply. There are also some robin-type boundary conditions or Dirichlet type, but Endurably type, but there are many questions on what values you should adopt for the stress at the wall or for the confirmation, yeah, or the additional parameters that the robin boundary condition induces. So we just use this because it's the simplest one. Also, we have made some tries with other boundary conditions. With other boundary conditions, but if you use a very small diffusivity, it's not so important. At least if you use a very small value for the stress diffusion coefficient, we observed that it was not so important. So it's not physically it's not a physical motivation, it's more or less a way to solve in a easier way your constructive model or Instructive model or in an easier way and also to get mass convergence. I mean, when you have this, you can get mass convergence. And you can also perform numerical simulation starting from equilibrium for a given value of the Weissenberg number and getting the same result. No need to start from low flow rate and increasing till you get a steady state, and then use this as initial condition and increase again. And increase again and increase again. Okay. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Esteban, you had a question. Yeah, thanks very much, Pam. Stilano, very good work, very interesting. I have a couple of questions really quickly. I maybe missed the information, but in your cross-slots geometry, are they the simulations and experiments, of course? Are they planar or axisymmetric? Axisymmetric. No, no, no, it's planar. It's not a three-dimensional cross-slot, it's a two-dimensional cross-slot. I don't know here if you can see, and it's planar. Oh, it's planar. Okay, good. And I have a very quick question. In your last slides, you showed that the VCM model in extension has got some non-monotonicity. Yeah. Can we maybe assign this kind of response to any kind of Of response to any kind of, say, extension banding or something like that? I've thought about this, but it would be difficult to imagine how the flow would be. First of all, it is also almost impossible to get a perfectly homogeneous extensional flow field to see this. But based on this worm-like myself solution, because based on the work of Michael Cromer on Work of Michael Cromer on filament extension, it has been observed that the filaments were breaking way faster than polymer solutions. So in that case, I think that the flow curve was non-monotone and the right constitutive equation to use would be the VCM. However, as I saw it also here, for this specific worm-like micellar solution, which is entangled and strongly elastic. Entangled and strongly elastic, you can see that it doesn't break in the cable. Instead, it gives a strong elastocapillary resime. So I think this is a reason that you need this extension rate hardening effect to reproduce the asymmetry in the cross-lot and in the flow past the cylinder in a channel. So, you would say that the ingredient really to reproduce at least this. That the ingredient really to reproduce at least this experimental data is a strong extension response for, yeah, yeah, yeah, both both instabilities are tightly related to elasticity and promoted by sear thing. I see. Excellent work. Really interesting. Hopefully, we can discuss more on the discussion session. Thanks, Bob. Thanks. Thank you. Said, you had a question? Yes. Yeah, it's a very quick question on slide 15. Yeah. By the way, very nice talk. Great work. Thank you so much. So in the JS model, you were showing that the concentration of the stress is around the corners. But when I'm comparing the different cases, the ranges that you are giving are different for the stress, right? So if you Is except for the fact that also the Weisenberg numbers are different. The Johnson-Siegelman model predicts an infinite extensional viscosity. Okay, with the stress diffusion term is not infinite, but is very high compared to the extensional viscosities of the Giesekus model and the modified VCA model. I mean, here in the first planar extensional viscosity, the term Planar extensional viscosity, the Trouton ratio is at maximum six, if I am correct, for the Johnson-Siegelman model is infinite. So I would expect the fact that I didn't expect is that I was assuming that the stress will also be maximum at the stagnation point, which is not. Right, right. Okay. It's at the corners. So I actually have a question. So, I actually have a question, which is: so, the MCM, is that what you called it model that you? MDCM, I guess you called it. That looks like the GCV model. Have you? Yeah, sure. It looks a lot. The only difference is that instead of this exponential term over the determinant of the conformity. The conformation tensor, it uses a simpler expression, just proportional to the conformation tensor. You know, also in the point of doing simulations, I don't know why, but some expressions seem to be more stable. I mean, this is the expression of, it resembles the linear version of the PTT model, how it assumes that the network breaks, and for some reason is very stable. Reason is very stable. And when you do simulations, you can go to high Weisenberg numbers. And also, as I said at the conclusion section, is numerically easier to solve. Okay, thank you. Yes, very nice. And I think we have some comments here about diffusion in the chat room if you want to read them. And I think we now we
