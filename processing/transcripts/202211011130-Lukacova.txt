Maria Lukakova. She's going to talk about a hybrid multi-scale method for complex polymetric fluids. Thank you, Maria. The floor is yours. Thank you, Chairman. And okay, so first of all, let me thank the organizers for this kind invitation. It's really a pleasure to be part of this workshop, and I'm very sorry not to be in person there. I hope we will have an opportunity. I hope we will have an opportunity to meet again in OHACA in the future. So, today I would like to discuss with you one strategy, how to approximate complex polymeric fluids. And I'm building on the strategy of heterogeneous multi-scale method, which was introduced as the suitable framework for mathematical analysis some years ago by Wainan E and Jon. Waynon E and Jon Enquist. So, here the idea is the following: I have two levels, you can also find more level, but okay, I have two level models. I have the macroscopic description. I hope you see my pointer. The U is the macroscopic solution, and that model is incomplete because some D data are missing. And I will obtain this data from the microscopic description, where U is the small microscopic solution. Where U is the small microscopic solution, but it is constrained by the macroscopic information. So that's written down here. And now my goal is to solve complex polymeric fluids with incomplete rheological relations. So in particular, for example, I do not know really how the stress tensor looks like. On the micro model, I can use different description. I can use particle simulations, which we have seen also here in this. Which we have seen also here in this workshop. We work with molecular dynamics, but one possibility is also to use the kinetic model. So, my idea is to combine the advantages for both words. Like, I would like to combine the advantage of the macroscopic model, which is efficient but not accurate, and the advantage of the microscopic model, which is accurate but unfortunately not so efficient. Okay, so. Okay, so for example, with my colleague from statistical physics, we are simulating colloid polymer mixture. And one possibility to represent that or to model that is to combine on the microscopic level, kinetic, on the macroscopic level, well, computational fluid dynamics or my Nabier-Stokes equation. Other opportunity will be to combine molecular dynamic and macroscopic description. But today I would like, because the talk is short, I would like just to concentrate I would like just to concentrate on the coupling between kinetic and continuum mechanic model. Well, and this is the joint work with several people. In particular, I should mention Hanna Miserova from Bratislava and Agniszkazviacheka Kriazda, as well as Piotr Kriazda from Borsau. So, what is my situation? The situation is following. I have the dilute polymer solution, and as you see with this green term. Green well, dumbbells. This is my polymeric molecule. So, these polymeric molecules are surrounded by the Newtonian fluid, and I have the dilute solution. So, there is no direct interaction between these green molecules. So, the model which can be used for the classical, is the incompressible Navier-Stokes system. So, I have the divergence freedom of velocity due to incompressibility. Omega is my physical domain. And then I have. Physical domain, and then I have this evolution equation for velocity. Because the fluid which I have here is complex, I not only have the diffusive effects due to the velocity, but also additional stress tensor, the elastic stress tensor. Now, there are many models how to represent elastic effects of my polymeric fluids, even there are many macroscopic models. But what I would like to do, I would like to take the information, have this The information how this stress tensor looks like from the kinetic model, from the microscopic model. Okay, so again, come back to my dumbbell. You see that they are connected by the spring and R is the vector in general R D. So I may have two or three dimensional situations for the conformation space. And so with R, I have the I'm defining the length of the molecule. Defining the length of the molecule or of this spring as well as the orientation. Okay, and then what I am interested in is not to approximate or to model each particle molecule, but I just want to know how they move in average, or I would like to know what is the probability distribution of them. So psi is my probability distribution function. And in this Fokker-Planck equation, you see the first two terms is just the transport operator. Transport operator, and then we have forces which act on my molecular. So, first of all, I have the friction force which is exerting by the surrounding fluid. So, this is the third term on the left-hand side. And then I have the stochastic force due to Brownian motion. So, this is the Laplace term with respect to R. And in front of that, as you see, I have some nonlinear function, gamma 2, given function, but it depends on the length of. Function, but it depends on the length of my. And the third, okay, the second term on the right-hand side, the third force is the spring force. In classical Hukanian model, which is the linear model, it will just be constant times r, but in our situation, we have a non-linear case, and I have again a given function gamma one, which depends on the length of my polymeric molecule. So that's the spring force. And then on the right-hand side, I have the additional. Hand side, I have the additional diffusion with respect to X, which is due to the fact that I assume that the velocity around the polymeric molecule might not be constant, right? So there are additional effects which then act up, comes into this diffusive term on the right-hand side. Okay, so the model I have just described is quite difficult to analyze mathematically and. And some years ago, Peterlin suggested that instead of taking really each individual length of the molecule, it is enough in this nonlinear function to consider the average length, right? And the average length, so if I have probability distribution function, I am taking the average length, expected value, it's nothing else just the trace of the so-called confirmation tensor. And this conformation tensor is related. And this conformation tensor is related to the elastic stress tensor, which I have shown you at the beginning. Fine, so now my kinetic model will be this peterlin kinetic model, where the nonlinear function depends on the trace of C. So I have the coupling between the macroscopic and the microscopic model, because in the microscopic model, in my kinetic model, I have the macroscopic velocity of my The macroscopic velocity of my solution as well as the trace C, and C is the macroscopic variable. Indeed, if I take this Fokker-Planck equation, I can do the formal macroscopic closure just by multiplying R times R and integrating over Rd. This is the configuration space, and this is the system which I obtain. So, this is nothing else just the evolution equation. Evolution equation for the conformation tensor. And people who are familiar with the Old Roid B model recovered some similarities. However, in the Old Roid B, I will not have this non-linear function which depends on trace C. So that's the patterling model for the time evolution of the conformation tensor. So that's my model. So I have So I have coupling between the macroscopic model, this Adenarier-Stokes equation, with the microscopic model, which is my kinetic model. Now the elastic tensor, T, is obtained by the so-called Cramer expression. As I told you, it's just the shifted conformation tensor, okay, and there is additional nonlinear function gamma z. Now, in this kinetic model, as you see it here, I can revise. It here, I can rewrite the first and the second term on the right-hand side in a more suitable way, where I am introducing the Maxivillian, that's the exponential minus r square over 2a. A is a suitable coefficient, k is the Boltzmann constant, and tau is the absolute temperature. So that's what appearing here. And then the capital gamma is just this constant here. Lambda is the Deborah number or Weisenberg number, which is giving me. Which is giving me the, okay, describing the elastic relaxation effect of my fluid. U0 and L0 where are the macroscopic characteristic lengths or the velocity. And then in front of this diffusion term with respect to x, I have the center of mass diffusion. And as you see, that's the number, which is just a fraction of the typical microscoping length and the typical macroscoping length squared. Microscopic length squared. So that's in reality a very small number, right? 10 to the power minus 9. But this term is still there, though it has small effects. Okay, so now I would like to analyze such a system, such a model, and I would like to show the existence of weak solution global data. Well, for that, I need some boundary condition. So because of this Laplace psi, I will La plus psi, I will get a zero-Neumann boundary condition on the physical domain, and then I will take, well, this typical decay boundary condition because I have infinitely extensible polymeric molecules. This is the strategy which I am using. First of all, I want to solve the Foker-Planck equation for given macroscopic velocity and given macroscopic conformation tensor. Well, this is quite technical, but it can be shown that such a But it can be shown that such a Fokker-Planck equation for given U and C has a global weak solution. And then we can do the rigorous macroscopic closure, obtain the macroscopic peterlin equation. We can study the existence and uniqueness of this macroscopic peterlin model, well, okay, Navier-Stokes solution and the conformation tensor. And finally, we can use this peterlin solution. Peterlin solution, macroscopic solution, esma U star and C star, and in this way we obtain the weak solution, weak global in-time solution of the Navier-Stokes-Foker-Planck system. This strategy was firstly proposed for the Hokkien model by Barrett and Sully, and we have generalized it for our Peter Linu model. So, here are the main steps. Okay, so that's my keynote. Okay, so that's my kinetic model. That's my Foucault-Planck equation. I just multiply the equation by the Maxwellian, and then I am looking for psi hat, which is given in this way, and I assume that U star and C star have suitable regularity. So in particular, U star is H three and C star H two. Okay, and that's just the weak formulation of my Fokker-Planck equation, which I have written down here in green. Written down here in green. And the test function is W11 in R and well, H1 in omega and Rd, so in the physical space and conformation space, but it's Maxwellian weighted. Fine, one can prove the existence of the weak solution. The main steps is, first of all, I do some semi-discretization in space. Space, so like elliptic approximation, sorry, implicit Euler, and then I make the cutoff of the psi which appearing in this friction term. And then I, okay, so that's my approximation, psi and L. L is the cutoff parameter. And then I need to prove that all moments are bounded for my approximate solution, and that I have a finite relative energy, like this is s log s minus one. So it is. S minus 1, so it is in L infinity L1 bounded, and that I have finite Fisher information, which is given by this last term on the slide. Well, this can be done. Now I have the approximate sequence and the problem is non-linear. So I need to pass to the limit because of my square cutting, right? I need to pass to the limit and for that I need a variance of Leon's orbin, which is so-called Dubinsky's. Orbing, which is so-called Dubinsky theorem, which is telling me that I have the compact embedding of such a set even if the set M okay, here was not a space, right? It is just a semi-norm subset. Okay, now that's my approximation. That's what I just told you. Here is the cutoff function. I have this information of finite relative energy and Fischer information. Relative energy and Fisher information. And here is written explicitly what is the suitable choice for A0. It is L1 as a Maxwellian weighted L1 space. Here is my set M, non-negative. Okay, this is bounded. So that's my semi-norm. And now A1 is just enough large space, right? I take the dual to HS and S is enough large. So that A0 is embedded in A. Embedded in a one. And then applying the Lubinsky theorem, I have the compact embedding, and that's important for my problem. So I will get that my sequence, right, I have this compact embedding, and I have that my approximate sequence strongly converges in L1 very well. And so that's the way how to get the convergence in beta L terms and other terms are easier. So I get the existence of the weak solution to my Solution to my Foucault-Planck equation, but U and C were given. Now, on the level of the weak formulation, I can prove just by multiplying taking the test function R times R and product with D, which is arbitrary test function for my conformation equation. I will get really the closure. I will get the rigorous microscopic closure. It's written here in the weak form. We don't need to. In the weak form, we don't need to read all details, but what we obtain is the equation I showed you at the beginning. That's the Peterlin equation for the conformation stress tensor. Very nice. Now, I have obtained now my macroscopic model. And the question is, can I prove that there exists a unique solution? And the answer is yes, we have studied this problem. So, in particular, I So in particular, I allow that the gamma one coefficient appearing here in this friction term and gamma two are polynomials and I control the growth. And then I can prove that, for example, in D equal to there exists global weak solution, velocity and conformation tensor, classical spaces, L infinity, L2, L2H1. But if I take more regular data, C3 bound, bound. 3 bound boundary C3 and initial data H3, then I will get exactly the regularity of my macroscopic velocity and macroscopic conformation tensor, which I need in order to start the whole arguments at the beginning. You remember U star, C star. That's exactly the regularity that I need. Okay, I have the other result for D equals 3, but let me come to the final step. So here what we have. So, here what we have is how to close that whole argument. So, let me stay with d equal to. Then I can prove that there exists a unique solution to my Narias-Dok Spaterlin system, and it has suitable regularity if the data are enough smooth. And then I start with this UPCP as my star macroscopic information and come into the Fokker-Planck equation. Now, I know that for Now I know that for given u C star, I have global weak solution psi star, very nice, and I can do rigorous macroscopic closure. So I've been doing that, and I obtain the conformation tensor, which comes from the macroscopic closure of the Fokker-Planck's equation. But the equation is the same, and the equation is uniquely solvable. So the C, which is which obtains as the macroscopic closure, has to be the same C. Has to be the same C which I have started this argument at equal C, so a unique solution of my betterlin-Navier-stock system. Okay, so that I obtain and so finally I have the global weak solution of the whole Navstock-Foker-Planck system, right? And the Fokker-Planck solution, this probability density distribution, satisfy the properties which I want to have. All moments are bounded, it's a probability distribution. The probability distribution, finite relative entropy, and finite Fisher information. Very nice. So, this was the idea how to prove for such a complex model, well, some part of the well possibility, so at least existence of global weak solution. Now, how to approximate such a model? And here is the idea. So, what I have here is the Foker-Planck equation, right? And in my Fokker-Planck equation, I have the operators which acts in the configuration space and the operators which act in the physical space. And so I do the splitting. I take just the operators which act in the physical space and there I apply Lagrange-Color King method. Well, it's a finite element method where I'm using upfinding. Where I'm using upfinding or characteristic information to approximate advective term. Well, and then the operators which act on R space, this is my configuration space, here I am using spectral method. And interestingly, we are using very similar method that we have seen in the previous talk of Francis. So I have kind of implicit-explicit splitting of my Fokker-Planck equation. So first of all, I fix point in the physical space and Point in the physical space and approximate with the spectral method this part of the operator. And having obtained side star, intermediate side star, I fix now a point in my configuration of space and go to solve in the physical space. Well, it is semi-implicit method, it's just the convection diffusion equation in the physical space. So my configuration space solver works in the following way. I have the Hermit polynomial. Way, I have the Hermite polynomial, but I'm taking a weighted Hermit polynomial, right? And this weighted Hermite polynomial, as we heard, they are orthogonal, but moreover, they have very nice property that they also vanish at infinity. And remember, I'm solving on the whole R2, right? That's my configurational space. So I need this kind of property. And my numerical solution for the Fokker-Planck equation, this psi, is written in the form of the spectral. Is written in the form of the spectral expansion. So these are my basis functions. And I just solve for the modes for these coefficients of the spectral expansion. Here we are doing the following trick. We kind of look only on the points R i R J which are the roots of the next Hermit polynomial. So it will be the Hermit polynomial n plus one, right? So the So the next Hermit polynomial is kind of not zero there, right? They are the roots of the next Hermit polynomial. So that's my expansion. And then I come with that expansion into my first equation, well, the first splitting equation, this equation, right, in the configuration space, and then just compute what comes out and obtain this final difference scheme. Now I have obtained. Now I have obtained a new coefficient phi star and come with this coefficient into the physical space and approximate it by the finite element method. So this is done then for each coefficient KL or index of this each coefficient. Okay, so that's the idea. Now I would like to show you that this really works. So first of all, simple experiment, I start Simple experiment. I start with Maxwellian and put some shear flow. So that's the gradient of U is given. And that's the initial data. And you see that as time evolves, the probability density really changes in the direction of the flow. And that's the solution of the coupled Navier-Stokes-Foka-Planck system. So here I have a well-known test benchmark flow plus cylinder. That's my cylinder. And I start. That's my cylinder. And I start with parabolic profile. And for the probability density, I am taking Maxwellian. And for example, this choice of my nonlinear function. And what you see here is the solution at some later time. The first row is the x component of velocity, y component of velocity. Then we see streamlines and the pressure. And since the model is viscoelastic, I also plotted the components of the conformation test. Components of the conformation tensor. So you have C11 component, C12 component, and C22 component. Well, and with that, I would stop and thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for this very interesting talk. Do we have any questions from the audience? Hello, Maya. This is Alina. Hi, hi, Alina. Hi. Hi, Alina. Hi. Nice to see you. Yeah. In the couple of slides before, so when you do this explicit, implicit splitting. So yeah. So here it's about this asymptotic preserve. You need to deal with different scales, right? And small parameters here. And so you do you, is it really you need to do here asymptotic preserving or it's just for the efficiency? No, we okay, that's a good question. No, we okay, that's a good question. I mean, we did not really consider here whether there is a problem with asymptotic preserving, but as you see here, as you see here, I have here only implicit approximation in one configuration space. So in fact, I do not get any kind of the restriction on delta t from the configuration space, and the only restriction comes in the well, delta t, which is dictated by the classic. Which is dictated by the classical CFL condition. So, in this sense, it is AP, but I have no proof I did not analyze that. Okay, okay, thank you. Thanks. Thank you very much. Do we have any other questions from the audience? I just have a quick question. I noticed that I think there's a uniqueness result that works for the case when the That works for the case when D is two. I just wonder, since it looks like numerically this algorithm can be easily extended to the three-dimensional case, for the sake of the uniqueness proof, are there any technical challenges or maybe I missed something? Okay, I can mention that that's a good question. So, I did not speak about this part because of time, but also for the Because of time, but also for d equals three, that's the result with Michael Ranardi. We have the existence of global weak solution, right? So that's the existence of weak solution I can prove. For the well, uniqueness or regularity, that's more or less the same question. I can show that there is the classical solution, which will be the unique solution, only for 2D, because of the Navier-Stokes part. You see, I mean, I'm speaking about this whole system. So, because of the Navier-Stokes, I can, well. other stocks I can well I cannot prove uniqueness of 3D solutions all right that's if I have but if I have the creeping flow it means I have just the well this this okay stokes flow if you wish so the advective term is not there then I can also prove uniqueness oh I see yes thank you yeah I should have seen this thank you very much for the explanation uh okay great so uh this will be our uh this is our So this is our last talk in the morning session. And after this, I think we have a group picture.
