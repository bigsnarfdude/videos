Selection of composite scale liquid crystal models. Obviously, in 40-45 minutes, I'm not going to cover even any respectable fraction of the liquid crystal field as a whole. These are biased toward topics that interest me and where I'll be able to do a little bit of shameless self-promotion. But emphasizing exploring the successes of these models and describing experiments, but also the assumptions, limits of applicability, and the challenges in practice of some of these common models. Challenges and practice of some of these common models and areas that I think are in prime need of further development. So, we're going to start out with pneumatics and polystaric equilibrium, active pneumatics next, and then symectics. So, if there's anyone in the room who their main thing is not liquid crystals, this might serve as a crash course in some of the common theories we're going to hear about a lot this week. But please do interrupt as we go along with questions. It doesn't matter how much of It doesn't matter how much of this I get through. This is mainly just to start the conversation we're going to be having for this workshop. All right. So, pneumatics, we all, I think, know and love them. We probably spend as much time looking at pneumatic screens as any human being nowadays. And, right, it's a first-order phase transition from the isotropic phase to the pneumatic phase. And, of course, disclinations, topological defects in the pneumatic. Topological defects in the pneumatic phase abound. This is, and I hope this is something they can post online because I just took this from the YouTube channel of someone named Alex Bavrovsky, who is a liquid crystals scientist and techno music drummer. And both things are on his channel sometimes combined. But here's a pneumatic to isotropic phase transition. Explain. There we go. All right. So you see some disclination. Alright, so you see some disclations, then you have these regions of pneumatic are shrinking with isotropics surrounding them. So the fact that there's such sharp phase boundaries is a signature of the first order discontinuous nature of the phase transition, which is something that will pop up a few times in this talk. So the OCE-Frank model is maybe the first version of elasticity. We start with Version of elasticity: we start with learning about liquid crystals. You have your splay, your twist, and your bend distortions, each panelized with the elastic constant K1, K2, K3. This model, of course, assumes that you are deep in the pneumatic phase, not near the phase transition necessarily, and that everywhere you're modeling has a well-defined director, so that any defects where the director is ill-defined have to be excised from your domain. Your domain. And so when you have topological defects and you don't know exactly where they are or how they're oriented, you have to minimize over those degrees of freedom separately. And so, right, very commonly, for theoretical convenience, we make the one constant approximation that all of these elastic constants, all of these three elastic constants, are equal, in which case the Frank-Ossing free energy reduces. Frank-Ossing free energy reduces to the volume integral of the integral of gran n squared, or here in this index notation, which is wonderful because the Euler-Lagrange equation reduces to Laplace's equation for each of the components of the directive, which is lovely. Okay. And furthermore, the interactions between point disclinations in 2D reduce to those of electrostatic charges. Electrostatic charges on the plane. So there's a logarithmic effective potential, logarithmic in the distance between the two disclinations, and then multiplied by their quote-unquote topological charges taking the place of the electric charges. But here, these are the winding numbers of these topological defects, most often plus half or minus half. So this is a very, of course, classic result. But one thing that One thing that has come up relatively recently in the literature, in the past decade, is that that classic result assumes the orientations of your defects are already in energy minimized form. So they've already rotated around relative to each other in the way that minimizes the energy for their respective positions. Which, in different scenarios, if you have, say, a slow-moving couple. If you have, say, a slow-moving colloidal particle functioning as a source of a defect, might be a good approximation. But if it's just a point defect in the liquid crystal, the relaxational time for its orientation might not be a lot faster than that for its position. And so there's been interesting work showing, for example, with two plus-half disclinations, there's an extra term in the potential proportional to the heat work that involves a dot product of the orientation. The dot product of the orientation vectors you can assign to the two Poissat explanations, which tends to bring them into anti-parallel alignment. So rather than thinking of these as scalar charges like an electrostatic, we start to think of them as vector charges, which want to align or anti-align. And then there's some subtlety with the minus half disponation, because that actually has a threefold symmetry, and so there's some third-rank tensor you have to worry about there. But interesting subtleties, and then when you get to Subtleties, and then when you get to three dimensions, it's much even more complicated but interesting. And that's all in the one constant approximation. So how good is that approximation? So it's, I mean, it's for 5 CB, which is one of the most common liquid crystals, it's good within, say, a factor of two, right? So already we're not even expecting it to quantitatively match most common crystals. Quantitatively match most common liquid crystals. The most general scenario is that the twist constant is the lowest of the three and the bend constant is the highest. And you can see that's the case for 5Cb, which is a thermotropic liquid crystal. For lyotropic, long column liquid crystals or stacked molecules like in chromotic liquid crystals, that is even more dramatically true. You can see an order of magnitude separation. You can see an order of magnitude separation between the twist elastic constant and the bend elastic constant. And so this low K2 has interesting consequences, including a spontaneous breaking of neurosymmetry. So there are things like cholesterol that will always be right-handed or always left-handed. But there are also achiral liquid crystals that don't have a preference for either-handedness, but in any configuration, they will. In any configuration, they will be twisted with one or the other because the twist distortion is the least costly of the three kinds of distortions. And so in a capillary, for example, you can have these double helical disclinations, which are actually of twist disclination kind. And I'll get into this more later, but there is a left-handed twist of the director field on the inside, and in this example, right-handed on the outside. On the outside. And that sets the handedness of how the lines, contours themselves, wind around each other. And that's a spontaneously broken mirror symmetry, so you see the opposite half the time. Okay. So back to Francocine with the three different elastic constants now. If we have a cholesteric or chiral pneumatic liquid crystal that does have its own preferred handiness, that gets encoded in this. Gets encoded in this pseudoscalar Q-naught in the twist part of the free energy density. And so I'll talk about Landau de Gen for a big section of the talk after this. But compared to that model, using the director-based model with the Q0 here can be really advantageous if you don't have singularities in the director, because you can generally model large. You can generally model larger systems with many more turns of the cholesterol helix with this free energy formulation. And one of the prominent examples of this in recent literature to me is work from the Small Yo group modeling their torons, hoppions, solitons, et cetera, in confined chiral pneumatics, where they can really nicely capture many turns of the director field. Turns of the director field. And so, in terms of the language of cholesteric defects, there are so-called lambda disclinations, lambda defects, which are not actually defects in the director field, but they are defects in this pitch axis. So these stripes are showing you each turn of the director as it goes helically along. So over on the right, there's maybe something like a ground state. Over on the left, there's something like a ground state. Over on the left, there's something like a ground state, but with an orthogonal orientation. And where they meet, you can see the pitch axis undergoes a 180-degree rotation in the manner of a Plus hat defect, even though the director is nowhere singular in this picture. So this is called a lambda defect, and because the director is well defined everywhere, francosine can be very useful. But the other kinds of defects, the tau and the chi defects in the cholosterics, those have singularities. Those have singularities in the pneumatic directory. And so that's where you really want land values in, which allows to see the local melting. All right, saddle's play is there, even though it is often ignored. It is often ignored with good reason because it is a total divergence term. It's there in this same expansion to quadratic. To quadratic order and first derivatives of the director, but it reduces to this boundary term. And so, if you have Dirichlet boundary conditions, such as strong homeotropic anchoring, and you know where all your defects are, then the boundary director can't change, and so this component of the free energy is constant. But there are many scenarios, either because the anchoring is finite, or because the anchoring is an anchor The anchoring is finite, or because you have a degenerate planar anchoring. So, even if it's infinitely strong, you have a degree of freedom in the battery where you do have to worry about this term, and it can have very interesting effects. For example, in a toroidal geometry, the saddle splay term can screen the cost of twist in an A-chiral system, so with Q0. So, it again gives us a spontaneous chirality, a spontaneous breaking of mirror symmetry with left- and right-handed twist. Okay, so with all of that going on just in Frank Ocene, where do we need the Q tensor? People who recognize this picture, it tends to be an age-dependent distribution in my experience. But this is the character Q from Star Trek the Next Generation. This is the character Q from Star Trek Next Generation, played by John Delancey. So, problem. When you have a disclination, the director is ill-defined, and the order goes to zero as we get into the defect core. And if it's a half-integer disclination, then we have this artificial branch cut in the vector representation of the director. It might not be here, depending how we parametrize it, but it's somewhere. And so, if you're naively counting up the If you're naively counting up the gradients of n without taking that into account, you're going to get an artificial infinity. So we can introduce a second reg tensor, q, which in three dimensions looks like this. n is the director. m and l are two orthogonal orientations. And I'm not going to say anything else about biaxiality in this talk, so don't, you can, we can ignore that term. And 2D, it has this simple representation. So it's traceless, it's symmetric. Symmetric, it's invariant if we take n to minus n, so it encodes that symmetry from the beginning, and it goes to zero in magnitude when this degree of order s goes to zero. And we can recover the director as the eigenvector of q with the eigenvalue, that is s. Very handy. All right, so remembering that this is a first-order or discontinuous transition from the isotropic phase. Continuous transition from the isotropic phase to kinetic phase, we would like some kind of mean field theory where each rod interacting with the average orientations of all the other rods will give us as a function of temperature a first order transition from disorder to order. And the Meyer-South theory is the most prominent example of this, where we take a mean field average Q as an average An average with this making it traceless here, traceless and symmetric, over orientations p with some probability with some distribution rho of p over those orientations on the units of rho. Okay, and then there's some potential where we try to align that q with the sort of local q of this test rod. And there is some coefficient negative. And there is some coefficient negative A. We demand in thermal equilibrium that, of course, we have a Boltzmann distribution of that potential for our distribution of orientations. And then Z is the partition function. So our enthalpy nicely reduces to just minus one-half A, the trace of Q squared, which is a term that will pop up again in Vengabi's N as the first of the bulk terms. The entropy is this. The entropy is this rho log rho integrated over the unit circle, unit sphere, with a Boltzmann constant. And we minimize the free energy, enthalpy minus T times entropy. S here is not the degree of order, it's the entropy. And this predicts a first order transition, whereas the temperature is rising, the degree of order goes down, but then suddenly drops to zero. But then suddenly drops to zero at the isotopic things. So, this idea is going to come back in a few slides as a possible correction to Landau-Degen. But first, Landau-Degen, the model with one elastic constant to start with. So, Landau-DeGen takes that first term similar to the Meyer-Stopping theory. The A is negative here. The A is negative here, and then we have, in general, a cubic term in three dimensions, and this fourth-order term has to be positive. So, excuse me, what that does is penalize places where the pneumatic order is melting into isotropic, because the energy of the pneumatic phase is lower than that of the isotropic phase. And so, wherever a defect forces us to melt to isotropic, that costs some energy per unit volume. Unit volume. And then the elastic part of the energy, F sub E, oh, and right, in the uniaxial approximation, where Q is proportional to the degree of order, this bulk part of the energy reduces to this polynomial in X, which is what's being plotted here. The elastic part of the energy with this one elastic constant approximation is the same as the one elastic constant approximation for Frank Ossi. And so it again penetrates. And so it again penalizes splayed magnetoids equally. And where the gradients of Q have a magnitude greater than something, a scale set by a square root of elastic constant L1 over bulk coefficient A, that's where your pneumatic distortions have become more costly than the energy of just giving up on pneumatic order, melting into the isotropic phase. So the core of the defect is isotropic. That is isotropic. Alright, so strictly speaking, this model is constructed as a model of the isotropic pneumatic phase transition. I don't know that there's a really formal expectation, maybe mathematicians have a great incorrectly, that it is a correct theory deep in the pneumatic phase, but it does reduce to Osine Frank if the bulk part of the energy is. Bulk part of the energy is at its minimum. That is, if we're well aligned, we just have gentle disclosures in the director. And it captures very nicely defects in the pneumatic phase as a localized melting. So here's an animation from a Landau's energy minimization with a Saturn ring disclination appearing around a particle, colloidal particle, with homeotropic anchoring. And with two particles, you can get fun things like the entanglement with a single disclination one. So this has been very. So, this has been very useful over the years for modeling defects around colloid particles. Okay, but again, that was an approximation to have one elastic constant. If we take all the elastic terms at that lowest order, then you might think we would get splay, twist, and bend again like we do with Frank Osine, but we don't. The bend and the splay constants are equal at Are equal at this lowest order expansion in the land outage and elastic energy. Now we could, and on the next few slides we are going to, add higher order terms that allow us to set K1 and K3 apart, but the lowest order theory says they're the same. And so this would suggest that even if we have the higher order terms, as we approach the phase transition to isotropic, where the magnitude of Q decreases, the lowest order terms are going to. Time. The lowest order terms are going to matter more. We ought to expect K3 to approach K1 at the IN phase condition. And that, as far as I've seen in the literature, is generally true. They don't exactly match, but whatever difference K1 and K3 have seems to decrease as you get closer to the isotropic phase. All right. Saddle display in the Landau design picture. Saddle splay in the Landau-Desen picture, right? So, this elastic energy I wrote in the last slide had three terms. So, how is it that we can't tell splay, bend, and twist apart? It's because one of the three is actually setting K2, 4, the saddle split. And you can see that explicitly by just rearranging that elastic energy so that one of the terms is again a total derivative, which means it reduces to a boundary term. And so then the L2 prime, this new second term, Prime, this new second term is the difference of splay orb and twist elastic constants. The last term is proportional to the difference of the saddle splay and twist elastic constants. One thing that this way of looking at saddle splay has been useful for is actually as a diagnostic of disclinations in computed or measured director fields, where we can tell that the degree of order. Tell that the degree of order has gone to zero on these green lines. Here, the gray is some perforated surface, modeling something that Lisa Tran made in the lab. And these, but some of them are plus half disclations, some of them are minus half disclinations. And the saddle splay will tell you which is which. Saddle splay is positive at the negative disclinations, negative at the positive disclinations. So for these so-called wedge disclosures, So, for these so-called resplanations of plus or minus half in 3D, it's a useful diagnosis. All right. We can also put Q0, the chirality, the preferred chirality, into Land Galen by sticking it into this L1 term, which is proportional to K2, the twist elastic constant, and fun things there, like what Max Orentovich has done. What Max Arentovich has done with modeling cholesteric droplets, which form these focalconic domains under certain boundary conditions. What's a focalconic domain? So it's an arrangement of layers that looks more or less like this. There's some cusp in the middle, and the layers are sort of turning through an elliptical or circular boundary at the bottom. And you can see that motif appearing multiple times around the boundary of this frustrated cholesterol. Of this frustrated cholesteric system. So, this in layered systems, whether cholesteric or smectic, is a very generic feature of frustration or response to frustration from the boundary conditions. And that will come up later when I talk about smectics. Okay. So, if we do need to get the splay and twist constants unequal, what can we do? What can we do? Well, we need to go to higher order, and there are multiple terms you could add that could do this. A common one to add is this particular combination of Q and its first derivatives, which then gives us an L4 proportional to K3 minus K1. So this has always struck me as a little bit strange that we need to do this. I don't know what fundamentally it. What fundamentally it tells us about the isotropic pneumatic transition, etc. But it is true that you need to do something like this. And this ends up introducing problems, which the applied mathematicians have informed us in the physics world about, which I didn't learn until recently. I'll get back to that soon. With Landau de Gen, there's a size challenge. So I mentioned before the Franco scene is better for large. The Francocene is better for larger systems. With Landau desien, we need to be able to resolve the length scale of the defect core in order to see defects, obviously. And that's set by the square root of the elastic constant K or L over the bulk coefficient A. But in the experiments we're trying to model, typically the system size is 1,000 or 100,000 times greater than the defense core size. And so if we're trying to model a cubic volume with that many sites in each With that many sites in each direction, this starts to get very computationally expensive. And so almost all uses of land outage and computational modeling compared to experiments are actually modeling at a smaller size scale, which makes quantitative matching very difficult, and we just have to take this into account. One very common consequence is that the simulations will see the Saturn ring around a homeotropic anchoring. A homeotropic aqueous particle, that is this blue loop, where the experiments more often see the hyperbolic hedgehog or dipolar configuration, which is the point defect above the North Pole of the particle. So Yimin Luo captured this lovely video of a Saturn ring transforming into a hedgehog as this colloidal particle approaches a dip, a valley in a wavy wall. A valley in a wavy wall. This is a 4.5 micron particle, so you're seeing a little hula hoop go up and collapse into a point at the top eventually. And modeling this numerically, there goes a challenge because, of course, the simulation will prefer to see the hyperbolic, excuse me, preferred to see the scatter ring, it will disfavor the hyperbolic hedgehog. So, what's happening? So, what's happening in the experiment is as the particle gets closer to the wavy view wall, the energy barrier between its metastable state and the Saturn ring and the stable state of the hedgehog gets lower and lower until eventually it can scoot over into this preferred configuration. But in the simulation, the Saturn ring is always stable, right? So, if we take the energy difference of those two states, it's always positive. And I think I reversed these labels. It should be Saturn. I think I reversed these labels. It should be Saturn rings stable up top, hedgehog stable on the bottom. And so, one possible way around this is to do some theoretically informed fitting of these curves as we increase the particle size in the simulations to the extent we can, up to like 200 and some nanometers, and extrapolate then out to the size scale of the experiment, where clearly, based on these trends, you would expect that 4.5 microns. That 4.5 microns got the H12 ought to be the stable state. Another way to address the size scale problem is to throw more computational resources at the problem. And to aid in doing this, I would like to advertise a software project that Daniel Sussman and I have created called OpenCumin. And this is Landau design. And this is Landau-DeGen modeling with user-defined boundary conditions, where, thanks to the computer science skills and wizardry of Dan GoSussman, who's here, there's not only GPU acceleration, but automatic MPI parallelization, meaning the size that you can simulate is just limited by how many cores of CPU you have accessed. And we've tried to make it accessible from Python and command line, et cetera. So I encourage you to check that out. Other problems with Lambda design? Well, let me pause here. Are there any questions so far? Since this is a quote-unquote tutorial. Yes. In re in real things. The ratio K3 to K1, what what is an extreme range of a realistic material? So I think there are maybe people in the room who know even more extreme examples, but in these chromatics, if you look here, okay, so you get like more than a factor of two sometimes. Sometimes. And I think it can be even greater than that if anyone knows offhand for these myotropic chromatic liquid crystals. K3 over K1. I don't know I've ever seen a case of order 10, but certainly order 2 to 4 is. Yeah, I'll follow on this question. Uh Keith, when you talk about robotics, are the kinds of um obstacles that you have to start up? But that this does not include DNA quantum sense, right? Because in DNA quantum sense, it really goes the other way. That K1 is greater than K3? K1 is very big. Okay. And usually K3 is the smallest. Right, okay. K1 grows if you have long chains because you can't have display and you probably do. Thank you. And so I guess there, we could also ask, do you get order of magnitude separation between those eventually as you make the pile move very well? Okay. So yeah, all the more reason then to have a stable method to capture K3 different than K1. This should say L4. But that higher order elastic constant, it was shown by Bal and Majumdar that it makes the free energy unbounded below. There are problems, at least formally, with the boundedness. Normally, with the boundedness of this free energy, if we add that higher-order term, which is bad. And they trace this back to this physical problem, which should bother the physicists also, that there's nothing about this bulk free energy density expansion that limits the eigenvalues of Q to the physical limits on the degree of order S, which, based on half of Q is constructed, have to be between negative one-third and positive two-thirds. Negative one-third and positive two-thirds. So we have this tension between, okay, we like to do, in the style of Landau, a Taylor expansion in rotational invariance of Q. So we don't want a singular potential. And yet, we need a potential that becomes singular at negative one-third and two-thirds in order to prevent these unphysical scenarios from occurring. And so these two. These two facts are related when the added higher-order term to distinguish splay from bend makes the system unbounded, the free energy unbounded below. It's to do with an explosion in one of these eigenvalues beyond its physical limits. Now, in practice, for reasons I don't have a great grasp on, K3O. Aspone. K3 over K1, up to about 8 works in Landavi's End numerical modeling that I've seen, which is pretty good. So I don't understand fully whether the stability problems here make these results less trustworthy, or whether we are just lucky that the numerical implementation remains stable under these conditions. Something went thundering. But to fix this up, Balaam Jumdar proposed taking the replacing the bulk-free energy density with the Meyer-Salpe version, where you have the temperature times the entropy minus this term, which is the enthalpy. And here, S is already minimized over, you find. Minimized over, you find the row, the distribution of rods, that minimizes the entropy subject to matching the Q of interest. Okay, so there's some hierarchical minimization going on because before even minimizing the free energy, you have to define it, the free energy, using a minimization over this rho function. So that's what's expressed here. It's a condition for rho. But what you get out of this is that the entropy and thus the potential explodes as it should when any eigenvalue approaches the lower upper. And so that ensures that the land average-free energy is bounded below. And there's nice work of Schimming and Vignals. Shout out to Cody Schimming in Denver Airport, who explained. Explain the anisotropy of disclination cores in chromatic lyotropics using something very close to this method, matching things observed by the Leventovich group at Kenstein. Downside, of course, is you need to do this whole other expensive calculation of the potential psi B. So this is a less sort of scalable operation. Something we're going to hear about a bit this week is external field response, which traditionally, because of the symmetry of the pneumatic, we have thought about as a quadratic response to fields. The electric-magnetic field being a vector can only couple to the Q-tensor quadratically. But this picture has changed in the world of ferroelectric pneumatics, which are this newly designed. Which are this newly discovered class of materials that have a linear response to an applied field, and often a much stronger response, very fast relaxation times, because the director is coupled to and strongly aligned with an internal polarization field, P, which is a vector. And so that can couple vectorially, and then N is rotated along with P. And so here's an example of a Of a pneumatic to ferroelectric transition, where you have these domains of up and down polarization, which is a spontaneously broken Ising-type symmetry as the system relaxes. And then the external field was reversed at that moment, I think. So, one interesting thing this does is This does is expel splay. These systems really can't splay except at defects because that introduces a space charge in the electrostatic sense, which has much larger energy costs than anything with liquid crystal elasticity. Some very interesting consequences. All right. For active pneumatics, if you haven't seen these videos, these are systems that are. These are systems that are locally pneumatically ordered, but in their steady state, which is not an equilibrium state, it's constantly consuming energy and producing motion, they have this continual pair production and pair annihilation of plus and minus half disclinations. So here the plus disclinations are the white circles, the minus disclinations are the yellow triangles, and these bend walls sharpen until you get disclination pair unbinding. You get disclination pair unbinding, and then eventually you'll get pair annihilation where the plus half meets a different minus half and they disappear. And there's a length between defects set by the balance of elasticity and activity, where this active forcing takes a divergence of Q, multiplies it by this zeta coefficient, the active force. And so, in terms of our friend's splay. And so, in terms of our friends splay and bend, this active force is, in the case of extensile active hematic, so zeta positive, is favoring bend while disfavoring spray, which is responsible for the emergent dynamics we saw before. Now, why should that be the case microscopically is because these microtubules are being pushed around by kinesion motors, but in such a way that when these microtubules are That when these microsubial bundles meet in anti-parallel orientations, they slide apart. So, the microscopic dynamics is this extensile dynamics, extensile force dipoles. And when they're dense enough to make a director field, you get this coupling of the active force to the penguin square. Oh, and that causes the aligned state to be unstable to bend distortions because if you have. Distortions because if you have a little bit of bent distortion, you get an imbalance of forces which reorients your rods in the flow to be more bent, and it's a positive feed. Here was my attempt to color code the Barris-Edwards model to make it understandable. I'm not sure if it helps, but let's take a look. All right, so we've got our friend the Q-tensor, we have a velocity field. Tensor, we have a velocity field. We're going to assume the density is constant. This is a common assumption, although we can debate its value for any model in the experiments. The velocity field updates according to Navier-Stokes, incompressible Navier-Stokes, as zero divergence, and a lot is hidden here in the stress tensor pi. The Q tensor does gradient descent where H is the gradient in the land outage and free energy. Land out of n free energy, but also gets a vector with the velocity field and co-rotates with gradients in the velocity field. So there is a flow alignment parameter, lambda, telling us how strongly it responds, Q tends to respond to strain in the velocity field. There's also coupling to vorticity, which is the anti-symmetric part of the gradient of the velocity field. And then the stress tensor. And then the stress tensor over here has an elastic part, a viscous part, which is just proportional to the strain rate, and the active part I mentioned earlier, which is just proportional to Q. So the elastic part has all these different components. It's got the pressure, I put that in here, as well as the flow alignment part, this other coupling to the molecular field, and the Ericsson stress, proportional to the gradients. Okay. So, when you put that all together and you integrate it, you get things that look wonderfully similar to the dynamics we saw earlier, where the aligned state is unstable to bend distortions, and then you get this active steady state of plus half and minus half defects, binding and unbinding. Here, the plus defects are in red, the minus defects are in blue, and they're continually. And they're continually pair annihilating and pair creating. All right. So what's potentially missing from this? Well, if you go back to the experimental videos of the microtubules, you can see the density is clearly not constant. And in fact, it's most not constant at the places of defects and bend walls, which are the objects of greatest interest. How important that is for large-scale dynamics is not so. For large-scale dynamics, it is not so clear, but these microtubules are extended objects that fracture rather than very small molecules compared to the length scale of distortions, as we usually assume in modern minimum fluid. One thing that's always puzzled me is that this defect pair unbinding, which is this very straightforward balance of elasticity and activity, requires some notion of fluctuations to escape over a pair, which is. A barrier, which is this length scale setting the energy maximum for the interaction of a plus half and a minus half B half. And it just doesn't look to me like thermal fluctuations are what is triggering these. It looks very sort of deterministic given the local dynamics. And there's a possibility also of polarity sorting, oops, with this variable like. This variable activity zeta, where the microtubules of different orientations end up on opposite sides. And this could explain observations of apparently time-varying activity in these active pneumatics, where it is time-varying because at different times the system is more or less sorted and can't generate more active forces. But this is also not in the Bayer-Assembled model, as usually described. As usually described. Okay, so in view of the time, I'm going to skip the whole section on smectics and close with a few words about pneumatic order and active systems of self-propelled polar objects. So clearly, the microtubule system was apolar microscopically because all the force generation is between pairs of microtubule bundles equally in both directions. Equally in both directions. But when we make the rod self-propelled, there's this whole world of literature of emergent mimetic order. You can see bi-directional traffic here in this active system of polar agents. So we know from Ansager that the higher aspect ratio and higher attacking fraction favor pneumatic order. If you make the particles flexible, that disfavors pneumatic order. If you make the particles self-propelled, If you make the particles self-propelled, it favors pneumatic order. And if you make the particles, the self-propelled particles flexible, you can get pneumatic, you can get polar order, you can get a bunch of things. And to close, I just want to tease a recent set of results that we've been involved in where liquid crystal order that rotates over time with a fixed-handedness. Fixed-handedness, you can get to emerge in simulations of self-propelled filaments by having their self-propulsion be a little bit off-tangent, just a little bit rotated relative to their contour direction. So, the heart-kinnens matter people have something called the time crystal, which is non-equilibrium, but it's periodic in time as well as in space. So, I think that this is a time cholesteric because if we view the time direction as the z-axis, it Direction as the z-axis, it looks like a choloscatic ground scale. All right, so let me just jump down to the concluding slides. And thanks very much. Thank you very much. That was an excellent survey. Not only a survey, but a lot of new materials. And I hope that maybe we have time for some discussion. I hope that maybe we have time for some discussion. You can some separate time that you can kind of go through the end, right? And perhaps it would be better if we go on with our gears and then we can ask questions later, right? Because we are all here. Thank you. Thank you very much.
