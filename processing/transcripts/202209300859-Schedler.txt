Person. I kind of was looking forward to that, but well, you know, it turned out to be quite difficult to come. And you're very kind to have this arrangement here. So I will speak to you. And by the way, I've been enjoying your talks. I haven't made it to all of them, but I have the videos. So I've been going over the videos, and that's really great. So anyway, I'm going to speak today about birational geometry of quiver varieties. By rational geometry of quiver varieties and related moduli. And this is joint work with Gwynne Bellamy and Alastair Craw. And I will say a little bit about some joint work with Dan Kaplan. Okay, so the background here is, and this is all in progress, but hopefully we're coming to a conclusion soon. So there we go. So the background is we have a quiver. We have a quiver, so mostly we'll talk about that with some vertices and arrows. And we'll have a quiver algebra, so we have some relations here, J and then we'll have a dimension vector. So we'll look at some representation of that dimension. So we'll have a sum of Vi's where each vector space Vi has dimension alpha i. And then we'll have a stability condition. So I'll say more about that right now. More about that right now. So let me scroll down. Okay, so if we have representations of an algebra with a given dimension vector, then we can view that as, well, we can view that as some way of assigning matrices to the elements of A compatibly with the quiver. So in other words, for each arrow that goes from I to J, we want Goes from i to j, we want the elements that go between i and j to be a linear map from vi to vj. Okay, so we'll assign, so this is going to be some quiver algebra presented by some arrows. The number of arrows we have from i to j is the number of matrices we need from vi to vj. And of course, they have to satisfy the relations j, right? So these linear maps, so each arrow satisfying the relations. Okay, so now and then. Okay, so now in this situation, King gave a definition of stability, which comes from Mumford's GIT in this case. And we say that a representation is semi-stable if for every sub-representation, the slope is no larger. So it's less than or equal. And we say it's stable if it's actually less than, strictly less than. So I think this, I might have erased this, but this. But the semi-stable, so this the stable would be, yeah, the stable would be less than like that. So stable means, so semi-stable means it's less than or equal, and stable means less than, like that. Right, so good. And that's semi-stability. And the slope, it's just, well, it's a slope. It's a slope which depends on this parameter theta, the stability condition. So it's just sort of a weighted sum of dimensions divided by the overall dimension. Okay, so that's the way that goes. And I also want to point out that in King's paper, he usually restricts the case when the stability condition dotted with alpha is zero. So then the slope of V itself is zero. And this doesn't change anything. And this doesn't change anything whether you restrict to that or not. It's just it's more convenient to restrict to that. But from my talk, I thought it might be more convenient not to have to say that all the time. Okay, so let's denote by this theta SS and theta S, the semi-stable and stable loci. Okay. So now we can define our moduli space as, well, basically you take the moduli space. The moduli space of representations which are theta semi-stable here. Oops. You take the moduli space of representations which are theta semi-stable. You take the theta semi-stable locus and you take the quotients by the group of base change, general linear group of GLV. And this is equal to, by definition, the product of the general linear groups at each vertex, the changing basis at each vertex. Basis at each vertex. Okay, so then that gives you a kind of a moduli space. It's like a coarse moduli space a priori of representations, but in some cases, you'll actually get a fine moduli space. Okay, so now let's let q bar be the double quiver. So for every arrow, we add a reverse arrow, okay? Right. Now, in this situation, Now, in this situation, there's a very nice algebra, like a lot, called the preprojective algebra, which is this, where the relation is just the sum of commutators of an arrow with a reverse arrow. So this is called the pre-projective algebra. A very popular guy. And then in this case, the moduli space is actually a Nakajima quiverver. Is actually a Nakajima quiver variety. This is more or less a definition of Nakajima's quiver varieties as these moduli spaces where you can have a stability condition. Okay, so one of the motivating examples and for Nakajima was the case of the framed Jordan quiver. So we're gonna, the framing means that we have some vertex, or could be more than one, this case, one vertex which is distinguished and we're gonna think of it as framing. So we're not going. And we're going to think of it as framing. So, we're not going to consider the general linear group acting there. We're not going to change basis at the frame vertex. So, we can take the framed quiver, Jordan quiver. And now in this case, if we look at the representations of this, then, well, here we're going to take, so if we take representations of this, we're going to get the commuting variety. We're going to get the commuting variety. This would be if we didn't use the framed vertex. Sorry. So this is the commuting variety is going to be a commuting variety plus going to be a variety of d is plus framings. So if we considered the unframed Jordan quiver, we would get the commuting variety. Okay. So. So this is commuting variety plus framing. Right. And so now if we take the moduli space here with no stability condition, we just get the same thing as if we didn't have a framing. We get just the eigenvalues of these matrices. The C2N mod S, and this is just the unordered pairs, the unordered N tuples of eigenvalues of the A and B. So it's the unordered. The unordered eigenvalues of A and B. So if two matrices commute with each other, then you can put them in some simultaneous upper triangular form and look at their pairs of eigenvalues. Because we just get this unordered n tuples of pairs of numbers. And then if we now take theta varying. Theta varying not zero, we get a crepent resolution of this, which is the Hilbert scheme. So, this is the, let's make that yellow. This is the celebrated Hilbert Chow resolution. This is what Nakajima discovered, that by varying the stability, we can get that. And so, this is really just varying theta going from m theta to m zero in this case. So, here there's one, and I guess I should have said this before. So here this one and I guess I should have said this before this one means that we're going to put a dimension one at the frame vertex and an n at the unframe vertex. So we're going to put dimension one and n like that. So that's why we have n by n matrices, these pairs of n by n matrices from the loop. And then we have our framing, which is just giving us a vector. It's going to be a cyclic vector. And that's why we get this. Get this in the case of non-trivial stability, it'll give us a cyclic vector, which is why instead of just getting the symmetric power, we get this Hilbert scheme because a cyclic vector gives you a way of realizing, so it gives you an ideal of codimension n and the polynomial algebra and two variables, or a module over the polynomial algebra, so A and B acting. Polynomial algebra, so A and B acting on a dimension n space with a cyclic vector meaning the one element. So that's a quotient of the polynomial algebra by some ideal. So that's why we get the Hilbert scheme. So the Hilbert scheme parameterizes these ideals of codimension n, or if you can think of it as length and subschemes of C2. Just very quickly, if you use a framing which is bigger than one, then you get these again, Nakajima. Get these again, Nakajima pointed out. You get these moduli of torsion-free sheaves on P2 framed at infinity, but now of rank R instead of rank one, and with Chern class N. Okay, so I won't say anything more about that. That's just a motivation here. Okay, so these are just the things again. Again, if you're familiar with this, and this is boring probably, and if you're not familiar with it, it's a little bit fast, but just the main point is that if you've seen this pre-projective algebra. In this pre-projective algebra, if it looks like a nice algebra here, then by looking at moduli representations of it, you can get these interesting spaces, these symmetric powers of C2 and their resolutions. So that's the thing to take away from here. So generalization, we can replace C2 by C2 mod. Yeah, maybe before I do that, I can ask if there's any questions at this point. So this is. So this is nothing I'm saying here is anything new to what I, to me, very far from that. This is just motivation. Are there any questions about it? Okay, so we can replace C2 with C2 mod gamma, where gamma is a finite subgroup of SL2C. And then we replace this Jordan quiver by the Mackay quiver of that group. This is an extended Dinkin quiver. So for example, An extended Dinkin quiver. So, for example, we can have these quiver like that, which is the AN type, or the E6 type, E7 type, etc. And they all correspond to some groups. Probably many of you or all of you have heard of this correspondence before, but the point is that to get this quiver, to get this graph, the vertices are the irreps of gamma, and then the adjacency is when the W is a sub-representation. The W is a sub-representation of V tensored with C2. This is a construction you can do for any group, any representation. You replace C2 by your representation. You get this nice graph. And what's the point of this graph here? Well, one of the points of this graph here is something which was observed by Crowley-Bovie and Holland, and that is that you get a Merida equivalence between this pre-projective algebra. Projective algebra and the Smash product algebra, C X Y Smash product with gamma. And this is something which is a little bit more general. You could take sort of any algebra smash product with gamma and then write down a Merida equivalent algebra using the Mackay equiver, where the representation you use is the generating vector space for the algebra, in this case, two-dimensional. But in this case, Two-dimensional, but in this case, it's really nice. You get this prepredictive algebra, and as a result, the C2 mod gamma, which a priori is a coarse moduli space of modules over the smash product algebra, is also one for this pre-projective algebra. And so we can realize it as a quiver variety. So it's a quiver variety for the dimension vector being what's called the imaginary root. And imaginary root, it's this thing, so that's the number you have. So that's the number you have at each vertex is equal to one-half the sum of all of the adjacent numbers. So here we have an example of that. We've multiplied by n, so we have n and 2n in each vertex, and we've added a framing. So to get the C2 mod gamma itself, you set n equal to 1, and you look at the quiver variety. But if you set n not equal to 1, then you get the symmetric power of C2 mod gamma. And so by using Mod gamma. And so by using this dimension vector with the n's and the ones, we can get all kinds of interesting guys. We can get the symmetric power of C2 mod gamma. That's for trivial stability. Stability is zero, zero stability. By varying stability a little bit, you can get symmetric power of a resolution of this surface. So every surface like C2 mod gamma has a unique minimal resolution, which is also a crepant resolution, meaning it preserves canonical class or even a symplectic resolution. canonical class or even a symplectic resolution, it preserves a generic symplectic structure. So we can replace the C2 mod gamma by its resolution, but this is still singular because it's a symmetric power. So we can vary stability more. We have a generic stability. We can get a Hilbert scheme of this S. This was observed by Kuznetsov in 2007 that you can get that for some theta. Or using Nakajima's stability, this is more commonly used. More common to use, you can get this, what's called a cyclotomic, I think, Hilbert scheme or this N-gamma version. So we're looking at moduli of what are called gamma constellations and C2. So these are going to be the locus of, so we're going to look inside of the Hilbert scheme, not n, but n times the size of gamma. We're going to look at subschemes which are isomorphic to n copies. To n copies of this regular representation here, n copies of this regular representation as a gamma representation. So this would mean that for generically we're having n orbits. Sorry, my phone is something I forgot to turn off. So generically, if we have n free orbits, that would mean we would just be picking n points of C2 mod gamma because a free orbit. C2 mod gamma, because a free orbit of C2 is just a point of C2 mod gamma, which is not the singular point. So we'd be picking n of those, but we could also allow to have the singular point. And then we look at this locus of things in the Hilbert scheme where as a gamma representation, we get this C gamma to the n. But then recently in 2019, it was discovered that you could get not just this kind of Hilbert scheme of C2 or the Hilbert scheme. Hilbert scheme of C2 or the Hilbert scheme of S, but you can in fact get the Hilbert scheme of the singular surface as well. So parameterizing codimension n ideals of the functions on C2 mod gamma. In other words, gamma invariant polynomials and two variables. So you can get that as well. And this is interesting. You have to vary stability in a certain way, and it accepts a map from this n gamma c2, not from Hilben S, right? Because Hilben is not, this is something that confuses. Is not this something that confused me at some point in the past? It's not functorial. So you don't have a map from Hilb ns to Hilb n of C2. This does not exist, right? So we don't have that, but we actually have a map. You can see that it comes from this n-gamma hilb. Right, so that's what you get. And you get all this guys, you get all other sorts of guys as well. You get all kinds of different variants on this, all sort of. On this, all sort of different versions of this 2n-dimensional space by taking either crepant resolution of it or partial resolution. So these guys in the middle are not smooth, they're singular, so these are partial resolutions. So we've got the resolutions here on the left, we've got the partial resolutions here in the middle, and then we've got the singular guy at the end. Okay, so this is the picture we get by varying stability. These are all sort of different modi-spaces of some non-commutative thing. Spaces of some non-commutative thing, this pi q, this pre-predictive algebra, or you could view it as moduli spaces of this smashed product algebra for this particular dimension vector here, this type of dimension vector. Okay, so that's what we can get, and we can get lots of other interesting things. And you can get also, of course, if you want to use different framings, you can get many more things analogs of these torsion-free sheaves. And actually, a PhD student recently. Actually, his PhD student recently finished Soren Gamelgard. He's looking into some of those. All right, so that's what you get here. And a theorem of Bellamy and Crow, well, I put the publication date here, whereas I put the archive date here. So I think the archive date here is earlier, but all projective crepant resolutions of sim n C2 mod gamma are of the n C2 mod gamma are of the form m theta for some theta generic. So that's the theorem. So of course you can get lots of interesting things by varying stability. And when theta is generic, you get something which is a resolution which is smooth. But then you can ask, well, what about other predictive resolutions? Like you could have all kinds of different things, but it turns out that you don't get any others. So that's what you have here. Have here. And more precisely, to do this, they compute the GIT hyperplane arrangement for the theta space here. And m theta depends only on the chamber that we're in, this GIT hyperplane arrangement. So basically, you have the theta space, you have the hyperplanes where we're not generic. So we have a smooth, a not smooth, so singular moduli space. And then in the complement of that, in this RQ. In this RQ, the complement of this hyperplane arrangement, we have these chambers, and inside of the chamber, the resolution you get is the same. And they're able to show that all the resolutions are of this form. So you have a one-to-one correspondence between projective preparent resolutions and the GIT chambers, the complements of these hyperplane arrangements, modulo a certain vial group action, which is actually the vial group of the quiver, the extended Dinkin quiver, cross with C2 here. Okay. Two here. Okay. Actually, this is the vial group of the Dink encryption. This is a finite vial group. So I should, that looks a little bit ambiguous the way I wrote that. It's not quite correct. It's a finite Weil group. All right, so there are any questions at this point here? So we get to. So we get so the nominee kava valgroup is always this finite group, and it's in general when you have symplectic resolutions. This nomineka-val group appears, and actually it appears not originally in the situation of seeing when resolutions are isomorphic, but originally in seeing when your deformations of the resolution give the same deformation of the base. So you have this sort of Namakawa-Wala group difference between Val group difference between the universal deformation of the resolution and the universal deformation of the base. But here it appears in resolutions. So, there's any questions about this. This is sort of the background here. So, again, maybe this is a lot of information because of the fact that I was able to give a Zoom talk here, but the main point is that you can get lots of interesting. point is that you can get lots of interesting resolutions of this singularity. So just to sum up, you can get lots of interesting resolutions of this singularity, which is a quotient singularity, C2N mod, this wreath product group, just by varying stability, or in other words, looking at Nakajima's quiver varieties. And there's some theorem that says that every resolution can be obtained this way. Okay. So what I'm doing with Bellamy and Cross generalizing this to any quiver, not just Quiver, not just the extended Dinkin quivers. So, actually, then the statement is maybe slightly easier to say. Sometimes, when it's more general, it's slightly easier to say because then we don't have to give all this explicit information about what is our setup. So, let me say what this statement is. Okay, so let's just take again, we're looking at Nakajima's quiver varieties. So, if we have a resolution given by varying theta and where theta is generic, okay, so for generic theta, there's an explicit. Generic theta, there's an explicit combinatorial condition on when you get such a thing, right? You can look at the dimension vector and the root system and of the quiver, and you can sort of say, or the Katzmutili Li algebra of the quiver, and you can sort of say what it is you need in order to have this happen. So it happens in a lot of examples, like the one I have. So now in this case, every projective crepent resolution is isomorphic to some m theta for some generic theta. We do need to have a non-trivial framing for this. Have a non-trivial framing for this, so we're not doing the unframed case in this theorem yet. Although, our general technique can apply to much more general problems, not just quiver varieties, but GIT problems. And I'll say more about that later. Are there any questions at this point? So, every projective resolution is isomorphic to M theta. So, this says that basically, in some sense, for quiver varieties, every projective crepid resolution or equivalently simple. Or equivalently symplectic resolution is given by another quiver variety for the same quiver. So, this gives a bijection between Vial group, Namakawa-Vial group orbits of GIT chambers and projective crepent resolutions of this original guy. They're just varying stability. Now, all projective crepent morphisms to M0 are isomorphic to one of these M thetas. Okay. So, not just the crepent resolutions, but we can actually look at partial resolutions as well for theta is not necessarily generic. This is something which I don't think this was explicitly mentioned as a consequence, or maybe it was, I have to check in Bellamy and Craw's paper. But either way, this is something where we're going to also get all of these guys as well. So, not just the ones on either end, not on the left end, the smooth ones. Not on the left hand, the smooth ones, but we can say that all of the partial resolutions too can be obtained by varying stability. And in this paper of Croix, Gamelgard, Genghis, Sendroy, they actually find specifically which thetas give this Hilbert scheme of the singular surface. So we can prove that there has to be some theta that does that. So then if we want to make the more general statement for partial solutions, Statement for partial resolutions, we get a bijection between again non-mcambovial orbits of GIT cones, which don't have to be chambers, and partial projective current resolutions. So again, the chambers, as I said, these are these hyperplane complements. These are the hyperplane complements, so the regions of the hyperplane complements, the regions of hyperplane. Of hyperplane arrangement complement of hyperplanes complement. Let's say it that way. Right, so those are the GIT chambers. The GIT cones are boundaries of these chambers, right? So these are going to be boundaries of these chambers. So that's the thing that's happening here. That's a difference between what we call a GIT cone and a GIT chamber. Chamber. So let me make this gray here. So now we have also GAT cones, which are sort of boundaries of chambers. Okay, so that's what we get. This includes all the partial resolutions. And so without using this nice paper I was mentioning in 2019. I was mentioning in 2019, we get, in fact, that there has to exist some theta. So we get this Hilbert scheme of C2 mod gamma, but we don't know a priori which one it is. So you have to do a computation. You have to do some work to figure out which one. Okay, so any questions about this theorem? So it's some general statement that under mild condition for quiver varieties, you can always obtain not just every. You can always obtain not just every resolution but every partial resolution by varying GAT. And then in the practice, what you want to do is you want to identify sort of which chambers or which GAT cones, if you're not smooth, you need to get your resolution. All right, so let's move on. I want to say what result this follows from, a general result it follows from. And I won't have a huge And I won't have a huge amount of time to go into the details. I wanted to say something about the proof, but I won't have a lot of time for that. Let's see how much time I have. But before I do that, I want to say something about another special case. I want to demonstrate that this is not even just about symplectic settings. Everything so far was symplectic, but you can talk about crepent resolutions more generally. So if we have a finite subgroup of SL3C, and we consider the quotient C3 mod gamma. Consider the quotient C3 mod gamma, then we can view this singular quotient also again as a coarse moduli space for some non-cumbitative algebra, this smashed product algebra. Okay, or Merida equivalently using the Mackay quiver of the subgroup of SL3. Now we use C3 instead of C2 to construct this quiver. Well, it's a theorem of Bridge and King and Reed that we have a projective prepared resolution of the C3 mod gamma given by the gamma. Gamma given by the gamma-Hilbert scheme. This was conjectured by Nakamura. And Crow and Ishii conjectured that all crepid resolutions are given by varying stability for this moduli space here over the smash product ring or over the Mackay quiver equivalently. So that's a nice amazing conjecture and it's been proved in some cases including the case I'm going to just Including the case I'm going to discuss. But I want to also point out that three days ago, Yamagishi posted a proof of the full conjecture. So I haven't taken a close look at that, but that's pretty exciting. Independently, we proved the following stronger statements, but in a special case about this conjecture, and that's the following. So I want to assume that the gamma is not arbitrary, but that this resolution I was mentioning has fibers only of dimension at most. Has fibers only of dimension at most one. So Michael Weems has a beautiful sort of algebraic proof of the classification of resolutions and under these assumptions. And we're going to say something different, something geometric, but it covers the same result. And so this is the same thing as saying that gamma has no senior conjugacy classes in the sense of eto reads. You can actually define the age of conjugacy classes and the junior ones of lower age and the senior. ones of lower age and the seniors. So I'm wondering when I'm going to be getting to that senior currency class soon. Okay, so theorem is that under this assumption that we have no senior one, only junior condensate classes, only sort of junior workshop, every generic theta is contained in a unique region of stability space. And then we get a one-to-one correspondence between the chambers in that stability, in that region of stability space. In that stability, in that region of stability space and the crepid resolutions. So, for example, from this approach using mutation, this Elderich approach that Michael Weems was writing, you can definitely get a prescription to get a theta to give you every crepite resolution. But this is a different one. Now we're identifying a region of the stability state. So maybe it's the same, I'm not sure, but it's a different way of getting it. Okay. Right. Right, so work in progress with Dan Kaplan is to extend these sorts of results to global crepent resolutions. So, before I get into how we prove these things, I was just telling you, I want to say a little bit about the globalization. So, you could consider crepent resolutions where locally it has some form of a moduli space like we're talking about, but not necessarily globally. Necessarily globally. So, maybe, or in other words, we understand the local cremate resolutions, but maybe not a priori the global ones. Say we've already done what I just showed you. Now, we want to extend that to settings where we have local models of the form I just talked about. So, for example, we could take a coarse moduli space of objects in the 2CY category that would include modules over any 2CY algebra, such as the prepredictive algebra that I talked about or the multiplicative prepredictive algebra. Or the multiplicative preparedive algebra. And that gives you multiplicative covered varieties, which include, so these were studied by Corley-Bovian Shaw, defined by Corley-Bovian Shaw and studied. And in the case when you have a comet or crab-shaped quiver, then you can actually get character varieties for Riemann surfaces. So moduli of local systems on Riemann surfaces. And the sort of branches here correspond to punctures with monodromy conditions. Punctures with monodromy conditions. You can be punctured as well. Also, moduli of sheaves on K3 orbelian surfaces and moduli of Higgs bundles on closed Riemann surfaces. So in this case, in these cases, in all these cases, these two CY categories, Ben Davison recently proved that you get local models of the form I was just talking about. Okay, so another example that's not necessarily moduli space, but we're Space, but where we locally have singularities that we can possibly understand would be a quotient of a torus, a complex torus, by a symplectic group now acting, preserving, by acting integrally so that it'll act on the torus, not just on complex place. And now we can take the multiplicative symplectic structure, there's the dilation invariant symplectic structure. Invariant symbolic structure, and that will be preserved by this gamma group. So, we could take these quotients, and locally, they'll look like quotients of just C2n by a group, but globally it can be more interesting. So, in all of these sorts of cases, if we so more generally, if y is a variety with a finite stratification where we understand the singularity type along each stratum, then we can count the resolutions by counting them locally. So, in other words, the local So, in other words, the locally projective analytic crepant resolutions here will be given by sort of resolving along each stratum in a way that the monodromy along the stratum doesn't change your resolution and in a way that you're compatible with generalizations. If you take a resolution at some point S in the boundary of a stratum, then you can extend it to this part of the little part of the stratum and then transport it along a path to your base point. So, if you pick a base point on each stratum, So, if you pick a base point on each stratum and pick some resolutions of the base points that are compatible in these ways, you get a global resolution and vice versa. Of course, in particular, if at every singularity there's a unique resolution, then you get a unique global resolution. But in general, you can count resolutions. So, if you have a surface with Duval singularities, you just multiply the number of resolutions you would have at each singularity. So, you can take symmetric powers of surfaces with singularities and count the resolutions. Singularities and count the resolutions. Okay, so right. So now I'm going to speak about something more general and right okay, so something seems a little bit Seems a little bit strange about the following here. But so let's talk about GIT now. So I want to explain a generalization. So we're going to generalize this. Something went wrong with the slide. So we're going to generalize the theorems at the beginning to the GIT case. So, we're going to just have the setup of G is a reductive group, and it's going to act on an affine variety B V. Okay. All right. And so now I need to Something went wrong with my slide. So, sorry about that. So, let me make a new slide here. Right. Okay. So, this is a setup here. So, Nick is right, and then we'll go down here. So, now we want to So now we want to we want to consider y is going to be this v mod G. So remember G is acting on V. This is affine. This is reductive. And we want to take want to define Define these variants of stability. So very stability. Okay, so that's what we want to do. So now what does it mean to be stable? So semi-stable, this is now we're going to Mumford. Is so now we're going to Mumford sort of GIT. Semi-stable means that we have a vector such that some semi-invariant, some multiple of theta, is non-zero. So theta is a character. And so semi-stable means that there's some semi-invariant which does not vanish at your V. And stable means that you're semi-stable, you're a closed orbit, and you're And your stabilizer is finite. Okay. Right. So now in this situation, we're going to say that our stability parameter is generic if the semi-stable and stable loci are the same. Okay. So let's assume that g acts freely on the semi-stable locus. So that implies that theta is generic, but this is actually stronger because I only require Stronger because I only required here that the stabilizer be finite. Well, in this case, if G acts freely, then we get a G covering from the theta semi-stable locus to its quotient by G. So we have a free action on some space, V theta semi-stable, and then we just take its quotient by G. All the orbits are closed. This is really, literally just a G covering. In this case, there's something called descent that says that every There's something called descent that says that every character of the group, which you can think of as a trivial line bundle with a non-trivial G-equivariant structure, it descends to a line bundle on the quotient. In other words, we can construct line bundles on the quotients by picking characters of the group because we have this G covering. So you can think of this as just twisting. You could think of this as twisting the structure sheaf by the character. So now from this, we can. So now, from this, we get a homomorphism from characters of G to the group of line bundles up to isomorphism on the quotient. And this is given by descending chi to L chi. Okay. And here, I guess I think this is something which I don't see on this slide. This is saying that the mod mod theta. V mod mod theta G is defined as V theta semi-stable mod G. So that's the notation here. And we're going to call it also chi theta. All right, so now we get this x theta. So now we're going to get some homomorphism. And this generalizes to the case when theta is generic, but we don't. When theta is generic, but we don't act freely. So we have a finite stabilizer. In that case, it's a little bit technical, and I don't really have much time. But anyway, the point is that if you have an arbitrary generic character, then for some power of the character, you will kill that stabilizer. So we can define L n chi and not L chi. But then if we tensor by Q, we get a well-defined map, sending chi to one over n times L. 1 over n times ln chi. So either way, we get in the generic case, we always get this linearization map from the rational characters to the rational Picard space. And if we're free, we actually get something stronger. Okay, and it's a theorem of Thaddeus in 1996 that it's amazing that actually we have a finite polyhedral complex. So there's a finite union of GIT cones. So if we're in the interior of the same GIT. If we're in the interior of the same GAT cone, then stability, semi-stability doesn't change as we move around the cone. Now we can define a GAT chamber to be the interior of one of these guys when theta is generic in that interior. So the stimi-stability and stability coincide. And the interior, that's a GIT chamber. So as a corollary of this Cepheus, we get that L, this linearization map also only depends on the change. map also only depends on the chamber, not on the theta itself. So we're going to call it L C for the chamber. This is not to be confused with a notation for the bundle itself. So you had L chi for the bundle and I called it L because it takes chi to the bundle L chi. Now since L is defined in terms of theta, it depends only the chamber. I'm actually going to call this L C. Okay. So now we can talk about wall crossing. What happens if we pass from one chamber? Crossing, what happens if we pass from one chamber to another chamber? Right, so if we do that and we have this wall here, then we get a birational transformation. We get a birational relationship between the two resolutions. So to classify resolutions, to talk about what the birational geometry of all these different crepid resolutions are and what happens when we flop them, we need to understand what happens when we cross one of these walls. This is an important problem. important problem so what are we let's look at the different types of walls we'll call a wall small for only going to be if they are going to be the same outside of co-dimension two since x theta plus and x theta minus they're only contracting things of co-dimension at least two and divisorial if you contract a divisor but the dimension stays the same and fiber type if actually the dimension drops so we're going to do this with respect to each chamber c plus we can look at from each side We can look at from each side as we approach the wall, whether we're small, divisorial, or fiber type. Now we can form a region by just deleting the small walls, basically. So we'll form a maximal region, which is a union of chambers such that all the internal walls are small from both sides. Okay. So now we have this region RC. We want to understand this region RC, and this is going to be our candidate for getting all of the resolutions because as you exit this RC, Because as you exit this RC, you can track a divisor, then you're not going to be, then you're going to be reaching the boundary of where you can make a modification, a crepent modification. So our assumption is that this LC is an isomorphism for the theta. So this is an isomorphism of vector spaces. This is a strong assumption. It doesn't happen even for all quivering. Assumption: it doesn't happen even for all quiver varies, it doesn't happen, but for the quiver varies in that previous theorem, it does happen. Okay, every internal wall of RC is a flipping wall, so on the inside these small walls have an additional property that the unstable locus for theta, I'm sorry, the strictly semi-stable locus for theta zero. I didn't say unstable, by the way. I'm not using the word unstable because that's a little bit confusing. So, the strictly Using. So the strictly semi-stable, this theta, theta zero semi-stable, but not theta zero stable locus, this should give you something of codimension at least two on our x theta on both sides, xc plus and xc minus. So we want most of these varieties we get on both sides of the wall outside of coordination two, we want it to course map to stable things, theta zero stable. Stable things, theta zero stable things down here. And we also don't want these to be isomorphisms. We don't want to allow that this map, one of these maps is an isomorphism. So that would not be good because then it would mean that actually when theta is not generic, it's still giving you the same thing as when it's generic. So that would not, then this would not work. And finally, we need to know that when we hit the band. And finally, we need to know that when we hit the boundary, then we have to do a contraction of a divisor or a fiber type from the inside. So, if all of those things are true, then we can hope that if we map RC in here to the Picard space, we get all the resolutions in some sense, the ample cones of the resolutions or of the models. So, here's the general statement. So, under these assumptions, first of all, all of these linearization maps are the same for the whole region. Maps are the same for the whole region, for any chamber in the region. And second of all, the region maps to the movable cone. This is the collection of all small modifications, of ample cones of small modifications. So it's a locus where if you take your line bundle and the movable cone and take a power of it, you get a globally generated bundle outside of codimension two. And so now the ample cones of all of the small modifications, the things that are the same outside. Modifications, the things that are the same outside of code mention two will be exactly inside of this movable cone and will be the union of their closures. So we'll get a one-to-one correspondence between chambers in the RC and the ample cones of the small projective modifications of x theta. And in the case when x theta to y is crepent, then these are exactly, these small modifications are exactly the projective crepant resolution. So we get all of them. And I have a question here. And I have a question here, and that is: does the converse hold? In other words, it seems that we've cooked up these conditions here to be exactly the conditions we need so that when we cross a, I was just discussing this with my collaborators this morning, and we cross a wall of the GIT space, we have exactly the right thing happen that we can match up the linearization maps and everything works out. So you might ask. So, you might ask this assumption here and the result look quite similar. You might ask, is it a biconditional? So, this is one, two, three, and the theorem apply the assumption. And we agreed that the only unclear part is the underlying condition, which is one of the most important technical ones. And that is that this unstable locus has codimension at least two. So, that's not necessary. I know it's not completely clear that that has to be true in order to get the theorems one, two, and three to hold, but that's what we needed. But that's what we needed. But the good thing is that now we can show all these assumptions are satisfied in the cases I was mentioning before. So I'm going to skip for a moment the proof. Just maybe I'll say a couple words about it before my time is up. But I just want to say the assumption is satisfied for the quiver varieties and for these C3 mod gamma, this Bridge and King read. This Bridge and King read, for example, resolution or any resolution there, we're going to get these assumptions are satisfied. So, a conjecture, question, is this assumption satisfied whenever we have, say, a conical symplectic resolution? Maybe we can restrict to Hamiltonian reduction. So, this V is the zero fiber of a moment map of a Hamiltonian action. And I want to remark that in this case, we have a In this case, we have a derived equivalence of two different resolutions, which exists by Khalid and locally over the base. And then, under some mild conditions, we have an explicit construction by Halper and Leister and Sam giving you a braid group-wide action on the sum of these categories. So, let me just say a couple of words about the proof because the proof is actually, once you write it down, it starts to look like a tautology almost, because these conditions resemble each other. Rely on each other, but actually, it gives you something really powerful. Like, I don't think that it wasn't at all clear until recently that for quiver varies, for example, you can match up what happens by varying stability and just the intrinsic by rational geometry, all the crepid resolutions. So the way this works is when we cross a flipping wall, then if you take a character and take L C minus or L C plus, they both descend from the same. They both descend from the same bundle on the stable locus for theta zero. So our technical condition about codimension two I was talking about, this one which is the most subtle, says that they will agree outside codimension two. So these two maps are the same. That's really the main part. Excuse me. And also by construction, L C of theta prime is ample for every theta prime in C because it maps the ample cone. So L C of C is C of C is going to be in the ample cone. And finally, if we're in the boundary, now if we take x theta 0, yes, I'll be done in a second. We take x theta 0, then this is the main, this is a really important point. Then that's a contraction of x theta. It's this projection, the proj construction for this bundle that we have L C. This bundle that we have L C of theta zero. So that's the important point that shows that on the boundary we're not ample, so we map to the boundary of the ample cone. And so therefore, we actually get an isomorphism. The chamber maps to the ample cone. And similarly, on the boundary of the region R C, we contract a divisor. And so that means we have to reach the boundary of the movable cone. And as a result, we get this isomorphism RC to the whole. This isomorphism RC to the whole movable cone. Okay. Well, okay, that was a little bit fast, but the point is that this proof is really not that complicated once you set everything up. So it's just like, it's amazing that you can write down these general assumptions. This gives you the result and that we can see that these assumptions are satisfied, you know, in nice examples. Okay, so that's going to be it. So thank you for following my talk. Any questions? Does that include Zoom? Can I ask one? Oh, yeah, it definitely includes Zoom. Okay. I had just a quick one about just the very background. Can King's stability conditions or semi-stability be recovered as instances of Mumford semi-stability or stability? Of Mumford semi-stability or stability? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I should have said it, but I thought that King's ability is easier to understand, especially for this audience. So I just started with that. But yeah, Mumford's ability matches King's ability in the case where you're just taking this representation space module, the general linear group acting. Okay. Thank you. So that's maybe probably why King came up with this in the first place. It's like a nice way of writing it down. It's like a nice way of writing it down that it seems easier to apply. Any other questions, either here or on Zoom? Well, if not, let's thank Travis again. Thank you so much for inviting me. This is a really nice conference. Thank you, Travis, for speaking. And we'll resume at 10 o'clock. Uh,
