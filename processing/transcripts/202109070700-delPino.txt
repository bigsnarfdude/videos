Okay, thank you very much, Miruna, for the introduction. Thank you very much to all the organizers for inviting me to this great workshop. So anyway, what I will speak about today is about some classical topics concerning oiler flows or Euler flows for the Euler equation. The Euler equation for the evolution of a fluid, of an incompressible fluid, expressed in the so-called vorticity string system, a vorticity string form, in two dimensions is the transport equation, the non-local transport equation that I am showing here. So here you have So here you have the transport term and the potential of the transport of which are from which the particles of the fluid of the underlying fluid is being moved is given just by the Newtonian potential itself of omega. Omega here is the vorticity, is the so-called vorticity, and psi is called the strength function. The velocity field is The velocity field is something you can recover using this formula. This is the also known as the Weio-Sabart law. Okay, this is a rather simple equation, partial differential equation, while non-local. And as it is well known, it involves a lot of difficulties, a lot of technical difficulties, and a lot of mistakes. Difficulties and a lot of mysterious issues not yet solved. Concerning the two-dimensional case, global existence and uniqueness are known. If we start with, say, an net infinity initial condition, then this problem has a global solution. In fact, a solution that lives at all times, that remains bounded at all times. In addition, in reality, if you start from a regular function, If you start from a regular function, the solution leaves at all times being regular, being always regular. This was found first in the 1930s and the more complete theory, say, traces back to the 1960s. Okay, so solutions remain smooth, do not develop singularities in finite time. Okay, well, the topic I will I will speak first about is the problem of finding solutions or analyzing solutions with concentrated vorticity. So vorticity is a measure of how much the fluid is rotating around at a certain point. So highly concentrated vorticity, okay, maybe it is certainly. Okay, maybe it is explained by this picture, that I don't think it is real anyway. But but so these are three regions with highly concentrated vorticities. Okay, so something that is consistent with the fact, for instance, that solutions to this equation, to the in fact this is easy to prove, crystal maps in time, then we can think that these pods that are actually evolving, if they are very concentrated, we can think of them. Very concentrated, we can think of them as simply multiple, constant multiple. These kappa j's are supposed to be constant here. And the aÏ€ I just included by convenience. I will tell you later why. And well, this delta represents direct delta. Okay, so it's mass, mass one. It's mass one concentrated, extremely concentrated. Okay, so we can think of solutions, regular solutions that pass certain concentration parameter goes to zero. Concentration parameter goes to zero, you approach these singular objects. Okay, capital psi, the string function, is simply the inverse Laplacian of delta, of the direct delta, so it is the fundamental solution. The pi factor is responsible of this four to appear here. And well, psi should be the singular object. Might be singular, but singular. Okay. Oops, sorry, I I something happens. Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, now it works. Okay, the mathematical theory for these highly concentrated solutions is very old. In fact, it takes us back to the very origins of the study of these fluid dynamics equations. Equations go back, say, to Hernholtz, who already found very interesting phenomena associated to the equation, and later on analyzed by Kirchhoff, Rose, Lagali, and Cislin ask for the concentrated vorticity solutions. Okay, let me explain you more or less in today's language. Okay, why do we expect that the solution? Why do we expect that the solution, say if we think of this guy here, which is a measure, right? It's a linear combination of direct deltas, center at points psi j of t, say this centers, this point evolving time. Then think of this way, call this WSS stands for singular. So it's singular solution of this. Solution is a way of saying because it is not so clear what's Not so clear what sense to give to this asset solution, even in a measure of theoretical sense for the two-dimensional case. Okay, direct delta is this, then since psi s, which is the strength function associated, is the inverse Laplacian of this, then this would be simply a linear combination of the fundamental solutions. And where fundamental solution, I understand. were fundamental solution, I understand it to be this function gamma of x here. Okay, so let me substitute these two guys in the equation and let's see what happens. If I do that substitution inside the operator, still formal, okay? What I find here is on the left, I see gradient of Dirac delta, okay, which has a distributional meaning, of course. So when I differentiate in time, I get this on the left. Differentiating time, I get this on the left. And substituting on the rest of the operator, the transport part, we found these. Then we grouped them together. And the gradient of the direct deltas comes multiplied by these factors. So in order to have a solution, what we need to do, what we need to find is that this guy, this coefficient here is actually zero exactly at the point phij. Exactly at the point phij. Okay, let me show you one fact, okay, that in fact, since these gradient, these functions are in the right sense, right, they're symmetric, right? I mean, they are invariants and the rotations, then the product here and here is zero when we stand for i equal to j. So this is the reason why only a different from j appears here. different from j appears here. So if I make this zero for x equals psi j, then I get this system. This Hamiltonian system, this is Hamiltonian system, which is nothing but the n-body problem in R2, where the masses are these coefficients kappa i. These kappa i's don't need to be positive anyway. They could have any sign. Okay, so this was the discovery. So, this was the discovery that traces back to the late 19th century, rediscovered again in the case of bounded domains later. Let me now set up a question. Are there solutions, true solutions, smooth solutions, which is what we see physical, right? In the physical world, we don't see direct deltas. We see regularized direct deltas, if you wish, but smooth things that in fact That in fact, in the center of the hurricane, say, what you see is a place with velocity zero, for instance, right? So the concentrated solutions are not just for fun. Direct deltas are not good enough to describe the fluid sufficiently close to the status. Anyway, so the question is the following: this is the formal law, and this is the system of A system of differential equations, which have, of course, solutions. If you take if you put initial conditions that so whenever the solutions do not collide, the initial conditions are all different, then for a finite time, this will exist, maybe for all times. And now the question is whether or not true solutions behave like this. Or not, true solutions behave like this. Okay. So, the question that I would like to analyze here is the one of finding solutions that are highly concentrated around a finite set of points that evolve in the form of that system of differential equations. Okay, let me consider the following regularizations just to fix ideas. Just to fix ideas. The vagarizations look a little bit, if you wish, arbitrary, but they are representative enough of the phenomenon I would like to show. I will consider for as a regularization of the direct delta and a regularization of the string function. So let me consider a regularization of the singular string function, which is given by this guy. Yeah? So simply I add down here epsilon squared. That down here, epsilon squared. Nothing, nothing. It's regular, almost singular, right? But not singular. If you compute the Laplacian of this, okay, you end up with this function u zero here, with an object that actually, when epsilon goes to zero, approaches delta. And this profile zero is integrable. In fact, has mass a pi. This is the reason of the a pi' before. And in zero is precisely this. Is precisely this, yeah? It's precisely this function. Okay, something that we immediately see, for instance, is that this regularization omega 0 epsilon approaches the corresponding linear combinations of the direct deltas, right? Okay, this is not quite correct because I need an 8 pi here, okay? So just to keep it in mind. On the other hand, the velocity field, the velocity field is the gradient per of the extreme function. Of the string function in reality approaches, once it is normalized by log epsilon, approaches a fixed string which is the duct del Potter. Okay, our first result, I say our main result in this first part is the fact that if we start from a collisionless solution of the system of the embody problem, in our two weeks, problem in R2 with these coefficients then there is a solution a true solution smooth of the EU system that actually differs little from these explicit regularizations like zero epsilon and omega zero epsilon so the remainder is in reality small yeah and so okay the picture shows more or less what what we are trying to find this this profile Are trying to find this profile are the concentrations of the mortality. So, here is the result. So, we consider collisionless solutions of the system called the Kirchhoff-Rhodes system anyway. In the fixed interval, say the solutions live and are smooth, say, in a given interval zero, capital T. Then there exists a solution, okay, omega epsilon psi epsilon, a true solution. Epsilon, a true solution of the Euler system that has this form. So it has the form, the regularizations of the singular objects plus small objects, little phi and psi. And this little phi can actually be bounded by epsilon times the bubbles. So it's a small fraction of the bubbles. And for the gradient, we get an even better control. we get an even better control okay for the sorry for the swim function and in fact both the function is like epsilon squares very small and the gradient in fact has size epsilon and there are technical reasons why we don't get better but in reality phi is better than this okay in fact but but in principle this is the type of thing we get so in particular we have this In particular, we have this statement. I would like to mention that there was a very nice result before, much before, almost 30 years ago, by Marcelo Pulvirenti, who proved the existence of solutions like these, satisfying the first statement, not the second. In reality, the other statement corresponds more or less to more or less to what happens in the exterior of the of this point psi i very close to the to the i mean in the concentration region they they find almost no information okay let me mention the ingredients in the construction um the construction is quite technical this paper is already published yeah in we um what we do is first we need improvement What we do is first we need improvements in powers of epsilon of the we need to improve the approximation. Okay, then we set up the problem as a coupled system of inner problems near the singularities and an outer problem more regular outside. And finally, we devise a previous estimates to solve by a continuation argument, which is a degree argument. Concerning the improvement of the approximation step, just to get a flavor of how it works. Just to get a flavor of how it works, okay, let me consider the explicit regularization, which I can write in this form, where the maze is this function. And I evaluate the operator, the Euler operator, in here and try to look for corrections, okay? Little psi and little phi for the regularized object u zero and psi zero. Use zero, I'm sine zero, and I will tell you how to get these first corrections. Um, we substitute and we get a system, we get a nice system, very explicit when I express it in the variable y. This is the variable y, close to the points I J say. It is this guy. So what we want in order to make the error small is that this quantity is the almost v. Yeah, and I can get that. So, uh Can get that. So the optimal thing is to make this. And this is precisely the fitness. It's a way of expressing the fitness. In that way, we get the first server of approximation, which is epsilon squared. But that is not enough to start some fixed point argument, and we need to improve several times. And in this improvement, what we make is we We use this elliptic operator, which is, I mean, this is the linearized operator, the linearized equation, and this guy appears here. And this operator is the linearized operator around the solution gamma zero of Louville's equation. Louis' equation in R2. And we know how to invert it, okay, and so on. And then we are able to solve a problem, a system like this. And that includes us the problem in epsilon. The problem in epsilon, however, we lose decay. And in order to recover the decay far away, we need to solve the transport problem. So what we do to do the improvement of the approximation is to alternate the use of the elliptical part of the operator, which is this. However, this operator is very bad because already there are functions living in the kernel of this. Okay, so it's not that it's not. Not that string is not, I mean, we cannot invert this operator equal to a radio function. Okay, we just can do it from Fourier mode one and on. And this part, the transport part. Okay, a major ingredient of find a pillar estimates for the linear problem, is this apirity estimates for the linearized operator, which reads like this. So it's a weighted two estimate. So it's a weighted to estimate, and that is in fact ideal in order to get later on the possibility to iterate. After iterating enough, we are able to get an error of the form epsilon to power five times rho to minus three, and that is good enough for our fixed point scheme, which is actually a degree theoretical object. It's not easy here to use Libchid stuff. Okay, let me show you. Let me show you a non-trivial extension of this work, which is joint work with Antonio Fernandez, who is my post-doc. So let me consider the following range. S, it's a number strictly between one half and one. This is called, this equation here looks This equation here looks the same as Euler, okay, except that this Laplacian to minus f is the Newtonian potential associated to the fractional Laplacian, okay, this quantity. And this is the same equation, of course, when f is equal to one, the same, the Euler equation, the same. And now the question is, what happens, okay, if we change the fractional parameter and we use S? This equation is called the general. This equation is called the generalized surface quasi geostrophic equation. And what I would like to tell you is how to get solutions with concentrated, not well, not vorticity, I mean the interpretation is not quite vorticity here, but we need concentrated values for this function omega. Okay, here is the limiting system, the relevant limiting system. If you do a similar If you do a similar argument as before, okay, with the formal derivation of the law, what we find is this. Of course, here the power is 4 minus 2s, which is true in the case of the Euler equation. And here is an embody problem, but with a different law. Our main result is that if we take u0 y now to be this function, the one before was the one with s equal 1 here. S equals one here, then we can find a solution that looks at main order like this, okay, and corresponding assertion for the string function. The result looks the same. On the other hand, let me tell you that the proof is more difficult. There is quite a bit, a lot of work additional that we need to do. First of all, in the improvement of the approximation, we need to consider In the programme approximation, we need to consider fractional equations that are actually not obvious, that is the case of Euler. That makes it harder on the one hand, but there is also a technical element that is very important. When S is bigger than, when S gets closer to one half, we need finer and finer approximations. In fact, we at the end. In fact, we at the end we need to find approximations of arbitrary order. And that is a very delicate thing, as it is the form that aquary estimates take. However, at the end, it works. On the other hand, it is interesting that when S is equal to one-half, we cannot get it. Our method simply fakes. And we strongly suspect that there is something different happening for the cases equal to one-half. Cases equal to one half. In any case, for NES, with Wegway Au, Fandavila, and Monica Musso, we found the corresponding result for a vortex pair. That is a different type of problem because it's an elliptic problem. It is a special solution, if you wish, of the system, but it reduces to an elliptic equation, and we are able to solve it for any. Anyway, let me say some words. Anyway, let me say some words about concentrated solutions in R3. These are called vortex filaments, and these are also very old objects, natural ones. Again, you can think of them as this picture. This picture, I suppose, is not true, but this one is true. This is the volcano in Italy, okay, that pushing a vortex ring, okay, outside of smoke. Okay. The open question that I would like to refer a little bit about is something called the vortex filament conjecture. The vortex filament conjecture concerns finding solutions of this form, I mean with concentrated vorticity, in this case not around a point, but around a curve. Okay, in the string vorticity formulation, the Euler equation. The Euler equation looks like this. This term makes it harder. Okay, it's the vortex stretching makes the problem much harder, actually. And so, and what we need to find are solutions that are concentrated around a curve evolving by a curve, okay, that I call gamma of t. So, what I would like to find, actually, what we would like to find are solutions that are concentrated in this form. Solutions that are concentrated in this form. Here, this is the stellar delta, direct delta, but it corresponds to a direct delta uniform, a measured uniform on the curve gamma of t. This one is the tangent vector field to the curve. And Darlius in 1904 found the law for which this evolves. If you make the change of variables in time, then you end up with the curve gamma of tau being asymptotically parameterized in this way. And this is called day-by-not. And this is called the binormal flow of curves. Yeah, it's a very interesting geometric flow. The vortex filament conjecture then is the existence of a regular solution behaving like that, which we would like to look for in the form the same guy as before, the same scaling guy centered at the curve, where point sets are parameterized in this form. This is only known in special cases, okay? It is known already in the case of Already in the case of a vortex ring, which is an S1 translating with constant speed vertically, and the other is a helix that is rotating with constant speed. The case of the helix is something we treated recently. If you look for solutions of this particular one and then you specialize to some to the rotating with constant speed, the problem is actually reduced to scalar elliptic. Use to scalar elliptic equation, which you can solve with using singular perturbation methods. And this is the way we treat this problem with Hundabila, with Monica Musso and Jung Cheng Wei, the paper you can find it in archive. Of course, this number alpha here is exactly the one that makes this guy a solution to the binormal flow. Okay, just to. Okay, just to conclude, let me say something about vortex rings. In the case of vortex rings, we look for solutions of this form with Euler no swim, and we find it in this way. And dialling ring solutions are the vortex rings, and they are found as solutions at the end of an elliptic equation. A problem that we solve is a problem that works. That we solve is a problem that was predicted, a conjecture that was predicted by Hernholtz already in 1858. It's the motion of two rings that are alternating, crossing one around each other, widening, stretching, and crossing periodically, say. Not periodically, but say this motion is called leapfrogging, leap frogging for vortex rings. And finding them rigorously is something that has been Is something that has been open forever, okay. And while you can find quite a bit of literature about them, also formal and experiments and so on in the web. Anyway, the nice thing is that if you use symmetries, then you can reduce the problem to something time-dependent, but a scalar equation in which you have to find solutions that interact when you have two vortices interacting, interacting sort. Is interacting, interacting sort of rotating one around each other. And in fact, the problem reduces to solving the following conjectures. Say that if you have a solution like this, this system was known already, the leaf throwing system, and what we need to find is a solution that looks like this, concentrated around the solution. We are able to find it. It is also quite a bit of work to do compared with the two-dimensional case because of the additional. Dimensional case because of the additional weights appearing. Anyway, thank you very much for your attention. Let's stop here. Thanks very much, Manuel, for the very beautiful talk. So there is a little bit of time for some questions, remarks. Yeah. Just curiosity, in the surface quasi-geostrophic equation, the one with this potential, no. You said something about the range S less than one half. Yes. What happens when S is equal to one half, you mean? Yes, yes. Well, when S equal to one half, what happens? So do you have a just a guess? Let me. Yes. Let me so let me tell you: the way we are, the procedure that we are using really shows an obstruct when you approach, when, I mean, you cannot use it when S is equal to one half. The reason is that when you try to, okay, in order to find this improvement of approximations, at the level of doing the improvement of approximation, we can do it. But at the level of finding a priority estimates, at some point we need to use A bootstrap, bootstrapping. And that bootstrapping somehow breaks down when we are in S equal to what happened. This is the technical reason. We don't know if there is something deeper that maybe is preventing the phenomenon to happen. Perhaps there is lower. Who knows? I mean, the case one half is supposed to be a good model for the Euler 3D when you consider solutions that blow up. Solutions that blow up, so maybe there is something deeper in that criticality that we are detecting. I see. So, this is a very, very special case. Yeah, it is a special case, and I think it is very interesting if one could solve it. Would be very interesting. Yeah. Okay, thank you very much. So, there are any other questions?
