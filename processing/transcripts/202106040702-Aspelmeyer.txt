And it's very exciting to have Marcus Aspermeyer opening up this session today. Marcus is going to be talking about quantum tests of quantum gravity. So over to you, Marcus. Well, thank you very much. So also thanks everyone from the organizing team for having me and putting together this fantastic workshop, which would Workshop, which would be even nicer if we were all together in person at this early time in the morning with a coffee and many blackboards, I guess. So in the light of what has been said over the last couple of days, there were many, many talks addressing exactly this topic I wanted to talk about. So I decided to shift a little bit more the focus. So originally, I thought I give an overview of all the different aspects of testing. Of testing gravity and quantum gravity, but now I want to focus on the current experiments on one specific area. So let me briefly say that right now there exists essentially two approaches that probe in one way or the other the quantum nature of gravity. The first one essentially assumes that a quantum theory of gravity exists and then looks at the low energy consequences of the features of such quantum theories of gravity. Features of such quantum theories of gravity. Those types of experiments do not necessarily involve gravitational measurements. They basically measure consequences on the dynamics of massive particles due to certain features of quantum theories of gravity. And then there's the second aspect that we heard about, namely where you don't assume anything and basically try to probe the phenomenology of gravitational fields, gravitational in that. Fields gravitational interaction in the presence of source masses that behave quantumly in some aspect. And this actually requires gravitational measurements. And there's a third part that I also would have talked about, but this was very nicely covered in the introduction, for example, of Philip Balta's talk, where quantum systems are used as test masses in external gravitational fields, where gravitational fields are at all time classical. Time classical and one test, Newtonian, or GR effects on these quantum systems. And again, there's a very complete list in Philipp Balta's talk. I added a couple of them if you want to check them out. I just want to highlight very, very quickly this first point. The idea goes back to atomic physics experiments where one tests low energy consequences of supersymmetric theories, for example, in so-called spectroscopic. Spectroscopic measurements of the electro-typal moment of the electron, and you can do the same for quantum theories of gravity. And I just give you one example basically providing you with a couple of references that you can look up without going into details. It turns out, for example, that if you assume a modified commutation relations, which are one possible feature of quantum theories of gravity, that this has consequences for the dynamic behavior of massive systems. Of massive systems, such as one can generate geometric phases that should be modified in the dynamics of massive systems. One should generate anharmonicities in the behavior, and one modifies the ground state energies of such systems. All of these things one can test with, for example, solid-state systems in a quantum machine. The only thing you have to be able to do is to perform very high precision measurements, quantum measurements on such mechanical systems. Measurements on such mechanical systems. And this has been an experimental to the force of establishing many, many solid-state systems that can be controlled via quantum optics. And in that spirit, there are many experimental proposals and partly experiments that confine possible parameter spaces of such high-energy quantum theories of gravity. Now, but I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about the About that, I want to talk about the question: what happens if we, or what, how can we actually think of experiments where we have quantum systems as gravitational source masses? And we already heard about all of the different approaches and the history of that. So this is only a summary slide that basically shows the different approaches that exist at the moment. Historically, it goes back to at least Feynman in his comments in a chapter. Feynman in his comments in a Chapel Hill conference. And right now, if you look in the literature, there are two types of experimental proposals that try to create superpositions of massive objects and then generate entanglement via gravitational action between those massive systems. One possibility is to have two harmonic oscillators in the quantum state of motion, such that you can describe the masses as pure state wave packets with a certain Is pure state wave packets with a certain extension delocalization delta x. You couple them via gravity and you can entangle them via this gravitational interaction. In the other case, the delocalization rests in two masses that are put in spatial superpositions of magnitude x. And here they are coupled via the dynamic phase that is generated when one mass propagates in the gravitational field of the other one. In both cases, it turns out. One. In both cases, it turns out that the entanglement rate is essentially the same and it's given by this expression. We already see the scaling, it scales with mass times the delocalization distance or the delocalization size and the distance here. And of course, the challenge is now in all these experiments to have this entanglement rate larger than all the decoherence rates in the system. So here's a reality check. Here's a reality check. Where are we today when we want to talk about gravitational source masses in the quantum machine? So, this chart, I want to focus first on the mass axis here and on the gravity side. So, what I have put here is what are actually currently the what is the smallest source mass for which people have actually measured a gravitational interaction. So, in other So, in other terms, how well can you, in an experiment, isolate gravity as a coupling force? There it goes. This is going to become important if you want to generate entanglement via or some sort of interaction via gravitational coupling. And the second question, so this is the first question, how small can we make a source mass and still isolate gravity as the coupling force? And the second question will be how massive can we make. Second question will be: how massive can we make a quantum system? So let's stick to this chart here. It turns out, up until recently, the smallest source master data was on the grand scale. So we wanted to change that and wanted to get a feeling for the challenges when you experimentally try to measure gravity or gravitational coupling of very small masses. So we set out to put together an experiment where the idea is the following. Essentially, of course, Essentially, of course, it is a variant of the Cavendish experiment on small scales. And the idea is you have here actually a source mass. And what you do is because the mass is small, you can actually easily modulate the motion. Okay. So as a function of time, you can modulate the amplitude. And that creates here on the test mass a modulated. Modulated, so the temporally modulated gravitational force, which means that you will start to ring up this thing here and you should see then coupling to this test mass. Now, since the gravitational potential is a nonlinear potential, you should not only see a linear response of the test mass, but there should also be higher order responses. You should also have a quadratic coupling and so on and so forth. So, in other words, if your displacement here Words, if your displacement here of your source mass is modulated by a certain amount and a certain amplitude, then the acceleration that your test mass sees will, if you Taylor expand just the gravitational potential, will follow the drive, but there will also be higher order contributions due to the non-linearity of the potential. So, in our case, we had here a small gold source mass on the order of 90 milligram, so a millimeter in size. A millimeter in size with a distance of a few millimeters between them that we modulated, and the smallest separation here between the two masses was in the order of 400 micrometer in the experiment. And the acceleration modulation that we create by modulating the source mass here is on the order of 10 to the minus 11 g. So 10 to the minus 10 meter per second squared. And which means for our configuration here, you see we read out the motion here. So it is a torsional pendulum. Motion here. So, this is a torsional pendulum that is now excited. When this here starts to rotate, you can read out the motion via just an optic lever here, just China laser from a mirror. You can read it out. And it turns out the displacement that you're looking for with these accelerations is on the order of some nanometer, which already tells you where the challenge lies. How do you distinguish a nanometer modulation due to gravitational interaction from a nanometer modulation due to some vibration in the lattice? Due to some vibration in the lab. Okay, a nanometer is really a small quantity. So here's the first challenge: it's the seismic noise challenge. Here you see data from our torsional pendulum just sitting there in the lab. And dark means nothing and yellowish means a lot. Okay. And what you see here, this is time. And these are the different frequencies. So our pendulum operates down here in the millihertz. Rates down here in the millihertz, so tens of millihertz regime. And if you see yellow stripes down there, this is really bad. So this is data that was taken without the source mass in place. So it's just the response of the test mass to its environment. And what you see here is stripes that occur. And it turns out these stripes, they coincide with the traffic light cycle of our road crossing, very close to our lap. So you have trams stopping, accelerating, you have. Stopping, accelerating, you have cars stopping, accelerating, and so on. And this is also consistent with the fact that you have these dark stripes in here, which just tells you this is where the trams stop going. Okay, so these are the six hours in the night between midnight and 6 a.m. where there is no tram traffic. But you see also that there are always two days where it's still a little bit yellowish. So this is Friday night and Saturday night, where there are people out on the street. Okay, so in principle, So, in principle, in our lab, we are confined to like four time slots, five time slots in the week, a five-hour time window, where the noise is basically much lower than at any other time of the day. There's also another thing that you have to be careful. Here's our lab. There is a Google Maps chart. Here's our lab. And you see here these purple points here. These are tram stations. Points here. These are tram stations. And when a tram passes by, it is a 90-ton object that passes by your lab in a distance of 60 to 70 meters. And this creates a gravitational pull. And since the traffic light cycle sort of coincides with our resonance frequency of a pendulum, what happens is if you project the Newtonian noise due to the gravitational pull on our pendulum, it turns out that here the frequency response is actually such that you get a maximum frequency response at our resonance. Um, at our resonance close to our resonance frequency, and the magnitude that you expect is on the order of the signal that we want to see. Um, in our case, luckily, um, this is the projected Newtonian noise on a free mass. We have a torsional pendulum which doesn't couple to this specific Newtonian noise, so we were isolated from that. But this is a lesson to learn for future experiments. You really want to decouple and be careful about which degrees of freedom couple to the motion of your environment. Coupled to the motion of your environment. So, to make a long story short, as a result, what we saw in this experiment here is the displacement as a function of frequency. We saw nicely the response of our test mass at the dry frequency of our source mass. And we also saw a second order modulation. So, it's the quadratic effect due to the linearity of the Newtonian potential. The acceleration modulation that we have is in the order that I. Modulation that we have is on the order that I just told you, and the precision that we have is on the order of 10 to the minus 12 meters per second squared when we average over 30,000 or 3,000 seconds. And we did have some systematics in this experiment. I don't go into the details. If there are questions, please feel free to ask. But we could calibrate our experiment to the extent that we know that 90% of the coupling that we observe is due to gravitational effects, and we know where the other. Gravitational effects, and we know where the other 10 percent that other 10 percent are actually coming from. So, um, having said that, if we go back to our plot here, we have now the situation where our gravitational window has been pushed in this direction here. So we are now somewhere in the regime of 10 milligram and sorry, of 90 milligram, and we are working. We are working at the moment to push this further down. Our next stop is actually the Planck mass. We want to see that we can isolate gravitational coupling from an object on the order of the Planck mass, which is around a factor of 4,000 in mass away from what we have at the moment. So let's come to the second point. And the second point is actually the question: how small can we make? How massive can we make? Can we make how massive can we make a quantum system? And you see here all these beautiful experiments already that show large coherence times and or large mass. Okay, so there's a trade-off, obviously. And this goes back to a comment that Gavin already made in his talk. Remember the coupling that we're interested in in scales with mass times delocalization. Okay, so if you look in current experiments, there are two experiments, two types of experiments that stand out. The one is the molecular. Experiments to stand out. The one is the molecular interference experiments by our colleague Marcus Anti in Vienna, where you have particles that contain like 20,000 atoms and are delocalized over several hundreds of nanometers, which means that your mass, the delocalization product is in the order of 10 to minus 29. Then there are other experiments with solid-state mechanical resonators. This is the one by Andrew Cleland and colleagues back then in Santa Barbara, where they had a mechanical Where they had a mechanical object with 10 to the 13 atoms, and they generated a superposition between the ground state and the first excited state of the acoustic motion in the system, resulting in a superposition size on the order of 10 to the minus 16 meters. But this was measured. So they saw nice Ramsey interference fringes. So it was an interference experiment, however, with tiny displacements. Again, mass times delta X is 10 to the minus 29. X is 10 to the minus 29. So it seems to be right now with experiments a universal constant that no matter which approach you choose, you're always confined to that. And the question is, how can you actually be better? Just a note on the side, ideally, of course, you take that square and divide it by the decoherence rate in the system to get a measure that is relevant for the gravitational coupling. And for the macromolecules, of course, this wins out because you have coherence times on the order of seconds and here nanoseconds. So there's still nine orders of magnitude difference in the Magnitude difference in the usefulness for gravity experiments. But still, note the 10 to minus 29 is still way too small. You can show actually that if you just take the coupling and want to get to coherence rates that are sufficiently strong compared to, let's say, decent decoherence times of a second or so, you need to have a solid state object. So, an object with solid state density, otherwise it With solid state density, otherwise, it will not work. So, this is why our approach has been now to combine the best of these two possible worlds: combine the idea of free-fall meta-wave endophrometry with long coherence times with solid-state systems where you can crank up the mass. And what does it mean, combine it? Well, the limiting factor here in a solid-state system is the fact that they are harmonically confined. So, it's just an harmonic oscillator, and that's in a sense useless. And that's in a sense useless because what you want to do is you want to have a wave packet that you can engineer to arbitrary sizes, shapes, superpositions, delocalizations, and just the harmonic oscillator won't do the job. So the idea is cut the harmonic potential and use a solid state system that you trap into a trap that you can shape arbitrarily. So levitate the system where the real asset, the real advantage is now that the potential landscape that the particle sees can be. Landscape that the particle sees can be shaped arbitrarily in principle. So, this is the idea, and my remaining minutes, I just want to guide you through two experiments that we are currently doing to try to have full wave packet control of such massive objects. One idea is how do you levitate them, but you can optically levitate them. That's a work that goes back to the pioneering experiments by Ashkin, where the whole idea is you have a dielectric particle. So, in our case, 150 nanometer diameter glass. 150 nanometer diameter glass sphere, and you simply focus a laser beam onto it. And the point is now the potential landscape that the particle sees is governed by the dipole interaction because it's a polarizable object. And the dipole moment that you create by the laser beam is just the polarizability times the electric field of the laser, which means that the overall potential is just given by the intensity of the laser beam. So if I have a focused laser beam now, the potential landscape that the particle sees is just Landscape that the particle sees is just the inverted intensity profile. So, if I take now a Gauss laser beam, okay, that looks like that in intensity, then my potential is just the inverted of that. It's an inverted Gauss and for small displacements, this is just a very nice harmonic confinement for my particle. And this is true for all three directions in a focused Gauss beam. And this is why you can levitate dielectric particles in 3D just focusing a laser beam onto them. Beam onto them. Now, these are the type of experiments that we do. You see a microscope objective that focuses down the light very strongly, such that you can trap a nanoparticle here in its focus. And then what you do is you have a laser, you shine your light through, and then you pick up the light that is transmitted and extract position information. You can extract X, Y, and Z motion position information of the object, and you use that to actually feed back this information on the potential, and you can then The potential, and you can then just by shaping the potential depending on your XYZ information, you can parametically stabilize the particle. So, in other words, you have a parametric cooling mechanism that allows you now to trap the particle at arbitrary pressure. So, in our experiments, we go down to like on the order of 10 to the minus 9, 10 to the minus 8 millibar, where you can neglect essentially gas collisions for the time of the experiment. And then, what you can do, for example, imagine you would have a weight. For example, imagine you would have a way to read out the particle motion with a precision that goes down to the ground state extension of the particle. So you can follow the quantum trajectory of the particle. And this is possible when you have a Heisenberg limited measurement. So when you have a measurement in which the imprecision of your measurement and the imprecision due to the back action of the probe is bound by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. By the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. This is something that we have implemented. This was a recent work by Lorenzo Marini and Constanze Bach, where the idea is now you collect the backscattered light because this contains most of the information. You collect the backscattered light and basically try to collect as much as possible. And it turns out, in our case, we can actually get a position sensitivity down to 1.3 times the zero point motion. So we fulfill the Zero-point motion. So we fulfill the Heisenberg limit to a factor of only 1.7 at room temperature. So that means we can follow the particle trajectory at room temperature, basically down to its quantum ground state dynamics, which also means if we now would have a feedback mechanism, we could just take that feedback and cool the particle, stabilize the particle down to the ground state, which is the last thing that we did. We actually implemented a Kalman filtering protocol together with optimal feedback that allowed us now. Feedback that allowed us now in real time to measure the quantum trajectory in phase space and apply a feedback to stabilize the particle in its ground state. And what you see here is a picture that was actually taken of the sphere, kept in room temperature while it is cooled in its quantum ground state of motion. So this is a 150 nanometer room temperature glass sphere where the motional degree of freedom is described by a pure state wave packet with a magnitude on the order of the mass of the mass of the mass With a magnitude on the order of a few picometers. So, delocalization with the order of a few picometers. You can also use other pooling methods. I don't go into the details here. We have borrowed ideas from Helmut Rich and Vladimir Bulitic and Chu back from the early 2000s that used ideas of laser cooling in combination with optical cavities to also achieve ground-scale cooling. The main idea essentially is theory. The main idea essentially, you see, you have here your particle in the tweezer, and of course, because of the motion of the particle, you scatter lights not only elastically but also inelastically. And what you do is you tune the cavity in such a way that you resonantly enhance those photons that carry away energy from the system. So the anti-Stokes scattered photons, if you want to talk in the Raman scattering picture. And by that, it's actually the cavity that provides a reservoir that is essentially at the ground state at zero temperature. Ground state at zero temperature, and you can use that to then cool the particle motion to its ground state of motion. So there's no active feedback involved. You just keep the particle in the cavity, you stabilize the tweezer frequency with respect to the cavity frequency and detune one with respect to the other such that you resonantly enhance the anti-stoke scattering and you cool again to the quantum ground state. Now, the next steps would then be to sort of make larger wave packets. Make larger wave packets. You remember, we need to increase the delocalization, and one way could be to simply switch off the trap and have three-fold dynamics, which in our case now would take on the order of some 10 milliseconds, such that we already have the particle radius. I don't bore you with the details. Of course, we do have decoherence in the system. We have recoil due to the light, we have recoil due to the gas, and that limits our coherence time significantly at the moment. This is all quantified right now. Right now, if we want to have a wave packet size larger than that particle, we need to work at much lower pressures and at lower temperatures, as has been told to you already by Zugato, by Gavin, and so on and so on. So the last thing I want to mention is, of course, in the future, we now need to generate large delocalizations. For example, large position states, to go from a pure wave packet like that to a wave packet that looks like that. So to generate non-Gaussian states of motion. Gaussian states of motion. This is done right now in collaboration with these people in a EHG Synergy grant. And then one possibility could be that you combine freefall protocols with quantum measurement protocols. Another alternative way has been presented by Gavin, where I use an internal degree of freedom and then have the particle go, for example, through a Schengelach device or something like that. And there's a nice recent article with a possible protocol to achieve that. So I'm So, I'm more or less at the end. Let me just mention that one of the things that you need in order to do all these protocols is to dynamically change the potential landscape. This is key to everything. And we already started to do that. Mario Campini and my team and Nicolai Tiesel's team has built up an experiment where you can change the beam intensity that catches the particle from just a Gauss beam to something like that. Spin to something like that, and you see, if you look at the potential, which is just the inversion of the spatial profile, you go from an harmonic trap to a quartic potential, super non-super unharmonic, to a double well potential, and to even a repulsive potential, where you can exponentially actually increase the size of the wave packing. And these are experiments that we're doing at the moment, where we actually have dynamic potential double wells that can be dynamically shaped and that. And that allows us now to explore the dynamics of a wave packet in an arbitrary potential. Last point, of course, even larger masses, and this is a sneak review, this is unpublished data. We also do magnetic levitation. We have superconductors. This is a 100-micrometer tin LED sphere. This is the mass of the Planck mass approximately that is levitated in an ultra-low temperature environment below 20 millikelvin. Environment below 20 millikelvin in an anti-Helmel configuration, and the motion is coupled to a squid. And in principle, you see this: the whole apparatus is hung on little fibers for vibration isolation, and the preliminary data is quite promising. So, we see amplitude damping times on the order of 40,000 seconds and the phasing times on the order of 80 seconds. So, I really think that this is a very promising path towards where we want to go. And here, I need to explicitly mention Joachim Hofer and the gang. Joachim Hofer and the gang and Michael Trupke, who in combination with all of them made this work. Okay, so I won't go here into the decoherence challenge. This has been told to you already by Subato and others. And I simply conclude here. And my summary is basically we have two approaches. In general, I guess we need two approaches. How to address these two questions. How small can we make a source mass? And there we need to have a top-down approach where we start with large mass. Approach where we start with large masses and go down and down and still isolate gravitational coupling. And this is what we have here with our small gold sphere. And we need a bottom-up approach where we have small nanoparticles in the quantum regime and try to go to larger and larger masses. Thanks a lot. Great stuff. Thanks, Marcus. I have lots of questions, but does anybody else want to get in before me? Get in before me? Rob, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, thanks. Very interesting talk. I just wondered: could you say a bit more when you have, I guess it's to do with the one on the right here in this picture. If I remember what you said, you're finding deviation from Newtonian gravity of about 9%. Did I get that right? No, we. We have other forces at play that we know. So we know the origin. It's not unknown. It's known and accounted for. Okay, so we understand the... So if we just fit our data without any additional assumptions, then we are missing approximately 9% to purely. So our coupling constant has a value that is 9% smaller than U.S. Smaller than Newton's constant. But we can account for that so we know where the deviations come from. For example, the mass here is on a little stick, a titanium rod. So which means there is a little hole in the mass. So which means that this is not a mass with isotropic density, but there's a little hole in there. And you have to take that into account. If you take that into account, you get a little bit smaller coupling, for example. Okay, this is one effect. For example. Okay, this is one effect. Then, well, and so on and so on. Okay. Okay. So, so sorry, misunderstood. So, let me ask it differently. So, when you take all that into account, how much in agree, like presumably you're agreeing with Newtonian theory within a certain error bar, right, or confidence level or something. Can you say what that is? Yes. You said it, I missed it. I'm sorry. No, no, no, that's fine. Sorry, no, no, no, that's that's fine, that's fine. So, basically, the um the message here is that the precision of our measurement is on the order of a percent. Okay, so we measure with a precision of 1% and the accuracy, so basically being away from Newton, is 10%. So, right now, if you were to convert that into a value for G, for Newton's constant, taking it. for g for newton's constant taking account all the system mathematics that we have our precision would be 10 to the minus um would be 10 to the minus two so one percent okay so you're measuring newton's constant to within one percent okay yeah thank you that's that's good i understand things yeah but the experiment was not optimized for doing that okay so this is just given what we had this was not one can do better if you optimize the experiment Right. And oh, Miles, yes, go ahead, Miles. Hey, Marcus. Very excited. Good to see you. Yeah, good to see you. Also, I mean, following on from Rob's question, so you see the second order term, call it 2F mod. Is that testing for the one over R dependence to some extent? That's the direct consequence of the one over R dependence. The one over r dependence. Of course, if you're asking, go ahead, sorry. So, again, in terms of putting a bound on the dependence, you know, is it one over R versus one over R to the 1.1 or something like that? So, what kind of constraints is it put on that? Yeah, no new ones. So, here Eric Edelberger's experiments are still much better because, remember, the distance between our sphere surfaces is in the order of 400 micrometers. Is in the order of 400 micrometers and Eric now measures down to 50 micrometers, so there is no new constraints. However, there are new constraints concerning those speculative scalar field fields, you know, like chameleon or symmetron, because there you also expect some sort of additional fifth force type of effects. And here, because of the smallness of the source mass, you can put Mass, you can put stronger parameter bonds. Thank you. Thanks. Great. Okay, let's move on to the next talk then. Thanks. Let's thank Marcus again and move on.
