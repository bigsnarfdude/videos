So now we have Jonathan Koh, and the next one will be Lydia. So if you can be ready as well. Okay, so the floor is yours. Hello everyone. My name is Jonathan Koh. I'm a postdoctoral researcher working in the Oshke Center for Climate Change Research at the University of Berlin. So today I'm really happy to tell you a little bit more about this project that I've been working on, which is really trying to combine elements of extreme delay theory in a machine learning algorithm to answer a pretty classical problem in plant science about temperature extreme. So, I think there's a lot of information, a lot of technical details in the poster. So, yesterday when I was making these slides, I was thinking, okay, let's talk about the motivation instead. That's funny. So, I think my motivation really stemmed from actually working with the Geography Institute, right? So, actually one day a week. So, my postdoc is primarily based in the statistics department, but one day a week I work with the group of Olivia Marxists in the Institute of Geography. And of course, we've heard a lot of these methods yesterday already about. Methods yesterday, really, about pulling out these things from the back of tricks that we have: GV, GPD, Gaussian processes, max stable processes. And I would argue that many of these methods are actually well known in a way, but at least for the most statistically inclined climatologists. But what they are also interested in is also to understand the drivers of what are driving these extreme events. And then we've heard a lot of talks also yesterday about trying to incorporate these covariates in the. Trying to incorporate these covariates in a linear fashion. And then we got a very nice talk this morning, which is trying to challenge this assumption, this linearity assumption, and trying to move away from that. Okay. And there's just, I mean, I'm just going to briefly, there are a lot of work about trying to put spine laces into trying to model the effect of, for example, this work we what we did was trying to see how the effect of the firewater index affects wildfire activity across the wildfire season. Activity across the wild five season. Okay, and then looking at extremal dependence specifically, you know, we had, um, sorry, actually, this is a dominant trends in the art birth process. This is a paper by Rafael Tom and Al. It went out of the page, but really we were also thinking about trying to put splines in the parameters of maximal process, for example. And in this example here, we actually used ENSO and month and looked at how the dependence changes over the season. Changes over the season and ENSO as well. That's all cool, but that requires us to specify a spine basis. That requires domain knowledge, the functional form. If it's a linear form, then that requires us to specify that. And my co-author Dani would say, okay, actually, we have thousands of careers, we have lots of non-linearities, a lot of interaction effects. And before he can finish his sentence, I'll say, okay, say no one, let's start this project, which is really. Let's start this project, which is really about temperature extremes. The most classical case in climate science, I would say. And Western Europe is really this region we're going to be focusing on, which has recently been identified as this increased hotspot, I mean, for heat extremes. Now, the nice thing about temperature extremes is that we have a pretty good idea of the main drivers of these extremes, right? The first thing is really to do with the global thermodynamic, which is to do with climate change. This is something actually we won't do in. This is something actually we won't do in this work, but this may be for future work. What we are actually going to do instead is we're going to be trend our data and we actually will be looking at two meter temperature surface land surface anomalies instead. What we will be focusing on here is the local land surface, which has to do with this thing, this fact that wet soil actually buffers heat. And the second thing, which I will focus more in this talk in the last two minutes, is about the In the last two minutes, is about the regional dynamic conditions, okay, which is due to the diabetic and adiabatic warming, and also this induction of warm air coming from, in this case, coming from the Sahara. Okay, and when I talk about the regional dynamic conditions, what I'm actually referring to are blocks, which are blocking, which is these regions, sorry, periods of high 500 hectopascal geopotential height anomalies. So 500 hectopascal is really what's going on at 5,000 meters. What's going on at 5,000 meters above the sea level, okay, so at the mid-troposphere, and looking at whether or not there's a high-pressure system. So this is a block. And here, this is a high-pressure system, and this is very often flanked by psychotic behavior. And this is what we call anti-psychotic behavior, so a high-pressure system sitting on top of the study region. And this is actually what caused the heat wave of 19th of July 2022, right? Where we saw in many Where we saw in many places like London, there was a record heat wave happening. So, the work here is to predict occurrence probability, intensity, and spatial dependence of these extremes. Second thing is to identify these weather patterns driving these extremes, in particular these blocking patterns. And the bonus here is to have a fully generated model for temperature extremes, given the drivers of these extremes. Just to preload, this is actually really related. My friend Danny is an expert in blocking. These are related. In blocking, these are related to different types of blocking. So you have a high-pressure system flanked by low-pressure systems, but how it looks like where it is located in the study region matters a lot. And also, so, you know, you have, I don't know if anyone's familiar with bucking here, but you have this paper by Team Williams et al., and you can refer to different types of bucket patterns in that way. And I'm just going to leave this slide here, which is for you to guess which was the correct, the truth. But this is a simulation. The truth, but these are simulations of the model. I mean, if you were paying attention, it's the top left because London is thank you.
