Thanks to Chelsea and Jason for bringing us all together. Such a beautiful place. Lots of great talks. It's been a great week so far. So I just want to start with a little bit of context so you have some idea where I'm coming from with this project. So I'm going to use just the kind of the generic term non-commutative spectral theory to mean developing and studying types of invariants of rings and algebras that extend the usual. So for us, we. We're going to think of the Zariski spectrum prime ideals of a commutative ring or algebra and try to extend that to the non-commutative case. But I'm trying to be a little generic here because maybe you like to think of C-star algebras and certain spectra there. So it can be broader than just that. But there's a lot of very classical topics in non-communitive algebra that fall under this heading. So things like your usual prime ideals. Maybe you like to study, you've thought about prime one-sided. Study, you know, you've thought about prime one-sided ideals, some flavors of localization have been geared toward this sort of thing, and even things like the spectrum of a category. So, in a sense, these are all trying to get at this very classical question, what sort of non-commutative geometric object would we like to associate to a non-commutative algebra? And for my purposes, I'm interested in what I'll call functorial spectral theory. So, this is specifically thinking about invariant. Specifically, thinking about invariants that extend the spectrum as a functor from the domain of commutative rings to the larger domain of non-commutative rings. And there's a number of reasons why I think functoriality is nice. Maybe one of the most classical ones is trying to maintain this correspondence that we all like to see in algebraic geometry. One thing that I think is maybe a little more practical is if you're trying to understand the spectrum of some algebra, at least in my experience, At least in my experience, most of these other spectra that I just passed here tend not to behave well when you restrict to, say, sub-algebras, sub-rings. Something tends to break down. So functoriality would essentially guarantee that you could look at sub-algebras and still get interesting information about the larger ones. Now, it tends to be the case that a lot of our familiar spectra aren't functorial, and I'm sorry to say it's not an accident. Accident. So I guess this is kind of an old theorem now. So it turns out if you take any functor, so let's forget about the topology and just think of the spectrum, its underlying set. Turns out any functor from not necessarily commutative rings to sets that when you restrict to the subcategory of commutative rings gives you your old spectrum, it always has to trivialize matrix algebras, at least when you're the order of the matrix algebra is at least three. At least about three. And again, the same sort of thing holds for C-star algebras if you care to think about those. Turns out that, so originally the reason that this was proved with the complex numbers first is that, to my surprise, it depended on some sort of no hidden variables theorem from quantum mechanics. But it turns out that you can replace the complex numbers by any ring. So this theorem has some sort of bizarre. Theorem has some sort of bizarre analog over the integers, and then you can sort of reduce any rate. So, this looks like bad news, and it only gets worse, unfortunately. So, you know, so this theorem is sort of taking topological spaces and forgetting, forgetting to, why did I skip so far? Forgetting to sets. There's other directions you can forget that sort of, in a sense, forget about the underlying sets. In a sense, forget about the underlying set and then try to do topology, you know, maybe just with open sets or with a category of sheaves. And it turns out that the same sort of obstruction holds for essentially the same reason when you try to forget in this other direction. And so, I mean, it's all bad news in some sense. So, the way I would interpret this is that all of these different types of objects that we're trying to use to model a non-cohetative spectrum, somehow they're too convenient. Commutative spectrum, somehow they're too commutative. They're not well suited to capture really whatever the geometry of a non-commutative Ringer algebra should be. So that leads to what I think is, well, for me, this is kind of the question I'm focused on now. So given that ordinary sets are too commutative, what should be used to play the role of sets in non-commutative geometry? Sets in non-commutative geometry. So, you know, subtract all of your geometry away from your non-commutative space. What's the non-commutative discrete object down there at the bottom? Ideally, so I would love to see this picture. So if we take our spectrum and forget all the way to sets, you know, we try to extend from rings to sets, this is bad. So the idea is let's try to embed sets into some larger category. And I would like this to be a fully faithful embedding, meaning that we don't get. A fully faithful embedding, meaning that we don't get any new morphisms between the classical sets. And then it becomes a problem of trying to extend there. But this becomes pretty hard because you're trying to sort of construct the functor and the category at the same time. So it's very slow going. So for now, here's the compromises that I'll make. So I'm definitely not solving this problem. So what I'd like to do is replace the prime spectrum with the maximal spectrum. So we're going to look at cases where it happens to be. We're going to look at cases where it happens to be a functor. And even this diagram, it's not quite going to be perfect. So it's not quite going to commute. In some sense, it'll be kind of a best approximation. I'll try to explain that if I haven't talked too much already. I've eaten up all the time. All right, so I appreciated Jason's joke about do we just add quantum in front of everything? I do literally mean quantum in this case, so I'll try to explain why. Why? So, if we're trying to fill in this picture here, all right, so we're trying to embed sets into something else. So, given that this obstruction came from quantum mechanics, I would prefer to try to think of making some progress by taking some analogy with quantum mechanics. So, in quantum mechanics, one of the weird things that happens is if you have some collection of states of your system, so I don't know, a cat that's dead or alive is kind of the famous joke, we should also allow for linear combinations of those states. Linear combinations of those states. So it's like half dead plus half alive. Again, that's the joke. So in a sense, we want to take our set and replace it by some vector space that's just spanned by the points in your set. Okay. Now we run into trouble. So if you remember, I wanted a nice embedding here. So this kind of screws up the embedding. Suddenly you've got many more maps between the linear span of these two sets than you did the ordinary sets. So we want to somehow remember the basis. To somehow remember the basis. And one of the easiest ways, I think, to do that is to treat this as a co-algebra. So I think I'm talking to the right audience here. I probably didn't really have to explain all this. But there's a co-algebra structure that basically turns every element of your distinguished basis into a group-like element. Or from this perspective, I might prefer to call it a point-like element, but I'll use group-like. So in that sense, then the set maps core. Then the set maps correspond exactly to the coalgebra maps, it turns out. And so we get a fully faithful embedding of sets into coalgebras. So essentially, for that reason, I'd like to view coalgebrases as some sort of quantization of sets. Again, the quantum meaning that we're sort of picturing these as linear combinations of points. Maybe we can't isolate individual points. And certainly others have thought of co-algebras this way. So Takeuchi. Co-algebras, this way. So Takeuchi thought of these co-algebras as some sort of discrete objects that were attached to a scheme. And then some other folks, so Kinsevich and Soybloman, had a kind of a related perspective. And Levin LeBruyne was thinking, so some of the things that I'm saying here are sort of directly related to ways he was thinking a while ago as well. So let me just give one quantum picture. So, okay, so here's a qubit. Okay, so here's a qubit. Quantum computer scientists like to think about this. So the classical bit, we have 0 and 1. The qubit, we've got all these different possible complex linear combinations of 0 and 1. So I would like to think of that as the dual co-algebra to 2 by 2 matrices. So in general, right, so rather than a bit, we've got maybe like a D-level system. So the dual co-algebra, I'm going to try to think of it as a q-dit, is what the physicists would call it. Is what the physicists would call it. So the object is something familiar. Maybe I'm just using some bizarre words to attach to it. All right. So just to try to set up how I want to think of a quantized maximal spectrum. So first let's start with the algebraically closed case. And if your algebra is finitely generated, then by the Neulstellensatz, the maximal spectrum is in correspondence with the algebra homomorphisms to your field. So it becomes a representable functor. So it becomes a representable functor. Now it turns out there's this funny enrichment of the category of algebras over co-algebras. So you can have not just a HOM set, but actually there's this Hom co-algebra between any two algebras. It's called the measuring co-algebra is construction. I'm not going to go into details. Just take my word for it. And some folks, so I found this in some papers of Marjorie Batchelor trying to view this co-algebra. This co-algebra enrichment as some sort of like a quantized collection of maps between A and B, or maybe between the non-commuted spaces that underlie them. So if we can get on board with that much, we can try to sort of quantize the morphisms from A to K now. So if you take this enriched POM, so this co-algebra maps from A to K, turns out that it gives this familiar construction. Gives this familiar construction, so it's called the finite dual coalgebra. So you just look at all quotients by ideals of finite co-dimension, take their duals, you get these co-algebras, there's some system, and you just take like a directed union, essentially. And so the classical HOMs give you the maximal spectrum. I would like to say the quantized HOMs give you some sort of quantized spectrum. So for this reason, I'll think of this functor. I'll think of this functor. So, yeah, this is easily seen to be a functor from algebras to co-algebras. And I want to think of this as some sort of quantized version of the maximal spectrum functor, at least for algebras where this is interesting. So there's plenty of algebras where this vanishes if there's no finite dimensional representations. I'm sure we all have a favorite example in mind. Mine would be the Weyl algebra. So that would just disappear. But as long as you've got enough finite dimensional representations, I'd like to argue that this is a reasonable substance. A reasonable substitute for the maximal spectrum of the algebra. Plus, it's a functor, which means it's happening. All right. So, you know, even in the commutative case, it's not, at least not clear to me right away what this thing even looks like, how it compares to the ordinary maximal spectrum. So I'll just try to say something briefly about that. So this goes, this is essentially isomorphic to this construction of Takeuchi I've mentioned before. So it turns out if you have any. I had mentioned it before. So it turns out if you have any scheme defined over a field, you can assign this co-algebra. So I've written it this way so that it looks kind of similar to this one here. So it's some directed limit. You look at, okay, what is it? Finite closed subschemes, and you're going to look at global sections, so you get some algebras, and when you dualize, you get co-algebras. I don't care too much about the actual definition. So what I care more about is what does this actually look like? So if your scheme is not So, if your scheme is nice enough, let's say x0 is the set of closed points. So, one way to think of it is you can look at all the local rings and then take the finite duals of those and then just kind of group them together. So it kind of pulverizes things pointwise. And if the fields algebraically close, you actually get a subco-algebra that just looks like this linear span of the closed points. So, whatever this thing is, those closed points fit inside of there. So, one way I would say this is that you One way I would say this is that you're sort of linearizing the set of closed points, but then you also have these kind of formal neighborhoods of each point in there as well. So it's very close to the set of closed points, but it remembers a lot. So in the case of a commutative algebra, let's say finitely generated algebra, this dual co-algebra, again, it decomposes over the maximal spectrum. So you can really see how closely related. Can really see how closely related this is to the maximal spectrum, but these things are a lot bigger than just the span of the closed points now. So, sadly, our diagram doesn't compete. So, you go this way and you get the span of the maximal spectrum. This way it sort of blew up. And this feels like a problem, but in a sense, it's kind of forced on us. So, here's one way to kind of explain how it works. kind of explain how we might think of it as being forced on it. So let's say we've got any functor from algebras to co-algebras, assuming we've sort of decided co-algebras are quantized sets. And let's say that it's going to be some sub-functor of this finite dual. Well as long as it's doing sort of the expected thing to matrix algebras, so like I said, these are kind of our Q-dits, our quantized versions of a D-level system, assuming it returns what you want, then you're forced to accept. Well, then you're forced to accept that it's going to do this to all algebra. So it's going to actually be equal to the finite dual. There's not much choice if you want that. Okay. And okay, so let me talk for a minute about this idea of having enough finite-dimensional representations. So what should it mean to have enough of them? So I'll say an algebra is fully residually finite-dimensional. If every finitely generated module is sort of Generated module is sort of close enough to finite dimensional representation. So it embeds in a big direct product, finite dimensional ones. And, okay, so I mean, I like module theory. So one way to think of this as saying that a dual is sort of interesting enough is it turns out this is equivalent to saying that it's a cogenerator in the category. So it carries some sort of module structure. So yeah, this is sort of big enough to be interesting. Be interesting. And I mean, this looks nice, it's sort of useless if we don't have examples. Fortunately, there's lots of them, so any finitely generated Ethereum PI algebra satisfies this condition, so I would say this is giving a good snapshot of like a quantized maximal spectrum for those. And in particular, all these nice quantum families of algebras at roots of unity tend to fall in the style. All right. So maybe we'll slowly. Maybe a little slower than I wanted to. So let me just quickly say: so you might ask: what about things like Merida equivalence, Merida invariance? So this idea that Merida equivalent rings give you quote-unquote isomorphic non-commutative spaces actually doesn't play very well with functorial spectral theory. So I would say that rather than that, I would look for Merida equivalent algebras to give you Merida equivalent spaces, whatever that should mean. Equivalence spaces, whatever that should mean. So in this case, it's going to be Merita-Takiuchi equivalents, which fortunately we've seen already this week. So if your algebras are linearly Merida equivalent, then sure enough, they're duals, this sort of spectrum is going to be equivalent as well. All right. So the next question, you know, for me was, how do we actually compute this thing? I wanted to sort of see at least one picture before I was. See at least one picture before I was done thinking about this. So I want to think, as I said, use this functoriality, think about sub-algebras, and try to figure out, you know, how can we compute the dual of a big algebra relative to sub-algebra. So two cases I want to mention quickly are twisted tensor products and then also relating the algebra to its center. So twisted tensor products. I don't think we've quite seen these yet this week. So a twisting map is just sort of a linear map. A twisting map is just sort of a linear map that interchanges the order of two algebras. So there's kind of the obvious tensor swath, but it can be any linear map. And under nice conditions, this gives you an algebra structure on the tensor product. So what you do is you kind of twist in the middle. So if you've got A, B, A, B, you would twist in the middle and then multiply the A's and B's. And it recovers, the reason I cared about this is it recovers lots of familiar constructions. So smash. Constructions, so smash products, OE extensions, they're all examples of this. So, you know, if you write it this way, it sort of feels like, okay, maybe I should distribute. What does this mean? Well, it turns out there's a completely dual notion of a cross-product co-algebra. So if you have a twisting map between the co-algebras, you can reverse all the arrows and form a twisted, or a cross-product of the two co-algebras, twisting. Product of the two co-algebras of twisting. So you might guess naively that this should be the case, this sort of isomorphism. Sadly, it doesn't work. So for instance, the left-hand side can often be zero. Again, if you take, let's say, two copies of polynomials and you put them together to get the Weyl algebra on the left, you're going to get zero. Whereas on the right, this is always non-zero. So this is definitely not going to work in full general. So a better guess would be to say. So, a better guess would be to say, well, okay, let's try to treat this dual as a functor, and let's try to chase through what this would mean when we can make sense of the dual of this linear map row. But it's not a homomorphism, so we kind of have to extend the domain of where this dual is acting as a functor. So maybe this is the stuff I can kind of wave my hands and plow through. So we've got categories of topological vector spaces, and then there's this nicer subgroup. And then there's this nicer subcategory where the open subspaces have finite codimension. The point is, the way I want to extend this is as a continuous dual. So it's just continuous maps from your vector space into the field, just given the discrete topology, very boring topology on the field. And in both of these categories, you can form some sort of topological tensor product. You can ask me about it later if you want the details. But the point is: okay, so first of all, the continuous dual basically plus Continuous dual basically plays nicely with these tensor products. So if you restrict to the correct subcategory, it's what's called a strong monoidal functor. So you actually get the dual of the tensor is the tensor of the duals of isomorphism. And one thing that lets you prove is the following. So start with any algebra. There's some sort of very boring topology you can put on it, such that when you take the continuous dual, let me see. Dual, let me see. Back. There we go. This continuous dual here, well, it's the same as the finite dual, and not only that, the multiplication of it gets turned right around to the co-multiplication. So it just is like a topological dual of the multiplication. So essentially, using those sorts of techniques, you can prove as long as your twisting math is continuous with respect to the correct topologies, then everything pushes through. Apologies, then everything pushes through very formally, and you get exactly the formula you want. But continuity sounds scary, so how can we turn that into something more algebraic? So one sufficient condition is when you have two sub-algebras that are big enough inside of each of them, and when you restrict to these subspaces, you're just commuting, basically. The swap map is doing something really boring. So here's a few maybe applications you could call them. Maybe applications, you could call them, of this sort of formula. So an ORI extension where you've got a finite order automorphism. It's one case where this happens. Okay, here's one that some folks in the audience might like. So you've got an H module algebra. If A is finite over the invariant subalgebra, and then the action factors through some finite-dimensional Hop algebra, then you get exactly this sort of formula out. If you've got two bi-algebras and you're trying to form like a cross-product bi-algebra, Like a cross product by algebra. As long as all of your twisting is continuous, then you could push it through. This got a little out of my wheelhouse, so I don't have great conditions, algebraic conditions on those two, but it might be something interesting to think about, what sort of algebraic conditions let you push this through. And this is actually an isomorphism of biologists, not just of biologists. All right. Very bad. All right. Let me just say very quickly: as far as the center. Quickly. As far as the center, the sort of technique that exists there is essentially looking at the azomyelocus, which has come up already. I kind of had to thicken it up to some sort of open subscheme of the spectrum. So it turns out that, okay, this dual, in the nice case, what you're doing is you're just sort of looking at the underlying co-algebra for that open subscheme and tensoring up with this matrix co-algebra. Matrix co-algebra. And then off of that, you've got some, I don't know, it's some sort of like a formal neighborhood of some closed something. So you've got some ideal here. And you're taking this limit. So maybe rather than talking about the details here, I'll just give you a particular example. So let's just put everything up there. So this is the quantum plane. And okay, so we know that if it's a twisted tensor product, it decomposes this way. I can't do this left-handed. This way. I can't do this left-handed thing. On the other hand, okay, let's say the field is algebraically closed. This Azumaya locus is pretty well known. So you can take the affine plane, you mod out by this action of this little group generated by Q in each coordinate. Again, Q is a root of unity, right? So we want a big center here. And the Azimaya locus is the complement of the This is the complement of the coordinate planes in here. So you get this sort of decomposition. So here, so here, let's cut together. So this is the case where Q is minus 1, so the order is 2. So on these coordinate axes here, we've still got sort of the old commutative ones. We get kind of this, it's like a non-commutative neighborhood here, so that's why I've put kind of these scary, ghostly things around there. Ghostly things around there. And then, off of this, what's happening is: so, under this multiplication by minus one, these four points are getting identified, but they're getting joined together into this qubit. So, this is how I would like to sort of picture what's going on on the quantum plane. Right, so it's maybe not the most interesting algebra, but it's at least a a picture that we can point at and say, hey, we can see sort of the geometry of the quantum interactivities. I have a couple more minutes. Yeah, okay, because we've got coffee, right? We don't have someone after. Okay. So let me just say a little more about maybe some questions and where I'm trying to go next. So one thing I've been wondering about, so you can write down some definition for an underlying co-algebra for a non-commutative. For a non-commutative projective space as well. I don't really know how to picture these yet, so it'd be nice to have some tools. Similar to the affine case, there's some tools that actually let us see what these coalgebras look like. Another one, so sort of thinking of the dual coalgebra in terms of representation theory. So there's some results in kind of like the setting of quiver algebras and things like that that suggest. That suggests that you should be able to construct this dual co-algebra sort of by knowing the simple modules, which are all finite-dimensional in the nice case, and something about some sort of A-infinity structure between them. Now, these results essentially describe that in kind of the Merida invariant way. So, if you kind of pass by Merida equivalence to something else, then you can sort of understand it. I'd like to understand it without the step of passing to Merida. out the step of passing to Merida equivalents, so this kind of Merida variance philosophy, it'd be nice to understand how that works. But let me just say a little more about kind of the bigger question. So back to the original picture. This kind of dream diagram. Alright, so based on what we've learned, you know, it doesn't seem like you can really It doesn't seem like you can really extend this idea directly. We can't form dual co-algebras, for instance, if we're dealing with rings in general. So, if you don't have a field in sight, nothing like a dual co-algebra seems to make sense because you don't have a field to take a dual with respect to. But I'm trying to be a little bit stubborn and think maybe there's something else we can do. So, let's go back to this motivation in terms of the map. Motivation in terms of the maximal spectrum is being representable. That's kind of where things started here, right? So it's representable to HOM into the base field. So in some sense, for commutative rings, you can say, you know, spec is kind of, I don't know, quasi-representable. So if you look at homomorphisms into all possible fields, the kernels are the prime ideas. But there's not really one fixed field that does it for you. And it turns out amazingly that if. And it turns out amazingly that if you step outside the category of commutative rings, you can sort of force it to become a representable functor. So these are some weird objects that we have to pass to. So apparently this is an old definition. I had not heard of it until a few years ago. So a hypergroup is something like a group, but the operation is now not single-valued, but multi-valued. So you multiply two elements, you get a whole non-empty subset. And you've got, you know, axioms that look And you've got axioms that look like the group axioms. So, for instance, just to see what gets complicated, so this equality in the associative law, this is an equality of sets, because when I multiply y and z, I get a set, and I have to multiply every element there by x, and I get a union of sets. So it gets really bizarre, really quick. So a hyperring is something where the multiplication is single-valued, but the addition now is multi-valued, and you've got some sort of distributive law. And you've got some sort of distributive law. Morphisms now become more complicated, so it should preserve a multiplication, but in addition, we've got kind of like this sub-additivity. So what are some examples? So if you've got, let's even say like a commutative ring and a subgroup of the units, and you mod out, this would be a ridiculous thing to do for ordinary rings, but turns out you actually get a hyperring. And the one example that I care most about right now, it's called the Krasner hyper. Most about right now. It's called the Krasner hyperfield, maybe the easiest example. So you multiply 0 and 1 as you expect. 0 is still an additive identity, but 1 plus 1 is the full set, 0 and 1. Why is this special? Well, it turns out that this represents spec, if you step to this larger category, hyperring. So it's kind of like this Uber field in some sense. And so what I would like to think is: all right, so if this is our order. Alright, so if this is our ordinary spec, can we play a similar game where maybe we think of some dual or enriched POM from R to K, and would that serve as a nice non-commutative spectrum? It's much easier said than done. So something I'm thinking about right now with one of my grad students, just really starting at the beginning. So how can we even think about these additive hypergroups as something like a category similar to abelian groups? You've got tensor products, internal homology. Got tensor products, internal HOMs. We can start to start thinking about some of these fancier constructions. Sadly, there's not been enough category theory done here, so that's something I've been thinking about these days. So if you see me talking about weird things in the near future, this is why. All right, that's all. Thank you. If you go back to your last slide, what are we missing? Why do you say app-light? So, for instance, in app, In app, HOM between two abelian groups is an abelian group. So you've got this enrichment over itself. For these commutative hypergroups, it seems like no matter how nice you make them, HOM between them, there's something that acts like a hyper addition, but it never satisfies the associative property. So it's not enriched over itself. So in a sense, right now what we're thinking is we're trying to step outside and find some sort of category that really it's a closed monopoly. Category that it really is a closed monoidal category. That's one thing that we're looking for. So the ordinary category does not satisfy this. You have to either go up or down. So we're trying to find the right place to do this. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Sunder. What's the difference? Is it like a Bruinian hyper ring? It looks a little like a semi-ring, but it's. So, yeah, so if you want to put them together, there is a theory of what is it, like hyper-semi-arays. So, that would, yeah, so the additive structure, I guess, is multi-valued, but not necessarily with inverses in any sense. So, that's kind of, yeah, certainly people have thought about that sort of thing. So, yeah, these Boolean semi-fields as well as hyperfields, you could fit them both in that. But if you just look through semi-groups, it's not representable or. Representable order? Oh, oh, you're asking about this one here. I don't know about semi-rings. That's a good question. So, this works for commutative hyperrings, even. I don't know about semi-rings. Oh, yeah, this is the sort of thing I don't know. So, I mean, this is something that I'm sure folks have studied in the Hopf algebra literature. I don't really quite cover. Literature. I don't really quite come from that background. Somebody knows nothing. Related to OSL. Yeah, right? The completion of OSL to make the word. Something like that. Yeah. We were talking about that. Yeah, I guess. That sounds right. Sounds believable. We'll save further questions over coffee. Thanks. Thanks, Matt. And welcome back. I'll go back in to have a look at the colour.
