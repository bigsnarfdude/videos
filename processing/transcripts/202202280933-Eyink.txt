Me. So, I'm going to present work with a number of collaborators who are all listed here. And I'm going to begin this talk with a quote from Feynman. This is actually from his undergraduate lectures. So in the very beginning of that book, the first volume, he says that matter is made of atoms. And he says, if some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed and only one sentence passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? And he said, I believe it is the Words. And he says, I believe it is the atomic hypothesis that all things are made of atoms, little particles that move around in perpetual motion. He says, in that one sentence, you will see there is an enormous amount of information about the world if just a little imagination and thinking are applied. Okay, so we're going to try to follow here Feynman's dictum to understand the consequences of the fact that matter is made of atoms for fluid turbulence. Okay, so now we can do better than. Okay, so now we can do better than Feynman's little cartoon picture that he drew for his undergraduates. This is actually a picture of water molecules taken on a substrate. We still can't do this in native liquid water. That's too hard. But it shows sort of the scale of the system. So you can see here marked over here, five nanometers. So the water molecules themselves have a radius of about 0.3 nanometers. So you can get some idea of the scale. And we also know. Scale. And we also know more about the system than just that it's made of atoms. We also have some knowledge from statistical mechanics. So there's the idea that every system that is described by hydrodynamics is in a system, is in a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium. And local equilibrium tells us a lot about the microscopic statistics of the particles. So here is the result from Ruel's book on statistical mechanics. On statistical mechanics, where he gives the distribution of both the positions and the momenta of the particles. What I want to focus on here is that circled equation. This is the distribution of the momenta. And it's very simple. It just factorizes into independent Gaussians, independent Maxwellians for the individual molecules. Now, this has a very simple consequence when you look at what's actually measured in any fluid experiment. You're always Fluid experiment. You're always measuring the velocity of the molecules coarse-grained over some scale of size L, which gives the space resolution of the observation. And so I just represent that here by this coarse-graining average with respect to this kernel that just locally averages all those velocities of the individual molecules. Well, when this L is sufficiently big, much larger than the inter-particle spacing, this sum is very large, and you have a central limit theorem. And you have a central limit theorem and a law of large numbers. And you know the statistics of that coarse-grained average is just going to be Gaussian to a very good approximation. And this is the formula for it right here. You also have to stay at life scales much smaller than the gradient length of the system because you don't want the, for example, the mean velocity or the temperature to be varying over the scale that you're averaging. So that sets the constraints on this coarse-graining average to get this result. Average to get this result. The variance in this Gaussian is very simple. It just comes from the central limit theorem. So if I take KBT divided by M, that's the RMS velocity of the individual molecules. Then I divide by NL cubed, that's the number of molecules in that coarse graining volume. And that gives that variance. But we can also get this from an effective spectrum, a spectrum of those thermal fluctuations. So if we want. Fluctuations. So, if we want to get that, we can then integrate this spectrum with respect to this coarse-graining kernel squared. And we know what that spectrum has to look like in order to recover this result. It's got to go like k squared. And if we want to get the pre-factors correctly, we can see that it has to be kBT over rho times k squared. So, this is quite well known. You can get the precise numerical factors by assuming energy equipartition. By assuming energy equipartition of the Fourier modes and just counting up the number of Fourier modes. Here, I'm ignoring energy and sound waves for this accounting. Otherwise, there's a factor of three halves that appears here. And of course, those thermal flux, I mean, molecules don't know whether they're in a sound wave or not. But I'm going to ignore those because there are theoretical arguments that say that for the dynamics, the incompressible modes at low Mach number become decoupled. Modes at low Mach number become decoupled from the sound waves. And so I'm only looking here at the energy in the incompressible fluid modes, the solenoidal ones. And of course, this is extremely well known. This is a result that goes back at least to T. D. Lee and Hopf in the 1950s, even earlier to Bergers in the 1920s. So this is a quite well-known result. And it's true for any fluid. It doesn't have anything particularly to do with turbulence. Well, what I want to discuss here is what are the consequences. Discuss here is what are the consequences of this for the turbulent flow? Sorry, I was muted in the moment. Okay, so let me just say what the standard picture of the turbid energy spectrum is. Of course, we have an inertial range with something like a five-thirds, and then this begins to bend down in what's called the near dissipation range. So, this is usually typically before you get to the Kolmogorov scale, and then after the Kolmogorov scale. Scale. And then after the Kolmogorov scale, it's believed typically that you go into an exponentially decaying spectrum, the so-called far dissipation range. But of course, we know that there is this thermal equilibrium spectrum, this thermal floor. And if you plot that in this diagram, what you see is that it looks like this. And it crosses very close to the Komogorov scale. And again, a moment's thought will say that. Moment's thought will say that that has to be the case because if the turbulent fluctuations are decaying exponentially quickly, it doesn't take you long to hit that thermal floor. And so very close to the Komogurov scale, you actually should hit this k squared spectrum. Okay, now the origin of this, I'll just emphasize again, the origin of that k squared, it might seem a priori, odd. Why does the energy start going up? Well, it's because the individual water molecules have huge velocity. Water molecules have huge velocities. They're moving close to the speed of sound in water. That means about one and a half kilometers per second. And as you start averaging over smaller and smaller length scales, those large fluctuations through the central limit theorem start to become apparent. And that's the origin of this rapidly rising spectrum. Okay, so one can actually see exactly where this crossover happens simply by matching an assumed exponential decay with the thermal spectrum, and you get this condition. Spectrum, and you get this condition, which can actually be solved here in terms of a Lambert W function. The important point is that because of this rapid exponential decay, this crossover is always going to happen at just slightly bigger than the Kolmogorov scale. So here I'm giving the parameters for a water experiment in France, the von Kármán experiment, W et al. in 2018, where the Kolmogorov scale is like 16 microns. Scale is like 16 microns, and theta k is very tiny, about 10 to the minus seven. But nevertheless, because of this rapid exponential decay, you see that this crossover happens in wave number at only 10 times the Kolmogorov scale. And if you go back to physical space and you say what that length scale is, you see that it's only very slightly less than the Kolmogorov scale of 16 microns. Okay, so as you would expect, this crossover happens right around the Kolmogorov scale. Kolmogorov scale. Good news is that crossover is still much, much larger than the mean free path of water and the inter-particle separation in water, which means that a hydrodynamic description of this should still be possible. So I should mention that this picture of this K squared is actually quite old. It goes back to work of Robert Bechov already in a JFM article in 1957, but his considerations have been largely ignored. Generations have been largely ignored and then recently revived by myself and my collaborators in some works that are listed here. So, once you accept that you have this k-squared spectrum, you have to ask, well, how do you describe the flow? And there's a well-known set of equations, the Landel Lifshitz fluctuating hydrodynamic equations, that are designed to treat this problem and to capture those thermal fluctuations. And they correspond to take. And they correspond to taking the Navier-Stokes equation and adding an additional fluctuating stress governed by a fluctuation-dissipation relation. It should be emphasized that these equations are not stochastic PDEs. They're often presented that way, but in fact, they always are understood to have an effective high wave number cutoff. The viscosity that appears in those equations is known to be dependent on the cutoff. Okay, so you have to project. Okay, so you have to project with this projector onto the modes less than the cutoff. This is not a real white noise in space, it's a projected white noise, so you don't have a real distributional spatial distribution here. And then you have to adjust the viscosity in these equations in order to get predictions that are independent of the cutoff. Okay, and so it is believed that as long as you can assume, you can choose this cutoff wave number. Can choose this cutoff wave number so that there's some wave number lying between the gradient length of the flow and the mean free path of the system. As long as this separation exists, then these equations should be valid for all inverse lambda, all those length scales between those two limits. Okay, so there's if you want to read more about this, you can look at the textbook of Zerati and Sanger's. And in particular, for the low Mach number limit, there's a nice paper of Donav et al. that treats the low Mach number. At all, that treats the low-mach number limit of the compressible equation to derive these. Okay, so I should emphasize that there are no experiments validating Navius-Stokes at and below the Kolmogorov scale. So the traditional picture of the exponential decaying spectrum is pure hypothesis. It's never been tested in any experiment. We also cannot test the ideas of Bechov and ourselves either experimentally. This is outside the scope of any current experiment. Is outside the scope of any current experimental technique. But you can now, with our modern computing resources, run a numerical simulation. And this has now been done with the fluctuating hydrodynamics that I just discussed, and also by something called direct simulation Monte Carlo, which is a species, a kind of molecular dynamics methods. So both of these works confirm the prediction of Bachov. So here I'm showing the work first on the left of John Bell and Clabras with fluctuating height. John Bell and collaborators with fluctuating hydrodynamics. This is for a water-glycerol mixture. It's a liquid. It's basically a cup of water, about five centimeters on a side, room temperature, with a nice, you know, decent forcing. I mean, similar to that in the upper ocean mixing layer. So it's a reasonable turbident flow. And what you see is that, indeed, the deterministic equation exhibits the usual decay, but this the one Usual decay, but this the one with the thermal forcing is this red curve, and it rapidly transitions to the predicted spectrum of thermal fluctuations, which is that green line, which is essentially indistinguishable from the simulation result itself. This is not specific to a liquid. It's also seen in the gas simulation of McMullen et al. And so this is a very, quite universal thing. There's a little bit of fudge in both in their work. Fudge in both their work, in the sense that in DSMC, the molecules really represent agglomerates of molecules. So that's this parameter F, which is representing the effective number of molecules that is represented by a single DSM-C molecule. And so they have to extrapolate to get the physical result of F equals one from their direct results. But again, it's in agreement with the expectations. Agreement with the expectations. Okay, so the conclusion of this numerical work is that the dissipation range of turbulence in molecular fluids, physical fluids, is not accurately described by the deterministic Navier-Stokes equations. Already it scales right at the Kolmogorov scale. In fact, here, you can see this is in the simulation of John Bell. This vertical line here represents where the Komogorov scale is, and the thermal fluctuations even appear slightly larger than that. Even appear slightly larger than that. Okay, so I just want to say that there are lots of arguments, mathematical proofs in the literature for validity of deterministic Navier-Stokes. And so it's worth asking what's wrong with those arguments? Why are they not working here? And so there's a scaling symmetry of the Navier-Stokes equation where if you make the velocity smaller by lambda, you simultaneously make length scales larger, you increase the size of the flow, and you look at long. Flow and you and look at longer times, this leaves the Navier-Stokes equation invariant. And this scaling is the basis of all the rigorous derivations of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equation. For example, from Boltzmann equation, the work of Bardus et al., or from stochastic lattice gases by Kwastel and Yao in 98. If you apply those arguments to a turbudent flow, then indeed you see that things scale as they should. I mean, the energy dissipation gets very weak. The velocities at the Kolmogorov. Very weak, the velocities at the Komogorov scale get weak, the length of the Komogorov length scale gets bigger. And with that combination, the thermal noise effect, this lambda, this theta k, which measures the strength of the thermal fluctuations relative to the energy of a Kolmogorov scale eddy, gets tinier. And the thermal noise should vanish. And that's a, so those proofs still work in principle, but it turns out that this lambda is just unattainably large. And that's because of that rapid drop-off in the spectrum. Drop off in the spectrum. So, if you go back and you look at the solution of this equation, you say, Well, suppose I wanted to double the scale where this crossover happens. Well, in order to double it, you have to satisfy this relation. And if you go back to the water experiment of Debiaol and you say, what would be required simply to double the wave number where deterministic Navier-Stokes equation is valid, it would require the system to be 145,000 times larger. So, effectively, what this is telling us is you can never. This is telling us you can never get a far dissipation range with an exponentially decaying energy spectrum in nature. It's just a virtual reality construct. You can see it in numerical simulations, but always you're going to see a thermal equipartition spectrum in practice. Okay, so then the question becomes, what are the consequences of this? What does it matter for any turbident fluid process? And so I'm going to consider here the problem. Uh, the problem particularly of the Bachelor-Creicnon theory of high-schmid turbulent mixing. Um, so uh, this, as many people here know, is the problem of a scalar advection with diffusion. You're looking at the case where the Schmidt number is very large, the ratio of viscosity to diffusivity. And in this regime, a very high Schmidt number, there's an important range below the Kolmogorov scale. So, I took this figure here from a recent review article of Srinivasan, which sort of shows the standard. Srinivasan, which sort of shows the standard picture of turbulent mixing. And the high Schmidt case, so this red curve is the energy spectrum. And then at high Schmidt number, you get this regime below the Kolmogorov scale. This is all happening below the Kolmogorov scale, where you get this one over K spectrum and a flux, which I'm going to call here chi, of scalar driven, you know, injected from the large scale, scalar fluctuations, down to this bachelor's scale. Down to this bachelor scale where it's dissipated. This is the so-called diffusive scale. So, the important point is that the bachelor length determined by the strain rate, which is driving this cascade from the Kolmogorov scale, that's what I'm calling gamma, that bachelor scale is given by this formula, diffusivity divided by that straining rate to the one-half. It's actually smaller than the Kolmogorov scale by a factor of the square root of the Schmidt number. So, for a very high Schmidt number, you have this whole range. Schmidt number, you have this whole range which is predicted below the bachelor scale, where you have this important cascade phenomenon. This has achieved a kind of iconic status in turbudence theory. This is a quote from Creightman, a rare thing in turbulence theory, where you can get exact results. And in fact, Jacob Bedrosian and his collaborators have recently rigorously derived this one over K spectrum for a 2D Navier-Stokes solution with a passive scalar. With a passive scalar. So it's achieved quite an iconic status. And Batchelor and Creignan derive many specific results, but among other things, they derive predictions for the concentration spectrum. Both of them give this one over K in the so-called viscous convective range. And the predictions of the two theories differed primarily in the so-called viscous diffusive range below the Batchelor scale, where Batchelor predicted a Gaussian. Batcher predicted a Gaussian decay and Cretan predicted an exponential. Okay, so these predictions are reasonably well confirmed by numerical simulations and experiment. This is the most recent experiment of which I'm aware by Iwano et al., where they see indecent one over K. But in experiments, and there are other experiments that are listed here, but in experiments, nobody can resolve below the bachelor scale. Below the bachelor scale. So, in fact, Iwano et al.'s recent result does the best, but you can see here that the bachelor scale, which is indicated by these vertical dashed lines, already you're starting to see noise in the measurements here. And so you cannot resolve anything below those length scales. So the confirmation of the predictions in the viscous diffusive range have been completely by numerical simulations. And here's a whole set of such experiments that are listed. I'm showing here the result of GoToEt all in. The result of GoToETAL in 2014 simply because it's not the most recent, but it nicely illustrates the validity of Kreichnan's theory in the numerical simulation. So you can see the predict, I mean, the numerical simulation in red and Kreiknan's prediction in green is very, very close, not only in the inertial convective, but all the way down through the viscous diffusive range. Okay, so according to numerical simulations, Crichton's theory is in fact working quite well. However, However, we believe that when you put in thermal noise, that's not the case at all. So, in the real world, when you have thermal noise, we recently worked out what the effects are in this preprint. This is with my postdoc Amir Jafari. And the prediction that we come up with is that you can see here the Daesh green line is Kreiknan's prediction. And we say, no, in fact, what happens when you put the thermal noise in is that you get a k to the minus. You get a k to the minus two instead. And it happens right below the batchless scale. So it's very similar to the picture for the Navier-Stokes: you don't have much of an extended range below the Batchelor scale at all. Almost immediately after that, you go to this k to the minus two, and then eventually to a k squared. So I should say that we can do this analytically. So according to the tradition of this problem, you can get exact analytical results. We have an analytical formula that we can work out for the spectrum. That we can work out for the spectrum in terms of great, you've been going for 20 minutes now. Okay, so I'm going to try to wrap up pretty soon. So, yeah, okay, five minutes. And so the physical origin of this effect are these are so-called giant concentration fluctuations. They've been well observed in laminar fluids. And I'll just give a quote here from the important paper. The important paper of Alatti and Giglio that observed these in free diffusion processes in laminar flow, where they said that the order of magnitude increase in the fluctuations above the equilibrium value, the most prominent feature that can be captured experimentally, is to be expected for any non-equilibrium fluid that has macroscopic concentration variations comparable to those in this experiment. So, in fact, from those considerations, it's not surprising from our point of view that this should be observed also in a turbulent. This should be observed also in a turbid flow, and that's what we find in our analytical work. So, in the remaining time, I'm just going to try to very, very quickly go through and discuss the way that we derive these predictions. So, the starting point is the fluctuating hydrodynamics of a binary fluid mixture. So these are rather well known. I wrote down these equations here. Again, these are not stochastic PDEs. These are effective low-wave number theories with a cutoff. Cut off. The first step is that we linearize around the turbid Navier-Stokes solution. So we take the Navier-Stokes solution, we linearize around that by dropping the term that involves the fluctuation, the thermal fluctuation squared. It's easy to do an order of magnitude estimate of that term and see that it's negligible. In fact, when you estimate that, what you find is that it depends on this ratio here. And whenever L is much bigger than the inner. L is much bigger than the inner particle separation cubed divided by the mean free pass squared. This thing is always small. And that means that, for example, in a gas, like in a typical gas, a Boltzmann gas kinetic theory limit, this inter-particle separation is much longer than the mean free path, according to the standard Bolgieu above-grad limit. And so that means that this length scale is, I mean, this coupling is very weak all the way down to the smallest scale where. Way down to the smallest scale where the fluctuating hydrodynamic equations are valid at all. So it's very reasonable to drop that term. We can, however, make analytical progress using the Navier-Stokes solution. So what we do is we do exactly what Kreiknan did, and we replace the Navier-Stokes solution with a white noise induction. So exactly the same model that Kreichnan did. That then leads to this Stratanovich set of equations for the problem. And then we have to consider the Heischmidt asymptotic. Have to consider the high Schmidt asymptotic limit, where we can borrow heavily from prior work of Donify and Vandenijen, who considered in laminar flow this Heischmidt asymptotic limit, which says that we should scale viscosity to be large, diffusivity to be small. We look at long times, and then crucially, we have to decide about the scaling of the turbulence term, but that's fixed by requiring that we should have a fixed amount of energy dissipation on the long macroscopic time. So that fixes this scaling. Is this scaling? When we put all those scalings into the equations, we get these, and then we consider those in the small epsilon limit. I'm not going to discuss the formal asymptotics, but you can more or less see what's happening just by looking here. These are the biggest terms in the velocity equation. So to leading order, the thermal fluctuations in the turbulent flow in the dissipation range satisfy exactly the same equations that you satisfy in a fluid in thermal equilibrium at rest, in a glass of water at rest. At rest, in a glass of water at rest. And then this term, which appears in the advection equation, becomes slave to the fluctuations at long time. So you just get an also, as you can see here from the rapid variation, you get a white noise advection problem. And the spatial variation is just obtained by the slaving of those fluctuations through the Stokes operator to the thermal fluctuations, which gives you this covariance. The important point is that in this limit, you just point is that in this limit, you just get back a Kreitmann model. Okay, so this entire model then becomes a white noise induction problem. And of course, we have many, many mathematical tools for then solving this problem. And that's what we went ahead and did. So I don't have time to go into even much of the details here. When you convert from Stratonovich to Edo, I just want to note that you get effective new renormalized diffusivities out. One of them is the turbident eddy diffusivity. There's also, however, a thermal. There's also, however, a thermally renormalized diffusivity. This was the focus of the work of Donovital in their 2014 paper. The important point is that this theory recovers the well-known Stokes-Einstein relation for diffusion in liquids, which has been known for many, many years to be a reasonable result and also many corrections and extensions and so forth as well. But going back to Ansat in the 1940s. Okay, so I'm just going to stop there. Going to stop there and say my conclusions and say thanks for inviting me to present the results. Thank you very much for a very interesting talk. I'm sure there will be questions. Any questions?
