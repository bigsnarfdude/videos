We continue with a talk by Gipliana Angel from the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy, and she will talk about non-local coefficients in the heat asymptotics for real powers of Laplacians. Floor is yours, Vienna. Thank you very much. So, first of all, I would like to thank the organizers for this very nice and unique event and for the opportunity to give a talk here. Opportunity to give a talk here. So, I want to start with the unexpected guest of my talk, which is the zeta epstein function. We define it in the following way. So, zeta n of s is sum over k1 kn in z power n without zero from k1 squared plus k2 squared plus dot dot dot kn squared, everything power minus s. So we can rewrite it as sum over k in n star from k power minus s times r n of k. minus s times rn of k, where rn of k is the number of representations of k as of as a sum of n squares. And an easy remark, zeta 1 of s is just 2 times zeta of 2s, where zeta here is just the usual Riemann zeta function. And one can prove with the same methods as for zeta that zeta n is absolutely convergent for real part of s greater than n over 2. And it extends meromorphically to C. And it extends meromorphically to C with trivial zeros at s equal to minus one, minus two, and so on. And the important fact for what I'm going to talk about is that the only zeros in the negative part, in the negative real line, occur here in minus one, minus two, and so on. And this is due to the functional equation that it verifies. And now that I have your attention, we can go to the geometric part. So let's set up the content. So let's set up the context. We start with a compact-oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension n, and we consider the Laplacian, d star d acting on C-infinity functions on M with values in C. And we are interested in the heat kernel of delta. We will denote it from now on by Pt. And in the next minutes, I want to introduce it briefly. So we have this theorem, which is based on pseudo-differential. Which is based on a pseudo-differential operator theory, that since M is compact and delta is self-adjoint, the spectrum of delta is discrete and it increases towards infinity. And moreover, we can find the basis of C infinity functions phi j such that delta is diagonal somehow in that basis. So delta phi j is equal to lambda j phi j. And now it's easy for us to define the heat operator, which is denoted by which is denoted by e power minus t delta, we define it on the basis. So e power minus t delta applied on a phi j is equal to e power minus t lambda j phi j. So we have the heat operator and it is actually an integral operator, meaning that when we apply it on a function f and we look in a point x, this is equal to integral over our manifold m from this pt of x and y, which This PT of x and y, which is the Waltz kernel, f of y dy. So, this P T here is the heat kernel that we are going to discuss about. And two easy remarks. P is a C infinity function on zero infinity times M times M with values in C. And it verifies the heat equation, meaning that partial T plus the Laplacian in X applied to Pt of X and Y is equal to zero. And y is equal to zero, and we have this initial condition that limit when t goes to zero from e power minus t delta applied on f is equal to f. This happens in zero norm. And I forgot to write here that this happens for any C infinity function f. And we have this very important theorem due to Minaxi-Sundaram and Plegel. I will state it directly on the diagonal because this is what I need. So the heat kernel PT has the following. So the heat kernel P T has the following small time asymptotic along the diagonal. P T of x and x is asymptotic to t power minus n over 2, sum from j equal to 0 to infinity from t power j and some coefficients a j of x and x, which are seen fittingly functions on m. And furthermore, we know the first term, a0 of x and x is equal to 1. And actually, those coefficients aj are related by a recurrent Are related by a recurrent formula. And so, what is this sign here exactly meaning? It means that if we truncate the sum until order big n and we take the difference, this is of order t power n plus 1 minus the dimension over 2. And it actually is something stronger than this because it remains true. If we take k derivatives in t here, the estimate remains. The estimate remains true if we put here minus k. Okay, so we have this asymptotic, and we want to talk about these coefficients here, what's the thing about them. And the fact is that AJ's depend only on the metric G and its derivatives, meaning that they are local. So, what is this exactly? It means that if this is our manifold M and we modify the metric in this red part, This red part. If we are looking in a point x away from the red part, aj of x and x remains the same. I already said that a0 is equal to 1, and a1 is related with the scalar curvature on the manifold. What is the motivation to study this object? Well, first of all, these asymptotics give a proof with heat kernel tools for the Atti Act-Zinger index theorem. And second, it gives And second, it gives a proof for the Weiss law. So it's a very nice result. And what we can do now, we move towards the new part. We studied a new operator, e power minus t delta power r, where r is a real number between zero and one, which is defined in a similar way. We define it on the basis as e power minus t delta power r on a phi j from the basis is equal to the phase. phi j from the basis is equal to e power minus t lambda j r phi j and we take the schwarz kernel of this operator and we we can ask how does the asymptotic the small asymptotic of this look like what can we say about the coefficients and the asymptotic is a bit more difficult it depends on the parity of the dimension n and it depends if this r here the power is rational or irrational but i will Or irrational, but I will state here the easiest case. So if n is even, the small time asymptotic of ht along the diagonal is the following. So h t of x and x is asymptotic to, we have this sum here, a finite sum from j equal to 0 to n over 2 from these ugly powers of t times some coefficients b of x, plus an infinite sum from j equal to 1 to infinity. equal to one to infinity and very important our j is not natural we don't have these coefficients in this in this sum from integer powers t power j a j of x and we want to find things about these coefficients here and for b the answer is quite easy because you when we when we compute them explicitly this coefficient b minus n minus 2j over 2r of x is actually something Of x is actually something times aj of x and x, where this was the coefficient from the heat kernel. So obviously it is local. But it remains the question, what happens with the aj? Are they also local? And before giving the idea of the proof for that, I want to say the motivation. Why should we look at this object, this strange operator here? Well, Ber and Morojano studied the Schwartz kernel of the. Moriano studied the Schwartz kernel of the operator e power minus t delta one over m for m in m star for a strictly positive self-adjoint generalized laplacian. So what we do here is a is a small generalization of that. I probably forgot to say that everything that I said until now holds true for a generalized Laplacian, which is non-negative, acting on the sections of a vector button. And the second And the second motivation is that Dussermat and Willemin studied E power minus Tp, where P is a positive elliptic self-adjoint pseudo-differential operator of positive order. So when we apply their theorem for the special case when P is a real power of a Laplacian, we get the vanishing of many of their terms. And the idea of how to connect the two objects, so we have here the heat operator. So we have here the heat operator, e power minus t delta, and its Schwarzkernel Pt. And in the right part, we have the new operator, E power minus T delta R with R in 0, 1, and its Schwarzkernel H T. And we would like to connect their asymptotics. And we actually can do this using Melin and inverse Meline formulas. And we connect them with the complex powers of Laplacians. So delta power S with the S complex. s with the s complex and let's denote by qs the schwarz kernel of delta power s and remember that we are interested in these coefficients here now a j of x and actually when we compute them we have this formula a j of x and x is minus one power j over j factorial times q r j of x and x and remember that rj is not natural so here again Natural. So here again, QRJ is the Schwarzkernel of delta power Rj. And we want to prove that these coefficients are not local. And the strategy to do that is that for each dimension and, we have to give a manifold and a Laplacian such that this coefficient here, Qrj of X and X, is not local. And I want to give the example for the one dimension. And after that, we will see that it continues. It continues very well. So for the one-dimensional case, we just take S1 as R factorized by 2Ï€z with the usual metric G equal to d theta squared and the Laplacian given by this metric. Then for real part of S greater than 1 over 2, by a simple computation, Q minus S of this Laplacian delta in a point theta theta is theta theta is exactly one over pi zeta into s, where this zeta here is the usual Riemann zeta function. And since the right-hand side has a Meromorphic extension to the whole complex plane, actually this equality holds everywhere for any complex S. And remember that we are interested in S, so we are interested in QRJ. So in our case, S is minus Rj, and we want it to be not net. Want it to be not natural. We are in this setup. And what we do in order to prove that this is not local, we modify the metric on S1, but just locally, in an open set. For example, we add there a bound function in the metric or something like that. And let's say that we obtain a new metric, G tilde, and we take its correspondent Laplacian, delta tilde. And again, by somehow simple computations, Q minus S delta. Q minus S delta tilde in theta theta will have this formula, p power 2s 2s minus 1 over pi zeta into s, where this p, so the length of the new circle, the modified circle, is 2 pi p. This is this p here. And we would like to compare these two quantities. We would like actually to cross this zeta of 2s out such that they are different and we are done. And we are done. But can we do that? So we have to verify that it is not zero. And zeta in 2s is equal to 0 if and only if 2s is minus 2, minus 4, and so on, which is equivalent for s to be in minus 1, minus 2, and so on. But that is not our case, since in our case, s is negative, but it is not an integer. This means that zeta of 2s is non-zero, so we can cross it out, and we modify the metric locally in a small way. Modify the metric locally in a small spot and it changed everywhere. So these coefficients are not local. And the general case, we just take S1, product S1, product S1, n times. And the funny part is that here, instead of zeta of 2s in those two coefficients, we have the same type of computations. We get what I started with, namely the zeta epstein function. And again, since that doesn't have zeros beside this in the negative Besides this, in the negative part, everything works fine. And this was it. Thank you. So thank you very much, Cipriana, for your talk. Are there any questions, comments? Okay, David? Hello, Sipriana. Very, very nice talk. Thank you. As you may have known from talking. As you may have known from talking to Josef, there is a very similar phenomenon with potentially non-local coefficients in the heat expansion of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator, which is sort of a perturbation of the square root of the Laplacian on the boundary, which is a closed manifold. Might this work? We know the heat expansion, but we don't know whether the coefficients are local or not. Do you think this method maybe has promise for that problem? It might be a good thing to think about. Think about it, yeah. It's a very nice question. It might work, yeah. Why not? Cool. One can try to do it, and probably, hopefully, maybe I recommend giving it a shot. Okay. Thank you. Any more questions or comments? Hi. Can you say a little bit? You said you were showing us the simplest case. Can you say anything about? Can you say anything about just giving us a sense of what gets more complicated? For example, I think you showed us n even. So, what about n odd or? Okay, yes, I can give you the worst case. So the idea is that if n is odd and the power r is rational with the denominator even, so if r is alpha over beta and beta is even, that's the worst case, let's say, because we also have. Case, let's say, because we also have, we don't have just powers of t, we also get some logarithmic terms. But the idea is that always we can, a lot of the coefficients can be related to the coefficients from the heat kernel, and those who can't are actually non-local exactly using this method. Okay. So, this kind of example still works for those worst cases? Yes, yes, it works. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so then we thank Chiprian again.
