Thank you. Thank you very much for the invitation to give a talk. And thanks to the organizers for setting up this nice event. So I'm going to present this Geist Story Dynamical System. This is joint work with Gheorghe Krachun and Laura Abrustenga Imoti. So for the motivation, I would like to start by saying I would like to start by saying that in general, non-linear dynamical systems are present everywhere, so they have many applications in biology, in medicine. So, for instance, in the study of infectious diseases, in the dynamics of concentrations in biochemical reaction networks, or in the dynamics of populations for species that interact in an ecosystem. And usually, explicit solutions to non-linear dynamical systems are impossible to find. Dynamical systems are impossible to find. Thus, inspired by Poincar√©, mathematicians tried to focus on qualitative aspects of nonlinear dynamical systems. But the qualitative questions turned out to be quite as challenging. And for instance, you can see the second part of Hilbert 60's problem. This is still an This is still an open problem. It's about polynomial differential equations in the real plane. And even for the quadratic case, we don't know much about it. And its history is quite dramatic. Also, here in a paper by Lyashenko, you can read about how it evolved the research in this problem. And And moreover, qualitative behaviors of non-linear dynamical systems can be also quite, can exhibit quite wide variety of properties. For instance, we can have uniqueness and stability of the steady states. We can have b-stability, multi-stationarity here in the middle, or oscillations, like in the picture here in the right, picture C. Victor C. Or we can even encounter chaotic behavior. For instance, just take the Lorentz systems and think about the butterfly effect. And these are just quadratic dynamical systems in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. And in this talk, we will focus on a large, relatively large class of nonlinear dynamical. Class of nonlinear dynamical systems, and these are called complex balanced dynamical systems. They were introduced by Horne and Jackson in 1972. And they are of particular interest because they exhibit remarkably or exceptionally strong dynamical properties. And actually, so they were known under mild hypothesis to have global stability in each. To have global stability in each stoichiometric compatibility class, and they have no oscillations and no chaotic dynamics, and they are also known or conjectured to be persistent and permanent. And in this picture, you can see the nice behavior, dynamical behavior of complex balance dynamical systems. In 1974, it was Horn who posed the now-called Global Tractor conjecture. And this is one of the main important, main unknown, main open questions in the field of chemical reaction networks. And this conjecture says that complex balanced mass action dynamical systems are globally stable within each positive stoichiometric compatibility class. That is, they have a globally attractive. They have a globally attracting point up to conservation laws. And this conjecture has already been proven, as I mentioned before, under my hypothesis. For instance, in the case when the stoichiometric compatibility class has dimension at most three, or some other hypothesis like connectedness of the reaction network in all dimensions. In all dimensions. But recently, Georgia Gracchun was the one who proposed a proof in all generality of this conjecture. And this is not the only reason why complex balance dynamical systems are of great interest. And note that non-linear dynamical systems are usually modeled with systems of differential. Usually modeled with systems of differential equations generated by reaction networks with parameters. And recently, Gheorghe Krechon, Alicia Diegenstein, Anne Xiu, and Bernstein Fest showed that under some algebraic conditions on parameters, so there are some algebraic equations of the parameters, the systems, these non-linear systems. These non-linear systems are complex balanced. And they called them, due to some very nice algebraic and combinatorial properties of these equations, they called these systems tori dynamical systems. And the set of parameters that satisfies these conditions is what we call the toric locus. And we will And we will see more details later about the toric locus, but we have to remember that this toric locus depends on the network that generates the system. And usually, the toric locus is a set of Lebesgue measures zero in the space of parameters. Let us now go to the main result of Of this talk. First of all, I mentioned that the Tori Glaucus usually is a measure zero, Lebesgue measure zero. But we show that there exists a larger class. So these were the toric dynamical systems. And now we show that there is a larger class called, that we call these Geist toric dynamical systems. Dynamical systems that enjoys the same dynamical properties of the tweak systems, but is larger. So here we have a strict inclusion. And usually what happens is that when we study the disguised toric locus, we extend it. So when we pass from the toric to the disguise to locus, we usually extend Usually, we extend these sets from a zero measure to a positive Lebesgue measure set. This is quite important because our main interest is the dynamics of the system. So the disguise story still have the global stability properties, but there are many more. And the main key idea of our The key idea of our proof, as we will explain a bit further, is that we use the dynamically equivalent systems idea that was also mentioned by Polly Yu in her talk on Tuesday. And we will see furthermore how we apply this. This is based on a paper by Krechun, Jean, and you. Very nice. And now. Very nice. And now we have already an extension, and it was known that there are globally stable systems that are not storic. And now, since we extended, since we look at these guys storic dynamic systems, a natural question appears, and this is the question whether there exist globally stable systems that are not. Stable systems that are not this guy story. So we might wonder whether we, by studying this guy story, we study all the globally stable systems. And this is the right moment to reach, to go to the poll. We have here the link. You also have the link in the chat. And you can vote whether the answer to this question: do there exist Answer to this question: Do there exist globally stable systems that are not disguised? Is yes or is no. So, yes, that means the set global, the difference between the globally stable systems and the disguise storage is not empty, and no, meaning that globally stable sets minus disguise storage sets is the empty set. Let's see a bit the poll. Okay, it's increasing the result. So 70 people say yes, and sorry, 17 people said yes, and one person said no. And now we will see the answer in a few slides. I don't tell you, but you kind of guess. So for this, we need some So, for this, we need some to understand more. We need now some technicalities. I won't insist much because here these notions have been mentioned before by Pauli and by some speakers. I will just say that for the purpose of this talk and in general, we consider a reaction network to be a Euclidean embedded graph. So, it's a graph that lives in the Euclidean space and the set of And the set of the vertices are just points in Rn. Just to understand briefly on an example, if we look at the chemical reaction, you can see that we have formal linear combinations of the species. Here we have just two species, x1 and x2. This is really the chemical equation. And it's enough to look at the coefficients in front of all the species. Coefficients in front of all the species. So we have here 2x1 and 0x2. And that's why from here we can get the vector to 0. And we place it here in the plane. Here 1, 1 and 0, 2. And that's how we get a vector, a graph from a reaction network. And we are interested in the dynamical. We are interested in the dynamical system that generates that is generated by a graph. So, given a graph, we now work under mass action kinetics, and this will give us polynomial ODEs. And let's understand better. So, how do we get the system? We have x, that is the vector of concentrations of the species, and this depends on the time. And that's why we can take here the derivative of x with respect to the time. With respect to the time, and to the right-hand side, in a factorial notation, we have this polynomial ODs. But to understand them better, we just watch better on an example. So, if we have a graph like this one embedded in the real plane, to obtain the partial differential equations, we follow the formula. So, you see that. We follow the formula. So you see that for each edge, also I didn't mention, but each edge, we don't draw it here for simplicity, but each edge is labeled or could be decorated with a rate constant or a parameter that is k. We don't know these parameters with k, k i j, if we go from the the vertex i to vertex j. So this is a directed graph, okay? Is a directed graph. We can also have kji, and these are the they might be different, and these are positive real numbers. So we take every reaction in the reaction network. For instance, let's take this one and we respect the formula. We consider the parameter ki, in this case k1, and consider the monomial given by the concentrations of the species and The concentrations of the species and the source node. So in this case, we have 0, 0. So we would have x1 to power 0 times x2 to the power 0. And then the monomial doesn't exist. And furthermore, we respect this rule for all the nodes. The vectors will be differences of this type, yi minus y, where y prime is the target and the source we have. That's the source we have. For instance, if you look at this reaction, the monomial is x1 cube x2 squared, and the vector will be the difference between these two. So now we are ready to go further to understand what is a complex balanced dynamical system. I won't I won't give a technical definition. I will just say that a steady state is complex balanced if at each vertex in the network the inflow and the outflow are equal. Let's understand on an example. We have, for instance, this node, and let us look at its outflow. For instance, this contains This contains the reaction one, let's just say one, two, one, three, one, four. And to each of them, we multiply with the corresponding monomial. But in this case, since the vector is 0, 0, we don't have. And now let us look at the outflow from the node y1. And there we have, you see, sorry, the inflow now. Okay, so we have 4, 1. So we have 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, and each multiplied by the corresponding monomial that is associated to the source of that edge, of that reaction. So for instance, 3, 1 will be multiplied by x1 cubed times x2 squared, because here we have 3,2, the vertex, the coordinates. Great, and so again, if these equations are satisfied, These equations are satisfied, then we say that the steady state is complex balanced. And in addition, what we should keep in mind is that all those parameters, k, the rate constants, for which there exists such an x that satisfies these complex balance solutions equations, represent the toric locus of Of given by this reaction network. So it's a problem of quantifier elimination. We can get into more details if time permits. Now, as I said before, for most networks, the set in the parameter space that gives rise to toric systems, so as I said before, the toric locus has Lebesgue measure zero. Has Lebesgue measure zero. And this is due to a theorem given by Krachun, Diegenstein, Hu and Sturmfels that say that the codimension of the toric locus in the parameter space equals the deficiency of the network. So we know, we see again that the toric locus is very connected to the topology or to the combinatorics of the reaction. Of the reaction network that we are looking at. Now, using this DRM, we can deduce the the toric locus of this reaction. So we consider the reaction of three nodes on a line, y1, y2, y3, the complete graph, complete de graph, directed graph on these three nodes. And you can compute using the deficiency. Pauli gave the formula. The formula already. So, number of nodes minus the number of connected components minus the dimension of the stoichiometric compatibility class. Delta is one. So, the toric locus will be a codimension one variety in the case space. And it is known, it was known already that this is the equation, the algebraic condition that the parameters must satisfy in the case of this reaction network. This reaction network in order for the reaction to be toric, has to be, in other words, complex balanced, and thus to be globally stable, because that's the most important thing, the dynamical behavior. So whenever you choose parameters in the parameter space lying on this hypersurface, because this is a hypersurface, we know that we have global. We have global stability. But the question is: what happens if you are not on this hypersurface? And I will show you now that the reaction that we call the three nodes on a line reaction is this geistoric. Okay, so even if So even if deficiency is one and the toric locus is a codimension one variety, we proved that this guy's toric locus of this complete D graph on three nodes on a line is the whole space of rate constants. So it's the whole positive orthant. In other words, no matter which parameters you pick from the positive orthant. From the positive ortant, you end up having global stability. So you see that we passed from, as I mentioned before, we passed from a Lebesgue measure zero in the positive ortant to the whole positive ortant. And all those parameters give rise to these guys, toric dynamical systems. Thus, all those points give rise to global stability. And for the proof idea, I will remind you that the toric locus depends on the graph. So we use a theorem by Krachun, Jean, and Yu. And they said that they proved that it is enough to look at the subgraphs of sub-graphs. Subgraphs, so when you use the idea of dynamical equivalence in this setting, it is enough to look at subgraph on the source nodes, on the complete graph based on the source nodes of the initial graph. So in other words, a mass action system generated by a graph G is dynamically equivalent to some complex balance mass action system, if and only if it is dynamically equivalent. If and only if it is dynamically equivalent to a complex balanced mass system that only uses the source vertices of G. You can see again the presentation given by Paul Yu this Tuesday. And now using the same idea, I will show you how we ended up filling an empty toric locus. So now if you give you this reaction network, reaction network we would like to see which is the this which is the first which is the toric locus of this network but note that there are some vertices that are just target vertices so they are not source vertices so we cannot even impose the condition of complex balance thus the toric locus is empty but using But using the idea of dynamically equivalent systems generated by distinct graphs, we can show that actually we can get a disguised Tauric locus that has a positive Lebesgue measure. So we have the new graph in blue. You see it's the complete graph on the source. Graph on the source vertices of the initial graph, the orange one. And studying the complex valence conditions on this new graph and using quantifier elimination, we and some other tools from real algebraic geometry, we ended up having the following, obtaining the following theorem. That the dynamical system generated by the orange graph is this guy's toric. And we say here, if and only if. And we say here if and only if, so we completely characterize, if and only if the four rate constants are satisfying these two inequalities. Okay, this is a Lebesgue positive Lebesgue measure set. And I would like to mention that this same result was obtained by Cretchun and his collaborators, but using a totally different approach than ours. We were based mostly in quantifier elimination in this proof. And of course, the main idea of dynamically equivalent systems. And going on in applying the same techniques, we also decided to complicate more the question and to study the quadrilateral on a line, what we call this is the complete directed graph on four nodes, okay. Four nodes on a line. And this graph, you can consider its differential equations under mass action kinetics. And now it will be soon time for another poll question. Here I tell you that the this That the graph from here could be in some cases represented by a different graph that is this one here on the right, which has a very important property that each vertex has exactly one reaction. Okay, there is one reaction per vertex. Another thing is how many possibilities, how many more, so in how many more. How many more ways could we represent the complete graph on four vertices by using just one reaction per vertex? Okay, of course we have one because I gave you one, but maybe you can choose between one, four or sixteen. Let's see if you now you can start answering. You have to keep in mind that here there are vertices that they don't get out. You see, there are these outermost vertices have only in. Vertices have only in inside arrows. Okay, now we stop the poll. We have six answers for four and three answers for 16. Let's see what is the correct answer. So there are four different types of reactions, and this is due to the fact that only the inside That only the inside vertices can vary, okay, then they can go either up or down, and it gives us two times two choices. And I would like just to mention here that if you look at this reaction, for instance, there is here only one change of direction, okay? We call it sign change, one sign change. In the second class, here in the second graph, there is one sign change. graph there is one sign change in the middle and in the third one we have one sign change between y1 and y2. However, in the last partition we have two sign changes, one between y1 and y2 and another one between y3 and y4. That's why we call these three cases single sign chambers. We call them chambers because we think of the partition of the parameters Of the parameter space of the quadrilateral on a line in four distinct components according to the behavior of the system inside each chamber. And this leads us to our main results related to the quadrilateral on a line, namely we have the following theorem. The complete graph on four nodes is this guy's story. Is disguised to and only if the parameters belong to the single sign change chambers, or the parameters belong to the fourth chamber, the one with two sign changes, and there is this inequality that they must satisfy. Here I would like to state, say some words about this inequality. So, first of all, in the literature, In the literature, more precisely in Anshiu's thesis, this equality, the hypersurface, appears. This is by the way a terminantal surface. It's the Segre variety, the simplest Segre variety. And it appeared as the toric locus of this reaction. And what's very interesting with us in this theorem, in our theorem, is that we expanded the toric locus, which was... The toric locus, which was the hypersurface, the one in Beige here in the picture, to the whole to all the points above the hypersurface in Beige that lie in the positive quadrant. Here you see there are two perspectives of the positive quadrant in these two pictures. So we passed from zero measure to a positive measure where we Where we have global stability. And again, the single sign change chambers are global, there we have global stability for any choice of case. But let's come back to the question, to the first poll question. I was asking whether there exist globally stable dynamical systems which are not disgusted, and this proposition. And this proposition now will clarify what the result is. So we have that the dynamical system in the fourth chamber is globally stable if and only if the rate constants verify this inequality. So note that this polynomial is the discriminant of the right-hand side of the differential equation. And this is that so the equality is That so the equality is this hypersurface in gray and we we state that all the points above this hypersurface are globally stable and this shows that in between the beige and the gray surface there are points that are globally stable but not complex balanced because the complex balanced were just the points above the beige surface and thus the inclusions are strict we have toric this guy's toric Are strict. We have Toric, the sky is Toric, and global stable systems. So, this is all I wanted to talk, to present, and I thank you for your attention. I hope I convinced you that there are useful tools from teleological geometry in the study of chemical reaction networks and complex balance dynamical systems. Thank you, Stefana. Uh, questions for the speaker? Questions for the speaker? Just unmute yourself and ask. I have a question. Can I ask it? Yes. So it's about the quiz question with the options of 4 and 16. I think there are seven options, right? Because the red arrows can be zero. So it can. So I can okay. I didn't thank you. I really wanted one reaction per per vertex, but then sorry. Yeah, but then the theorem that says the network is disguised if and only if some conditions, you are omitting some conditions because you are ignoring three possibilities. Right? So it's not an if and only if, yeah. Yeah, this theorem, you say the system is disguised if and only if, but you are ignoring k belonging to the situation where one of the red arrows is it. I see, I see, I see. I think there is some case missing. Yes, I think, yes, we can add here that yes, some of them, if there's zero, okay, then that's. Okay, then let's thanks. I think you're right. Okay, thank you. Also, can I say something? Yeah, sure. Also, the condition that you had at the end is just a discriminant of the polynomial. Yes. Discriminant of a degree three polynomial. So somehow this condition, because the least thing that you need is to have just one positive root. Positive root. So maybe this is the boundary between one positive root and three positive roots. Yes, maybe I should have gotten into details that on the surface, right, we can have a triple on this discriminant, on the zero logs of the discriminant, and we could have a triple root, the root of multiplicity is three. Also, I don't remember now, but there was a theorem by five. Remember now, but there was a theorem by Feinberg on deficiency one. And you, in your first, in the triangle case at the beginning, maybe this is different from Feinberg's theorem that I don't remember. There was also a condition for I cannot ask you because I don't remember it. But what was do you remember? What was, do you remember what was the conclusion? What was the well, we can check later. I would be happy. Yes, yes. We can continue during the coffee break. Maybe sure. Under some conditions, you have unique equilibrium, but nothing about global stability. Thank you. And also, here, the fact that you have really. The fact that you have unique equilibrium in this case was more subtle because actually it's globally stable because we are in a plane with geometric compatibility class of dimension one. So it was just a unique equilibrium then and some more subtle globally stable. I have a question. I have a question. Yeah, please. So you mentioned about the quantifier elimination for eliminating the state variables X, correct? Yes, one could use elimination by then you get the the total locus. Then you get condition on the parameters, right? So now question is this another question to you. Is another question to you that I'd like to know the exact statement of this lesson formula that involves quantifiers. So I'm going to list three of them. Could you tell me which one is the one that you intended? What you mean? The person says that I didn't hear well. Sorry, could you repeat? Yeah, so let me see. I think there's some sound from the background. Yes, there is. Background, yes, there is oh, yeah, so that's from you, it's not from me, yes. I also hear you somebody, somebody has a sound, especially the beauty first. Okay, so I think so. First, I'd like to know which one is the your the formula from which your eliminate quantifiers. So, I'll give you three of them. Could you tell me which one? Person says that for all X. Says that for all x, that's a positive x, that the steady state condition implies that the complex balance and the, let's say, the same time maker system condition. So this number one, again, for all x, steady state condition implies the conjunction of the complex balance condition. Complex balance condition and dynamical equivalence condition. That's the first one. Second one is that same as the first one, except that it is the essentially quantified, the exist X, such that the, and so on, the same. Third one is that the exist X such that steady state condition and complex balance condition and the dynamical equivalence. So, which one are these three? What do you mean? Sorry, which one? Which ones are? Which one is the one that you can I answer you? Yes, please. I understand the question. I think I was also adding the steady state condition. I was eliminating X from all the add, what I'm by adding, adding as a I think that if you have these conditions, you do have a steady state, you don't need to add them. And this condition means there exists one X. And then you want to extract conditions on decay from the knowledge that there exists at least one X. This implies that it's a steady state, that the complex balance implies a steady state. But also, there is detail that is not written here. Detail that is not written here. Everything seems to be very much algebraic, but the importance is that the X is positive, real and positive. And so, that I understand X is positive. But still, when you said word add, I don't know what you mean by adding, logically speaking, okay? What do you mean by adding? Is it implications or is it actually conjunction? Which one do you adding? But when did I say, did I mention 10? Did I mention chance? And so to that, maybe we can move the discussion to the coffee break, and also the speaker will have time to. All right, go ahead. Yeah, please. So, yeah, so then let's thank the speaker. Okay, thank you. And
