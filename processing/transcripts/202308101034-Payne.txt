But the two are independent and I won't yeah, anyway. So I'll remind you from Gabby's talk that famous theorem of Harris and Humphrey and Eisenbud from the 1980s, which was culmination of a big project of enumerative geometry of curves and real meritor theory, is that Mg. theory is that Mg is general type for G at least 24. And older work of Severi shows that Ng is unirational, so could I already mention minus infinity for G up to 10 or 11 and then subsequent people have pushed the minus infinity up to 15 or 16 and then there's some gap where there hasn't been much contract. There hasn't been much progress in it for quite a while. And so, our main result in our first paper together is that I mean G is general type for G equals 22 and 23. So that's moving the general type range down just a little bit. And as Gabby explained, this really required a This really required a new idea and some new constructions. And so the equivalent statement is that for D at least 22, there is an effective device of D on Mg bar of a slope strictly less than 13 over 2. And so now And so now the game is to find these divisors, so to geometrically describe some locus and to compute its class and compute its load. And so the classical, or now classical picture for D at least 24 is that we use the failure loci of the brilliant and D-circuitrium. And Gieser-Kirpetri theorems. So the Perlmutter and Gies-Kirpetri theorems are saying that there's some generic behavior, so that for a general curve, something nice is happening as expected with a linear series. And then for certain numerical parameters, you expect a codimension one locus where those nice things do not happen. And you can compute the classes of those loci and prove these things. And prove these theorems, and okay, and so for G at least 24, it's those loci that give the divisors of small slope. And those loci exist for smaller g, but they have slope greater than 6.5. And so for g equals 22 and 23, there's a loci with a different description. So we looked at A different description. So we look at dg, which would be the set of curves that lie inside a quadrant, inside P6 with degree g plus 3. Okay? And so the expected dimension of the space of The space of maps of degree g plus 3 to p6 has dimension g minus 21. So for g equals 22 and 23, there's a one or two dimensional family of such embeddings, but you do not expect the images to lie on a quad. And so there's some special locus where the images of these MAP2P6 do lie on a quadrant. And so these are the loci that we're The loci that we're looking for. And you can give, so not on MG, but on the universal GRD, you can give a determinantal description of the locus where the image is contained in the quadrature. And you can compute the expected class by a determinantal formula. And then you can push forward that class to mg, and you can get an expected slope. And these voci are more complicated than the real Nerd divisors. The formulas for the expected slopes are a little more subtle. But at the end of the day, you get this 17,121 over 2636, which is less than 6.5. So this is for G equals 22. So this is for g equals 22. And then for g equals 23, you have the 470,749 over 72,725 6.4. So everybody's favorite rational number. That's a good question. Yeah. Like, why is it so close to six and a half and not like a discovery that's way lower? Like, is there something? I mean that in which this is narrowly not like almost not being general, like well so this you know this comes back to you know what what Gabi was saying. So until our second paper which did some constructions for g equals 13, every known, you know, originally there was a conjecture that what 6 plus 12 over g plus 1, the slope of the Brillner divisor was optimal. That was the slope conjecture. Optimal, that was the slope conjecture. And then there's this slope 6 plus 10 over g, which comes from identifying two base points in a linear series on a K3. And it seemed like maybe those curves would be sufficiently general for all purposes. And if they were sufficiently general for all purposes, then all effective divisors would have slope greater than 6 plus 10 million HP. And so those, those, right, so for G equals 13, those divisors are not. G equals 13, those divisors are not sufficiently general. Here, it sort of looks like probably those divisors are sufficiently general. So, these are still in that range over 6 plus 10 over G. Really check these numbers, right? So, what to expect with that MMG is 20 and 6 plus NG. Why don't we talk about that after? Okay. Okay, so there's various, so we want to show that there actually is an effective divisor on MGBAR that has these expected slopes. And so when you have some locus defined by equations with some expected codimension, one thing you could be worried about is that the locus. One thing you could be worried about is that the locus actually has higher than expected dimension. So, here, step one, which turns out to be not so easy, is to show that this locus is not everything. That we actually are describing the Q. Yes. So, we want to show that this locus is not the whole space. Oh, and here we should only. Uh oh, and here uh we should only be yeah we want to look at petri general curves. Uh so we want to show that there exists some petri general curve such that for all For all, so the Petri general condition will guarantee that all G6 G plus 3s are complete linear series. And so now we can actually look inside pick G plus 3. And so we look at those line bundles so that for all such line bundles, we have this multiplication map. So the quadratics that contain the image of the map are given by the kernel of The multiplication map from SIM2 of global sections to global sections of 2L. And so we want a curve such that all of these multiplication maps are injective. So and this is an instance of the strong maximal rate. Maximal rank. The existence of such a curve is an instance of the strong maximal rank conjecture of Gabi and Akru. And just as for Brillmer, Petri-type theorems, explicitly describing such curves is typically not easy. But one way of describing curves, well, you can put algebraic conditions on, you can put analytic conditions on, and so we're going to put non-Archimedean analytic conditions on our curve. So k is going to be some algebraic composed complete value field. And we'll look at a graph of the flavor that Nathan told us about. So, this is our chain of loops. And as Nathan makes And as Nathan explained, special things tend to happen when there are special relations among edge lengths. So we want to rule out special relations among edge lengths. So we label the lengths of these edges. And so we're going to choose a constant that will be reasonably big. So bigger than 12 times d plus g. You should think of d as being 20. G, you should think of D as being 26 and G as being 23. So C is whatever, a few thousand. And then we want that Li is bigger than C times Mi and that Ni is bigger than C times Li. Li and Ni plus 1 is bigger than C times Ni and also Ni plus 1 is bigger than C times L I. And is that? B times G naught. So the idea here is that these bridges are much, much longer. Are much, much longer than the edges in the loops that are adjacent to them, and the top edge is much longer than the bottom edge, and also this loop is much bigger than this loop, so I picture not to scale. So the idea will be that we're going to work from that loop to the I take it back. We do not need relations among the lengths. Thank you. So in different scenarios, one puts different conditions on edge lengths. And here these are the conditions that we have. Can I ask something about the step one? So I should think about this. This is like this is happening in MG, right? So I don't get to pick the divisor. I really have to find how curves. So it's more like a... It's a stronger statement than the maximal rank things that you guys proved. Which is why it's called the strong maximal rank conjecture. But the strong state is all the way. Well, so actually, the strong maximal rank conjecture is a prediction for the codimension of the load. For the codimension of the locus in the universal WRD, where the multiplication knot fails to have the expected range. And in this particular case, the expected dimension of the failure locus in the WRD is negative. So when you guys use these kinds of techniques to prove Gieskir Petri, it's a similar setup, right? You have to prove something for all divisors. Right. The Giesekir-Petri theorem, that paper does not. Theorem that paper does not fit the pattern of the other papers, we can discuss later. But there should be a tropical proof of DC perpetuity that follows this method, but it has not been done yet. Or just your last inequality? Would you add one bigger than C N I bigger than C squared? That looks better. So everything gets smaller as we move from left to right across the graph. So we work from left to right, and you want things that happen on the left to dominate things that happen on the right. So these sort of later groups, so if you're thinking analytically, yeah, these are sort of perturbations of what happens here. What happens here? Thank you. Okay. Okay, so now I can. So it was known previously, so worked with Dave a while ago. So if we have a curve over K with the skeleton, so genus G, the skeleton, so then C is already petrigent. So that was the result that Dhruv alluded to, and the proof probably by historical accident follows a different method. But I hope our understanding of our methods are getting better with time. So we choose a curve with that skeleton, and so now we have a Petri-general curve, and the theorem. And the theorem the new theorem is, so suppose g equals 21, 22, or 23, d equals g plus 3, r equals 6, and l is in w or d. So then So then this condition is satisfied. The second multiplication is integrity. So I'm getting this now for all my models. Yeah, your previous regime was 21, 22, 23, but the general tagging is only for 21. That's right, yeah. So if you compute the slope of, so the 21 case is easier. So, the 21 case is easier. This is a row equals zero case. The existence of such curves already follows from the maximum rank theorem. But if you compute the slope of that divisor, it is strictly greater than 13 over 2, and so it gives no information on the quadratic function. But nevertheless, this is a true statement. So, we're giving an explicit condition for a curve to be sufficiently general for this purpose. This purpose. And that condition is that the skeleton is like this. Okay, and so the method of proof of this statement is by copying the maps. So this is sort of using tropical geometry to control linear algebra over Linear algebra over valued fields. So ask one more question over here. So this is L and W R D of C where C on the stage that there is a standard. Yeah? Yes. Yes. Thank you. Exactly. So I'm going to come back to the setup. To come back to the setup where we have this specific graph, but to talk about tropical independence, the particular graph we're working with doesn't matter. So let's say C is a smooth projective curve over our field. Over our field K, which delta gamma. And you can think of this graph, or it could be any graph. This next part doesn't depend on the graph. And so then we have our tropicalization map, which is the retraction to the skeleton. And if you have a rational function, then you get a real value. Function, then you get a real valued function on the scalar function. So the tropicalization of the rational function is a real value function. So the points on the skeleton can be viewed as valuations on the function field. And so V goes to that valuation applied to F. And Proposition effect. So this was from work with Matt Baker and Joe Ravanov some time ago. So this is the non-Archimedean Punqueri-Le Long formula. And so this says that, so Trop F is, so continuous. Is so continuous and piecewise linear with integer slopes and the divisor of tropical F is the tropicalization of the divisor of F. So here, the divisor of a piecewise linear function with integer slopes is the sum over all points of the sum of the incoming slopes times that point. So this says that we can study rational functions by looking at these associated these wise linear functions, and we retain some information about the divisors. Of course, you could have, you lose information because the fibers of the tropicalization map are large, there's risky dense, so you could have zeros and poles in some fiber of the retraction to the skeleton. Of the retraction to the skeleton, and they will just cancel out. So we are throwing away a lot of information, but in many circumstances, we hold on to enough to prove a theorem. So now we want to make some observations about how linear algebra behaves in the presence of a value. Behaves in the presence of a valuation. So suppose F1 to FS. So we have some non-zero rational functions. Okay, and suppose this is k linearly dependent. We have a dependent. So then There are real numbers such that so we have some scalars in k so that alpha1 f1 plus alpha s f s is 0. And so then ai would be the valuation of alpha i. And the tropicalization of alpha i f i is a i plus f i so the minimum Trop FI, so the minimum of A1 plus Trop F1 AS plus Trop FS occurs twice at every point. So every point in the skeleton is a valuation. For each of these valuations, leading terms have to cancel. And so there have to be a cancel. And so there have to be at least two linear terms. So then we could just take that as a definition of tropical heat pendant. So a set psi 1 through psi s is tropically dependent if so if there are real numbers in one So, if there are real numbers, a1 through af such that the minimum occurs everywhere, at least twice. And otherwise, we say that these piecewise linear functions are tropically dependent, and tropical dependence of the tropicalizations is a sufficient condition for linear independence of rational functions. And so that's a notion that Jensen and I have been working with for quite a while. Sorry, I got confused by dependence and independence. So tropical dependence is a sufficient condition for linear independence? Linear dependence implies tropical dependence. Tropical dependence. Tropical independence implies linear independence. Awesome. Thank you. Sorry, I just heard something. And now there's a proposition, a not obvious proposition that we missed for a while. And so there's a sort of constructive criterion for tropical independence. So here it looks like tropical independence is a non-existent statement. There do not exist null numbers. Statement. There do not exist real numbers. But here's the proposition. So psi 1 through ψ s is topically independent if and only if there exist real numbers A1 through AS such that for each i, there is a point in the graph, so VI. So Vi, where psi i plus Ai is strictly less than psi j plus Aj Rji. So tropical dependence is that the minimum occurs everywhere at least twice. So there is no function that anywhere achieves the minimum uniquely. And here, every function. Every function achieves the minimum somewhere, uniquely. And so the proposition is that these two are equivalent, and this is an application of the master-Kuratowski-Mazurkievich lemma. So, this is the set covering variant of the Brouwer fixed point theorem. So, this is an exotic error for most of us. There are for most of us version of the Brouwer fixed point theorem implies this condition for tropical independence, and in retrospect, this is what one should typically use. And part of the reason why this is good is because you can, for instance, give algorithms to construct these constants a1 through a and prove that they have this property and conclude that some rational functions are in. That some rational functions remain. And so, this is exactly the strategy that we follow. Okay. And so then I can restate or state a stronger form of our main result for step one. So this was. So this was C over J with a skeleton gamma and L in W R D. And then what we're going to do is, so we want to identify sections of line models with rational functions. So we're going to choose D such that L is all of D. So then we can really view global sections in. Global sections inside the function. And so then the conclusion will be that there exist sections psi 1 through psi s, s unspecified. I can give a bound on s, but it's not a great bound. It would be like 30. Okay. And a And a subset S of the pairwise sum psi i plus psi j that is tropically independent. And so what's going on here is that, so if I have psi one through psi s, these are sections, then psi one tensor psi s is in the image of the multiplication map mu2. map mu2. And the tropicalization of psi1 tensor, or the tropicalization of F1 tensor Fs, F, the tropicalization of Fi tensor Fj is psi i plus psi j. And so these are tropicalizations of rational functions in the image of mu2. And oh, I laugh if we specify the size of the subset. So there's a subset of size 28. 28. So H0 of L has dimension 7, so sing2 has dimension 28, and so we are going to find a set of 28 pairwise sums of tropicalizations of functions in our linear series that is tropically independent. Actually build uh build the set and we find the coefficients And we find the coefficients. Yep. I'll give a, hopefully I'm going to show you an example of how this works, like in Genus 3. So you can see. All right, I'm just going to keep going and we'll see how far we got. Keep going, and we'll see how far we got. So, this whole strategy tells us that we need to study the structure of the collection of functions trop F, where F varies in a finite-dimensional subspace of the function field of the curve. And so, this is some sort of linear algebra, again, over valued fields. Algebra again over valued fields. And so that's what we should call a tropical linear series. So we should somehow isolate combinatorial properties of such collections of piecewise linear functions. And okay, and so I know we've been warned not to define matroids, but whatever. So let me say how I want to think of matroids. So I want to think about a linear substance. Think about a linear subspace of Rn. And then, if I have a vector in my space, well, that's V is V1 QVN. And then I get a subset of the coordinates. So sub V is the set of I such that VI is not zero. And so the matroid is the set of Is the set of supports of vectors? Okay, so now if you're a matroid theorist, the flats are the complements of the support sets. So now you believe that I've given you a cryptomorphic description of matroids. I think maybe not one of the standard ones or not on Wikipedia, but anyway, and then there are the obvious axes. Axes, the empty set, is a support vector. It's the support vector of zero. Okay, and if A and B are in this support set, then their union is. Okay, because if you take a general linear combination of two vectors with specified support, then the support of that general linear combination would be the union of the supports. And then there's an elimination axiom. An elimination axiom. So if A is not equal to B and I is in the intersection, then there exists C which contains the symmetric difference and is contained in the union and does not contain i. So you can eliminate the ith coordinate by taking a suitable. The ith coordinate by taking a suitable linear combination. Okay, so that's how I want to think about a matroid. And so, what's evaluated matroid? Well, it's the same thing, but whenever I have an index in the support, I want to understand the valuation of that. So, evaluated matroid. So this is a set of tropicalizations of some vectors in a vector space. And there will be, okay, I'm not going to write down the x, but you follow this train of thought. So what do I want to say here? So if you act If you act by a scalar, by a constant in k, then you add a real constant to the topicalization. And if you take a general linear combination, then you get a pointwise minimum. And so evaluated natroid, which is a tropical linear space, is close under scalar addition and point-wise minimum, so this is a tropical submodule. submodule of R bar to the n. And if you have a collection of, so in this setup for matroids, if you have a subspace of Rn, and then you have some minimal support sets, and if you choose one vector with each minimal support, that's a generating set for your vector space. So easy exercise that that set cannot be contained in any circuit. not be contained in any circuit. And so similarly here, so in our tropical submodule, if you choose one valuated vector with each minimal support, then that collection generates the vector space. And it generates the tropical submodule. So it's a tropical submodule. Tropical submodules are in general not finitely generated, but tropical linear spaces are. But tropical linear spaces are finitely general. And again, you can get a generating set by choosing one valuated vector with each minimal support set. And that is. Sorry, Sam, that went last bit, went too fast for me. What was the minimum support set in here? So support would be not equal to infinity. And so there's finitely many support sets. They're ordered by inclusion. Two minimums. Or just look at the underlying ordinary matroid and apply this in. So this is disappears cryptomorphically, let's say, in Naroda Tamura, 20 years ago. Okay. And ah. Okay, and so now we want to relate these tropical linear spaces to tropicalizations of linear series. And so this is a proposition in our paper that so So, if you have any finite-dimensional k-vector subspace of the function field, and you take the tropicalization of that, this is a homomorphic image as a tropical module of a tropical linear space. So, the ambient dimension for that tropical linear space is huge. And we give some bound, but it's something not good. But at the very least, you get finite change. Okay. But Sam, that tropical linear space is not a well-defined space. I mean, there's choices, then? They're choices. Yes. Yes. Ah. Yes. There are choices, but there is a canonical minimal generating set up to tropical risk. So that's another proposition. But that's following the same argument as in Hasamusik or U for the finite generators for R of T. Sorry, so you give some bound on the number of generators? No, some bound on the ambient dimension. Some bound on the ambient dimension, right? So when you have a tropical linear space that's evaluated matroid on some number of elements, there's a bound on the number of elements, but it's not a good one. In terms of what? In terms of what are the. In terms of the number of edges in the graph, in terms of the so you'd have to put v inside o of d for some divisor d, and then you'd have to bound the degree of d and it'll be polynomial in those. It'll be polynomial in those terms. The degree of P can be bounded by the original degree and then the genus. Yeah, so the idea here is you have some, for instance, seven-dimensional vector space that you want to study, and you're going to re-embed it in a vector space of, I don't know, dimension 800. And so now you have a tropical linear space of dimension. A tropical linear space of dimension 7 in R-bar to E800, but that's a finitely generated tropical module, and it maps homomorphically onto the tropicalization of our linear series. And so now the idea is that we should be studying tropical linear series using the ideas of Baker and Norien and the idea that they are homomorphic images of tropical linear spaces. Images of 12 image spaces. Was there a question? Is the 800-dimensional thing that maps onto the seven-dimensional thing? Yeah, so there's the seven-dimensional sub-module. A tropical linear space is embedded somewhere. Where it's embedded tends to be big. We're sort of looking at coefficients of a power series expansion of the rational function on on the pre-image of every edge. On the pre-image of every edge. So using the structured theory of non-automatic curves. Good. Okay. And how should I proceed? Maybe. Okay, so maybe just let me reiterate what I said. Let me reiterate what I just said, which is that this gives a perspective with which one can combinatorially define a tropical linear series and get maybe multiple options for a working definition that in some way combine this idea with the idea of Baker-Norian rank. And there is one such notion in our paper that is good enough for proving our theorem, and in fact, it is. Our theorem. And in fact, it is good enough to prove. So, whatever I erased, the existence of those PL functions with 28 pairwise sums. So, that is actually a theorem not about tropicalizations of linear series on a chain of 23 loops, but it's about tropical linear series on a chain of 23 loops. So, that statement will hold for non-realizable tropical linear series as well. So, the combinatorial properties that one So the combinatorial properties that one extracts from this perspective are enough to algorithmically construct these coefficients that give tropical independences. So I feel like that is an important takeaway. That's in the same paper? That's in the same paper. And moreover, so tropical linear series, here's another reason why you should like them. So you can restrict a tropical linear series of some rank. A tropical linear series of some rank to a closed subgraph. And that is a tropical linear series. And so now you can do things like you have a chain of 23 loops. You can chop off three loops. So this is going from a linear series on a curve of genus 23 to a linear series on a curve of genus 20. So this is sort of like Berkovich geometry lets you do gluing constructions and surgery constructions. And surgery constructions, they're somehow closer in spirit to what the topologists do. And so, as a side note, so long ago, maybe about 15 years ago, when Soren Galatius and I started thinking about tropical geometry of moduli of curves and how that was related to the cohomology of Mg, the goal was to use these surgery techniques to give a new proof of the Madsen-Weiss theorem, Mumford's conjecture. The confidence conjecture. Because that's done by such a surgery operation. So, yes, I guess one of our mentorship topics was what to do with, you know, when do you give up on a project? And I feel like one of the takeaways there is that often when a project fails, if you've thought hard about something and good ideas came up, but you got nowhere near your goal, there might be some other direction in which to take those ideas. So that's, okay. All right, so that was the, and we've Alright, so that was the, and we really, we used that extensively in the paper. So this idea that you can slice the graph and you get a tropical linear series on a subgraph. So in Jonathan's talk, you saw an example where he had classified the tropical linear series of degree 3 and rank 1 on a loop. And that idea is essentially what we're doing when we have this chain of loops. We classify. We classify the possibilities for what can happen on each loop, we classify the possibilities for what can happen on each edge, and we classify the possibilities for how they can fit together. There's a lot of cases, and so it becomes difficult analysis, but that's the underlying idea. Okay. All right, so now here's a proposition. So if lambda is a tropical linear series for a car. So you're talking about how you can restrict to a sample. Is there any point in your argument where you cut something that's not So, the way the paper is written, no. I would say that conceptually, it might be helpful to think that morally we are cutting at every vertex and we are analyzing what. And we are analyzing what happens on each loop, and we are analyzing what happens on each edge. But strictly, as written in the logical structure, the only times when we cut, we have a chain of loops that does not satisfy exactly the inequalities that I said, but instead there's one edge which either comes between the first and second loops or between the second and third loops that is extremely long. And all the other inequalities are. And all the other inequalities are satisfied. So, what this is saying is that we are at a point in the skeleton of mg that is very close to either delta 2 or to delta 1. So we're going very close to the boundary, and then we cut in the middle of that edge. And then we get two skeletons that satisfy the right inequalities: one of genus 1 or 2, and 1. Okay, so if we have a tropical linear series of rank R, so then, so whenever you have a tangent vector, so we call it zeta, then you can look at the slopes of functions along that tangent vector. And the set of slopes always has size r plus one. So And so you're going to track those as you study your tropical linear series. And when you have something like this that you can really order from left to right, you have a vector of r plus one slopes coming into the loop, you have a vector of r plus one slopes coming out of the loop, and r plus one going into the next loop, okay, and so on. And so we analyze, and so if you cut the graph at each of If you cut the graph at each of the vertices, then what happens at the end points restricts what can happen in the middle. So for instance, if you're on a single loop, you can do single loop analysis. So here's zeta, and here's zeta prime. And so we have some function psi, and the degree of the provisor of psi restricted to Of psi restricted to gamma is the difference in slopes. So it's S theta of psi minus S theta column. So in the way that Nathan was describing things, so the difference between the incoming slope and the outgoing slope is the number of chips that are left behind. So in that way, yeah, so these slope vectors really control. So, these slope vectors really control what can be. So, for instance, if the incoming and outgoing slopes on a bridge are equal, then no chips were left behind on the bridge, and psi just has constant slope on the bridge. That would be the sort of typical behavior. And the typical behavior on a loop, as Nathan explained, is that there would be on this vector, there will be one slope that can increase by one, and all the other slope. Increase by one, and all the other slopes stay the same. So that would be sort of the typical behavior. And you can measure the deviance from the typical behavior, and the sum of the deviations from typical behavior over all bridges and loops adds up to exactly rho. And so in our paper, we depend very heavily on rho being only one or two. So there can either be one special rho. One special loop of multiplicity two, or two special loops of multiplicity one, okay, you get it. And so that's how that is really how we break things into cases. And now I want to give you a flavor of the analysis that goes on, because this really is analysis. We're working with real functions and inequalities. Real functions and inequalities on real functions. And so here's the example: d equals 3, and d is the canonical divisor. Okay, and we can write down these vectors of the corresponding tableau is 1, 2, 3. And the divisor And the divisor looks like this. So there's one point on the left. There's one point here. This distance is equal to this distance. And then these two are at the vertices. So this is the brake divisor equivalent to the canonical divisor on a chain of three loops. And since we only have one point here, we have the One point here, you have one chip here, then the outgoing slope here is bounded above by one. So if you had slope one, then you're moving this chip to the left. If you had slope minus one, then in the end, you're going to have two chips here. And then if you had one chip going across, these two distances are equal, so then you could have two chips going out. So by single-loop slope analysis, the slope incoming slope one can go up. Incoming slope one can go up to outgoing slope two. And here, if you had zero chips coming in, then you can have one chip going out because this is sitting at the vertex. So the slope zero is allowed to go up to one and the others have to stay the same. And now here, if you had an anti-chip coming along, okay, then when the anti-chip gets to here, it can annihilate this chip, and then you have no chips. Chip and then you have no chips coming out. So there's no anti-chips at the end of the day. So that means this minus one can go up to zero. Okay, so those are the vectors of slopes along each of the bridges. And the canonical divisor is always vertex avoiding. And so there exists a function which is unique that has slope one on the first bridge two, two, two. There exists a unique function that has slope zero, zero, one, one. There exists a unique 0, 1, 1. There exists a unique function that has slopes. Minus 1, minus 1, minus 1, 0. And those are the functions that we're going to use. So we'll call it, so this is phi2, phi1, phi0, and then we claim that the set of phi i plus phi j is tropically independent. So now I need to give you an independence, and the way I'll do it is by specifying which regions, which functions achieve the minimum. Which functions achieve the minimum? Okay, so we'll redraw our graph. And now remember: this edge, everything gets smaller as you go from left to right. So this edge is incredibly long. So if my function that has the highest slope on the left bridge does not achieve the minimum here, it'll be astronomically bigger than the minimum, and it will never achieve the minimum anywhere to the right. So the only place where phi2 Only place where phi2 plus phi2 can achieve the minimum is here at the left. So we call that phi22. And so then there's only one function that has slope 1 on the first bridge. That's phi1 plus phi2. And if that doesn't achieve the minimum, just to the right of the region where phi22 achieves the minimum, it will never achieve the minimum anywhere. So it has to go here. Phi12. Okay? And then there's only one. There's only one. Okay, sorry. Now there are two functions going into this loop with slope zero: phi0 plus phi2 and phi1 plus phi1. But let's look at what happens on the next bridge. So phi0 plus phi2 has outgoing slope 1, whereas phi1 plus phi1 has outgoing slope 0. So that means that phi0 plus phi2 has to achieve the minimum on this loop, because then on the next bridge, it's going to go shooting up above the minimum. It's going to go shooting up above the mini. Okay, so phi02 goes here, and then will that phi11 take over here. And okay, and you can keep, now phi11, its slope jumps by 2 when you go from here to here. And so then when we transition from phi 11 to phi, To phi 01. Yes. So the difference in slope between phi11 and phi01 is 2 minus 0. So we leave two chips here in the middle of this bridge. And then phi01 achieves the minimum. And then there's a unique function with smallest slope on the last bridge, and that achieves the minimum there. Okay, so here's a construction. And you can feel that there's an algorithm here. There's an algorithm here. Okay? So that's the way these arguments work, but of course it gets more complicated in genus 23 and rank 6. But the idea is basically the same. So that's the idea. And now I want to show you an example. Can you still assume vertex avoiding it? No, no, well, yeah. Okay. So here we have a tableau. So this would be a tableau corresponding to a vertex of white divisor. So there's one number that does not appear in the tableau. That's the number 18. So on the 18th loop, we just have a brake divisor with a point in general position. And so the incoming and outgoing scopes will be the same on either end. Same on either end. And then we really do have these seven distinguished functions, phi zero through phi six. And here are their slopes on the bridges. So we have bridges beta one through beta 23. And we have the slopes of these distinguished functions. And then you run the algorithm. And there's a unique function with highest slope on the left bridge. And there's a unique function with the next slope. And okay, then on the next bridge, you have two functions that have. Two functions that have the same slope, which are 4,6 and 5,5. But 4,6 then has slope increasing on the next wave. So 4,6, we call that a departing function. So the slope of 4,6 is too high. So 4,6 has to achieve the minimum here. And then on the next loop, there's 3,6, and 5,5, but 3,6 has its slope increasing on the next bridge. All of the slope data is encoded in the tableau. And so you just keep going. And then And then there will be interesting situations that come up. So, for instance, on this loop, there will be three functions that have the same incoming and outgoing slopes. And there's a proposition that in that case, you can take all the functions, you can choose all three, you can choose the coefficients of all three so they agree at the right-hand endpoint of the loop, and then one of them achieves the minimum uniquely. And so then you can increase its coefficients. So then you can increase its coefficient by just a little bit, but enough so that it never achieves the minimum again, because this loop is bigger than the other loops. And okay, so there's some analysis that happens, and that's the way it goes. And one has to check cases. So for G equals 23, D equals 26, there are 350. There are 350,574,510 tableaux on shape 3 by 7. So that's roughly the population of the US plus Netherlands. So if each person checks one case, that will handle the vertex avoiding case. No, so instead, you really have to give an algorithm. And so the bulk of the paper is devoted to explaining these algorithms. And when you do these cases and they work, it starts. And they work, it starts to feel like, ah, this must be just some mechanical trivial thing. It's not because if you change the parameters, then the curves have image contained in quadrants. So this only just barely works. And it just barely works. And the fact that it just barely works implies that there are curves that, you know, none of their embeddings have imaging plugins. So, yeah. So the algorithms have to be done carefully and precisely, and they cannot be done in such a way that one gets false conclusions in other cases. But so that's the bulk of what happens in the paper. And as Dhruv mentioned, so this nice picture where we have these distinguished functions, that handles an open dense subset of the tropical WRD. And then there are special cases. And then there are special cases where one has to account for special behavior on certain loops. And that's the second big bulk of the tropical part of the paper is dealing with those cases. And there we depend very heavily on rho being at most two. So there's a very limited number of complicated things that can happen. And if a really complicated thing happens on one loop, then on the rest of the Then, on the rest of the graph, everything behaves like the vertex of weighting case. So you can isolate the difficulty. For the vertex of weighting case, in fact, we can do G6G plus 3 for all genus, regardless of relative ways. Okay. I think that's it. So thank you. Questions? I can say something about lower chip in general. I think might happen in lower chip. Oh, these are ideas that I learned from Gabby. Gabby, is it okay to roughly say these things? Okay, so in genus 20 and 21, there are conjectural descriptions of loci that seem like plausible candidates for divisors of small slope, but they are of different nature. So it would be maybe you have some linear series where the image is contained in some positive dimensional space of quadratic. Some positive dimensional space of quadrics, but then there might be a codimension one locus where the rank of where the smallest rank of the quadrant drops. Or there might be a locus where there's a syzygy among the quadrics that contain the image. So when you can construct numerical parameters for g equals 20 and 21, where you get an expected codimension one locus in mg, and where it seems plausible that And where it seems plausible that those divisors should have very small slope. These particular methods aren't good enough for that. One could imagine either a variant on these methods or something non-tropical, some other degeneration method or something else entirely. But there are at least candidates for loci that would make M20 and M21. Um you have this very large number of cases that you have to go through. Is it conceivable that if you so but you were saying this is for non-realized, not necessarily realizable like is it is there a chance that by imposing realizability you could you know maybe wouldn't need to have to be positive. I think the important thing I want to say is is that realizability does Is that realizability does not help? That these algorithms are entirely based on the combinatorial properties of the piecewise linear functions that come from this sort of valuated Matroid property plus the Baker-Morgan condition. And so you gain nothing by imposing some sort of realizability. And in fact, I would argue that you gain something by throwing all of that away. Throwing all of that away and just working combinatory. And so even in the tropical linear series, you have the associated combinatorial data. So this Young Tableau or a sequence of partitions, and the algorithms take that combinatorial input and they tell you what to do at the next step based on that combinatorial data. That combinatorial data. So there's various parameters that have to be chosen, but they're chosen by a formula that depends on the tableau or the sequence of partitions. And there are expressions that let Z be the second smallest number that does not appear in the union of the first two rows. But it's just there is an algorithm that makes this work. An algorithm that makes this work. And as I said before, where the fact that you can choose these parameters to make these things work is delicate, because if you varied the parameters so that the images of the curves are contained in quadrics, then it is impossible to carry out the analogous argument. Same again.
