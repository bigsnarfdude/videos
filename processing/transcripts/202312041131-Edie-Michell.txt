With Noah, that we started over the summer when he was visiting UNH. So, this is a recent project, so there's still things working out. Things they label theorem are things we have full written down proofs for. There's also some conjectures, but these are the conjectures that we believe we can work out and are still writing proofs up. Right, so I'm going to talk about how to get diagrammatics for conformal embeddings. And let me just give a quick highlight of my results. So, what we can do. So, what we can do, or what we want to study, are the tensor categories related to conformal embeddings. And we're able to come up with a bunch of techniques for understanding these categories, which before were not so well understood. We're still testing out how strong these techniques are, but the consensus seems to be that we can do this for any infinite family of conformal getting. Yeah, these are all going to be manifest, the unitary. Mm-hmm. Yeah, these are all going to be manifestly unitary because we're working with component embeddings. Yep, and I can show you some at the end of the talk. Ah, different diagrammatics, but I guess. We're going to focus on type A. So we, in particular, study this component embedding. And we construct the tensor category corresponding to each of these, which is a discrete family. And in fact, we can interpolate these to obtain a one. We can interpolate these to obtain a one-parameter continuous family of new tensor categories. And the street values of the parameter, these specialize to give the corresponding categories here. So how do we do it? We're going to give a description via a diagonal presentation. And this is just a powerful technique for understanding tensor categories. Because in general, understanding the morphisms of tensor category is extremely hard. Instead, you want to focus on a nice subcategory. On a nice subcategory. And following Vaughan Jones, the best way to do this is via the planar approach. You pick your favorite object, X, and this is a choice, and you want to make a nice choice. And once you make this choice, you then look at the hom spaces between tens of powers of this object. It's no longer either permanent complete, but if you choose your object nice enough, then you can just take the TRUBY completion, and this will recover the entire category. And usually, And usually, but most of the time, if this object is picked nice enough, you get a nice diagnostic presentation, your category, that makes it very simple to understand. And makes working with a difficult category much, much easier. So, let's look at a couple of quick examples for this. The easiest one is category of Z mod 2-graded vector spaces. Yeah, you can pick your favorite object, could be the G-graded vector space, and then, well, the vector. And then, well, the diagram presentation just consists of your Dreli morphisms. These generate everything. So it's all things you can build out of the Drelli morphisms modulo these two relations, which collapse it down massively. These just mean that every comm space is either zero or one-dimensional. It's a nice simple example. More complicated ones. So another category that's extremely interesting is representations of the quantum groove SLN. Quantum groove SLN. And this is a high category, but it turns out the diagrammatics are extremely nice. So if you pack the vector representation, then the planar algebra generated this, is generated by the braid, and then intertwine it from the vector representation, tens of itself, n times, to the tens of unit. And it's worked out by Karvjan and Benzel that you have these relations here between the generators, then these, this relations. Then this recovers the planar algebra. So, this is a great diagonal presentation of this category. And it turns the hard thing into something that, in my mind, is much, much easier to work with. And if you want, you can find the unemployments and centralized algebra's presentation, and you'll recover your quantum group category. Right, so we're going to take the same idea and apply it to categories coming from conformal embeddings. Conformal embeddings. So, what do I mean by this? Well, for me, a conformal embedding is going to be an inclusion of Vertex operator operators. And we're going to restrict the subclass where both of these VOAs are WCW models. So, you have inclusions of the GK VOA into the H, which necessarily has to have level 1 VOA. And these give us Tyler objects in the representations of this guy, which by Kajan Lucus. Which by Kajdan-Lustig is the same as the representations of a semi-simplified walking group. What's the idea? Well, take the big VLA and you can restrict it to get a representation of this thing. And the general theory says that this will be the tile algebra object and the representations the smaller vertex of quake algebra. Right, so here's a quick example: SL3 level 5 embeds into SL6 level 1. SL6 level 1, and once you translate through all of the theory, this gives you this algebra object and the representations of SL3 and level 5. Right, and this means we get tensor categories. We have an etile algebra object, then we can look at the A modules in the base category for them. Here's a new tensor category. And these are not so well known. The conformal embeddings. Conformal embeddings, these have been well studied. Mean that we understand in good detail what each of these electrical objects look like. But to actually get the structure of the A modules, this is much, much more difficult. And so this is what I want to address with this program. I want to use diagrammatic techniques to completely understand these categories. Alright, so before we carry on, just point out that. Before we carry on, just point out that there are lots and lots of examples of conformal embeddings. These worked out by Shellikins and Vorner, and then we have this great list by Davidov, Nuger, Nick Shipp, and Austral. And so we have all of these. Some infinite example, infinite families up here, and then sporadic examples down here. Yeah, I couldn't fit it in a nice way. The key idea is just the scale of it. So every one of these. For every one of these, there is a new tensor category that deserves to be understood. And so, I'm going to focus on just one of these families. The techniques are much, much more general. We're not quite sure how broad it works for, but we're pretty certain it's going to work for all infinite examples of conformal embeddings, which in my mind is strong. Alright, so what's the program? It's exactly what I said. And this was actually first studied by J. First, studied by Jing Wei Wu, which is to study these corresponding categories to the conformal embeddings. So he studied these infinite families here, and he was able to obtain a really nice diagrammatic presentation for the corresponding intensive category. In fact, I can draw it quickly here. He says, take the standard SLN diagrammatics, you think of as generated by a braid, and you want to add in one more morphism. Which gives a self-duality from the vector representation to its dual. There's going to be new relations between these morphisms, and the idea is if you want to pull the self-duality through a grade, you get i times the same thing, but with this dot. Now that's basically backwards. Right, so this is the idea. How do we So, this is the idea. How do we extend the diagrammatics for quantum SLN to take into account these new categories? And often they're really, really nice, as we can see here. This was also done for the two sporadic conformal embeddings, SL2 level 10 into SL5 level 1, and SL2 at level 28 into G2 level 1, by Stephen Bigelow and some work from 2010. Barry obtains extensions of the AA. Of the AN planar algebras by some new generators. It's not quite as pretty as this relation, but the same idea, still problems. Alright, so how do you understand this? This should be hard. There's new categories here. We don't want to have to study all of these A modules. So there's going to be a few observations. And so we're going to focus on this family of polynomials for now, but these techniques are going to work much more generally. Going to work much more generally. So, the first observation is we have the free module functor. So, take an object of the base tensor category and tensor it by the algebra object A. That's an A module, so we get this functor here. It's not full, but it is faithful. And this means we can just import all the previous diagrammatics from quantum SLN into a new category. They're there from this function. And we already see that right here in Yijing Wei's example. You see that right here, and Yijing Wei's example. We get the braid, but it's not full. There's going to be new stuff. How do we understand new stuff? And we do this, some of the new stuff, by studying the local modules. This is a subcategory of the category of all A modules, and they're ones that play super nice with the breathing. And for the case of W easy W conformal embeddings, these are completely undisturbed. These are completely understood. They're just the representations of the corresponding super vertex operator algebra at level one, and these are completely understood. To any of these, we know exactly what the diagrammatics of this category apply. So in this particular example, where we look at SLN divided into SON squared minus 1, we always get a VECZ mod2 subcategory. Right. And that means we have VECZ mod2 diagram. Beck Zmod2 diagrammatics and the new thing. And so now we know two things. We have the old quantum SLN diagrammatics and we have some new BEC ZMod2 diagrammatics. The question is, how do these play with each other? Right now, as far as I understand them, these two things are completely disjoint. We want to figure out how they work. And so, how do we do that? Well, it turns out this was hidden inside the modular variant. Hidden inside the module invariant this entire time. What's the module invariant tell us? Well, it tells us how to decompose local modules into objects of x category. You can translate that using induction and restriction into saying exactly how local modules interplay with the free module factor. And so, these modular invariants, these have been worked out in great detail by Kat and Mokamoto, and you can look at the And you can look at the one for this example, or for any module, any conformal embedding that you care about, and you can see how the diagrammatics of local modules will interplay with the base diagrammatics you started with. And so in the case of this one, we see that the vec C mod2 subcategory, which we get from the local modules, well, the non-trivial simple object in that has to be a sum and of the vector tens of the vector joule under the free module k. Under the free morphological technical requirement. Right, that doesn't seem like much, but it tells us something. It tells us that there's now a new morphism in the endomorphism space of this object here. So this gives us the following diagramatics. And this is our first definition. And notice here, Q is going to be generic. We're not specializing to the Q that corresponds to the conformal embeddings. The conformal embeddings. What do we have? We have the braid that we get from the free module functions that exists in quantum SLN, and then we have this projection onto the non-trivial object and the vector mod2 subcategory. From the modulo invariant, we know has to be of this form. Right, and from here, we get a whole bunch of stuff just the freak. And this relation, this relation, this relation, and this relation, these just come from the This relation, these just come from the fact that this forms a category equivalent to VEC Z mod 2. And then this one here, this is the only one that is not immediate, but this just follows from general theory. The category of A modules in the braided tensor category is not necessarily graded. In fact, it very rarely is. But it is half-graded, meaning it plays well the grading only with one naturality, not with both. So this thing is. Not with both. So this thing is not going to be branded, but it has this lovely, lovely heart recognition. All right. And so these are things we just have to have from what we're seeing so far. We can kind of think of this as like the free extension of the category generated agree, satisfying the SLN relations, bimorphism of this formed, which generates a vet Z mod 2 subcategory. There could be more morphisms, but what we can prove is, in fact, these are completely sufficient to describe. Are completely sufficient to describe this category, which is pretty incredible. But we have an evaluation algorithm that shows that the home space is going to be one-dimensional. That's not true in general. That's very nice to this example. Though, there are examples where you said to add a few more relations on top, which you can get pretty easily. Alright, so we have ourselves a tensor category. There are some questions. Does it exist? Does it actually specialize to the thing we suspect it to? The thing we suspect it to. And these are our main theorems. So, first main theorem says that this category is non-trivial for generic Q. And in fact, we give explicit bases for the Holmes spaces, and these are the dimensions of the end of Watson spaces. What's the idea here? Well, by the way we constructed it, we know it's a subcategory of a thing coming from the Jim Formula and therefore it exists. Therefore, it exists at an infinite number of these q's when specialized to certain rates and unity. What's the obstruction to this category existing generically? Well, it's some function in q, and in fact, we can show it's a polynomial in q. And we then know this category exists for an infinite number of points. This polynomial is zero, an infinite number of points. It's identic with zero. This is the idea of Deline interpolation. Of Deline interpolation. This is how Deline constructed his continuous family of symmetric tensor categories where t is not an integer. We do the same trick. We construct these conformal embedding categories at discrete points, and then we show, using delete interpolation, we can continuously interpolate between these categories. So these exist for every single queue, and also the Q a generic variable. Right, our second theorem says that these indeed give us That these indeed give us what we want. Remember, we set out to describe this category of A modules in quantum SLN, where A was the algebra coming from the conformal embedding software page, SLN and S sub of n squared minus 1. We can prove you do have to take a dead translation and a semi-simplification, but if you specialize the parameter to a certain route of unity, you recover exactly what we want it to. Is this the F zero or the F zero zero? Is this rep Z or rep Z? RepZ. This is given by the image of the NT anti-symmetrizer. Because we go back to our definition, we didn't include the map from vector tensor n down to 1. This deck of annotization is exactly adding that back in. How do you get the dimensions in engineering queue? So we look at the specialized queue first, we build an explicit basis for the hot space. Explicit basis for the hom space. And then the lean interpolation says just build a category, what you think is a category with these same hom spaces with diagrammatic composition and tensor product. But the specialized category that exists, it isn't bug one that you know exists? Yep, but we can show that negligibles don't appear until you get to a sufficiently high tensor power. It's exactly the same as Delines argument, but for different categories. That is the hardest part, and it's a very cool thing. I'm gonna get hot now. That's the hardest part, and it's super fun. So, read the paper once it comes out. It's hard. Spanning is easy, linear dependent, we have to use a bunch of tricks. But the idea is we know it comes from the conformal embedding, and we can count dimensions differently, and then minimum and limitable approach. All right, so we'll cover what we set out to get. What we sit out together. And that's our emitting theorem. Right, so we now actually understand this conformal emitting category through this diagonal thing, or at least the item code and completion of it. But now there is another kind of follow-up question. Well, what is the eyempon completion of these two families of diagrammatic chemicals? And lucky for me, I had the world expert in this type of And this type of question, come here to visit me. Though we had different projects in mind when he came to visit. Oh, I actually phrased this question completely wrong the first time we talked. I said pretty much this, and he looked at me where. And I realized, that's not how I talk to Hans. What I say is, Hans, I have these extensions of the Hecke algebras whose representation theory needs to classify. And then he was hoped. He was hooked. And, well, he came up with the following classification. Classification of eye components in our new categories. So, what are these simple objects parameterized by? They're parameterized by strictly decreasing partitions. So, young diagrams where you always drop at least one box moving down, along with a choice assign, but only a choice assign when you're young. Choice assign when your Young diagram has an even number of rows. And furthermore, we get the tensor product rules, the tensoring by the simple object, which is just a simple box with a plus sign, and that gives us this following Rugby diagram, which is the fusion graph for the object box plus in our category. So, this is the generic one. This is the cube generic. Alright, so. Alright, so we also care about the semi-simplified ones where you take the get representation by the rect C subcategory. Right, and this is what we haven't quite proved yet, but we're working on it and we're very confident. And we suspect that you take essentially the same thing, but once you quotient out by negligibles, you now want to restrict to young diagrams that fit in an n minus 1 by n minus 1 box. And this gives you a few. On box. This gives you a fusion category. And you get the same style of tensor product rules, which is just always where the box, QEM diagram. You pick up double edges if you go from odd number of rows to odd number of rows. And, well, this is conjecture now, but it seems to match up with everything that we know about these categories. So we had verified this for n is 3, n is 4, n is 5. For n is 5, we need to work. 5. If the n is 5, we need to work in house Grossman and it all checks out. Now, in this case, we get a subfactor of this index. So, different type of diagrammatics. All right, and if we can prove this, which we're very confident we can, this means we fully understand the categories coming from the conformal embeddings. We have the morphisms, we have the simple objects, we're going to have all the fusion rules. So, we're kind of snuck in from the side. Usually, you have the category that we. From the side. Usually you have the category to begin with, fully understood, and then you understand the plane algebra structure. Here we did it kind of in reverse. We don't know much about the category at all, but we figured out the diagrammatics from some kind of indirect arguments. We can then fully understand the category by studying those diagrammatics. So that's, well, what we plan to do here. And this is going to give us new tensor categories. So, again, study. Categories. So again, still conjecture, but in the case when, actually, this one is proven, when n is equal to 5, we get a fusion category with this fusion graph. You can see our local modules are here, here, here, and here. And then we get all this other stuff. Just cool. True, but what we start with. All we started with was the knowledge that there was this vet Z mod2 subcategory. The rest just came for free. We leveraged that, and we now fully understand. That and we now fully understand the rest of the category of A molecules. When n is equal to 6, again, now this is conjecture, but we hope to prove it soon, where we get the fusion category with this fusion graph. So again, here are our local modules, and that one there is also a local module, and the rest we obtain just from the undergoing completion of the diagrams. Alright, so that's everything. I think it went a little fast. So that's everything. Cutting it went a little fast. I open us? I woke up. Unitarian for the different values of Q. Oh yeah, I should have mentioned that. So because it came from conformal embeddings, it's manifestly unitary when you look at roots of unity of This thing is unitary, just from the general theory. I think work of Feng Shu proves this. We're equivalent to it, so we must be unitary. So we get an infinite series of subfactors for every single n. I mean, this is known by work of Thing Chu, but now we can explicitly say what they look like. And so one of these impaired in your work, which is this thing here, this is the N is equal to 5 example. But are there any other unitary values, or do you expect them to be any other unitary values? Ah, great question. Great question. So you can't define it at Q as equal to one. So if you look at the relations, going back, what breaks? Oh, I don't know. Sorry. The loop parameter would end up dividing by zero. I should have included the loop parameter, which is one over this thing. Sorry. It's not defined at Q is equal to one, which is usually the other one, which is unitarity. It would be very unlikely it's unitary. Very unlikely it's unitary at any other extent, apart from negative negatives of these ones. Could you do like a real, like some point where Q is large enough and real, like Q greater than one? Could you just write down your basis? Could you just write down what the star is and check that your basis is we have the star, but I mean that sounds like an extremely difficult computation. One confusion category too, but yeah, it'll be infinitely. Category 2. Yeah, it'll be infinite. I mean it'll gonna be this thing. Yeah, and it won't be a hyperfinite type 21 sub vector. And that's what Frank had, you know, he showed that all analysis for every q, you're probably right, play a q greater than one is unitary, but we haven't even thought of that. I mean, we get it for free. So we For free, so we didn't even think about the other ones. It was just immediate, so we're happy to read it with that. So, the doubles of your new series of fusion categories are just going to be delete products? The doubles are boring and undisturbed. It's the old thing, box, the braided opposite of the local modules. So, center's actually null, which is kind of wild. Usually you understand the base category than the center. Everything's opposite here. So, why? So so why do you think they will be unitary for Q greater than one? Because for example the Li basically is for let's say ref S symmetric group S G, they are not unitary for any for any G which is not an integer. So when you make an interpolation, somehow you never have a unitary case. So the unitary case is it's hard to construct ones that grow faster than exponentially, and therefore which are not moderate growth. So say the So say the evidence, and again, this was pure conjecture as to why the unitary for Q is real and greater than one, is the fact that they're extensions of these quantum SLAN categories. And those are known to be unitary for Q is equal to 1. Oh, sorry, Q real strictly bigger than 1. And so it doesn't seem completely crazy to think that these extensions would also be unitary at the same values. Certainly the subcategory. The subcategory, right? But that's also true for synaptic groups. All synaptic groups are unitary, but once you go off integers, it stops being unitary. I think it's different. Quantum groups, it's true. So for quantum groups at Q bigger than 1, they're not branded unitary, but they are monoidally unitary. That's true, yeah, but quantum groups have moderate growth. So I think maybe even there is a theorem that if you're Maybe even there is a theorem that if you have a basic of non-month controls at a certain time, it cannot be unitary. Oh. Okay. Um I wasn't aware of that theorem, but that might suggest that these things are then not unitary. Does this not have moderate growth? It does have. It seems like it has moderate growth, I mean yeah, I mean. I haven't thought about the moderate growth. Seems like it. Like it should be kind of smaller in some sense than regular. In some sense, than regular quantum SLN, which does have moderate growth. N speaks to mean here, yes, yes. Ah, ah, okay, okay, that probably is, that probably is, yeah. If I got it correctly, then you want to get the modular tensor category of the bigger algebra in terms of the smaller one. You can reverse the question. You have the diagrammatic calculus in the other direction and in vain. Can you say that one more time, please? I don't quite understand. We wanted to reconstruct in terms of these local modules one of the modular categories. Modular categories. Yeah, or take the local modules and get the structure of all modules. Yes. Now, you could ask the question: suppose you know everything about the theory associated to the affine Lie algebra G. What do you need to say everything about the theory associated to the Lie algebra H? So G is the smaller, H is the larger? And G is the bigger. G is the bigger. Is the bigger. This is really, really hard. This is like, how do I think of it? It's like moving backwards from condensing in a tail algebra object. And I mean, even think of the easing category. There's an infinite number of things which condense down to give easing. And you want to say, how do we work backwards from that? Well, the number of complicated categories you'd have to describe suggests this problem is extremely hard. Suggests this problem is extremely hard. I think there's been some work. In fact, Kerry, you kind of work in numbers, right? And there is some general theory, but as far as I'm saying, it's not workable in practice. It just works in theory. Yeah. Sorry. So it can be done, but it's theoretically, but I think it's very hard in practice. And for this particular EQ, is it known what the But is it known what the rotting decoring looks like? You said that the objects are labeled by some diagrams, signs, and so on. But is it known what multiplication looks like in these bases? Yes. So this is the multiplication for the simple object consisting of partition one with positive sign. And so here we just label our simple objects, and the graph shows you the tensor product rules. Yeah, for but for here, for two. Yeah, but for general, for two general partitions. Ah, so no, we don't have that yet, but we hope to get it. The information should be here because we have the item codes, but we haven't worked it out in detail yet. But we suspect it can be done, and we hope to get there eventually. Is it related? There was a paper by Jean Duieriu and Chris Rebot, which computations similar kind of case. So, this is for this extension of Quantum SLN. Ours is a different extension, but the same big ideas should hold. Uh-huh. That's a completely different category. Is it commuted between this thing? No. Even this thing and its jewel don't commute in this category. Uh-huh. Okay. Thanks. Okay, let's thank Kane again.
