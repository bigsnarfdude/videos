You're talking about knotted pandelies. Oh, I will let her take you a look. Okay, thanks. Yeah, so sometimes, like when I give Zoom talks, I like write a lot beforehand. And this time I'm trying to like not write basically anything beforehand. So that'll, I don't know, maybe that's better. So I'm going to talk about knotted handlebodies. This is joint with Mark Hughes and Sung Wan Kyum. There's going to be two pieces of motivation before I tell you a theorem to convince you that a theorem statement is intrinsic. To convince you that a theorem statement is interesting. And so one of those is three-dimensional. And this isn't a theorem, this is just like something that happens. So in dimension three, we sometimes find that ciphert surfaces for a knot become isotopical boundary when pushed into B4. So the like maybe like sidebar is that this talk, so in this talk, I'm really more interested in four-dimensional phenomena. So we're interested in 4D. Interested in 4D. And so I'm bringing up like something that happens here that when we have something interesting in 3D, it sometimes becomes trivial in 4D, which is kind of like negative space interesting information. And it's pretty easy to think of just like really silly examples of this happening. So here's one that I think is sort of like the natural one to think of. If I take an unknot in S3 and I consider two genus one ciphered surfaces. Two genus one ciphered surfaces for that unknown, one of which is kind of like the I don't know standard genus one surface, um, and one of them is kind of like a tube that's maybe tied in a non-trivial knot. Um, I find it harder to draw knots like this, but something like this kind of figure eight-shaped tube. Um, and these are two genus one ciphered surfaces in S3. They have the same boundary, but they're definitely not isotopic to each other because the figure eight. Isotopic to each other because the figure eight lies on the blue surface, but it's not a torus knot, so there's no way it lies on the red surface. So these aren't isotopic, even if I don't say rel boundary, but a particular rel boundary. So in some sense, they're like very different ciphered surfaces. And maybe like if I were sort of a not theorist or three-manifold topologist, like maybe I would think the different ciphered surfaces are interesting. But even then, like in this case, I don't think that I would think these two are interesting because they're. Two are interesting because they're compressible, and as a consequence of that compression, like we see that there's kind of a crossing in this blue tube. And if it were possible, so if it were possible to like change this crossing to make sort of the other piece of this torus be like in front. Be like in front, then these two surfaces would become isotopic. So if I could achieve that move by isotopy, right? And in S3, there's not enough room to do that because they're not isotopic. But if I push the interior of these surfaces into the four-ball, so I have, this is how I always draw like my schematic of S3 versus S3 as the boundary of B4. So B4 is like the lower half space. I can't draw very good balls. Good balls. Then I'm saying take our blue surface and push its interior just a little bit into the four ball. Then, when we have on fourth dimension of freedom, I can take this tube that looks like it's in front in this picture, and I'll pull it in the fourth dimension and then push it backwards and bring it back to this time slice. And if I do that, then I'll actually change the crossing by isotopy. Okay, so this is this is something that happens in three dimensions. This is something that happens in three dimensions. We include into four dimensions. This is like maybe a not a very interesting example of it, but it is a time in which we can very explicitly see that something that was interesting became uninteresting with an extra dimension added. And they're actually like very interesting examples of this. So here's a picture of what's going to be two Ceifert surfaces for one knot. So on the left, I went ahead and drew the Ceifert surface because this one's pretty easy to see. I have three like pink disks glued to three blue discs. Glued to three blue disks. And they're glued along one, two, three, four, five, six, seven places. So this is a genus one ciphered surface for whatever this knot is. So genus one. And I'll just claim that this knot is non-trivial. We could compute like, I don't know, basically anything about it and determine that this is not the unknot, like it's Alexander polynomial. So that means that this is definitely a minimum genus surface. So it's sort of already more interesting than these. So it's sort of already more interesting than these ones I drew here. So I drew the same knot on the right. I'm going to pretend that these are identified, but I wanted to draw a second Seifert surface for that knot and not have the picture be terrible and compare those two surfaces. So let's see. Can I make this bigger? Sometimes I can. So I wanted to draw this surface in real time because if you just see the picture of it, sometimes it's hard to like imagine what the surface is. It's kind of helpful to like see it up here, I think. Up here, I think. So, I'm going to construct the ciphert surface by first starting off by adding two boundary components temporarily. So, and this like sort of pink circle and a blue circle kind of like wraps around here. And then I'm going to start building a surface where I'm going to start at this like pink circle and have some like pink surface like this and have it come through the blue hole. Okay. Okay, so I just made like a pink annulus. And then it's going to flip over and extend along like a long tail, like how the other surface did, sort of tied in this trefoil knot, and then come through the pink hole and end at the blue. So this is an annulus with an extra hole. It's like a disc with two discs deleted. And this is not a Ciphered surface for a knot because I added the pink and blue boundaries, but I can turn it into a Cephered surface for a knot by. Surface for a naught by adding a tube whose boundary is the pink and blue circle. Okay, so this is an example that I think is due to Alfred. He was constructing two minimum genus ciphered surfaces. So these are both genus one surfaces for a knot, which are so different. Not even like, it's not just that they're not isotopic or not isotopic row boundary. They're complements. They're not even homeomorphic. So these are like wildly different. So, these are like wildly different. So, in particular, not isotopic draw boundary. And the funny thing is that while it's much harder to see in this example, the same phenomenon happens as in the other case. If I include the interiors of these surfaces, if I push them a little bit into the foreball, these two ciphered surfaces actually also become Isotopic and B4. But it's not and change it in the fourth dimension. It actually is, in some sense, not difficult to prove that these two surfaces are isotopic, but it kind of depends on what you're going in with, right? We have various ways of describing surfaces in B4, and just literally drawing this surface and pushing it in is like a totally fine way. But if you think about surfaces often, you might know some other systems. Often you might know some other systems for drawing surfaces. And if you're comfortable with those, then actually constructing the isotopy here is not too difficult. I drew the picture of it, but if you don't know what these pictures mean, you don't know what these pictures mean. And it would take like a lot of thought to like figure out how you would show an isotopy. So I just wanted to illustrate that this is not like a general phenomena. So not really general. The isotopy is somehow, but these surfaces are isotopic in B4 with an isotopy that's somehow like very special to these surfaces. And this was first observed by Chuck Livingston. But he actually showed that not only are these two ciphered surfaces isotopic, Only are these two ciphered surfaces isotopic, lots of examples of different genus G ciphered surfaces for knots and this 3 became isotopic when you pushed in B4, and he constructed like different isotopies between them. So there's not like a pattern, but somehow overwhelmingly examples of different sephered surfaces become isotopic when you push in the four ball, which is kind of weird. And so here's a really, I think, interesting open question in dimension three. So the question is, does there exist a knot with two different genes? Exist a knot with two different genus G ciphered surfaces so that those ciphered surfaces don't become isotopic when you push them into the four wall. And so I heard this question from Peter Teichner last summer, but it was, I don't think he was like stating it as like an original question. It felt like he'd thought about it for a while. So I don't know who to attribute it this to. If I could answer this question, I would ask Peter Techner if it was his question or someone else's. So he's like the viable candidate, maybe. And I think this is really interesting. And I think this is really interesting, and I have no idea how to answer it. And it's kind of funny because, you know, we do. So, some notes. We do have invariants of surfaces in the four-ball, like in theory. The one that I think is like most likely to be familiar to people in this audience is that there's like the notflora Kavanov maps that you can associate to a surface. Maps that you can associate to a surface. So, like, in theory, I don't know, maybe you could use those to distinguish two ciphered surfaces, even when pushed in before. But then it's just a matter of like, whenever we have invariants, they're usually like either hard to compute or when you can compute them, they sort of like obviously fail in reasonable examples. So, in addition to not really knowing which invariants I think you would use to try to disprove this question, or well, try to, I don't know which direction it is, but to try to prove that there is a pair of interesting ciphered surfaces that don't become isotopic. I don't even have like a proposed pair. The literature is like full of examples of ciphered surfaces for knots that aren't the same. There's like this like cocky-mizu complex of minimum genus ciphered surfaces for a knot. Genus ciphered surfaces for a knot, and it's very well studied, but somehow it's very well studied by one group of people, and then there's another group of people who think about four-dimensional topology, and that group does like not intersect very much. So it's kind of like not well organized into here's some ones that we think stay different in B4. So, I don't know. I think this is a really interesting problem, and it is related to kind of a funny conjecture that I heard from Peter Feller, which is so. Which is so conjecture. If I glue two ciphered surfaces for a single knot to make a closed surface in S4, glue to make closed in S4. So this, I mean, we have our S3, which I told you is a boundary of B4. The upper half space in this picture could also be Half space, and this picture could also be thought of as before. So, this is my favorite picture of the four-dimensional sphere. And if I have two Seifert surfaces with the same boundary, then I could push one of them a little bit into this lower four-ball and another one a little bit into this upper four-ball and glue them along that common boundary to get a closed surface in S4. And Peter thinks that the resulting surface is unknotted. Which in this dimension means bounce a handle body, a solid of genus whatever. So this is related to this conjecture on the left or this question on the left, because if sigma one and sigma two are isotopic, then their union Um, then their union, uh, when viewed as a closed surface in SVAR is unknotted because then I can think of that as like sigma one doubled, and it'll bound sigma one times I. And like a surface with boundary times I is a handle body. Um, so neither of these questions like imply the other, but there's definitely a relationship. This conjecture of Feller is a sub-question of what's called the unknotting conjecture. Of what's called the unknotting conjecture. I guess I will say that we know this is true locally flatly for a genus equal to zero by Friedman or greater than two by Conway-Powell. But we don't know anything smoothly. Maggie, there's a question for the room. Yeah. So Yeah. So just to help me understand Feller's conjecture, if I took a slice knot that was not double slice, and then in the one disc glued on the sliced disc on the other four disc glued on the sliced disc, I get a two sphere. But that wouldn't be if the knot's not doubly sliced, that Not doubly slice, that two-speeder wouldn't be unknotted. What am I missing? This is specific to ciphert surfaces from S3 that are pushed into the four-ball. So yeah, this is very restrictive. In particular, that means that all of the surfaces we get this way, the complement will have infinite cyclic fundamental group. And that's why it's what I said. I said it was a subcase of the unknotting conjecture. And the unknotting conjecture. Unknotting conjecture. And the unknotting conjecture is the conjecture that any oriented surface in S4, whose complement has cyclic fundamental group, should be unknotted. And we know that that's true locally flatly, except for genus 1 and 2. And we don't know it smoothly at all. So this is kind of like an easy version of this conjecture, where in addition to cyclic fundamental group, we have like, it's a very simple surface. It's like almost an S3. And the uh the timely power result holds when the closed surface is genus three or more, right? Yeah, so this would be about the this should hold for genus two ciphered surfaces. Well, that's kind of tricky because well, genus two ciphered surfaces are it's like closed results don't imply boundary results, right? Um, like Friedman showed that two spheres with group Z in S4 are topologically isotopic. Topologically isotopic. But I think it took a lot more work than that for Anthony and Mark to later show that any two disks for one knot in B4 with group Z are topologically isotopic real boundary. There's like something extra that went into that. So somehow on the right, I'm saying that as long as this glued genus is at least three, we'll know the closed surface is isotopic to the unknot, but maybe that isotopy sort of messes up the middle cross-section. Yeah, so this is kind of the three-dimensional motivation of what I want to talk to you about, which is just keep in mind that we have all these examples of cipher surfaces becoming kind of trivial when pushed into B4, but it's an open question of whether or not this always happens. So then here's the motivating 4D theorems. Let me add some blank space. We're not looking at that. So this is a theorem. Um, so this is a theorem that's going to seem totally unrelated, and it kind of is, um, that Ryan Budney and Dave Gabay proved like the end of 2019, start of 2020. Uh, so I just wrote 2020, um, where they showed that there exist three balls, so now we're up one dimension, so uh, I'll call this B three balls in S4 with the same boundary. Boundary that are not isotopic raw boundary. So I'll explain what the connection is to the like previous three-dimensional version. So we've went from Seifert surfaces up to Seifert solids. So now we're sort of studying codimension one, but one dimension up. This statement I think is really remarkable. You can compare this to the situation in S3, where in S3, any two disks. Where in S3, any two disks in S3 that have the same boundary are isotopic pro boundary, and that's pretty easy to prove if you know the Schoenfley's theorem in dimension three. This is that every two-sphere, this is all smooth, every smooth two-sphere in S3 bounds S3 ball. Because then if I have an unknot that bounds two like different disks inside of S3, they probably intersect each other. But using the Champ Lis theorem, I can get rid of these intersections. I just take an innermost circle. I just take an innermost circle. So I have like sort of a disc in the red and a disc in the blue, and these glue to make a two-sphere. And I know by showing please that it bounds a three-ball. So I can use that three-ball to like isotope this one of these discs off the other. So I'll just isotope the red one past that three ball. So now it's disjoint from blue. So remove all the intersections. And now I have two discs whose interiors are disjoint and they glue to. Are disjoint and they glue to a two-sphere. So that two-sphere bounds a ball, and I can use that to isotope D1 to agree with D2. So, I mean, this is like a really standard innermost circle argument. So, the fact that this isn't true in dimension four does not imply that the Schoenfleys conjecture is false, but it's certainly like related to the Chamfleys conjecture. And I think that's like the motivation of this theorem, as Ryan Bunny, Dave Gubby are here. So, I guess they'll know more than me. So, I guess they'll know more than me. Okay, so this is kind of like the four-dimensional theorem. And I want to compare this to like, why was I just talking about Seifert surfaces? So I, there's no way in this talk that I'm going to tell you exactly what these two three balls are, but I will show you like a schematic and like kind of explain what the schematic means. So this looks very intimidating if you've never seen their paper before, but Their paper before, but schematically, what we should think: so here's like a schematic: one of the three balls. So, if I call these guys like B1 and B2, so I'll call this like B1, corresponds to this like gray plane. So, I've drawn everything down a dimension. So, I'm sort of drawing in S4, and this like gray plane is supposed to represent a three-ball. And I've sort of made it like the simplest possible three ball. Like, it's going to be my reference three ball. It's not interesting. And I'm going to construct a second three ball that's interesting. So B2 is obtained from B1 by doing something, a sort of standard surgery called ambient Dane surgery on B1. And we're going to somehow use. And we're going to somehow use that surgery. These red and blue curves indicate discs. And this is the part that I will definitely not try to explain because I've seen both of them give talks about it. And I think like one time at Beers, Dave Gabby gave a talk about this. And this was like, it takes a long time to explain what they are. Like, I can't do it in this talk. But I drew this picture so you could kind of see like, it looks a lot like those genus one ciphered surfaces for the unknot that I drew before, where these are. Where these are linked together in this picture. I sort of have, like, whatever these red and blue mean, I see that these are clasped, and I don't have enough like dimension of freedom to get rid of the clasp. So in fact, even though this construction is kind of complicated, it is very explicit. And if you know what it is, it's kind of immediate to show that if you push from S4 to the bounded B5 and add an extra dimension of freedom, so push. Extra dimension of freedom, so push interiors into B5, then we can actually get rid of all of the clasping. Here, the red and blue are kind of trivial. And we can conclude, if we understand what the surgery argument is, that B1 and B2 are actually isotopic rel boundary. So again, So again, we have this like weird phenomena of two very different seemingly objects in one dimension in S4 becoming kind of uninteresting when we include them into one higher dimension, so a bounded B5. And again, like I can't give like a general principle for why that happens. The only way I know that these are isotopic is that I can draw a picture of them and see the isotopy, just like the cipher surfaces that I showed before. And so it And so, in addition, like, so this is like, I think, really interesting. Like, their examples kind of fit in with what we expect for cipher surfaces. It's like nice to see that consistency, right? But in addition, this theorem is pretty particular to three balls. The The sort of motivating idea is to write a three-ball as a two-parameter family of intervals and then actually study embeddings of intervals and like look at pi two of that sort of embedding space. And so you can't do that with another three-manifold. But there's like an obvious conjecture in addition to this weird thing in B5. So the obvious conjecture is that there should exist Genus G for every G handlebodies H1 and H2 with the same boundary in S4 that are not isotopic real boundary. And one extra condition that I have to write to make this interesting. So I didn't state the whole conjecture yet because State the whole conjecture yet because, as I've written it, like this is obviously not true. Actually, if you haven't seen me give a talk before, can anybody like do you have an example for why what I've written this conjecture is obviously not true? I'd be impressed. Okay, here's the answer for why it's so far it's obviously not true. Um, let's just take like the standard sort of Taurus sitting inside of S3, sitting inside of S3. Sitting inside of S3, sitting inside of S4. It bounds two very clear handle bodies in this picture. There's like the one that looks compact and the one that looks non-compact, right? So I can include both of these into S4. And these are two handle bodies with the same boundary, but they definitely aren't isotopic real boundary because they're not even homeomorphic rel boundary. So that's kind of cheating. So let's say Cheating. So let's say H1 is homeomorphic rel boundary to H2. So this is the conjecture that we should have these sort of like knotted handlebodies where the knotting is really like an isotopy obstruction. It's not about like this, this handle body as a manifold. It's something about how it's embedded in S4. And again, I think that this is surprising, just like the ball case, because balls are basically zero-dimensional. You know, balls are basically zero-dimensional, they sort of shouldn't be interesting in S4. Handlebodies are basically one-dimensional. I think they still shouldn't be interesting in S4. But this is this is almost the theorem that Mark and Sungwon and I proved in like December, it's been a few months, where we showed for all G at least two, there exists H1 and H2 as in One and H2, as in this conjecture. So we can answer this except for we can't do g equals one, and we also can't do g equals zero, but that was the Gabbai-Budney case, but we really can't recover that. But moreover, the weird thing is, and RH1 and H2 do not become isotopic when you push them into B5. Push them into B5. And this is the part that I think is like really surprising because I spent the sort of like first 10 minutes of the talk telling you that we don't have examples of this in dimension three, like sort of two ciphered surfaces that don't become isotopic in B4. It feels wrong to me that we would have an example in this dimension first. Like, doesn't it seem like obstructing things from being the same in B4? Being the same in B4 would be easier than B5. Like B5 sounds kind of scary. But I think that this is like really interesting. So here's some comments. The like just in case like somebody always asks, the Budney Gubai paper is in the smooth category. I don't know this embedding space stuff very well. So like I don't know how plausible it would be to just restate everything locally flat. I have no idea. Just restate everything locally flat. I have no idea. But it's definitely written in the smooth category. Ours are in HKM. The embeddings are smooth. So we have smooth handlebodies. But the isotopy obstructions are locally flat. So they're not even locally flatly isotopic, which on one hand is like kind of good. Like, kind of good because that means they're extremely different to not even be locally flatly isotopic. But now, if you wanted to try to construct like exotic handlebodies, you'd want a smooth obstruction. And at least the techniques that I know from this paper are like never smooth. So I have no idea, like, sort of what you would do if you wanted to just obstruct smooth isotopy. And the thing that I really like is that. Is that the genus N examples come from the genus N minus one examples by attaching a trivial tube? So you have some sort of weird pair of handle bodies of, that's like a remarkably bad picture. Remarkably bad picture. You have a weird pair of handle bodies of genus two. I'll just draw their boundary. And we get two genus three handlebodies by just taking the first two and then attaching like a small three-dimensional two. Which, if you think about knotted surfaces often, I think this sounds wrong because usually, like, if you add a bunch of tubes to things, they become the Bunch of tubes to things they become the same. It's like a stabilization operation. So it's kind of surprising for them to remain not isotopic, even when pushed into B5. So somehow they're very different from each other. Okay, so here's the sort of like vague strategy. So for the rest of the talk, I'm basically just going to tell you like some of my favorite theorems in topology that we like got to use in order to prove this. So the strategy is to like, So, the strategy is to, like, I don't know, know something about handle bodies in S4 at least. And then, like, if we want to prove something about inclusion into B5, we should know, like, you know, when is something in B5 isotopic to something in S4? And then if we're going to think about B5, we're going to have to abstract three-dimensional things in B5 from being isotopic to each other. So, just like at least find like at least one theorem about each of these things, and then just like, you know, sort of like hope they match up. Like, hope they match up and that we can prove a theorem. And that's that was that's genuinely the strategy. That's genuinely, I think, what happened. Okay, so here's here's my second favorite theorem. We're gonna like work up to it. So let me add a page. So my second favorite theorem is this theorem by Hiroshi, which I think is like very underrated. And he studied, so let So let sigma g be a genus G surface in S4, which is unknotted, by which I mean it bounds a handlebody. So there's only one of these surfaces up to isotopy, because there is only one handlebody in S4 up to isotopy if you don't have to fix the boundary. Hiroshi showed that showed that whether an arbitrary surface automorphism can be extended to an ambient diffeomorphism of all of S4 is determined by whether phi preserves a certain quadratic form. On the surface first homology. This is called the rock lean form. And I'll tell you what the form is. And it will be like sort of obvious that in order to extend phi, it has to preserve this form. And the surprising thing is that that's enough. Like, so the reason I really like this theorem is that it never works. I really like this theorem is that it never works out that way in dimension four. You know, you sort of have like, oh, this should be what's true, and like, actually, it is what's true. That's good. So the form Q of like, so a first homology element, it's going to be represented by a simple closed curve on my surface. So here's C, maybe, is determined by taking a Is determined by taking a disk that is bounded by this curve. So D, whose boundary is C. And D, since it's a disk, this is going to induce a framing on C. And our surface, sigma G, also induces a framing on C. And C is a curve in S4. So it's possible. S4. So it's possible framings, like it's a curve. So its framings are going to be a loop in, like, there's three normal vectors. So SO3. So framings of curves correspond to pi one elements of SO3. So there are two possible framings of a curve. And I have two framings here, and they could either be the same or they could be different. So Q of C is zero if these are the same and one if And one, if different. So here's an example. Do my same genus 2 surface. Let's consider like this blue curve and this red curve. So geometrically, what I should do, I'll just take a disk, maybe bounded by this red curve, and I'm going to try to push that disk off of itself while keeping the boundary on the surface. So I'll just push to like this parallel disk here. Parallel disk here while keeping the boundary on the surface. And if I can do that and actually like push the disk off itself, then that means that they induce the same framing. So I can push off. So Q is actually equal to zero. And the same thing with this particular blue curve that I drew. They're sort of the like obvious disk. And I can push it like, I don't know, a little bit backwards, keep the boundary on the surface, and actually push the disk off itself. And actually push the disk off itself. So here, Q is equal to zero. But on the other hand, I'm going to take the sort of 1-1 curve that I would get by, you know, gluing the red and the blue curves together with some orientation, like this. And this also bounds like an obvious disc in this picture. But if I try to push it off of itself, like while keeping the boundary on the surface, the pushed-off disc, so push. So, push off boundary would be another copy of this green curve, slightly pushed off the first one. And in this example, that looks like a hop flank. So, the orange-like curve also bounds a disk, but it's going to intersect the one bounded by the green in exactly one point. So, here I can't actually do the push-off, so Q is one. And that checks out for it being a quadratic form because, like, Quadratic form because, like, the red and the blue curves intersected once, so, like, I should get one. Um, and so it's clear that, um, you know, if I were going to have a diffeomorphism of S4 and it sent like this blue curve to this green curve, that would be bad because it would send a disk bounded by the blue curve to a disk bounded by the green curve, and like that would be a contradiction. So, it's definitely an obstruction, and then it's just remarkable that that's enough. Um, and I think this theorem is like very underrated for how useful it is. Like, very underrated for how useful it is. So, um, here's like my actual favorite theorem. Uh, this one is not underrated, but I do think it's still very good. And we're going to see how this relates to this Hiroshi, this Hirosai claim. So, here's the theorem. It's going to look unrelated. And maybe you've seen this before. Every two-sphere in S4 bounds a three-ball in B5. In B5, a smooth three-ball, if it's a smooth two-sphere. So, if you're a knot theorist, this is like bizarre because you know, knots, most knots don't bound disks into B4. And we're saying sliceness is just like not interesting when you go up one dimension. So, every two-sphere in S4 is slice. And I really love the proof of this Kervair's proof. I'll tell you, like, sort of like how it goes. Like, obviously, I'm not going to. Of, like, how it goes. Like, obviously, I'm not going to tell you the proof, but Cerver's idea is to literally construct a ball. I mean, I guess maybe it's obvious that's what the idea is. But he starts off with whatever his two-sphere is. So, this is our S2. And he knows that it bounds some three-manifold. Some three manifold into B5. So here's my three manifold. Again, like this is my picture of this is how I draw a ball, but now it's just, this is a five-dimensional ball. And Kerbert's observation was that he could perform ambient Dane surgery along a disk, which means that he's going to take some interesting curve in this three-manifold and find a disk that bounces into B5. Disk that it bounds into B5 into the complement of the three manifold and use that disk to change this red three manifold by thickening it to be four-dimensional, deleting a neighborhood of C and replacing it with the rest of the boundary of that four-dimensional thickening. So if we surger, call this Y, Y along a thickened copy of D, then we do Then we do Dane surgery on Y. Okay, so then there's some analysis of like which Dane surgeries can we do and making sure that we can do enough different Dane surgeries to turn our arbitrary three manifold, whatever it is, it's not arbitrary, but whatever it is, into B3. And so, like, that takes some explanation. And I think it is like a very clever proof. But the first time I saw this, Um, but the first time I saw this, I was like a first or second year grad student, and this makes use of spin structures in order to explain, um, in order to explain which stain surgeries we can do. There's like spin structures and framings, and I was like, seems kind of too hard. Like, I'll just think of a different argument. And so I saw this theorem by Hirosei used in like sort of a different context than some of Kawauchi's work. And like, if you just see it, this looks kind of unrelated from the Kerber. Looks kind of unrelated from the Kerber statement, right? This like weird automorphism of surfaces and diffeomorphisms of S4. But here's like a really funny proof of the Kerber theorem, I think. So if we start off with an arbitrary S2, so note, any S2 in S4 can be turned into a positive genus unknot. So a boundary of a positive genus handle body. A genus handle body by attaching some tubes to it to increase its genus. I say note rather than theorem. When you have a knot in S3, you know, you can attach bands to it to turn it into the unknot by just like sort of cutting up a ciphert surface. Same thing. Like if we have a two-sphere in S4 bounds some three-manifold, we can like attach. Some three-manifold, we can like attach tubes to cut up that three-manifold and turn it into a handle body. Um, but this means that, well, here's like another very explicit construction of a of a three-ball. So here's my B5. Here's my S4. Here's my S2. I'm going to start building a three-manifold whose boundary is this S2. So that three-manifold is going to start off as S2 across. Three manifolds going to start off as S2 cross I, like a collar on the boundary, and then a little bit into the five ball, like sort of going down towards the center, I'm going to attach a bunch of solid tubes, like one handles. So, some like solid tubes, and I'm going to attach enough of them and attach them so that. them and attach them so that when I sort of move past the surgery to have a positive genus surface in this cross section, I want to know that this is the unknot. Oops, unknot. Okay, so on this unknot, we have like two favorite curves in this picture, and they're the ones that bounded disks. Bounded disks in our solid tubes. And I know, like, this Ruckling form that was determined by framings has to be two, zero. Two is not an option. It has to be zero on these curves, just because, like, they bounded discs that were in tubes. I look at the framings from those disks and zero. So, the kind of funny thing we could do with Ruckleen, or sorry, with Hiroshi, is: well, these are just two curves. I can like add a few more. I can like add a few more to get a whole basis of my surface where Q is also zero. And I know by Hiroshi that there's a diffeomorphism that takes this genus 2 surface to, let's draw it on this side, Hirose, the unknotted genus 2 surface with sort of actually this embedding. Embedding is the standard picture where those pink and purple curves can become any genus, any Q equals zero. any genus, any any q equals zero curves that I want. So in particular, they could be these two curves and these two curves. So see, I've kind of flipped the roles where here, like there's an obvious handle body that came from these tubes kind of, where purple was the one that bounded discs. But what I'm saying is there's actually, there's also a handle body where pink bounds the discs. So if I pull this So, if I pull this back along this Hirosi diffeomorphism, then there's some sort of pink handle buddy that I could attach to this picture. And when I do that, I'll get a three-manifold that's properly embedded. This two-sphere is like its whole boundary. And I built it by attaching a bunch of one handles and then attaching a handle body, so a bunch of two handles. And I specifically arranged for those to geometrically cancel. Because here I'm attaching two. Cancel because here I'm attaching two handles along the pink curves, and they're going to like geometrically cancel those one handles. So it's at first, this is just like an alternate proof, which as a graduate student, I was kind of like less intimidated by. But I was kind of like, you know, this, this isn't, it's not like interesting, though. This is just like nice because now when somebody asks me, I can actually explain. Nice because now, when somebody asks me, I can actually explain why it's true that they're sliced. So, like, one time I was in the bus with Kent Orr and he asked me to like prove that they were sliced. I was like, oh, thank God. But we were thinking about this like handle body problem, and we realized that this has like a really nice property because it's not just like a three-ball, it's a three-ball with a very explicit embedding. And the Kervair proof also had a very explicit embedding, but this one is like way smaller somehow. So if we look at it, what we really proved, well, Look at it, what we really proved. Well, maybe I'll just like sort of copy my illustration down here. Our three-ball that we constructed, well, first we attached some tubes, which were like one handles. And then I attached a handle body, which is a bunch of two handles and three handles. So it's a handle body. And so we end up with a three ball that has exactly one local minimum, which is like really special and I think also really surprising. So every two Really surprising. So, every two-sphere in S4 bounds a three-ball with one local minimum, and we can even count the number of index one and two points is the number of tubes needed to unknot the two-sphere. Okay, so I'm gonna just, it's just kind of cool. It's like, okay, this is a theorem about how to construct something that's through. About how to construct something that's three-dimensional in B5. And it's like very simple somehow as an embedding. So that's kind of good. And the reason that this sort of like popped up when we were talking about these handlebodies is like one minimum is actually like really useful because like here's a related observation. Like if you wanted to construct some handlebodies in S4 and know something about them when you push them into B5, that's pretty hard. I think what you actually want That's pretty hard. I think what you actually want to do is construct some antibodies in B5 and like hope you can push them into S4. Like, that sounds much more plausible to me. So, the related observation is that if H in B5 is a properly embedded handlebody, so genus G handlebody, which has exactly one local minimum with respect to radial height, G. Radial height, G index one points, and zero index two or three, then in fact, H is isotopic, or I guess I'll say H is boundary parallel, meaning that I can isotope it to lie actually in the boundary S4. So here's the picture. It's going to look a lot like the other pictures I drew. I have S4, I have B5, and I'm saying I'm going to. I have B5, and I'm saying I have a handle body which has exactly one local minimum. So, sort of a, I'll thicken this up to be a whole three-ball, but like a deepest point in the five ball. So it comes up a little bit. And then some index one critical points. And I'll just have all of those in one height. So these are going to look like solid tubes. And then no other critical points. So it's just going to go like straight up. Then in fact. Then, in fact, this is isotopic to one that's actually an S4. And in the picture, it looks kind of like obvious. I just push up. Of course, like maybe I didn't draw a general enough picture. But the point here, this is just kind of like a coincidence of dimension. The interesting parts of this picture are these tubes that I attached. Like, that's the only time that I could do something interesting, basically. And well, these are tubes attached in S4. attached in s4 to the boundary of an unknotted two sphere so they're attached in a pi one equals z manifold um and like they're attached along they're like attached on the boundary so in fact uh any choice of like sort of core of this tube all those arcs are homotopic to each other which means they're isotopic to each other because i'm in four dimensions so there's there's a unique tube that you can attach so this is the this is actually like an accurate picture um So it kind of like it's nice because here I know that I could get a lot of three balls that have one minima. And like if I could just sort of do something to get rid of the other critical points, then I'll get handle bodies that have one minima. And I'll know that they're like sort of actually an S4. So then here's how we're going to construct some interesting handle bodies in B5. I'm going to start off in S4 because that's much more comfortable. Much more comfortable, um, which is like some two-sphere, and I'll have to decide later which two-sphere this should have been. So, here's S2. Um, and I know by this like modified Curvair theorem that I bound a three-ball into B5. So this is a B3 inside of B5, which specifically has sort of one index zero point, so call this. Index zero point, so call this like index zero, and then some number of index one and two. And then I let's let's just like try to construct some kind of manifold. I'm just going to double this picture. So, all together, I've constructed an S3 sitting inside of S5. But if we look at the critical But if we look at the critical points in this S3, so these B3s, I have zero, ones, twos, and when I double, I get one, two, three. The like most critical points are not in ascending order. So the very natural thing to do is to do isotopy to this picture, sort of mess up the middle, but pull all the index one points down and the index two points up and like make it be an ascending order. So I'll do isotopy. And I'll still have my S3, and it's going to have a unique minimum and a unique maximum, and then like some numbers of index one and two points. And so now maybe you see the relationship to this observation about handle bodies. I said that if you had a handle body in B5 with a one minimum and some index one point. A one minimum and some index one points, and that's it, then it is boundary parallel. So now here, this is a boundary parallel handle body. So call that like H1. And on the top, this is also boundary parallel. I'll call this like H1 prime. These are not our pair of interesting non-isotopic candle bodies because they glue to make S3. So they're definitely not isotopic well boundary. Boundary. But these are like Handel bodies in B5, and maybe they're interesting because I didn't construct them in a super obvious way. And I would say that one way of saying that the Hansel body is interesting is to know that this S3 is interesting. So maybe H1 and H2, or H1 prime, are interesting, whatever that means. If our S3 in S5 is interesting, it's kind of like the vague idea. And so, like, I could mean a lot of things when I say S3 and S5 to be interesting. There is like a whole theory of three-dimensional knots, but I think maybe a lot of people have never thought about that before and do not want to think about three-dimensional knots in S5, which is totally fine. But I think. But I think a very reasonable invariant of an S3 in S5 is the binary invariant, does this S3 bound a ball? So, i.e., doesn't bound a ball. I think we can all agree that's like a pretty good invariant. And it's not actually, maybe it's not obvious that there is an S3 that doesn't bound a ball, but I'll just claim like there's actually lots of them, like most of them don't. Them like most of them don't. Um, okay, um, cool. So, like, now we have like maybe a way of constructing interesting handle bodies. And this is like a particularly nice, like, condition to give because I see like people who I think know way more about knot theory than me. So, you would recognize this as like doubly slice. Like, you know, we study knots, whether or not they're cross-sections of unknotted S2s. We can also add. Knotted S2s. We can also ask whether this particular S2 is a cross-section of an unknotted S3. So if I knew that my two sphere were not doubly sliced, then I would know for sure that this S3 doesn't bound a ball. Can show that by showing our S2 is not double. It is not doubly sliced. Okay, so we have like a way to construct handlebodies. We have a way to ensure that they are interesting. You'd have to like know that there exist two spheres that aren't doubly sliced and like probably don't know that off the top of your head if you don't think about them. But that's like a quick Google, and there are like actually several papers about it. And so, oh, wow, I got. And so, oh, oh, wow, I got there. So, the theorem of Ruberman. He didn't produce the first two spheres that aren't doubly sliced. He produced the first paper that I understand that produced two spheres that aren't doubly sliced. So, in particular, he showed that a particular two-sphere that has a name, which I will not try to tell you what this two-sphere in S4 is, but some of you will know. So, five twist bunch refoil. This is a particular two-sphere. 2-sphere in S4 is not doubly sliced. So it is not the cross-section of an S3 that bounds a wall. And this paper is like really cool. He shows that, like, really, he's looking at a different, like the actual Rucklean invariant of a bounded three manifold and using that as an obstruction. I really like that. I like that when people use the bounded three manifolds as invariants. That should happen more. So if we use this as So, if we use this S2, we take that to be the five-twist punch refoil, then we'll know that this S3 we constructed is interesting. And then also, theorem of Sato, five twist-blundrefoil can be unknotted, turned into a positogenous unknot by exactly one tube. Exactly one tube. Which means in this picture that I drew before, I sort of just drew a schematic for how many index one and two points there were in our ball. There's actually, there actually really is one of each. I can make it be one of each. So here, this actually is a surface of genus two, because I have sort of two index one points below it that each increase genus. Genus. Okay. Right. And so then we're left with: well, let's just copy, let's copy and paste this picture. And let's conclude the theorem. So I have these complicated handlebodies, and I don't really know what they are, but I know by Waldhausen's theorem that they are defined by some curves on the surface that look standard. Standard. So, like this bound disks here, this bound discs here. And I know that this union, this S3 is not the boundary of a ball. But on the other hand, there's a way more obvious pair of handlebodies in this picture because I know by Hiroshi that this S2, sorry, this genus 2 surface actually does look like this. This actually does look like this picture, like up to diffeomorphism of S4. It really is the standard embedding with these the standard bases that I've drawn here. Like, because I'm just doing, it's up to up to surface automorphism, that's true. And Hiroshi says that, like, I can do that by ambient diffeomorphism. So I really have this handlebody, this surface with two obvious handlebodies in this picture. The ones that glue to make sort of the S3 that I can actually see. So these glue to make like an equator of an equator of S5. So if I call this like H2 and this H2 prime, then this S3 does bound a four-ball. Bound to four ball. So then the theorem is true by looking at either the top halfs of this picture or the bottom halves. Because, well, this H1 and H2 prime, these handlebodies are, they're boundary parallel. So I could think of them as being an S4. And they are homeomorphic, rel boundary. And the same thing with these bottom handle bodies. They are homeomorphic, rel boundary. But if the top But if the top pair were isotopic rel boundary and the bottom pair were isotopic rel boundary, then I would get like an isotopy from the S3 on the left to the S3 on the right, but one of them bounces the ball and one of them doesn't. So that can't happen. So either H1 and H2 are like the weird knotted handle bodies, or the primes are the weird knotted handle bodies. And if I did this like sort of carefully enough to like, I could actually tell you that both pairs are examples by using like symmetry. Examples by using like symmetry. But at some point, I just said like choose a diffeomorphism of S4, and I didn't tell you which one, so that's kind of scary. Anyway, so here's some like remaining open questions in the last like two minutes of the talk. So the Bunny paper, Bunny Gubby paper theorem. Can you sort of extend it? Extend it, not extend it, but can you produce more three balls like their three balls? Maybe I just won't write the theorem. Can you produce three balls in S4 that do not become isotopic in B5? Because the Bunny Kabai examples don't immediately work, but Examples don't immediately work, but maybe there's like some other pair of examples that do, and like maybe you could even use their variant. I don't know. Um, so that's like sort of like an obvious question if you're interested in this B5 part. There's also the like notable gap. Um, can you produce genus one handlebodies in S form that aren't isotopic, rel boundary? Real boundary. So, answering their question in the genus 1 case. So, their invariant doesn't really make sense for genus 1 handlebodies, and our construction like will never yield genus less than 2. So, I don't know exactly what to say about genus 1. I think like obstructions, like you could do something similar to our paper, but then you'd have to have like a potential example. And like, I don't know how to get that. And then the sort of like other direction is all of these theorems were about pairs of handle bodies, or maybe even finite families. But so for the handle bodies, do there exist the three balls, I think there are countably infinite. So I think actually Buddy and Gabe might be countably infinite. But do there exist countably infinitely many handlebodies of genus G? Handle bodies of genus G which are not isotopic rel boundary and to improve this from pairs
