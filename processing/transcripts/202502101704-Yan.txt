Encountering defects because they are necessary ingredients and you want to actually model nature. Examples of such are include quantum impurities, which are like point-like defect, or the meanwhile separating different other regimes. And defect problems, in particular, so our workshop has its exact solutions in the title. Defect problems provide some interesting playgrounds where we could test various analytical methods, both in lattice systems. Both in lattice systems. Both in lattice systems and continuum effective field theories. Now, recently, there's also an emerging interest in experimental engineering effect synchronous matter systems with the potential application to realization of quantum memories. Now, whether it's a distant or near goal, I'm not in a position to make a judgment. Last but not least, for simulation communities, defect problems also give you nice candidates for both classical and quantum. Classical and quantum simulation. Now, I've introduced the three subjects, and today I will be talking about some interplay between these three things. In particular, I'll give you two examples. Example one, or part one, of my talk, concerns the intersection between quantum entanglement and symmetries. In particular, this is under the notion of so-called symmetry-resolved entanglement, which in one sentence summary quantifies quantum entanglement within a particular Quantum entanglement within a particular within individual symmetry charge sectors for quantum systems with global symmetries. Now, we just heard a fantastic talk by Juliberto on some not list of this subject, but something related. And I believe there will be some further talks, and I put some pointers here. Now, if you look, there's already hundreds of papers on this subject. I don't think there's thousands, but maybe in the near future there will be a thousand papers on this subject. Thousand papers on the subject. So, what could I possibly tell you today? Today, I'm going to give you some brief bulletin point of this recent work in December with my fantastic collaborators, Sarah Marciano, Pasquale Cavries, and Robert Punek in particular. We provided a computational framework which is suitable for keeping track of dynamic revolutions or symmetry result entanglement instead of preserving altar equilibrium processes. Processes. And as a very nice application, our framework could also be applied to study centric charge for counting statistics. So, in this, later in the talk, I will just give you a brief overview of how this works. Now, the second part of my talk concerns a different intersection of these three things, namely intersection between symmetries and defects. This is under the notion of topological defects in quantum systems. And in particular, you could ask what is topological defect, and I will give you Topological defect, and I will give you a one-sentence answer in 1 plus 1D. The 1 plus 1D topological defect just corresponds to some local modification to your quantum hematomy, such that your physical observables only depend very, very mildly on the location of the defect. So, for example, if I consider a circular chain, you just locally modify, say, this red bump, and then there's two few bits connected by this bump in particular way, such that it doesn't really affect observables. Observables. This subject has rich connections with general asymmetries, and I believe there will be a talk later in the week by Xu Han Shang, who is an expert on this subject. And we will learn more about that hopefully in the talk. Now, again, there are hundreds of papers in this subject. So what I'm going to tell you today is, again, like a very quick summary of this recent work last October with my collaborators Robert Kunick and Titi Mitchell. Robert Kunick and D.T. Mitchell. In particular, our paper sort of like serves the purpose of exploring something that, in our opinion, has been much less studied in this field, namely the roles played by topological defects in constructing long-lived physical concrete. So our paper, our work, has multiple connections with different fields, language resenses, walking circuits, but in this talk I will emphasize the connection with so-called weak interability breaking, which you might Breaking, which you might also hear more in the talk graphic vertical tomorrow. Okay, now let me start part one on my talk. So I try to make the slide such that it's more at a higher level, so hopefully it doesn't exhaust too much brain power. And please feel free to interrupt me for questions. Okay, so a lot of recent developments in this field are sort of like motivated by experiment in 2018 done by Luke. Down by Looking and collaborators, where they try to experimentally explore entanglement properties of a many-body localized system with particle number symptoms. In particular, the total quantum entanglement could be split as a sum of two types of entanglement, the so-called number entanglement, which is generated by particle transport across the boundary of the subsystem, as well as configurational entanglement generated by particle interaction and particle transport with. And particle transport within the subsystem. In particular, we view the configurational entanglement and some sort of weighted contributions from different configurations where the parting number within the subsystem is fixed. What they found experimentally is there are different gross time scales in non-equilibrium settings for these two different kinds of entanglement. So, for example, in a post-quench dynamical scenario, number entanglement will set very quickly. Entanglement will separate quickly, where configurational entanglement exhibits a slower logarithmic growth. Now, to better understand the experimental results, there are in many papers of this symmetry result entanglement in lattice systems and conformal field series. And I will only give you a completely incomplete list of the references in this field. What I'm going to do today is to first give you a general setup and definitions of circuitry resolve entanglement. Of symmetry-resolve entanglement in equilibrium setting before moving on to what it takes to do for studying its dynamic coefficients. So, our setup is the following. You consider a one plus 1D quantum system with some global symmetry t. Now, since we're talking about particle number symmetry, we just take t equals u1, for example. And the system is equipped with a bipartition, a subsystem A, and its complement. Now, you put the total system in a particular pure state with a fixed U1 charge capital SQ. You one charge capital YQ. Now tracing over the complement then gives you the radius density matrix. One immediate thing you realize is that even though the total system has a fixed U1 charge or fixed particle number, the same is obviously not true for subsystem A. Namely, the U1 charge containing a subsystem A is not fixed. That denoted as a little Q here. Now one can argue that your reduced density matrix can be written in terms of this sort of Written in terms of this sort of block diagonal form, where each individual block corresponds to a particular subsystem charge sector. Then you could ask the question: can we quantify the amount of entanglement distributed within each individual block? So what you do is you literally zoom in to this little block. Mathematically, that just corresponds to you apply a projector into the corresponding charge sector, which I denote as pi-sub q here. Now, after proper normalization, Now after proper normalization, this gives you an effective density matrix for this particular subsystem charge factor. Then you can play a favorable game of constructing entanglement methods. So Reign entropy of normal entropy, and that gives you the sample result version of these things. Now, in general, it is difficult, at least for me, to analytically track the mimical evolution of quantum entanglement. And it's going to be more difficult to do so for the symmetry result. To do so for the symmetry result version. So, let me first briefly tell you the logic of this. How do you think about dynamic evolution? The logic is quite simple, albeit the calculation is messy. Okay, so now suppose you choose an appropriate basis, which I denote as S of I here, for the Hilbert space of your total system. At a given time for your non-equilibrium processes, at any given time, you try to expand your quantum state. To expand your quantum state in terms of this basis, where your time dependence is shifted to the time dependence of the coefficient. Now, tracing out the complement then gives you this time-dependent reduced density matrix. In particular, it's a sum over some sort of generalized density matrices with various weight given by these coefficients. And in particular, one important feature is that the in-state and out-state are not necessarily equal to each other. Necessarily equal to each other. In fact, generally, they're just quite distinct from each other. That's clear that if you want to study any entanglement methods built out of this time-dependent reduced density matrix, you have to take into account cross-term contributions coming from the fact that pink state is not equal to upstate. Now, this kind of quantity has been studied by my collaborators in 2022 in the context of generalized Reni entropy, which they further used to study dynamical evolutions of. study dynamical evolutions of Reign entropy in a non-equilibrium setting. What we did in this one of the things we did in this work in December is to generalize this construction for the purpose of dynamical evolution of symmetry result random entropy. And in particular, I define this quantity, the so-called symmetry result generalized random entropy, which looks like the following. It looks very similar to your ordinary symmetry result random entropy. So in particular, you have this projector passive Q here. Pass a pube here, but here notice that at the in state and out state for each individual replica copy can all be different from each other. So, how do you compute this thing? In this business, people say you go to Fourier space. Concretely for the UN of central resolution, what it takes is the following. In this case, you could explicitly write down this charge projector in this following form as an integrating over all your E1 group elements, where Q sub A here. Where Q sub A here is the operator that's mattering the charge containing subsystem A. If you substitute this formula in here, then you realize that a fundamental computational ingredient for serving this purpose of tracking dynamical evolution or symmetry result entropy is given by the so-called generalized charge moment, which I wrote here. And it looks literally looks like a trace of n copies of a generalized density matrix where in-state and out-state are again. Where instead and out-state are again different, but you also have an actual insertion of E to the I theta Q sub A, where Q sub A is the subsystem charge operator. In particular, physically, you could think of this as turning on some sort of flux theta in your replica manifold coupled to this centric charge restricted to the subsystem. Now, in general, these kind of quantities are very messy to compute. However, for critical systems described by conformal field theories, one can utilize. Field theories, one can utilize the power of conformal transformation to compute such quantities in terms of certain twisted partition functions with actual field insertions. And we explicitly carried out this kind of computation in this paper in the context of 1 plus 1D mass list free compact model theory, which we find some explicit analytical formula. Now, up until so far, I told you about the generalized charge moment as if it's just some computational true, like I introduced like it. Not true, like introduce like intermediate thing, but you further do Fourier transform to get the symmetry of entropy. However, this kind of subject has their own physical meaning. In particular, n equals one generalized transmoment, namely just that n equals right here, there are just one state, one outside, and then the speed of either Q sub A. It plays an important role in the study of Foucanti statistics of centric charge distribution in non-equilibrium setting. Not necessary, it could be anything. In three compatible zone, you have vertex operator, primary. No, they could be descendant of vertex operator modules. So, like you have vertex operator, and then So like you have vertex operator and then up. You can. It's just literally there are descendant operators. There's no constraints like all has to be primaries. The conformal transform. There's I should say like it's a messy procedure but you can do that. I should emphasize that here I'm doing some sort of regularization procedure showing this picture but what we're comput what we computed is a linear thing where it's yeah. It's not. Yeah. Cyclic boundary conditions, I mean, if you have a motion. Yes, yes, so there's a yeah, there's a A, there are A I put here is an entanglement cut on recognition. This cut changes the, how to say, vector, and it goes to extend the cut boundary cognition becomes this is an annulus where you have like this. Where you have like these, the two ends of the annulus have boundary conditions, which is given by this entanglement curve. So you mean the replica copy is like this telling of the cylinder, the n copies the circumference as two pi times n. I mean, this is cut. This cut. Cut. I mean, it can. This cut. Cut. I mean, that's fine. Yeah, you. So, I didn't tell you what this conformal transformation. Basically, you sort of like first map it to some cut-out plane, and then you can further map it to this picture. So, there is a stretching plane. I composed two maps, one of them maping map, and then another one, which is a logarithmic map. Okay, so um Okay, so now, okay, so I mentioned that Encounter's one-general charge moment has played some roles in the forthcoming statistics. So, let me first introduce this concept in the equilibrium study. Consider a total system again in a pure state with some fixed UN charge. And now, I told you that the charge containing a subsystem is not fixed. You could ask what is the probability that the subsystem contains a particular UN charge, like little Q is 100 or 200. Is 100 or 200, whatever you want. This probability is computed by trace over A on their basic reduced density matrix composed with this projector into the corresponding charge sector. Now, the generative function for this form distribution is again given by its Fourier transform, namely trace over your radius density matrix composed with e to the i theta q sub a over q sub a. So again, it measures the charge contains in your subsystem. Now, in particular, In your subsystem. Now, in particular, you say that this quantity is a special case of the Engels-Wein generalized transmoment I showed you in the last slide, where you set the instate and out-state equal to each other. Now, why do I say it's a generative function? It's because if you literally take derivatives with respect to the flux theta for various order, you will be able to recover the mean value as well as higher moments of the charge distribute. So then it's clear that if you want to track dynamical evolution of the charge distribution, Track dynamical evolution of the charge distribution, but then you need to take into account cross-term contributions, and that's where this guy comes in and calls one-drunk charge model. In this paper, we gave explicit and liquid results again for the Y plus 1D Freak Mass compact volume theory, which then gives us access to symmetry charge distribution for arbitrary circuit state. And in particular, this also could have be applied to outer equilibrium processes involving leaping direct wave. Which way intend to explore further. Now, our analytical results are mostly derived using conformal field theory techniques. However, we also benchmark the results using lattice calculation in the XX chain, and we found a good numerical agreement. Okay, so that's going to be the end of the first part of my talk. Maybe I should pause for questions. Okay. Okay. So in the next ten minutes, or even less, I think ten minutes, I'll tell you about another interplay between these three things, but now we're considering interplay between symmetries and defects, namely topological defects. Now in this field, you can make a lot of general statements for various things that I'm going to tell you about today, but today I'm just going to stick with a very simple model, the one plus 90 quantum transfer. The one plus 90 quantum transverse fieldizing model with this very famous Hamiltonian. So, my transverse field is a poly X operator and nearest neighbor polyze, polyzay practice. I put it on circular chain with periodic volume. Now, in this model, there are only two non-trivial topological defects. The first one you have seen before, maybe also the second one, sorry, I don't mean to judge you, but the first one is very familiar, which people usually call A2 defect. So, how do you introduce the defect? You literally you introduce the defect, you literally flip the sign of this poly Z-Poly Z interaction for a particular bound, for example this red color point. And effectively, instead of periodic boundary condition, now you would be considering anti-periodic boundary condition. Now the other non-trivial topological defect is more non-trivial. Namely, to introduce such a defect, you have to modify the bound interaction from poly Z poly Z to poly Z poly X, and you have to delete. And you have to delete the transverse field in one of the qubits connected by this bond. Now, this thing has been studied by many, many people, and there is a resurgence of interest in this field for other good reasons. But today, what I'm going to focus on is more exploring the role played by topological defects in constructing these long-lived physical quantities. And one perspective to interpret our work, this work with. Our work, this work with Robert and Haditi, is that we're trying to come up with a general scheme to study weakly interpretable systems in presence of defect. And in particular, there are two kinds of physical quantities with long lifetimes in this system. First of all, you will be able to find quasi-conserved extensive local charges which are modified by the defect. And because they are quasi-conserved, as I will mention later, they will decay more slowly than predictive. Decay more slowly than predicted from Fermi's golden rule. And secondly, the introduction of defect also enables localized modes. Now, if you just look at these two things, it's obvious that the second physical quantity is more intrinsic to the fact that you have a defect. Namely, you're not going to get that if you're considering a clean system. Now, with open boundaries, there are similar stories, but that's a whole nother business. However, in this talk, trying to make connections with other Trying to make connections with other talks in the workshop, and also we have also integral people here. So, I'm just going to talk about the first one, quasi-conserved charges. But I'm more than happy to discuss the second one during the week. Okay, so let me first review our weekly interoperable system without any defect, namely, how do you weekly break interoperability in clean interoperable systems? So, the starting point is the following: having an interpretable system, you have those concerns. Have an integral system, you have those conserved charges, which in particular includes the Hamiltonian. Now, if you take an arbitrary deformation, integrability is spoiled. So, you don't have those conserved charges anymore. Her recommendations are there, and a special deformation such that integrability is broken only weakly. In this very nice paper by Federica and Noleksi, they gave us over a systematic construction of such weak integral breaking deformations, and in particular, And in particular, if you turn on such kind of special deformation with strength lambda, one can find quasi-conserved charges which commutate each other up to corrections at order lambda squared. So in other words, even though your deformation has strength lambda, integral bit is broken at order lambda squared instead of order lambda is broken more weakly than Euro. Now, what we did with Robert and DT is try to generalize this procedure to defat-enriched intelligence. To defect-enriched integrable systems. So, our starting point is the following: you have an integrable system with the insertion of an integrable defect, where the defect, of course, modifies the Hamiltonian, but it also modifies the higher console charges. Namely, you can still find these console charges, but they're all going to be modified by their defect without spoiling probability. It's very complicated to actually construct this kind of defect. That's a separate note, but anyways, the starting point is this. And now, you just Now, you just, I should say, like I didn't mention, but in this paper of Frederick and Alexei, the deformation that you use are generated by certain non-local operations on the original conserved charges. So now, if you perform the same kind of non-local operation, but now on this defect-modified conserved charges, you're going to be able to generate a weekly integral system with quasi-conserved charges where everything is modified by your default. Now, I'm going to show you briefly. Now, I'm going to show you briefly how this works for transverse field rising model with insertions of chromosome duality defect using the fact that chromosome duality defect is in particular imputable. So, first of all, how does this work for clean transverse fieldizing model? So, this is a procedure that's already been worked out into the RECOS paper. So, starting from, you have this famous transverse fieldizing Hamiltonian. You also need this higher conserved charge, which consists of nearest neighbor poly. Consists of nearest neighbor polyy polyz interaction. Now, now your deformation, there is a particular kind of deformation you could consider, which is generated by the so-called bilocal operator built out of the Hamiltonian and higher conserved charges. Now, this bilocal operator, I can tell you in more detail, but it's essentially sort of like a one-half of anti-communicator with a choice of operating. So, doing so, you'll get a weakly deformed transverse field acid model, in particular, the deformed having to. Model in particular, the deformed Hamiltonian takes the following form. Now, the deformation consists of two kinds of terms: next nearest neighbor poly Z poly Z and nearest neighbor poly X poly X. In particular, this deformation is self-dual under the Cormus-Marine transformation, and it's also previously been studied by Ami-Romani and collaborators in terms of the Mariana particle, the particle-Marana interactions. Now, we introduce a duet defect in the story. A duet defect in the story. So, as an input, we need to know the defect Hamiltonian, which I already told you, and many, many people have studied before. We also need to know how this defect modifies this higher constern chart, which we worked out in this paper. And now, you just stick everything into this bilocal operator that's going to generate you, you know, waking deformation in your defect system. And in particular, we were able to derive the defect Hamiltonian in this default model. In this default model, where everything in red in these formulas, I intentionally put a different color to indicate that that's what the defect changes in your homotopy. Now, okay, you could say, so what? You have this completely looking defect homotonic. How do you even know it's correct or it makes sense? Now, in this paper, what we did is, in addition to this method that I just told you, we benchmarked or whatever, no one keep using benchmark, but we used two. Uni benchmark, but we use two additional completely different methods to study this problem. The first method is the so-called half-chain chromosome transformation, which is equivalent to the so-called half-chain detail gauging I explored in this very nice paper, where they also derive this de facto Hamiltonian deformed model. And the second technique draws among various things from the so-called Ising fusion category, and it's a more mathematical approach. So the bottom line is we have all we have three. Is we have three very differently looking methods, and they all produce the same defect hymnatonium. So, this serves a non-trivial check for all those methods. Now, additionally, we also constructed passing conserved charges in this model and try to study their slower decay behavior. And in particular, so this is like the first deformation for this higher conserved charge modified by defect, so it looks like mess. I should say, like in this top SIJ, it looks to be. I should say that in this top I said j equals 3 plus 1. So, what one would expect for this quasi-constructed charges is that at short time, if you look at the decay behavior at leading order, it should depend on lambda to the cubic power instead of lambda squared. And we were able to confirm this in some small numerical exercises for small system sizes. So, here, what's plotting here is the ultra-correlation function for this deformed concern, sorry, quasi-conserved chart here. Classic concern chart here against lambda to the cubic power multiplies by time. And we see good data points collapse at early times. Okay, so that's basically the second part of my talk. So let me summarize. So today I told you two stories about these intersections between quantum entanglement, symmetries, and defects, namely centralized entanglement and topological defects. And topological defects. Now, of course, you must ask: what about this intersection between quantum entanglement and defects? So, here there's also a rich story. So, for example, one can ask how does quantum entanglement depend on the defect location? Like, when you put a subsystem there, it matters whether you put your defect right in the middle of the subsystem or at the boundary of the subsystem. These situations impact the scaling behavior, for example, of the quantum entanglement dependence on the defect. Dependence on the defect. And another thing you could ask is: on the other hand, can one extract any defect physical data from quantum entanglement? And some of these aspects of this problem has been explored by my collaborators and I in this paper, I guess in 2023. Yeah, in the context of one plus funding three-state pulse model that I'll be also interested in discuss related things in this week. Related things are in this week. That's how I have to think anxiously. Yes. No, it is integrable. In the original transverse, it is integrable. Interval, but this chromosome drastic impact. So we start the ocean? It doesn't preserve the ocean and the thing. Yes, so, but when you talk about that, are you like mapping to say Marana Fermuls? Yeah, there's something tricky there. Like, I tried to talk about There, like I tried to talk about in the spin-chain language where you map tomorrow affirming there's some non-local thing, like this little charge attached to this term. So, it's but it is integrable in the context of transverse field as you know. In fact, if you like lots of models, like this model or it's flow-key circus model, relies on general vehicle transformation to get solutions, but there are usually people restrict to a particular little charge sector, and everything is identical. Charge sector, and then everything is identical draft being RLF. But there is indeed a subtlety between mapping to MRL forking sector. Thank you. So about this second part, so I think you said that you study one plus one D transverse ising chain, but actually you focus on bulk critical critical chain. So our paper is not necessarily critical. Yeah, yeah, but just to simplify everything in the talk, I pulled that up. Maybe I should study your paper, but the brief question is that you studied this chromatid duality defect. And if you go to off-critical points, you rate the chromatid. But do you still find something interesting for this KWG? Yes, in that case, what I do is, so I have. Case, what I do is, so I have a circular chain and I put a primus venue direct interface, as you say, separating the ferromagnet and fermatic, but I also put a domain wall at another point of the chain. So now you can still get those interesting properties in the sense that you could sort of like, for example, shrink one of the faces to zero sides, and then in that sense, it's like the composition of the domain wall and the parameter redirect interface give you some sort of defect, which might be. Which might be unnatural to look at, but there are still interesting properties there. And those interesting properties actually persist to 4K circuit, which is, yeah, in particular, in this domain wall picture, so actually I didn't talk about this localized conserved quantity, but as it's well known, you will have a Marano zero mode attached to the domain wall, which will shrink one of the phases to zero size, it's going to be localized around defect, and it persists in the flaw case segment. Sits in the flow case setting. So, in the periodic driven setting, you still have this zero voltage. If you don't turn deformation, it doesn't detail. Thank you. I have a question on the local generator. Yeah. Because that's infinite size. So I skipped that. Yeah. So I should say, like, in so in deriving this, this Deriving this expression, I'm actually using like an infinite chain. But then this defect term, like all I wanted to know is what does this defect term look like, and then I just close the chain up. But indeed, if you're talking about like biblical cooperator, as you explained in your paper, there is a subtlety because it requires an ordering to have periodic chain, there's this issue. But what we did is we don't have like a proof, like everything should mathematically work out for periodic. Mathematically, it worked out for periodic chain, but our numerical study here does confirm. Instead of order lambda squared, you have order lambda cube. And I should say, these are small system sizes. So if you're considering the scaling limit where you have many, many different sets, then the order lambda q dependence will vanish after some time and then you get order lambda 4. But for finite sets, it just cut off from this curve. That's why you only. That's why this colour is a good idea. Thanks again. Yeah, so it is.
