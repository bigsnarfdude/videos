My afternoon, basically, so this is a reasonable time for me to give a talk. And also, thank you. I've been on sabbatical this term, so I've been travelling lots and giving lots of talks to mainly to sort of general mathematical audiences, which is fine, but it's nice to be among one's own people because when you're able to talk about something a bit more contentful. So, I'm going to talk about homomortons of contractible manifolds. Contractible manifolds will shock near the end. To begin with, what's going to show up is the notion of a one-sided H-cobordism. So, a cobordism. So the combatism C B to B prime is going to be called a one-sided H-cobordism when it satisfies the definition of an H-cobordism but only on one side. So the inclusion of this end is a homotopy cobivalent and the inclusion of the other end may or may not be a homotopy equivalent. Comportism is a one-sided equivalent. Cobortism is a one-sided combordism if B prime to C is a homogeneous. Okay? So I'm going to use this notation, B and B prime and C all the time. So B is always the left-hand side, B prime is always the right-hand side, and the prime one is the one that's in the right hand side. This This, I want to allow myself to be sort of as general as possible. So B itself is allowed to have a boundary, and then the cobort should be trivial on the boundary. Maybe I won't write that. That does somehow stand when you're thinking about cobordinums in the plane of boundary. And I'll also write pi for the fundamental group of C or of B prime, which is the same because that's harmonic equivalent. So that's a one-sided Horton. So that's the one-side of HCO boards. I don't know if these are familiar to many people. I didn't know about them until not so long ago. But let me tell you a few basic sort of algebraic tolerant facts about them. So in this situation, if we think about the homology of C relative to the end that's not an equivalent, with E pi coefficients. coefficients, so coefficients in the group thing with the fundamental group of the cohortism, which is the only thing that makes sense in this sort of situation. Then by prime code, this is the same as cohomorphy, or I guess by Lefschettiodesy, relative to the other end is the pi coefficient. But that inclusion is a homotopy equivalence, so this is zero and that tells you something about the map from B to C. It doesn't tell you that it's a homotopy equivalence. It doesn't tell you that it's a homotopy equivalence, because B might have a different fundamental group to C, but it tells you that it's a homology isomorphism with all local coefficients that come from C. In other words, it's an acyclic map. It's an acyclic map, i.e. a homogeneous homophobism with these pi coefficients. And there's some immediate consequences of acyclic maps. I mean, these are studied in homotopy theory and various things are known about them. So here's an immediate consequence. So some consequences. Pi 1 of B surge X onto pi 1 of C in that situation. And the kernel kernel P is perfect, meaning its commutator subgroup is the whole group. And a little more. So in general in homotopy theory when we think about acyclic maps maybe these are just like cell complexes. We'd say a map is an acyclic map if it's an isomorphism homology with autistic coefficients. But here a little more is known. B and C are both finite cell complexes. Cell complexes. In particular, there are finitely many relative cells. And that tells you something about this perfect group, namely, it tells you it's generated by finitely many conjugacy classes in the Python B. So it's generated by finitely many conjugacy classes in the file. Okay. That's sort of the analogue of being finitely generated for normal subgroups. Finite generative for normal subgroups. It doesn't have to be finite generative in its own right. It's finite generative sort of as a normal subgroup. Okay, so those are some basic observations that you get in this situation. But conversely, if B, a manifold such as B, is given and how do I want to say it, P P is a normal perfect generated by finitely many conjugacy classes, so just like the thing up there was generated by finitely many conjugacy classes then we can build a combordism. We can build it just by mimicking the definition of By mimicking the definition of the plus construction, but doing it with handles instead of with cells, just to make sure that we stay in the land of manifolds. So then you just mimic. Look at the picture. Looks pretty compact to me. Compact smooth manifolds, yes. But they don't have boundary. B's don't have boundary. Um I mean uh of course you can make the definition in other categories, but compact I think I want to say is. But compact, I think I want to say this. So you can mimic the definition or the construction, mimic the plus construction. So you can attach two handles to kill people. So that uses that it's normally finitely generated, so you can attach finitely many to handles to kill it. And then you can attach three handles. Attach three handles to homomorphically cancel the two elements. And if you say cells instead of handles, then this is exactly what you do in the plus construction. In order to do the second thing, you need the dimension to not be too silly. So I'm going to assume forever. Forever, the dimension of B is at least five, and therefore the dimension of C is at least six. Okay, and even if I mistakenly erase that, I don't mean to. Under those conditions, you can embed the attaching maps for the three cobalts. You can do this. And that gives you then the cobaltism starting at B and going somewhere. I'm going somewhere. I'm just calling it C, and I'm calling the result B plus. And in this situation, the map from the inclusion of B into C plus is acyclic, because if I forget their manifolds, it is just the plus construction. And something that requires a little thinking is that the other inclusion is a homotopy. Technical time. Let me just say where that is in words. If we read the combordism from the V plus end, then it has only D minus 3 and D minus 2 handles. And under this condition, that means it has only 1 handles and above. In particular, you can't change PI1 by attaching such handles. And so this inclusion is a pi 1 isomorphism and acyclic, but then it's an above. So that's, yeah, I mean, there's a very much aside in the There's very much a sidedness to the whole thing. So, this is a one-sided collapse. Some of you may know that Quillen's plus construction was invented by Claver, uh it with a manifold, in fact, to begin with, and it was then done homotopically. I think maybe Sunderland knew about that and told Quillen that this is something you can do. That and told Quillen that this is something you can do with Clear Self completes. That this is, in fact, something like the original way of looking at it. So, one-side equal borders are classified, just like X-ray borderisms are and the fundamentals. And in different amounts of generality, different people have done this. Let me quite a sort of complete list. So, Friedman Quinn, Gil Bo Churnsley, and I learned to open up paper. Yeah. And it says the following: so one-sided H combordisms starting at a given thing, B of dimension these five with fundamental group a given quotient of pi one b by some perfect finite generative normal subgroup are classified by Are classified by something. So if we were doing bordering H combortisms, then everybody knows that they're classified by their white-head total. But of course, if you have an H-combortism, there are two white-head totals you can define. You have two homotopic equivalences. But there's also a duality formula that says that one of them is a formula in terms of the other. So in fact, there's only one piece of information. Here, only one of the inclusions is a homotopy equivalence, but we can still take it tutorial. Equivalence, but we can still take its torsion. And it's classified by the torsion of the inclusion of the n that is an equivalence. And it lives in the y-h root of pi. So there's no duality formula in some sense. In fact, you can define a torsion well at the well to the other end. It's just defined with the pi coefficients instead of in the function that would be. And then there is a duality formula. But the point is that classified by that. But the point is they're classified by that. Octodipheumorphism. So here's one way of saying what this says. It says, any one-sided H-cobordenum on B looks like one that you have in your mind, maybe this one that we built, with an ordinary H cobortism glued onto the right-hand head. Right? There's as many ordinary H cobortisms as this right-head boot. Ordinates coordinates as this way-head group, and so that tells you which one. So, in fact, one way to prove this, and in fact, the way that at least these guys prove it, is all you have to do is convince yourself that you can embed my plus construction once I edgebort them into the one you have in mind. Well, the B end. And then the difference between normally edge cobortism and those are classical. So, that's one way you can prove this. So, and that's true, you can embed. So and that's true. You can embed this one. In fact, you can embed any one-sided cobaltism into any other one-sided cobaltism, starting at the B-N. And the theorem I want to tell you is not only can you do it, but you can do it in a very unique way. So there is a somehow uniqueness of this already to deduce the homotopy something that you could deduce. Did it use what? The invariance defined up reality is totally invariant. But I don't think you do need that. Well, I mean, you're going to have it in a minute anyway, so you can use it if you want. So, this is joint work with Sawon Ganatius, which I could have said at the beginning. And it says the following: so, again, let the It says the following. So again, let the dimension be only six. Let M be the D-dimensional unifolded boundary. Let C be a one-sided equivalent. And suppose we have a given embedding of B into the boundary. Given embedding of B into the boundary of M. 0. And then the conclusion is that the space of embeddings, which extend that given one, is contractible as long as that is in any way feasible. So then the space of embeddings, rel B from C into M is contractible as long as that's. Intractable as long as that's plausible from the point of view of pi1. As long as, so let me try to write that. So pi1 of B maps by this boundary embedding to pi1 of the boundary then, which maps to pi one of m. If there is going to exist an embedding of c relative to b, then this better factor over this quotient. And if it doesn't factor, then it's the space is empty, obviously. It's the space is empty, obviously. And if it does factor, then the space is contracted. So there's a unique one. In particular, you can take M to be another one-sided H coordinate. In that case, the fundamental loop assumptions. So this is somehow a very strong uniqueness theorem for these kind of embeddings of one-sided edge comports relative to the weird end, relative to the end of the end. End relative to the end that's not a harmonic equivalent, and that's important because this is a completely non-symmetric definition. So I want to make a couple of comments about uh what I'm mainly going to do is explain one of the proofs of this theory. Um but first a few comments. But first, a few comments. So, an example of a one-sided H towards a cylinder. And in that case, this statement is, of course, true and well-known and goes under the name of uniqueness of colours. So it's that you can always embed, you can always extend embedding in the boundary into a little folder embedding. Into a little product in better. But there's a treat trick you can do once you know that. Because any H-cobordism is isotopically equivalent, well, one end to a cylinder. In other words, you can embed any H-cobordism into a cylinder. So if C from B to B prime is an H-combortism, and we're in this range of dimensions that I'm insisting that we're in, then you can pick an inverse H-combortism from B prime to whatever. From B prime to whatever, because it's the inverse to whatever must be B, and the composite must be the cylinder. In other words, C must embed into that. Well, one end, the cylinder. And it doesn't just embed. Obviously, this embeds into that as well, as a collar of the left-hand end. And those are mutually inverse isotopic. That's the first one. So, if you want to embed C into something, you can just embed a colour, which you can do for free, and then restrict to the something, which is C. That, in fact, gives a contractible space embedding, so an H cobordism. So, if C is an actual H cobordism, this is also relatively cheap. The proof doesn't use for. So, you can deduce this by the argument I said. You embed one of them into the other and look at the complement. You can deduce that from the proof I tried to explain. And the last thing is that we give two proofs. So, one of them I'm not going to explain because, in some sense, it's an exercise in embedding calculus. Under these conditions, you can convince yourself Under these conditions, you can convince yourself that any one-sided comboism has a handle structure well B with only two and three handles, like the one called C, which by definition will only have two and three handles. In fact, any two would have two. But then the co-dimension condition is satisfied through embedding calculus to converge in that situation. So you can just go to computing embedding calculus. And what you do is you check that every Tn is contractible. And you prove that by showing every layer is contractible. Every layer is compatible, and T0 is compredible. And that's not so difficult. I mean, it's, you know, you can do it. It's in the paper, you did it. But it's a sort of induction off the tower. And T0 is like immersions, I suppose. In that language, there's even a kind of T minus one, which is just continuous max. And in that setting already, this has some content. If you just think about the analog of this for continuous max. About the analog of this for continuous maps, it is the infinity categorical universal property of plus constructions. It's that the space of extensions over a plus construction is contractible when it's not empty. You have to use that or do it yourself. But it has, even homotopically, I mean, there's something not quite classical that you have to do to get it. So one by embedding calculus. And another one, which I'm just calling manual. And I won't say more because I've explained that proof. But it's definitely true, right? Because we've got two proofs. So, I want to try to explain the main idea of this second proof, the manual one. And it involves simplification to begin with, which is that it's enough to prove the theorem, which I've now erased, but you remember what it says, it's enough to prove the theorem in a special. It's enough to prove the theorem for a special sort of example. So it suffices to prove the theorem for B having the following special form. So I'm going to let you write it and then I'll say well that one R and Y are closed t minus 2 control. So it's enough to assume that B looks like closed interval times y, for some closed manifold y, and it's inside the boundary of y by being inside a twice as big closed interval times y. Okay? I'm claiming this is true. I'm going to explain why it's true. This is true, I'm going to explain why it's true as well. So we need to start with the general case of the theorem and reduce it to this special case of Ethereum. So let me pick a Morse function on b that's self-indexing. Self-indexing and where the boundary of B is above whatever. So it starts off with zero. Then all the critical points of index one have value one, all the critical points of index two have value two, so on. So you can always pick a Morse function that's this property. And it goes up to, I think, d minus a half. That's where the bound is. You can always pick a Morse function that's this property. And I want to look at the level set at 2.5. And that's going to be this y. Okay, m was a d manifold. The boundary of m is a d minus one manifold. So b is a d minus one manifold. A slice of b is then a d minus two manifold, as the statement asserts. It's a level set of 2.5, so if we take a little leave and above and below it, it exactly looks like a closed interval times 1. But I've chosen to call it 1 to 5 infinity, because I like to. It's just a closed interval. Because I like to. It's a closed interval times y. I find a slice y in the middle and then I find a little root in a bottle. So that's how I find a copy of this inside B. Now the H cobordism C starts at B and goes somewhere by attaching handles. And in principle, those handles are attached all over the place. I mean, probably they're attached all over the place. Probably they're attached all over the place. And so, what I want to argue is that I can compress the attachment map to those handles until they're just inside here. That's going to be the argument. Okay? So, let me try to write something. I said that in the picture. So, B is obtained from this sort of collar that I just built by attaching handles of index at least three. Handles have indexed at least three. If you go upwards, that's completely clear. Self-indexing, I attach three, four, five, six handles. But if I go downwards, I attach d minus two, d minus one, d minus zero handles. If d is at least five, then that's also at least. So b is obtained from this by attaching above and below. Handles of index these three. So if I have, so that's just a property of B. If I now think about the attaching maps for the handles of the cobordism C, they go all over the place, but if I pick a two-handle, say, it's attached along some circle, that will miss the co-cause of all these three handles by general position. They're all. They're all per dimensional East 3. So if I just flow, on the top bit I use the Morse flow for the function, on the bottom bit I use the Morse flow for the minus the function. If I just flow with respect to that, it will just compress all the handles into the. Similarly, the three handles are attached along two spheres, which again, because the co-cores are codecored for three, so now if you miss them, let me try to say that. See. C as a handle structure B with two free handles only you can isotope or you can perturb their attaching maps To miss the co-cause of these various handles that are being attached to Y to build B. To miss the co-course of the handles of B well this thing and then just flowing. And then just flowing will compress those maps all into the thing. So flow to compress them, to compress these maps into it seems a little complicated because I'm doing it with manifolds. If everything were just a cell complex, it would just be the A cell complex. It would just be that the inclusion of y into b is whatever, too connected. And so you can compress every map into b into y. You just have to be a bit careful to do it with embedded handles. Okay. So now my cobaltism C is really just a cobordism on y times interval with a trivial cobaltism glued on the outside, but embedding those two things at the same time as of the question. Same time as I think the question. That somehow reduces to that case. Which proof came first in Europe, but uh I think this one, yes. At least with proper level of detail. With proper level of detail. So now I want to make a construction of an auxiliary combordism that's going to be called T. And I didn't draw a picture in my notes, so I'll try to make a picture up now. So that's the boundary of M, and M goes upwards. We've found this region that looks like Y cross a That's sort of why, and this is like minus infinity. Is this statement about C only having angles with index two and three coming from the classification in terms of torsion? So I snuck that in, didn't I? Yes. It it doesn't have that. One way to see it is to, like many things in curative topology, use not the HP water theorem, but the proof of the HP water theorem. But the proof of the equal water theorem to just get rid of all the handles apart from two adjacent indices and you can make them be two and three. I mean, that's a homological thing that you try to do, and you get rid of the other. Yeah, I thought I would get away with sneaking at it, but well, thanks for keeping me honest. So we've reduced to the situation where the combordism C is attached along the negative part. We're looking at embeddings of that into the manifold M. But I want to make an auxiliary coordinum that takes place in this region here. And it goes as follows. So choose a load of embedded servers into 0, 1 times y, which normally generates this group P. Good P which generate the kernel of pi one of y goes to pi one of c. Remember that was by definition of a one-sided comportant, that's surjective, and its kernel is perfect and is normally finitely emitted, so pick finitely many normal generators. Oscar, can I do it? Why what we've done? You've explained that the the general I mean, the general case relates to the the one where you have this y and zero language. Why are the embedding spaces of the same? Why are the embedding spaces of what? So if I have a cobordism, let's call it C prime, that's this little thing with some handles attached, and I extend it to a cobordism of B by just making trivial cobordisms on the rest, then embedding the big thing. Then embedding the big thing, the space of embeddings of the big thing is the same as the space of embeddings of the small thing. Because the difference is the space of embeddings of a colour. So this trick gets used about seven more times. So it's good that you called me out. Yes. So we're going to regularly use the embeddings of colours as contract more to try to reduce embeddings of other things to embeddings of columns. Okay. Okay, so pick some normal generators for this thing. By assumption, which I've now removed from erased, but the assumption was that at the level of pi 1, the map into M extends over C. So these things are non-homotopic in M. These are non-homotopic in M by assumption. So, choose some embedded disk Marvel solids. So, let me draw the picture, assuming that there's only one circle for simplicity. So, I look at the region from 0 to 1. 0 to 1. I pick the one circle, let's say, that normally generates this thing. It's null material. Thing. It's null homotopic in M, so it picks on disk that it bounds in M. Because of my dimension assumptions, I can assume that disk is embedded. That's what I mean by embedded disk nichomotopy, pinpen. And then I can just take a Reagan neighbourhood of that, and that's a cobordism from this little square to whatever. Then a thickening in A. In M gives cobaltism t that goes from 0, 1 times y to whatever 01 times y or five. So it's the result of some surgery on 01 times y. Okay? So that's difficult to draw somehow, but uh yeah I'll try anyway. Somehow, but I'll try anyway. I probably can't draw it in a way that makes it look non-trivial, but it's meant to be some organism on this square root of T times. Okay, but T has some interesting behaviour. In particular, these loops are trivial in T. Okay, so that's just an auxiliary manifold I'm making. And now I can make a definition. So, as the picture over there hopefully tries to indicate, you can embed C and T simultaneously, There's a general principle that's very useful in certain flavours of geometric topology, which is often the space of embeddings of a T is probably not contractible. So it's very difficult to pick an embedding of T. But the space of embeddings of at least one T is much more often contractible. So it's much more often easy to pick a non-empty set of embeddings of T's that are disjoint from each other. So we're going to formalize that by making some visual object x or x be the semi-sympetical space with xp. So the space of these emplices is given by Is given by embeddings of C, disjoint union P plus 1 copies of T, so this means, of course, 0 1, the object called P in the simplex category, into M. So it's an embedding of C and P plus 1 copies of T, satisfying some properties. Satisfying some properties. So on the bottom of C it's the inclusion and where to find things, that's the identity or conclusions. And then on the bottom of all these copies of T so on ith1, say. Say it looks like the standard embedding of 0, 1 times y into plus and 1 to infinity times y, but maybe translated in plus and 1 to infinity direction. So it looks like the function xy goes to x plus ti y for t i sum numbers that are supposed to be ordered correctly. Important correctly. Okay. So if I go to the picture, this is a legal point in the zero synthesis. Embedding of C and an embedding of T, and they're disjoint from each other, so it's an embedding of the disjoint union. Nor this little line where they are not disjoint. But one syntax, for example, would be another embedding of T that's disjoint. There's disjoint from the other one and just disjoint from the C. Just take many such embeddings and they're allowed to slide up and down along this thing. Make sure you fix T, right? T is something we constructed once and for all of, yeah. There's choices in that. There's choices. And basically, I describe T in the way I did so that it obviously embeds into Hem. Because I described it as an embedded thing in heaven. Otherwise, if you want to build your T more abstractly, then you have to worry. To build your T more attractive, then you have to worry about the fact that there aren't any embeddings in it. That comes down to how you thicken the disks. Thicken them so that they do embed. But it's just a trace. But this D should be like the trace of the surgery. Yep, it's the trace of the surgery on these. It's a trace of A surgery on these with some frame. And you cook up the framing so that it embeds in M by embedding it in M and declaring it to be that frame. So, this is, I said what the p sympices are. The way I've described it, hopefully, it's clear what the symphical structure is. I even called it square brackets p. So you just composed with maps on that variable. That corresponds to forgetting ti's. So, the two faces of this one simplex are the two things you get by forgetting one of the t's. So, that's one thing. So, let y got it. Be the same without C. So, in other words, it just consists of things like that with the same conditions. C that they have to be destroyed. So, now I can make a diagram. Which somehow tries to implement this idea that I said that you can't pick one embedding of a T, but you can pick a non-empty set of embeddings of a T. So my definition of exploit makes sense when bullet is minus one, and it's an embedding of C and no copies of T. So it And no copies of T, though it is just the space that we study. It's embeddings of C into M fixed on its boundary, which maybe I'll spell it out if it's mine since I've eat zero to M. So this is an augmented semi-simplific space. And similarly, y, maybe it's less clear what y minus one is, but it's not. Just embedding, it's the space. But it's not. Just embedding, it's the space of embeddings of no copies of T. There's one embedding of no copies of T. And if I have an embedding of C and a load of copies of T that are destroying from each other, I can just forget C. And I get an embedding of loads of copies of T that are destroyed from each other. That's why I have max. Now, remember what we're trying to do? We're trying to prove that this space is contractual. Prove that this space is contractual. In other words, we're trying to show that this map is a homotopy equivalent. And we do that by showing all the other maps are. So that's the strategy. So these are documentations. And the part that has con there's one part that's a little formal. The part that has content, or geometric content, is the following. Fp is a homotopy complex. For all p for tweet or so. Okay, so as long as we also embed at least one copy of t, doesn't matter how many, but at least one, then the space of embeddings of c's is controllable. So this is the geometrical context. So let me tell you why this is true. So what is this map? So this is the, this is, I mean, it's always still important. XP is the right. XP is the space of embeddings of things like that, satisfying these conditions. And YP is the same without the C. What is T? T was this thing that I defined on that board and have now erased. So it's the trace. It's a trace of a specific circle. And I described it in a bit of a complicated way so that it manifestly embeds an empty of that. Right. So this map from XP to YP is just a restriction map from embeddings. On this domain, we're embedding a big manifold, and we're restricting to embedding some sort of manifold. So maps like that are always surf vibrations. That's the parameterized isotopic stations. So it is surf vibration by With amateurized session. So, if we're going to show some equivalence, we just have to show that the fibers are contractible. So, what is the fibers? The fibers is we pick an embedding of p plus 1 copies of t, and then we look at embeddings of c that are compatible with that. Fibre over some maybe these, I'll call them E zero. Maybe these, I'll call them B0. I'll put some point like this. Is the space of embeddings well minus infinity 0 times y of c into, well they have to be compatible with this one, in other words they have to be just joint with. In other words, embeddings into the complement I think. Into m minus the image of e to the complement. Okay. Okay. So now I have to show you that that's contractible. And you may ask yourself, but isn't that exactly the kind of thing that we're trying to study? What's better? This is exactly an example of the kind of space that I'm trying to tell you are contractible. So what's better about this example than the generic example? And what's better is the following. Which unfortunately is sort of undrawable. Let me try to do a dimensionally restricted version of that and picture over there. So I had an embedding of C. Rather than looking at a space of embeddings of C fixed on the boundary, and I'm assuming it misses some T. At least one T. Maybe there's more, but it misses at least one. That's the crucial point. So embedding a C. So embedding a C, well its boundary. Firstly, if it misses T, then you may as well remove T. Embedding C, well the boundary, is exactly the same as embedding C and a colour of the whole manifold. Well, the whole boundary. So for free, I can add that to C and look at the space embeddings of that. Because the difference is, again, an embedding of a column and that's contractible. But this. But this manifold, so once I've done that, what is that? That's some two handles and some three handles. The two handles are attached along some loops in the boundary of the manifold. Maybe the new manifold is M prime, this is its boundary. The two handles of this are attached along some loops in the boundary of M prime. But when I do the surgery on T, I kill all the things in the group P. So all these loops are actually in the So, all these loops are actually non-homatopic in the boundary. They're not non-homatopic in this bit of boundary. You have to go off and use the stuff that you did by cutting out T. But they are non-homatopic in the boundary. And so the advantage that this situation has is that even though it's the same C, when I thicken the boundary a little bit, it's still a one-sided H-combortism, but it's obtained by attaching trivial two handles and then homologically cancelling three handles. And that's just an H comport. 300s. And that does an H company in particular, those are embedded by this cheat trick that I said earlier. So let me try. I mean, somehow that's meant to be the rest of the argument. So the point is that the boundary of M minus, what can I call it? D0, is the boundary of M with probably many copies Copies of surgery along generators of the kernel pi one of B to pi one of C done. We do surgery many times, but it's a very important fact in surgery theory, below the middle dimension, that if you kill something by surgery and then kill it again, it just stays dead. Okay, so it doesn't matter that we do. So it doesn't matter that we do surgery far too many times when we've got loads of copies of the ticket. It doesn't matter that we're doing surgery loads of times, as long as we're doing it at least once, it's killed that fungal barrier out. So this slightly improved thing where you glue in the colour, so C prime is obtained as trivial two angles plus Plus homologically cancelling pre-adults. And it's an easy exercise, again, from the proof of the HOWASON theorem, that such a thing isn't actually natural. Because when you trivially attach two handles, you don't change pi 1. And when you attach three handles, you definitely don't change pi 1. So that's the argument. So by cutting out at least one copy of T with four. At least one copy of tea, we've forced the interesting one-sided comportion we're studying to become a non-interesting or edge comport. So that proves that all these maps are equivalent. And so it proves that the map on geometric realizations is an equivalence as well. If you're level-wise equivalence, then you are realizations. And so all that's left is to show that the vertical maps are equivalences. And that's something that by now is very well, there's a very standard thing to do this. Paper that I wrote with Sewin is called. This in the paper that I wrote with Saw and it's called a Some Fischl Technique. And it's these things are what are called topological flag complexes, and there's a standard rigma or you play with W there's some axioms that you check them and they're true for both examples. They're true after you change them a little bit. But that part is somehow not specific to this situation. Just move one email off to the side and it becomes distressful and completely out of the way. You have to change them just like you do in other situations. Make a flabbier version of this, but you don't necessarily Flabbier version of this, where you don't insist that they're district, you just insist that they have district cores, and then that's like an open condition. Like you can pick another core that's destroying all the different ones because their cores are two-dimensional inside the five-dimensional line. Making them miss each other, you just need dimension five. C has two and three handles. You need to be able to pick generically two handles that are destroying from it, which means you need a dimension to be of six. You need a dimension to be at least six. That's where the assumption comes from. Okay, so that's sorry, that so there is another lamp to prove, and it's somehow longer in terms of writing, but it doesn't have anybody new is in, and it proves that the vertical has a provenism, so you deduce that. So in the last few minutes, so far nothing I've said has anything to do with the title. In the last few minutes, I want to make content with the title. Minutes I want to make contact with the title. Delta D for not the D simplex, but compact, contractible topological D manifold. And if you have such a thing, then just by pancoduality, its boundaries are. Then just by Pancha duality, its boundary is a homology sphere. Homologistic. But in fact, the converse is true. So if sigma d minus 1 is a homology sphere, then its fundamental group is perfect, because its meanization is trivial. So we can apply the plus constant, the H Coborton plus construction to it. And we get a one-sided combatant from sigma to its plus construction. And what we know about its plus construction is that it's homotopy equivalent to its plus construction. Manifold plus construction is homotopy equivalent to the CW complex construction. In particular, it's still a homomorphism sphere, but it's also simply connected. While the Poincaré conjecture is actually the homomy sphere, top plot. I didn't want to use it. Top a lot. But then you can fit it in with an ordinary disk. Then your delta, which is C union along that boundary with an ordinary disk, is a constructible manifold. You click as constructible. And its boundary is the homology sphere used. So in fact, any homology sphere bounds Multi-sphere bounds are contractable to model, and vice versa. It's not only contractible manifold. Not only that, it bounds a kind of unique one by the following argument. Suppose I have, with the same sigma, I have a delta prime. So if delta prime delta prime is another, then I can consider the manifold given by gluing them together along sigma. So that's a homologous field, because it's doing two homology disks along a homologous field. But it's also simply connected by side of encounter. So two simply connected things along anything connected. So again by the Poincaré conjecture it's just homomorphic to the order of sphere. It's a homomorphic to the ordinary sphere. Simply connected multi-sphere. Now it's the d-dimensional multi-sphere, so a d minus one. And in particular, it's the boundary of the d plus one disk. Because that means if you do some unbending of corners, the d plus one disk is an hobbortism from delta to delta point. And so they're in fact homeomorphic log boundary. So in fact, not only does the homology sphere bound a contracted manifold, it bounds a unique one up to homeomorphism. That's what this argument shows. And as an application of this kind of stuff, unique up to homeomorphism engineer the first step of a kind The first step of a kind of uniqueness you could ask. That's just saying that the space of fillings is path-connected. You can ask if it's actually contractible. And it is, and you can prove it using this result that I said. You try to write it in an efficient way. So homeo, well boundary of delta, is contractible. State the result. If you think about, that means B homeo is contractible. And given these two things, B homeo of delta is the moduli space of contractible fittings of sigma. So there's a unique contractible filling of any homogeneous filling. Again, with the dimension conditions that I place almost. Conditions that I in place all those times. Good question. So, how here we said let the delta be any compact contractible variable, but then we give specific construction. But any delta has this for? But this argument shows that any two deltas that fill the same thing are holomorphic. So any one does have this form. But also, can you assume that delta is smoothable when you have this? No, because it is, so you don't have to assume it. So the first step of the proof is to smooth it. Okay, so it is always smoothable. Contractable manifolds in high-dimensional are smoothable because there's no obstructions to smoothing them because they're contractible. So hell teacher boundary is a good obstruction. Yes, but that's you don't smooth the boundary first and then smooth the interior. Because then you will be obstructed. You smooth the whole thing in one go and then it's unobstructed. That's not functional. No, there's not. It's not unobactions. Every talk I give on this, I have an argument with a mathematician of a certain seniority about this point. But I agree that this is unusual. I agree that this is unusual, but it's perfectly safe. I can tell you, yeah, it's Kobe Zieberman essay to Colin. So let me just, okay, let me try not to write anymore because I'm constantly trying. So let me tell you in words how the proof of this goes. So step zero is to do what we just said and to show that you can smooth such a manifold. That's just because there's no obstruction from lifting from beyond. Because there's no obstruction from lifting from BO to B top. And that is actually the obstruction for smoothing a single manifold, not smoothing of families. For smoothing a single manifold, that's what the obstruction is. So you can suppose it's smooth. And then you can study diff of the manifold instead of homeo. And instead of proving that homeo is contractible, let me phrase this in a different way. Homeo of delta is the same as homeo of the ordinary d disc, which is contractible without alexandric. So that's an equivalence. With it as another trick. So that's an equivalent statement to this. Homu of delta is the same as homeu of the ordinary disk. But that statement is compatible with smoothing theory. The truth of that statement is equivalent to the truth of the statement diff of delta is equivalent to diff of the ordinary disk, even though both neither are contract. And then you check that because the difference between diff of delta and diff of an ordinary disk is the space of embeddings of delta minus an ordinary disk into delta. And that's exactly. And that's exactly a space of embeddings for one size H coordinate relative to the weird end. And there's a few things about Kai Zoo that you should be careful with along the way, but they're more or less controlled by these two things. Why can't I just do the entire previous embedding argument in the topological category? Yeah, you can probably do that. You can probably do that as well, yes. Yes, okay, thank you. Thanks for the talk. Questions or comments? Of course, if I just want to know that the C and that is the easiest thing that you share is that F1 is the automatic equivalent? If you just want to know that C doesn't care that F extends, so that you have extends. No, because the map from x0 to x minus 1 does not have a section. The first step was like part of the step was programming f of 1 or f0 is the Homo confluence. That means a particular that is an extra space. That means it's a non-empty space, so then it maps to another space, so the other space has to be non-empty. I guess that's true. I guess you could do that. That's not how the people that I mentioned would do it. That's probably illegal. I'm curious. I'm curious, the impatient calculus proof doesn't require the full strength of the conversion current. Well, if you want to say it in a dimension 6, it does. You need to invent something that has absolute 2 and 3 handles. So it has codimension D minus 3. So I guess if D is big enough, maybe you're in the regime where the cheap proof of convergence works. But if you want it for done correctly, then yes. Is it possible for a compact, contractible, vanilla to have boundary that's not automology so you're not sure? No, no, that's analytic. Okay. Or left SQLity, whatever you call it. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I said that it was right. These are indeed different proofs, but they have something, it has something that reminds one of how the convergence of the Benning calculus works, right? Because you have a Works, right? Because you have these different slices of tea that appears. Yeah, it is similar in spirit, but not in a way that you can make a bijection somehow. Yes. I was quite interested in this, the proof I presented, exactly because it seems to be similar in spirit to the proof of convergence, and I confess I don't really understand that problem. So, the problem with core going one-dimensional lower is not just that you have to spread. By by general position. I mean for these for these certain symptom technique methods, you need things to be destroyed by general position. Not because you can make a big defamation when it's destroyed. Do you think it's true? I don't know. I mean, both proofs fail in exactly the same dimension. Maybe it's not true. Notion of one-sided normal coordinates and connection to Capel Shannison's gamma obstruction. What any of those tones mean? I don't know. Phineas homological surgery. Uh-huh. Oh, I see. I see. I mean, these are also, of course, like Z pi and option quartons. They're a bit more special because one end is active for coverage as well, somehow. So, yeah. But no, I don't know about that. No, I don't know. I think it's a good idea. Thank you. Thanks, Oscar. There's a coffee break now, and we'll resume the talk fast.
