So, I would like to talk about modeling cell conductivity in migration. This is a subject we have been working on since a long time. And therefore, I would like to delve into two sub-aspects, namely row signaling and non-muscle myosin 2 isoforms. There will be collaborations with experimental copes and then some model which tries to actually put this into equations. So, let me start by saying. So, let me start by saying in very general terms that we all know, and especially this community knows, that animal cells are very contractile. And I think the main proof is always traction force microscopy. So, these are different projects we have been doing over the years, including the first one actually with Sam and Sasha. And you see that if you look at the traction forces, they always go inward. Okay, so there are actually. Inward. Okay, so there are actually inward-directed forces, they never go outward. So there's always contractility, and we understand this is all based on ectomyosin because if we inhibit either of the two subsystems, it goes away, okay, at least to a certain extent. So it's clear cells, animal cells are strongly contractile. But in fact, to make the statement, you don't even have to go to attraction forces. You even see it if you look at the shape. So, this is from a review with SEM. This is from a review with them. Just in very general terms, if you look at the shape of the cells, you see immediately that they must be under tension, contractile tension. Okay, so they are spherical in solution. They form this arcs in adhesion in epithelial tissue. They are always polyhedral. That's why we can use vertex models for them. And sometimes you get actually these pearling instabilities, like the beautiful work by Sasha and Sam, which they did on pearling in cells. Did on pearling in cells. Okay, so all of these are signatures of tension. So, now no doubt that they are under large tension. So, very early on, we looked at this in quantitative details using micropattern substrates. And I explained this because I will use it again later for the isoform. So, this is just as a background for what comes later. But it's also, I think, interesting work by itself. So, what we did is together with the group of Martin Bastmeier, a long time ago, we looked at these cells on these dot patterns. And this has the advantage. Dot patterns, and this has the advantage that you really can focus on shape because the adhesions are only a few dot-like adhesions, and the rest is basically determined by the cell. You nicely see this in magnated arcs. And what we realized is that you can very well fit circles to this. Okay, so circles are usually a very good fit, at least for pieces of it. But then, if you do this for the right-hand side picture, you realize something interesting. The two circles at the top are much larger than the other ones. Okay, and what is the Other ones. Okay. And what is the difference between these two and the others? Well, they have a larger spanning distance. The distance between the two points is a square root of two longer than for the other ones. Okay. So there seems to be an importance of absolute distances here. So what we did next is we actually analyzed this in quantitative detail. We recorded the spending distance and the radius, and we made what we call the Rd correlation. And we found that the radius increases. Found that the radius increases with the spelling distance statistically. Okay, of course, there's a lot of scatter in this kind of experiments. So, this indicates, as I already said, that there must be some elastic component. And we actually hypothesize that the elastic component is the line tension, which is in the contour. Okay, so we say that the line tension lambda is basically some elastic constant times the stretch in the contour. So, the stress fibers, which you call the peripheral stress fibers, we assume are elastic. Peripheral stress fibers, we assume, are elastic, but for the surface tension, this is what is pulling the cell in. We assume it's a thermodynamic surface tension with no dependence on any geometry. Just a local quantity like interfacial tension. And then if you do the geometry and you put these formulas together, you will find that indeed you predict an increasing radius as a function of spanning distance. And we have measured this first different cell type. And we have measured this for different cell types, and you can fit it in different ways. But this is the baseline of what I'm talking about when I say tension elasticity model. Now, we also looked at this in 3D. So, here we actually use something which is provided by our local cluster of excellence 3D MetaMater order, namely 3D laser writing. So, basically, you print this kind of scaffolds with the two-photon process. This is shown with electron microscopy. This is shown with electron microscopy here, and then you put cells into it. You have to make sure that there are some kind of adhesive platforms which they like to adhere to. And then it's very much like the 2D micropatterns. Okay, you get these amagonated arcs and you can do the RD relation and lo and behold, you get the same relation. Recently, we looked at this with different models, not only surfaces under tension, like in the simple argument, but more complicated models like the Seller-Pots model. And we saw that the Seller-Pots model. Seller POTS model, and we thought that the seller pots model is a little bit better because it knows more about the bulk of the system. But this would be another subject. So, to wrap up this introduction, I'm asking the question, why are animal cells so contractile? I think this community, which comes from soft matter physics, it immediately would agree that it's a natural way to generate forces. So, if you have any kind of interface, I mean, two materials which interface. Two materials which interface each other, you would get surface tension, and this is a way to contract the system. Okay, and more specifically, we have polymers and we have motors, and if you mix them, you get some kind of contraction, they sort themselves out. It's very important to understand that, I mean, in soft metal physics and biophysics, we always work with polymers, and polymers are really bad in extension, but they are good under contraction. Okay, so this is why I think filament motor systems usually work in some kind of contraction. Work in some kind of contraction and very rarely, but there are examples like, yeah, depends. Philopodia, maybe there are examples where you work under extension, but usually it's contraction, okay, for obvious reasons. It's the asymmetry in the force velocity, sorry, in the force extension curves of the biopolymers. Still, even if it's natural, there are alternatives, right? So if you look at other cell types like plant cells, yeast cells, bacteria, or diatoms, they are stabilized. Atoms, they are stabilized or their shape is determined by completely different mechanisms. Like plant cells are pressured up, okay? Bacteria have very stiff cell walls. Diatoms, diatoms use actually mineralized scaffolds, exoskeletons, and so on. So there are ways to actually generate forces to stabilize shape. It doesn't have to be conductility. In fact, conductility has disadvantages. So conductility is prone to instabilities, like everything could condense into very... Everything could condense into very dense systems, right? And there are diseases, for example, muscle diseases, where this happens, where your whole apparatus contracts into something very condensed. Or there's a theory that tendon is actually stabilized this way. So in some sense, conductility is bad. It also leads to bond rupture and things can be detached from the environment. So contactility is not a sort of perfect system. It's a natural system, it's good, but it has to be. Good, but it has to be handled carefully. In fact, early work on friction forces was hypothesizing that these forces are artifacts, okay, because something was wrong in the system, something was dehydrating or some unbalanced charges, it was contracting. So it took a while to understand that these forces are natural, that they're really there for a purpose. Okay, it's not a given, I would say, right? So if you think about it, because of these problems, there always has to be another process. There always has to be another process to balance contractility. Let it be a volume constraint like in vertex models, let it be a stiff element like microtubules, or let it be a matrix which keeps the cells from shrinking even more, something which pulls in the other direction. So animal cells have developed exastellar matrix also for this purpose. Now, if you put it together, these two aspects, quantility and something else, then you get to a principle which is called tensecrity and which has been shown to work in architecture and art. And I think cells in principle. And I think cells in principle work this way. Also, the original concept of 10 security was maybe a little bit naive. But once you accept that contactility can work, you can use it for many things. It's also good because it's a multi-purpose process. Okay, you can use it for mechanical stability, for shape, but you can also use it for cell division, of course. You can use it for migration and for mechanosensation. So once it's established, there are certainly many evolutionary advantages for it. From the more physics point of view, more physics point of view as many people here probably work on it has long-range effects if you cut something it quickly dissipates or propagates in the environment like in boot healing so it has many more advantages also from the mechanical point of view now the the question of cell migration is a little bit more subtle okay because cell migration usually has an element of extension and i'm arguing in favor of conductility but there's a beautiful pl by pierre ricot and colleagues which actually Colleagues, which actually argued why contractility is also a natural way to build migration, because you get retrograde flow and then you combine the retrograde flow with adhesion, and this finally leads to tank threading and migration. Anyway, so to wrap this up, what I'm arguing here is that because contractility is not such an easy process, I think you need to wrap your head a little bit around why it's used and how it's used. It needs a little bit more of details, right? And this is what I would like to talk about. And this is what I would like to talk about today. So it needs a control structure. I talk about the row signaling and it needs some fine-tuning sometimes. And so I will talk as an example about the different isoforms of non-muscle myosin 2, which are the motors behind all of this. Okay, so let's start with the row signaling. And here I always like to show this cartoon, which comes out of the work of Daniel Rivelin and Sasha Bashatsky, early at the Weizmann Institute. Bashotsky early at the Weizmann Institute, where they actually showed how mechanics enters the picture. But I show it for the row signaling. So, what you have here on top is actually, I'm not sure if you see my pointer, so maybe I change to this. So, at top, you see the row itself. It's a small molecule, which can exist in two states, active and inactive. And once it's activated, which can be by many different channels, it has two main effects. So, first thing, through this form in M diar. First thing through this form in M-dire, it actually leads to actin polymerization, which is the substrate on which the motors can work. But the motors also have to be activated. So there is a cascade of phosphorylation events, which eventually leads to activation of motors. One has to understand that the motors not only need to start beating, they also need to start assembling. So the rho signal first leads to assembly in the millifilaments, and then the millifilaments can actually beat. And this is again another way, another example where different functions. Example where different functions are bundled into one control structure. Okay, so the phosphorylation leads both to assembly and to cycling through the motorcycle. Okay, then the myosin can start developing force because it works on the actin, which has been polymerized. And of course, the actin has to be bipolar and all of these things we know from user. Okay, and then together the whole system can productively generate force. So the point here is you need one signal at the top, the whole, which makes all these different. Top the row, which makes all these different elements come together in space and time so that it works. So, recently, there is a new technique which is called optogenetics, which helps you now to understand the system better. Now, optogenetics is not that new, actually. It was developed for the neurosciences. I'm still waiting for the Nobel Prize for it, but it didn't happen this year. But it's a cool technique, and now it's used also a lot in all other parts of biology, in particular the cytoskeleton. And irrespective of what system you use. Irrespective of what system you use, it's always the same principle. You actually use light to recruit some protein to the membrane, and this is a small protein, a so-called exchange factor, Jeff, which actually activates the rho. And then the rho is activated. Now, actually, in principle, the row is activated right at the membrane, but there are diffusible factors which increase the range where it works. Or you can also say, usually, even for stress fibers, you have a membrane somewhere close by. Virus, you have a membrane somewhere close by, okay? So the signal propagates from this activated part, from typically from the membrane to the place where you want stress fibers, okay, or where you need stress fibers. So then the row signal leads to actin parallelization and myosin assembly and activation. Okay, so it's the same in both systems. Doesn't matter which one you use. There are small differences. So this was the first project where I was involved by Patrick Oakes and Market Gardell from Chicago, where they looked Market Gardell from Chicago, where they looked at activation of stress fibers. Now, this is the first interesting lesson. So, they actually activated whole cells. So, these are very strong fibroblasts. And the fibroblasts just ripped themselves off the substrate. This experiment was in the beginning useless. And that's what I mean when I say limitations of conductility. So, then they started to activate only parts of the cells, and this works. So, you now activate these rectangles here. And on the right-hand side, you see that actin is recruited. Actin is recruited and myosin is recruited actually a little bit later. It takes longer, which makes sense because it needs to assemble and to start kicking, actually. And then together you get forces on the substrate and the forces you measured with strict force microscopy. So you here see how forces develop. The larger you make the activation region, the more forces you get on the substrate. And you see this action at a distance because it activates in the middle, but the stress fibers propagate the forces to the endpoints, which are the focal tissue. To the endpoints, which are the focal attitudes, where you actually get the forces. It's straightforward to model this. So, what you do is you first write down a mechanical model. So, here we went for the Maxwell model because it's in this experiment, you see flow in the stress fiber. So, we took a flow model, a fluid vispoelastic model, and then we actually model the optogenetics by just cranking up active stress in some of these elements. And then you actually can read out and compare. Read out and compare with the experiment. You can fit the data and you can extract numbers, like, for example, the active stress comes out to be 2.8 kilopascal, which is a typical value for active stresses, or in general, for stresses in cell systems. So it's clear how you can use this model here to extract numbers. Now, in the next project, which we actually did together with the group of Martial Ballon at Grenoble, we looked at whole cells. Grenoble, we looked at whole cells. So, in this case, we had a different optogenetic system, which is a little bit weaker, I think, and also the cells were weaker. And in this case, it was possible to activate the whole cell. Okay, so what you see is here, two cells on the left on a disk, on the right hand on what we call a hazard. Okay, and in both cases, you have lots of stress fibers, which are not seen here, but they are in the paper. And by activating, you have these stress fibers contracting. Fibers contracting. So we did this on differently sized micro patterns. And what you see is that the larger the micro pattern, so we go from bottom to top to larger patterns, the larger the forces you get, okay? Because it's a larger area over which you actually develop the forces. Second thing you see is that after activation, it takes a few minutes for the system to come up because it takes time for the signal to propagate, it's a diffusion system, but then it actually. Distribution system, but then it actually has a peak and goes down again. And now the most amazing thing was, I think, that you always go back to the same baseline. So, this is something called tensional homeostasis. It's not always true. It depends on the system. But here in this system where you have a very stable system, you perturb it a little bit, you let it go back, you actually get tensional homeostasis. And the system remembers where it came from, okay? Because the system of stress fibers doesn't change much. We also recorded the strain energy, both. Recorded the strain energy both at baseline and in the peak, and it increases with area. Now, this increase with area you can actually calculate. So, some time back, we published an analytical model where we calculated actually analytically the contraction of an isotropic disk. And you can use these solutions to actually estimate the strain energy. Turns out that in the model, it should scale like square root of a. And in the data, which is only three data points, but you have the impression that it's a little bit like. You have the impression that it's a little bit like this. Okay, no proof, but it looks supportive. We also wrote down more equations for the whole pathway, and we can basically, by looking at the biochemistry, explain how an input, which comes from the direction diplomatic system, is converted into the output, which is the traction forces on the substrate. And then our collaborators did the separation experiment, so they increased the pulse duration, and they found that the more you actually put in More you actually put in power, the more you saturate. But interestingly, if you don't get excited system, so if you're at zero pulse duration, you still have the baseline, okay? You still have a very strong contraction in the substrate. So this means that the system is actually far away from being saturated. It still has quite a way to go until it's saturated. And this means that the cell, as it's sitting there and waiting, it can go both directions. Waiting, it can go both directions, can go up and down and direct dynamically to systems. So it's not saturated. Okay, it's important. I think it's important that the cell homeostasis at the intermediate level where it waits to go up and down. This is part of the regulation. Now, in the third optogenetic project, which again was Mart Salvallon, we did this activation for doublets. Okay, so now we went to an epithelial cell line, MDCK, which like to have cell cell junctions, and we put them on this H-pad. Cell junctions, and we put them on this H pattern. So, it has been shown by the work of Manuel Thierry that these H patterns are perfect for doublets because they don't rotate, they are very much fixed in space, and they have this very nice cell-cell junction right in the middle. So, now you actually activate the whole system. In this case, because it's different cell lines, this comes from Guillaume-Scharas, by the way. So, you activate with many small pulses here, but it doesn't matter so much. So, you see the same structure, you activate, and then you. Structure you activate and then it goes down again. Okay, so it works like in the other experiment with a single fibroblast. And now, what you can do is you can activate one side and look at the other side. Okay, so we activate the left cell and we look what's happening on the right cell. And you see, of course, that the attraction forces will always be a little bit larger on the left cell where you activate, but also the other side reacts. And the question now arises: is the other side just a passive reaction? Like you pull a sheet of You pull a sheet of elastic material, and the deformation will propagate through the whole system, even if you pull only in one side, or is there more active components? Okay, so this is the question we asked. And now we looked actually at these doublets in large numbers, and we analyzed both the traction forces and the contour. And you see that the contour reacts pretty sensitively. Okay, the traction forces you don't see here. Well, you see them, but it's hard to see how they react. They react. See how they react. They react on the left side the most. This is where you activate, but there's also some movement on the right-hand side in the attraction forces. So, now for each of these aspects of the system, the friction forces and the cycle tour, we ask how much do I have to couple left and right to see what I see in the experiments. And we do this with finite element simulations in Phoenix. And what we find is that the coupling, this is shown here on the right-hand side, the coupling strength for the attraction forces doesn't have to be large, okay? Forces don't have to be large. Okay, it's basically could be explained by a passive coupling. But if you look at the contour analysis, the contour reacts extremely actively. Okay, so somehow this contour needs a very large active coupling coefficient to be explained by the model. And I think this makes a lot of sense because the contour is made by stress fibers. And stress fibers, of course, focus a lot of activity into one place, okay? And they're probably very mechanosensitive. So I think it's a clear proof that these cells are mechanical. I think it's a clear proof that these cells are mechanically coupled. And we could even increase the coupling and the traction forces by changing the aspect ratio of the pattern. So it turns out if you make the pattern very high, then the coupling becomes stronger. So this is only the standard case. And in general, it also couples at the level of the traction forces. Okay, so there is active coupling. And this means immediately, if you think about it, that now cell one can communicate to cell two by mechanics. I don't talk. Too by mechanics. I don't talk about the molecules behind this. It could be a lot, okay? It could be EGF or could be something in the caterons. We didn't look at this, but I mean, there is a coupling, cell one, activate cell two. But if there was a cell three behind it, it would then be activated. And this would lead to signal propagation, very much like in action potentials or Fitsu Nagumu or something like this. Okay, so we also have a part in a paper where we show that it works for larger systems too. Okay, let me switch subjects and for the next five minutes briefly talk about the role of the non-muscle mice into isoform. So I was saying earlier that the contractility needs a lot of control. And one way to control is this row signaling and in general, the small GDPA cells. Another way is to actually use different isoforms. Many proteins in our cells come in different isoforms. And for non-muscle myosin 2, we know that there are three of them. In two, we know that there are three of them, A, B, and C. So, what is their purpose? So, here we teamed up with Martin Bastmeier again from Krantz Ruhl, and they created knockouts. So, these are cells without one of these three components. If you look at the viral type, these are U2OS cells. You see the usual stress fibers, propulites, and so on. If you do a knockout of non-muscle myosin 2A, all of this is gone. Okay, no stress fibers, no probioticians. It's really bad for the cell not to have DA, okay? To have the A. Okay, if you do the same procedure with the B, it's okay, they do have stress fibers and propallitations, but they look more fussy, not so nice. But there is a better phenotype, okay? And then if you look at C, nothing really happens in this experiment. So we eventually found one situation where it matters, the C, but usually I don't talk about C because it's a little bit special. So now we put the cell into collagen gels, okay? And interestingly, even the A node. Even the A knockout, so the one which on glass on a flat substrate would be no phenotype, okay. Um, well, or strong phenotype, if you will, so completely no stress trial norphoglies. In collagen, it's doing something. It has some inveganated arcs, okay? It's not that bad. And B looks already pretty good. And C, as I said, no difference anyway. So, I mean, I would conclude that this is an interesting proof that the environment is extremely important here. Is extremely important here. Okay, so even if you have an EA knockout, which is really bad on glass or plastic, in collagen gels, you rescue a bit of the usual phenomenology of adherent cells. So this motivated us to go back to the micropatterns. Now we use this process and to look at the phenotypes there. And lo and behold, you see that the A knockout again shows invaconated arcs. Okay, nothing on glass or plastic, but very nice. Nice stress fibers in a structured environment. It's amazing. Okay, so it really proves how much these animal cells depend on the environment. Okay, it's a very strong marriage between the two. Okay, then we went back to the correlation, which I showed you in the beginning, the R D correlation, and we found that the wild type shows the usual R D correlation, so R increases with D. If you do the knockout of A, surprisingly, in these structured environments, we get In the structured environments, we get radii. Okay, we can do the analysis, but the radii are smaller. And for the B, we see that we completely lose this correlation. Okay, the correlation coefficient goes down to 0.3. And for C, there is no correlation. Okay, so then we actually came up with a new model, which we call the dynamic tension acidity model. So the challenge here is that we still believe in the tension assistance model, but now we have an experiment which is about myosin. Okay, and for myosin, the most Myosin, okay, and for myosin, the most important aspects are dynamic aspects, like how much force does it generate, how fast does it go through the cycle, and things like this, okay? And how fast is it flowing, the stress fiber? So basically, we have to introduce more dynamic quantities, and therefore we developed this dynamic TEM. And we actually could prove that you again get an increasing relation of R with D, okay, now a little bit different functional relationship, and then we could interpret our expansion. And then we could interpret our experimental results in the light of this model. And we actually found that the small R for the A knockouts basically corresponds to a smaller line tension. And this makes sense because it means that the A is the main force generator somehow. And this ties in with a lot of knowledge we have about the A. And then for the B, the equations show that there's a instability, so there's no stable solution anymore. And this would explain the loss of correlation. Would explain the loss of correlation in the plot. Another thing we actually realized is that there is a very different spatial localization between A and B. So the A is usually at the front of the cell, so this is here on the left, and the B is at the back of the cell. Okay, so as you go from the front to the back, you see a gradient with an increase in B versus A. And this is now quantified here. So for a polarized cell, the leading edge has very little B, but the back has more B. Okay, and this is. Back has more B. Okay, and this is in very nice agreement with work by Jordan Beach, who 10 years earlier as a postdoc, or yeah, I think as a postdoc at NIH, Ms. John Hammer, showed that there is this gradient, okay, from the front to the back of the cell. So somehow cells like A at the front and B at the back. And from what we know about the molecular properties of these molecules, it makes a lot of sense. Okay, so we know that A is the very fast species, which A is the very fast species which turns over more rapidly but also assembles more rapidly. Okay, we know that from actually our work that A B and B V dimers are more stable than AA dimers. So this speaks for the fact that B can replace A in time. And therefore, we think what's happening is that you assemble very quickly A's at the front and then you gradually replace them by B's. But because they are carried backwards by the rate of grade flow in the back, then you have more B's than A's. Bees than A's. So, in the last part of the talk, I have a few minutes left, I hope. I will quickly talk about how we put this into models of active gel theory. So, active gel theory goes away long way back to Carsten Cruz's work together with Jean-François Chorny, Frank Gulich, Charpro, and others. So, we use it here because we like it a lot. Okay, it's a very strong. It's a very strong model where you can really say something about how things are coordinated in cells in a non-trivial manner. So, for cell migration, it has been shown by Pierre Ricot and others that what you really need to explain cell migration in active gel theory is a gradient, okay? A gradient between little myosin in the front and a lot of myosin in the back, then you get radioplate flow, and together with adhesion, this is turned into migration, okay? So, the question is: how can we explain these gradients and do they come out? These gradients, and do they come out of the theory in a natural way? And can we put in all the aspects I talked about, like optogenetics, rho, and the different isoforms? Okay, so these are the equations. It's basically force balance, some viscoelastic law, very much like Pierre Reco wrote them down. But the difference here is that in the second to last line, we use this concentration-dependent diffusion constant. Okay, this is the new element here, and this is an extremely powerful element. Here. And this is an extremely powerful element because it actually reflects the tendency of the myosins to aggregate into something. Okay, this is the van der Waas fluid, wants to attract each other, but it also incorporates the extruded volume effect, okay, which means that the aggregate has a certain size. Myosin, too many filaments are very large. So there are two important elements here. It's also about the stability of the system that you need this extruded volume. So we think it's a very nice start to. It's a very nice start to model what the non-muscle myosin 2 is doing. And lo and behold, if you put it into equations, we get bicepility, we get a phase diagram between motile and sessile solutions. We have this gradient of myosin. So myosin is in the back in the motile solutions and it's flat in the sessile solutions. And we can explain optogenetics. So we can have a cell migrating to the top on the left-hand side. Then we shine in the front, which means we crank up. In the front, which means we crank up active stress. This actually recruits all the myosin to the back. Now, the earlier font becomes a new back. Okay, now it moves back in the other direction. You can do the same game with inhibition. You can actually, in the model, you can do a rest, you can reversal. So, all of these things which we know in optogenetics basically work. Now, in the last step, we actually put in the different isoforms. Okay, so I mean, the raw signal. Isoforms. Okay, so I mean, the row signaling is in here because we use spatially varying active stress. Okay, the isoforms come in because now we have to write more equations. We basically write one equation of one set of equations for every isoform, and we couple them by excluded volume or something like this. And we do it for A and B because they are the two main important ones. And what we get is exactly that we have parameter regimes where you have a lot of A at the front. You have a lot of A at the front and the B is more in the back. So we get this kind of contributions and they compare relatively favorable with the experiments I showed you before and also by the experiments by Jordan Beach. But then we found something else which is interesting. It's a small parameter regime, but it's a possibility which makes a lot of sense. We found oscillations. Okay, what we find is that it can be that the A and B are continuously exchanging. So front and back are changing, not because we do option. Changing, not because we do optogenetics from the outside, because inside there is a mechanism for exchange. So, basically, what happens is that the B is in the back, then it pulls the A to the back, the A can replace the B in this example, okay? And then the B has to go to the front, this becomes a new back, and so on. And there is a way how you can get oscillations in the system. I have no idea if this is true experimentally, but it's an interesting observation which comes out of the model. Okay, and we wonder if someone can help us here with experiments. With experiments. Okay, so to wrap up my talk, I started with saying that ectomyosin conductility is so important. Okay, it's everything. It's cell shape, it's cell migration, it's cell division, it's mechanosensing, but it's not a given process, okay? It's a complicated process, which has many aspects, and it basically can run ore, it can go wrong, and you need a control structure to make it work. And of course, evolution probably had to fine-tune itself. Probably had to fine-tune it somehow to make it work in different contexts. Okay, so there are lots of details here, and we try to put some of these details in our models. So, there was a list of experimental results with our collaborators, like stress fibers flow under local row activation by optogenetics. Crow cells under optogenetics contract for a few minutes, but then go back to baseline. We showed that the cellular levels are well below saturation, which is important. Neighboring cells show an active response. Cells show an active response, especially if you look at the contour response. Then we looked at the isoforms. So we think, but this is, I think, in agreement with a lot of the literature, also Pekka Lapeline, who might be here. The myosin 2A is the quick responder, okay? It comes, forms the new filaments. It's quickly generating force, but then it needs to be controlled. And this is what myosin 2B is doing. It basically controls the A. And because they have different exchange rates. Because they have different exchange rates, different interaction energies, different cycling, different QD ratios, they can exchange each other. Okay, and there's a gradient from A to B, from the front to the rear of the cell. Now, we put this into active gel models to demonstrate that you can get cell conductivity. We use this new concept of a concentration-dependent diffusion constant from the mass fluids. And we showed that you can recapitulate all these row optogenetics experiments. The model can also explain the The model can also explain the AB gradient if you put in two different species, and it would predict oscillations, which is open to debate. So, I finish by quickly flashing all the collaborators. I already told you, many collaborations with the course of Martin Bastmeier, Marcel Ballon, Margaret Gardel, Patrick Oates, many different students who contributed in one way or the other. So, maybe I mentioned the active gel theory. This is started with work by Oliver. Started this work by Oliver Prostowski, and now Niels Winkler did the work on the two species. Thanks a lot for your attention.
