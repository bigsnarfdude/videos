Okay, okay. Thank you for the introduction. I'd also like to thank the organisers. It's been a very nice conference. Okay. So I'm going to talk about a project joint work with Joshua Box and Steven Gajevich. And this project started in the Arizona Winter School in twenty twenty. So there was David Zurek Brown, who was giving one of the courses. Who's giving one of the courses? And he and his collaborators had recently finished proving Maeser's torsion theorem over cubic fields. Okay, so they had to compute cubic points on x1n, finitely many x1n. By this stage in kind of the literature, these are the remaining cases. And there was one curve, Curve curve X165 had caused them caused them difficulties. Okay, so in the end they found some approach to work out the cubic points on this curve, but initially they wanted Wanted to use, so we have a map from x165 to x065, which is just kind of the obvious maps. This is elliptic curves, points of order 65, and this one up to an elliptic curve, and the subgroup generators were at that point. So they wanted to use this map to reduce the question to just The question's just uh computing the qubit points on X165. I'll say what this, I mean I think we've seen this notation a few times in the conference already, but I'll say what I need by 10 seconds. Okay, so it's computing the cubic points in exon 65. Um but they were unable to do this. Okay. Uh so I'll tell you why they're unable to do this, but first let me set up some notation. So I'm going to have throughout the curve, the talk, X and C are going to be nice curves where nice means exactly what it did in both Abby and Isabel's talks. So we're going to have X and C being nice curves to find over Q, and then to have I'm going to have a morphism of curves defined over Q of degree D and there'll be a prime P of good reduction for both x. Okay I'll try to leave this up. Okay, so how does So, how does one deal with cubic points? Okay, so how do we deal? Okay, um, so the way that we go about this is we study um points on the symmetric power of On the symmetric power of a curve. So here, if we want cubic points, we'll take n equals 3. And we think of points of points on this guy as GQ stable, so deliver stable sums are Of endpoints on X. Okay. So let me just give you an example. So if I take this guy, then this is just going to be, well, what's the different ways of getting this? Well, we could have sum of two rational points, so P and Q, both being rational. This being rational. Or we could have a sum of Galois conjugate points which are defined over the quadratic extension. Okay. Um now This set need not be finite. Again, we've seen examples in Abby and Ispal's talks, but let me just reiterate it. Okay. So if we have a curve defined by FI model, such, so we have FI model such, so we have a hyper elliptic curve, then we get a degree two map from x to p1 just by projecting down to x. Okay? And okay, here we write this. So if I pull back the rational points on this guy, then I'm going to find an infinite subset. Infinite subsets okay so uh yeah okay let let's get back to uh back to excel sixty five okay um so so here we want to we want to compute uh the qubit points. Compute the cubic points. And okay, if we want some methods to do this, well, so the Jacobian of this guy, so it has dimension five and rank one and rank one. So we want some kind of chapter. So we want some kind of Chabuti method. Chabuti type. Okay. And what do we want from such methods? What do we want? Okay. So our basic idea is that we want to sort this guy out into different sets. We want to partition it up somehow. And we're going to partition it up by looking at residue disks on this screen. So Of this thing. So if I take C point P on segment option, we want information on its inverse image. This inverse image, which I'll call D of P in X. Oh, sorry, this should be NQ. Okay? And I'm going to call this guy the residue disc. Okay. Okay, so we want some kind of information on this, which allows us to partition things up into essentially parts that we care about and parts that we don't care about. So things that we don't care about are things which arise from pullbacks from, say, rational points on C. We kind of already have a description of these, so we want to forget about those somehow. So the kind of thing that we're looking for. So the kind of thing that we're looking for, so maybe, so what do we want from such a method? We want, for example, if okay, let me write kind of very carely D sort of section of these guys. So if we have this guy, we want to know. We want to know to know, for example, if say there's only one point in D or for example if um If D consists of pullbacks. For example, pullbacks. Okay, so when I say pullback here, maybe let me write it just here. So IE that D is contained in a set of A sense of this. So, this is what I mean when I say pullback. A point is a pullback, it lives in such a sense. Okay. X here is, in general, any curve. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so yeah, I'm saying this for general curves. But if you prefer, you can always take X to be X naught n and C to be I can. And C to be a can land quotient. Those are where I want to apply the results, but the results in principle work for me. Okay, so there is a method to do this. So Sick, sick. So it says, so it gives us explicit conditions depending on our prime of good reduction, depending on P, such that Uh very clear ED is is contained in either sorry or yes let me say this only uh yeah only has only has uh one point in it in it. So, like essentially, this example, all the second thing happens, it just consists of all x. Okay, so there is some kind of champion method, but despite that, it couldn't be used to compute the quartic the cubic points on x165. Okay, so why is this? So, why is this? So why don't it work for X normal 60? Okay, so the reason is, is that here, okay, we have let me write again row. Let me write it together. So we have Q2 map. Which map? Let's find over Q. So this is just the Ecken-Lenner quotient. If you have a Ecken Lenner evolution, it's just the Ecken-Lenner quotient. And x plus 65 is is uh an elliptic curve of rank one. Could I ask a question? Yes. Is it the W65 action of evolution? Yes, it is exactly. There is also one of five ranks. Yeah yeah yeah I mean W65 once. Okay, it's an elliptic curve of rank one. Great. Okay so this is a degree two map. So if we pull back rational points So if we pull back rational points, which is infinitely many of them here, we get an infinite subset of the symmetric square. Okay? But there's also... Can you read if I write down here? So X065 has four rational points. Okay, all cusps, okay, and just let uh C be one of them. Then we can come up with an infinite set on uh the symmetric cube which uh is essentially not going to be a pullback and as it's infinite we can't expect As it's infinite, we can't expect them to have their own residue list. So let me just not write that down. So if I take my cusp, I add, I look at this set. So I look at this set. Oh yes, thank you very much. Thanks. Yeah, okay, so this gives us an infinite subset. These these are not pullbacks, so we can't can't apply for them here. From here, and as there's infinitely many points, they can't all be alone in that residue disk. So, again, we can't apply this. Okay? Sorry? Question? Yes. So, if I understand correctly, you mentioned that the Jacobian of X065 at rank 1, right? Yes. So, this rank 1 is coming from the pullback of the X0 plus 65. And then you have the cos X by torsion in J065, and that would be all the. And that would be all the rational points in J065. Is that it? Yeah, I think this is true, I think, but I'm not sure if it's a figure of this thing. So, what you're saying here is that basically these translates of the copies of X0 class 65 landing in the Japan, some of them. Some of them are sitting inside the image of the third symmetric power of the curve. Is that it? I'm trying to understand geometrically the construction you just mentioned. So I'm trying to understand geometrically what's going on with this construction you just mentioned. So it seems to me that what's going on is that when you look at the third symmetric power of the curve sitting inside J065, you have this pre-fold clear. You have this treefold here, and then you will have copies of X0 plus 65 sitting inside this treefold. Okay. So this is X5. I see. Can I ask, I mean, wouldn't that equality be true if you just remember the keys? I mean that's one way of saying the question. One way of saying the question. Okay, if I just remove the cues, yes, yeah, yeah, if they find some care, yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah. Okay, okay. Um okay, great. Um okay, so okay, so fair Okay, so given, so if we're given some point P which lives in a set of the form Well Okay, Q Okay, where so this is there's an F there um and so that things make sense n is equal to F plus E D. We give explicit conditions which depend on B. Which depends on the sorry should be a a little bit expensive. Um conditions uh depending on P, I guarantee uh the residue disk. Is contained in a form, uh, in a set of this form. So okay. So I want to give us a few applications of this. Okay. Okay. So we use this new kind of chapter criterion to prove the following. So there are finite committee. Are finitely many qubit points on x0 n for n in list so fifty-three fifty-seven sixty-one. Fifty-seven, sixty-one, sixty-five, sixty-seven, seventy-three, uh, and are all listed in our paper. Yep, okay, and then there are infinitely many. Infinitely many quartic points on X065 and these come in two flavors so they belong either to when we pull back points on there. When we pull back points on the symmetric instances on the symmetric square of this guy, or a finite list list again, which is given in the paper. Okay. Um so I'll just say that the choice of these n was so that the corresponding Jacobian would have positive rank and also so that the modular curve would have genus at most five, just to make sure computations were feasible. Are there any questions? The statement of finiteness of cubic planes. Was that part of the result? Or was that previously? No, um I mean I just write finally many so then it makes sense then something's like listed in our paper. So it would be hard to list. Um yeah supposedly. Does this imply that the only degree format from X065 to P1 factors through the People add factors through the elliptic curve caution? No. No, no, no. There's. So if you, I think if you have a genus 5 curve, then Grill Nota theory tells you that you'll have infinitely many degree formats to P1. And essentially, enough of these must factor through the elliptic curve quotient that we can compute the quarter points. So there's So there's this end here. This again is X057 as genus 5 and it has rank 1. So kind of looking at Chabit conditions, you might say, okay, maybe I can compute the quartic points. But here you can't because the actual Leonard quotient ends up being a genus 2 curve. And so you can't get all of these infinitely many spectrums from. For 65 something really special happens, that the rational points in the Deucodian they come from the rational points in the acting lander position, which happens to be an elliptic curve. Is this accident also occurring with the other levels, or is it just above 65? So could you repeat the question? Right, so if you look at the rational points in the Jacobian of X065. X065. Those rational points have a geometric explanation. They come from the pullback of the elliptic curve X0 plus 65. And I'm just wondering if something like this happens with the other levels where you can apply the result or is it just special 65? So I mean we for this level For these levels, we need to compute the rational model of A group. And we do this by taking pullbacks from the Akalena quotient, pullbacks from the Jacobian, from the model of A group, and combining it with the torsion. But we don't confirm that this is the full thing. It gives at least the finance index of. Yes, at least the finite index of group if this is finite index of group. Okay, so in all cases they come from the Akina repository. I mean here's just you have a pretty finite index in index dividing two. But yeah, we we don't verify whether it's the full thing. Um okay. Um any other questions? Um any other questions? Okay. Okay, so I I'll give another couple of applications which uh I think are very nice. So the these come up from either applying the film that I'm just rubbing off the board or this one. So Yasha has Russia has a very nice application of this. So he says he takes K to be a tochy real quartic field field not containing a square root of five then any elliptic curve Defined E defined over K is modular. So in his proof of this, he needs to compute a load points on symmetric powers of modular curves, and he uses our integrity method as part of this. Also, I'll mention a theorem of Perinda and Mercenterics. Medenterics. Okay. So I think here they used this one just what the cubic points in these curves look like. So if they take this guy, then under GRH they determine. They determine all primes P primes P such that y naught P is empty or equivalently uh empty. Okay. Okay. Any capital? Yes, yes, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, that's okay. So I think they get these kind of these isogeny characters and I don't know, they're divided up into different places. Different cases, and one of these cases they need GIH to wall it out. I think it comes up in work with Momosa. You getting up down to it as well, that's where that's actually when the viewer came up with Michael. How long do I ten minutes? Okay, um so I'll kind of give like a broad overview of uh kind of why symmetric gravity works. So uh okay, so big big picture of uh sorry to change. Okay. Okay. Okay, so we learn again incredibly current D B um X M Q. Q intersecting with some some slightly discurvy which is the which is the which is the residue the residue disc at some point. Okay. Um and let's fix um Abel Abel Jacobi map. Jacobi map from Xn going into going into okay, so we're making the Jacobian okay um and I'll call this I um I'm trying to make it too curly now. Okay, this D is this D. Okay, so we get bedding to both here. So this is kind of the classical Chevy T diagram that I'm drawing up right now. Okay. Um, so in in classical charity we have uh in classical chevron classic group. Let's equal contributory. So this is AB of the error. n equals 1. So introduction contributed when the rank is less than the genus, one tries to determine the intersection of D. Of tea with the candy closure. Okay, one tries to determine this. So, and the rank, the rank condition guarantees that this thing will be fine. Okay, so we get finiteness, but in our case, so when n is greater than 1, this might not be the case. Okay. Um and so so we have to modify things a bit. I don't want to rub this out actually. Um okay so so we have to to modify things a bit. So um so our our problems are coming from Are coming from sets to form I see. Okay. So what we want to do is we want to kind of squish these sets down. Okay. Okay, and okay, so how do we do that? Well, the exact thing which is causing us this problem is going to help us out. So what does that mean? So our rho, our map from x to c, induces a splitting A splitting from Jacobian of X, Jacobian of C across some leading variety A. Okay. And now if we take the quotient map to A then Then uh see uh then things of this form when I project them onto A are just going to be just going to give a point. Okay. Okay, um so yeah, so so the model is is that we shouldn't be trying to do um Chabit here, but rather we should kind of increase this diagram and we we can move it to this abelian frequency for this guy again and and likewise instead of doing things with Instead of doing things with j of x here, we replace it with a of j and then the corresponding rank condition the first point condition should be well, okay. Um well, okay. Um because we're now on kind of uh an n-dimensional um space, we we're going to want n annihilating differentials. So we want the rank of a plus n minus one to be less than the dimension of a. So this is um this is the new rate condition which we under this we we can kind of hope to determine these sets. To the time in these sets. Okay, I think that brings me up to time. Should I end there? Why don't you continue two more minutes? Okay, um, let me see. Okay, I mean, I've I kind of put things into sections a bit, so um okay, I'm gonna I'll I'll yeah. Okay. Um Okay, so as is common in chevy, we want to combine information from different primes. Okay, so combining information from Uh okay. Okay, so yeah, okay, so so to do this we use uh a finite index subgroup of J. Of J Rocks. Um put my continued wonderful. So let's see, questions for Rufin? So you mentioned that you'd kind of gone up to genus five because maybe above that, you think that more difficult? Above that, things are more difficult, maybe computationally. And I asked kind of within the computations: are there paths which are like taking really long, which you would imagine might become more difficult as you increase? Is that kind of one thing which is really tough, or is it just generally everything, slow spread? So one thing that did take a lot of time now, but no longer does, is computing models for these frames. Yeah, there's also. Okay, so I'm always never sure if I end up speaking very fast or something, so I prepared other bits where we get some unexpected things happening where we essentially get some Riemann rock spaces having kind of more map, like a higher dimension than you would expect. And this means that we need. And this means that we need to kind of create again new Chemity theorems to deal with this. And this again makes the computations more difficult. So I don't know, I'd expect kind of more weird things like this to happen. That would again make the computations harder. So going back to the example of snow 65, there is a knowledge about the explanation of the rational points. I could give you Of the rational points, the metric point, which is you have this three-fold image of the third signal power inside the Jacobian, and then you pull back the inner portion. You get one copy of the curve sitting inside the Jacobian, and then you take the translates, like the torsion of the Jacobian. Some of these translates will be contained in the tree-fold, and those are precisely the one that you described as the source of infinite points. Of infinite points, right? But some others will not be contained and they may intersect or not, if they do intersect with some finite many points. It seems to me that these finite many points are the points we're trying to find. And I was wondering if this geometric description leads to something one can actually compute. When you say actually compute, well, I mean, get numbers out of this, because abstractly it gives you a description of the finitely many points, but I don't know if, for instance, it can. But I don't know if, for instance, if the torsion of the Jacobian in this case is something one can compute for a. Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah. Yeah, um, yeah, I was about to say that, um, so this, but uh, it maybe would take too long, is that um, yeah, we completely compute J065Q. Um, I mean, the idea is to look at the Zeroisky closure of the model Bay rule, which is just a bit the colour. That is a final deunion of translators. You intersect this with the info sitting in the sandage covalent, and then either when each of these curves either is contained completely or intersects at an event points. Or you get a final intersection which there is something very particular about this example, and it's not something that we're working yet. I guess in most cases the Well I guess in most cases the the minus part under the fifteen dimension will have a problem. Dimensional this is larger than I mean yeah if if the dimensions are okay. Yeah, but this idea may give a way to do the computation without the total effort. Yeah in theory it's not reasonable but I don't know if in practice one can do the computation. I don't know if in practice one can do the computation of intersection. That's my question. Yeah, good question. Any questions? So you said you computed J065 and Q. In particular, is the torsion subgroup generated by the differences in classes? That components generalized August conjecture. Yeah, in in that case. But I I I don't know I I don't know the status of generalized box conjecture is but I think I thought they knew it for like square free uh n perhaps I I might be wrong when it's saying that. But yeah, yeah, I mean doing these things kind of yeah confirms individual case clocks conjecture. Questions from Zoom? All right, well let's thank you for getting it. Oh, oh yeah. Um at the time we just explored the majority of the ways. There's whatever. Okay, thank you. Okay, you could change the bottom card actually, so like every half of the day, I see. There are good dust in the first, like who does more, like six people eat it. Sure, yes, yes.   What is the conductor of the material? I mean, we should put a third time. But we couldn't find an algorithm. I think I wasn't trying to talk about things. I mean, it's not. Yeah, but you mentioned that I mean you were telling us reaching schemes somehow by selection or something. Did you see anything else inside? No, yeah, there's a white. Oh, what happened? I think it's a little bit of a microphone.
