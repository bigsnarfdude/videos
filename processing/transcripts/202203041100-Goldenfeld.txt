Nigel will speak about stochasticity and statistical mechanics at the Leminocturus in pipes. Okay, thank you very much for the invitation to talk here and for organizing such a stimulating conference. There are two places in the phase diagram of turbulence. By the way, please could people mute? Because I can hear all sorts of weird background noises. So please, could you mute if you're not speaking? Thank you. Including the Including the room, yeah. Okay, so there's two places in the phase diagram of turbulence where you would expect to see universal behavior of statistical fluctuations. So the first, of course, is at asymptotically large Reynolds numbers, and that's what we've been mostly talking about in this conference. But I'm going to talk about the other place where you might expect this, and this is at the laminar turbulence transition. And I'm going to be focusing today on height. So I'm going to talk about work. So, I'm going to talk about work, some old work that was from a couple of years ago with Hong Yen Shi and Song Lin Xi. And then also, I will mention some new work with one of my students, Shai Ying Wang, who is here at the conference. And if she were in the room, she would wave through everybody. All right, so let's get started then. The modern era of transitional flow and turbulence started with Reynolds's. And turbulence started with Reynolds's paper in 1883, where he documented that as you go to higher Reynolds numbers, you go from laminar to turbulent, but you go through this transitional phase where you get what he called flashes, and today we call puffs. That is, regions of turbulence interspersed with laminar regions. And so you might then ask the following question: how much turbulence is in a transitional pipe? And so, as you go along here in Reynolds number, the answer is that you get something like The answer is that you get something like the curve shown here. These are actual data, but they're not on pipe flow. They're on a Couette experiment that I'll talk about later in the talk. But it's something very much like this. Now, the important points to understand is that this transition is not spatially uniform, that you have rare sharp bursts of turbulence interspersed with nothing at all. So you get a different kind of intermittency, of course, than the sort that we've been focused on up to now. And so the question I want to address is: what is the quantitative decision? Is what is the quantitative description of this transition to turbulence? Now, the modern way that is where this is started experimentally really started with Bj√∏rnhoff's wonderful paper in 2008, where they did this setup. They create a flow, they make it subcritical, they inject a disturbance here that causes a little burst of turbulence to create a little puff. The puff propagates down the tube, and if it's a Down the tube, and if it survives to the end, the flow comes out with the red trajectory. If it decays before it gets to the end, it flows out on the yellow trajectory. And so you have a yes-no answer to the question, given an injection here at a particular distance from the end point, knowing the speed of the flow, what is the probability that the piece of turbulence, the puff, survived? And so you can do this experiment many, many times. Experiment many, many times. If you have a very, very clever setup where you can temperature stabilize the flow, make sure that you have accurate measurements of Reynolds number, then you can do this and from the data, the yes-no data about survival, compute the survival probability as a function of Reynolds number and temperature and time, excuse me. So here's the phase diagram. As you increase, you go from laminar to turbulent up at large Reynolds numbers, and the transitional region is extended. The transitional region is extremely complicated. There's a region of metastability, there's a region of spatial temporal instability, and then there's a region of expanding slugs. And I'll talk about all of those today. So the first thing is that when you look at the survival probability for different Reynolds numbers, you get data that look like these early data shown here, and it's an exponential decay, and the lifetime can be deduced from the slope of these graphs. And here is the lifetime plotted as a function of Reynolds number. Plotted as a function of Reynolds number. And this is, in fact, the logarithm of the lifetime. So you can see that it is actually curving upwards, indicating that it is growing with Reynolds number faster than an exponential. When you go into a higher Reynolds number, above about 2040, what happens is a puff doesn't just simply decay away, but it actually can split into two puffs. And then those two puffs will have their own dynamics and they can either decay or split further. And so you get a complicated space-time regime called spatial-temporal. Space-time regime called spatial temporal intermittency. And of course, you can ask: well, how long does it take for the puffs to split? Well, at higher Reynolds numbers, of course, this flow wants to be more and more turbulent. So you would expect that time to be shorter than it would be at lower Reynolds numbers. So that means we'd expect a curve that starts off small here and increases as I go to lower Reynolds number. Yeah, can we mute the microphones, please? And so what you find is that the mean time between splitting. find is that the mean time between splitting events follows the curve shown here. So that's very interesting. If you plot these graphs double logarithm, the last refuge of the scoundrel, you find that they are straight line data and they intersect at this point Reynolds critical, where above this point you have a non-zero turbulent fraction in the system at long times, because there will always be some sort of path that will have split. Some sort of puff that will have split it and created a turbulent in the tube. Now, there's a theoretical reason for this, which we'll talk about. So, this isn't just pure data fitting. So, what I've just told you is that the lifetime scales superexponentially, in fact, these data showing goes as e to the e to the Reynolds number for every time scale. And we'll see where that comes from in a few minutes. Now, the theory for the laminar turbulence transition follows the logic of what we do in statistical mechanics. Do in statistical mechanics. And I want to very, very quickly rehearse that because it's often not familiar to fluid mechanicians. And in particular, the point I want to make is that even today, we still have no first principles way of going from the lowest level of description, electronic structure, to a theory for the universality class of the magnetic phase transition. We go from electronic structure, we coarse grain and look at the And look at the electric dipoles, the electronic dipoles, the spins. We have quantum models, and we have a classical model for that. That's still too hard to solve. Then we go to Landau theory, and then we can solve something and create the do renormalization group theory and really understand the transition in detail. And so let's just see how that works. So these are the important curves here: magnetization as a function of temperature, external magnetic field and temperature. Magnetic field and temperature. This is the phase diagram. And as you see, very close to the transition, you have a very small, vanishingly small magnetization. The magnetization is very, very small, very weak, but the long wavelength modes of this weak mode completely control the non-analyticities in the problem. And that means that they control the singularities that you see as a phase transition. Similarly, as you so, this scales with these experiments here. With these experiments here. Similarly, if you sit on this critical point, normally you would expect that if I apply an external field, I would induce a magnetization in the system, and that would be proportional to the external field applied, linear response theory. But that breaks down at this critical point, and you get a non-analytic response, and this is shown here. And it turns out that both of these things can be subsumed into a similarity formula, which I've shown you here. And here is the magnetization as a function of external. As a function of external field and temperature, plotted in a way that the theory predicts. And all these data for different external fields and temperatures all collapse onto one universal curve for different magnetic materials. And the solid line here is the renormalization prediction of this with no adjustable parameters. So that is a huge success. And I want to remind you that this is a model that gives you a very precise prediction, which is a complete agreement. Prediction, which is a complete agreement with experiment, but actually, this is a model of a model of a model of a model of a model because you started off with quantum chemistry, electronic structure, quantum Heisenberg model, classical Heisenberg model, eventually Landau theory and renormalization group. And you might say, well, okay, this is fine. But the point I want to make is that every approximation that is made here is non-systematic and non-justifiable a priori. Only at the end, when we understand about universality and the normalization group, can we understand why this works. Group, can we understand why this works? So, now we're going to do the same thing for turbulence, and in particular, we're going to look at the try to construct the Landau theory of the transition or the analog of it, and then the renormalization group universal enclosures. Okay, so we identified the long wavelength collective modes by doing direct numerical simulations. And here are the data. The important modes near the transition are small-scale turbulence and an emergent mean flow, a large-scale weak as. Flow, a large-scale weak azimuthal flow, which is technically a zonal flow, which looks like this, has a radial structure, which I'm not going to go into, and importantly, has a time dependence, which has it being out of phase with the energy of the turbulence. And we measured that in our flow. Now, what happens here is that the anisotropy of the turbulence is creating Reynolds stress, which generates the mean flow in the azimuthal direction. What happens then is that that mean flow Happens then is that that mean flow then shears the turbulence in the center, reduces its anisotropy, and thus suppresses the turbulence. So the turbulence is inducing the zonal flow, that zonal flow suppresses the turbulence, the turbulence being suppressed then suppresses the zonal flow, and then you come back up to here. And so what you're going to get is oscillations, which is the ones I just showed you, which are essentially like predator-prey oscillations in ecology. And this phenomenon was first identified in an early paper by Pad. In an early paper by Pat Diamond in the context of magnetohydrogen arrays. And I will show you the observations of this later. Okay, so this is the idea that we have a, we can think of this as a predator-prey where the predator is the zonal flow and the prey is the turbulence, and the turbulence feeds on the kinetic energy in the laminar flow. Okay, so now let's make a stochastic model of predator-prey dynamics. And the way we do that is we simply write down birth and death processes. Simply write down birth and death processes and predation processes, such as a predator A meets a prey B, annihilates it, and uses the energy gained to create a baby predator. So you now end up with two predators. And you can go ahead and do this, and you can work out the theory in great detail. Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at the diagrams that you would get in Navier-Stokes near the transition following, again, the usual Feynman diagram picture due to Bill Wilde at Illinois in the 50s. Illinois in the 50s. So, what you do is you have two lines here: a zonal flow line, the emergent mean flow and the turbulence, like this. All the vertices are like triangle vertices like this. We can write down every single diagram that is allowed, and each of these diagrams can be interpreted as a predator-prey interaction. So, for example, this one here is a turbulence runs into zonal flow, something happens, and then eventually the zonal flow suppresses. Zonal flow suppresses the turbulence and creates more zonal flow. That's this diagram over here, which corresponds to the predation reactions I told you about a few minutes ago. So you can take the sequence of reactions and now say, let's go and look at the phase diagram of a spatially extended predator-prey system in a pipe geometry. The analog of the Reynolds number turns out to be the prey birth rate. And as we increase the prey birth rate, And as we increase the prey birth rate, we go from a situation where the system goes extinct to a situation where we get a population that initially starts off and then eventually decays away to a state where you get these traveling fronts and then an expanding population mimicking precisely the phenomenology that you see in real turbulence. So let's have a look then at the space-time picture of the system. So over here is the space-time picture for a real turbulence from Reeler et al. Real turbulence from Rilo et al. in 2011. The intensity of turbulence is plotted in the color scale here. And what you're seeing is a puff going slightly backwards in the lab frame and then splitting into two and then subsequent splittings as shown here. And here is the predator-prey model. And again, you see exactly the same kind of pattern of splitting events, the spatial temporal intermittency that you see here. So we've mimicked qualitatively the features. So now let's Qualitatively, the features. So now let's ask some quantitative questions. What is the statistics of the extinction time? That's the decay of a single puff, and what is the statistics of the time between splitting events, the splitting puffs over here and the splitting events in the predator-prey system over here? So we can go and measure that in our stochastic predator-prey model. And here you see the data. These are data that I showed you at the beginning of the seminar from Evila et al. for turbulence. These are the data that you get. These are the data that you get from the predatory system, and you completely recapitulate what we see here. So, what we've learned is that the death of turbulence is the extinction transition in ecology. Now, what I've told you then is that near the transition, classical turbulence reduces to a kind of two-fluid model, which is in the sort of predator-prey universality class. But we want to understand what is the universality class of this phase transition, and I'm going to show you now that it's directed percolation. And we're going to see that. And we're going to see that by taking this predator-prey model, writing it down as a path integral, and solving that to understand what the critical behavior is. Now, luckily, most of this work was already done for us by Mabilio et al. in 2007. So I will just give you a very, very quick graphical illustration of how this comes about. So, over here is directed percolation showing you percolation in one direction, which will One direction, which we'll call the time direction, going down like this. Think of this as water flowing through a pores medium. And you can convince yourself that each of these diagrams that represent possible trajectories can be built up out of this sequence of four possible minimal diagrams here, where the top line is where you are at time t, the bottom line is where you are at time t plus one. So you have this annihilation process, this process called decoagulation. This process called decoagulation, diffusion, and finally coagulation. So, this is what you get when you simulate directed percolation. It looks like this: above the percolation probability, you always flow to the other side. And at large time, there is a non-zero fraction of filled sites. Below the percolation threshold, you just get stopped along the way. And at the critical point, you just about manage to get through to the other side at long times. And there's critical exponents that characterize this. Critical exponents that characterize this, and this is exceedingly well understood. So, in three plus one dimensions, you can do directed percolation as shown here on the left. And what you can see happening is that the turbulence is decaying away. And eventually, what you find is that there is some last time when the turbulence is still present, and that's what we're going to measure. And that last time shown here in this one plus one-dimensional example here, where you start off with these fields. Example here where you start off with these field sites, the time for turbulence to decay away is the time of this longest-lived percolating strand. And if you're not exactly at the critical point, these strands are independent, or at least over a sufficiently large region, they're independent. And so what that tells you then is that the lifetime statistics is going to be dominated by extreme value statistics. And that fundamentally is the origin for these superexponential. Is the origin for the superexponential behavior that I showed you at the beginning. Now, when we write down the space-time model of predator and prey, and I and J here represent spatial sites on a lattice, I and J being nearest neighbor sites, here are all the reactions I showed you before, but spatially extended. Near the transition, the prey are going to go extinct. The predator, which survives on them, is going to be even more extinct, as it were. So we can heuristically just remove. Heuristically just remove the predators from the reactions here. So I just cross them out. And then I'm left with a two-trophic level ecosystem. And if I look at each of these terms diagrammatically, you see that I get the spatial pictures, the spatial minimal diagrams that correspond to directed percolation. So near the extinction transition, the stochastic predatory dynamics reduces to directed percolation. So is this true? So the answer is yes. This is true. So, the answer is yes. So, here are two experiments both done on Taylor-Couette systems by Bjorn-Hoff's group. This is a one-dimensional, quasi-one-dimensional system. The outer cylinder is rotating, the inner cylinder is stationary, and that means that the transition is a sub-critical transition. And what you do in this case is you just look along a little slit here as the fluid flows past, and you look for regions of turbulence, which are these black stripes shown here. Stripes shown here. You take these pictures, the first rotation, second rotation, third rotation, etc., etc., stack them up one underneath each other, and you get these pictures that are shown here, showing you the blue is the turbulent, yellow is laminar, and you can see that you get pictures that look very much like directed percolation. And when you analyze the statistics of these deturbulent fraction and other things that I'm not going to go into, you find that you can measure all the critical exponents of directed percolation. Just a couple of weeks ago, Just a couple of weeks ago, the two plus one dimensional version of this was published in Physical Review Letters, looking at a long center, not one that is narrow. So we understand then that there is, at least in a closed geometry, there is a directed support for this directed percolation prediction. Here are observations I'm showing you of the predator-prey interactions that were first predicted by Diamond. That were first predicted by Diamond, and these are from Estrada et al. in a Tokamak in Europe about 10 years or so ago. Okay, so now let's talk about beyond the critical point. So what I've told you about so far is puff decay shown here for Reynolds numbers lower than about 2040 or so. So what we're going to now talk about is the regime of a higher Reynolds number where actually turbulence spreads throughout the pipe. And these things that spread are And these things that spread are called slugs. Okay, so now we're going to talk about slugs for the next few minutes. So here's the diagram, the phase diagram that I've showed you earlier. We've talked about all of these phenomena so far, and now we're going to be looking at this slightly larger Reynolds number regime. So what happens here is what happens is that turbulence actually can grow in this regime, as we saw that, and there's two types of slug. There's what I'll call weak slugs, and then there's strong slugs. Slugs and then there's strong slugs. The weak slugs are slugs that have a front up here, a sharp front, and you can see over here there's a very weak, hardly non-hardly existing front, and this is the turbulent intensity as a function of space. And you can see that it basically dies away. There's only one front up at the upstream edge. On the other hand, at high enough Reynolds numbers, you get these strong slugs where you have two fronts, both the upstream and downstream one. And we're going to try to understand. One. And we're going to try to understand that. Now, when you look at the experimental data for the speed of these fronts, what you see are data that look like this. This is the downstream front, this is the upstream front, and you see a shape like this. And again, this was measured in data from Bjornhof's group. Now, what I told you so far was the theory for a single puff, just a small system, a single puff in a box. And what we need to do is include the mean share. Do is include the mean shear because it's the mean shear that controls the spatial extent of the path. Now, the first work on this that was done was by Dwight Barclay, who said, Well, this is a subcritical transition, so this therefore should be an excitable medium. And he devised a very nice equation, which is sort of like the Fitzi-Nagumo type of equations that describe nerve fibers. And he applied that to try to make a phenomenological model. And we're going to sort of use some of the insights that came from that, in particular understanding the energy budget, to make a Understanding the energy budget to make a stochastic, a fully stochastic model of the slunk behavior. So, what's basically happening is that we have energy input into the system. These are the velocity profiles across the flow. When you have turbulence, the flow becomes blunted. The velocity profile becomes blunted and then eventually returns to the Hagen-Prossell flow further downstream. And what that means is that there's an energy depletion zone, which is shown over here. Which is shown over here. And so we're going to need to focus on this because this is going to be very important in what happens next. So, what that means for our stochastic models in an ecosystem sense is that we need to include the mean flow energy that comes from the Lyman flow. So, this is the turbulent energy, this is the mean flow energy, and what we have then is we think of this as nutrient. Is we think of this as nutrients being advected through the system, feeding the predators and preys as you go through this path. And so we model that simply by a deterministic advection here, which is given by this reaction here. This is how the prey, the turbulent, survives, draws energy from the laminar flow, and then the regrowing back of the Hagen-Proselle flow is where vacuum creates new nutrient. Creates new nutrient. And this is a flow velocity u, and so we rescale everything by one over u in order to get the Reynolds number dependent. So these are the reactions. These are the new reactions that we've included, just simply adding the nutrient. You can show that the rate of growth goes like the Reynolds number squared, and I'm not going to go through where that comes from. And so now let me show you, end by showing you the results. So what you see is that here on the right is the So what you see is that here on the right is the experiments and on the left is what comes out of the model. And first of all, we have here a puff showing it decaying in the frame like this. This is the puff splitting reaction happening over here, just as we saw over here, again with the asymmetry now because we have the mean flow and the correct shear interactions modeled. If we go into the weak and scroll slug regimes, here is what you see. Here is what you see is the experiment. This is the weak and the strong slug, and this is what the model predicts. If I look at the downstream and upstream front profiles, the velocities, we measure that in our simulation, and we see again we capture the characteristic asymmetry of the expanding fronts in the weak slug phase. So, the role of stochasticity here is very important. I'm just going to end with just a Important. I'm just going to end with just a few remarks about that. So, the first thing is that in this regime here, shown in pink, once I've got a puff, there's a regime where there really isn't enough nutrient to support a new puff. And so what that means that if there's a stochastic fluctuation that allows some turbulent energy to get into this blue regime where there is enough energy to support a puff, then a new puff can emerge. A new path can emerge. And that's how you get path splitting here. And this is so you're basically getting tunneling, as it were, through this energy depletion zone. Now, the propagating front is a very complicated story. And if you're interested, you can ask me in detail about it in the discussion. If you take these equations and do a van Kampen expansion, you get these mean field equations here, which I'm not going to discuss in detail. But basically, these are generalizations of the Kolmogorov-Petrosky. Generalizations of the Komogov-Petrosky-Pisculo-Fisher equations. And those equations describe the propagation of a stable state into an unstable state as modeled by the KPP-Fisher equations shown here. And when you look at directed percolation, it turns out that I take the basic directed percolation reactions, write them down as a field theory, look at the stochastic equation that describes that field theory, and it ends up being the KPP-Fisher equation, but with multiplicative stochastic norms. With multiplicative stochastic noise added to the right-hand side. And it is that feature that is responsible for the front behavior. So here is what happens if you solve the deterministic equations. You don't reproduce what you see in experiments. But in the stochastic model, what you see is this. You get a sharp front upstream and a weak front downstream in the weak slug regime. Similarly, this sharp front, you might say, is, well, it should. You might say, Is well, it should be a bistable front. That's what we know from this being a sub-critical transition. Now, the KPP fissure fronts are not usually thought of as bistable fronts, but it turns out that they actually are. They are the bistable limit. They are the limit of a sequence of bistable fronts, and that's a result of a structural stability and the influence of demographic stochasticity. And I don't have time to explain that, but I can answer questions about it if you want. Similarly, if we look at the Similarly, if we look at the weak front here, this is not a well-defined front at all. There's insufficient nutrient at the downstream edge, and we can make a stochastic theory of that, which in ecology would be called a stochastic of the effect. Lastly, we can apply the same model to looking at Taylor-Couette flow. So, in pipe, the energy is coming in from the left. In a Taylor-Couette system, it is shear-driven. It comes in from the boundaries. And when we simply model that, Simply model that. What we find is that there's no energy depletion zone in that, and we replicate exactly what you see in the experiments. So I'll end there. This is my summary slide, and I'll be happy to take any questions.
