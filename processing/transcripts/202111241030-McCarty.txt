So, first of all, I want to say thank you, everyone, for coming, and thank you to the organizers for inviting me. I'd also like to shout out to the Polish hub for setting up the cameras that it looks like I'm actually speaking to you. So I've got that set up high. So, thank you. So, what I'm going to be talking about today is joint work with Seniak Dvorak and Sergey Noran and concerns. Noran and concerns classes of graphs with small separators. So, my definition of a separator is the same as going through yesterday. I'm actually just interested in balanced separators, but I'll just call them separators. So, a separator is a set of vertices so that after you delete them, you can partition the remaining vertices into two parts, each of which has at most two-thirds of the vertices of the original graph, so that there are no edges between the two parts. And then I'm going to. And then a class has sublinear separators if each invertex subgraph of a graph in the class has a separator of order n to the 1 minus epsilon for fixed epsilon greater than 0. So sublinear separators have shown up a number of times already in the workshop. And in particular, Sergei mentioned yesterday a result that he and Zinik proved that if you always have separators of constant size, that's actually the same thing as having bounded tree width. But here we're interested. Tree width. But here we're interested in the sublinear regime, or sometimes they're called strongly sublinear because you're actually bounding away from by an epsilon and the exponents. And our sort of pie in the sky goal for this project was asking, can we describe the structure of classes with sublinear separators? So this sort of seems really, really difficult from looking at it right away. And we weren't overall successful in this goal, but we still have some. Successful in this goal, but we still have some interesting results to share. In particular, we found a geometric representation for graphs, which guarantees sublinear separators, generalizes some other previous classes of graphs which are known to have sublinear separators. And importantly, for this workshop, this representation respects product structure, which previous representations did not. Which previous representations did not. And unfortunately, this representation still doesn't capture every class of graphs with subliminary separators. So the quest continues. Our overall approach is based on generalized coloring numbers, and we have at least some open problems for generalized coloring numbers, which still might be able to answer, which would tell us more about the structure of classes of seminar separators. So, what classes? So, what classes actually have this property? The most classic example is planar graphs. So, planar graphs have separators of size root n, as proven by Lieutenant Tarjan. And so, given this workshop, the next most natural question you'd like to answer is, does every class with product structure have sublinear separators? And indeed, the answer is yes. So, I mean that for each fixed C, the class of all subgraphs of the strong product of a graph of tree with the most C in a path had. With the most CNA path has separators of size girt in, and so you oh, sorry, I've got an alarm going off. I don't want to distract anyone with this. Okay, sorry about that. Everyone can still hear me again? Yes. Okay, thank you. Okay. Okay, so you can sort of intuitively see that classes with a product structure have quadratically sized separators because either you get a vertical separator or horizontal separator, but the same actually holds for subgraphs and you're always going to get a separator of size root n. And also classes with the forbidden minor have separators of size square root n. And David talked yesterday about product structure for such classes. About product structure for such classes. And one problem that you get is that Apex grids don't have the product structure. But this and clique sums are the only problem, like David mentioned. And we'll see that there's a natural way of sort of capturing apex vertices by looking at certain types of geometric representations. So that's one problem that we'll be able to address. But so far, those examples aren't even close to capturing every class. Aren't even close to calculating every class of sublinear separators because classes of polynomial expansion also have sublinear separators. So that is classes whose depth R minors have average degree at most polynomial and R. And a depth R, saying that a minor has depth R just means that each bag has a spanning tree of radius at most R. And that'll also be talked about more in the next talk. And I'll also be talking about more in the next talk today. So, the really amazing thing is that Ziniak and Sergei actually proved that these are the only classes with subliminal separators. So, a class has sublinear separators if and only if the depth R minors have average degree of most polynomial in R. And so this is sort of crazy. I think that this theorem is really exciting. It's more or less a forbidden minor characterization for classical sub-linear separators. So, this is really strong, but This is really strong, but we'd like something a little bit more explicit. So, the overall focus of our project was just to answer this question. Does every class of separators have a really explicit structure, something along the lines of the product structure? So, we've seen some explicit classes with sublinear separators so far, in particular, planar graphs and classes with the product structure, but both of these have. Structure, but both of these have separators of size root in, and so that's not going to be enough. And the next thing that we're going to look at is sort of the higher-dimensional analog of these classes. So the natural thing to do in regards to the product structure is to just continue taking strong products with paths, right? So just do it more than once. And indeed, Tworzhak, Huh, Joure, Liu, and Wood recently showed that subgraphs are the strong product of a graph. product of a graph of bounded tree width and d paths have separators of order n to the one minus one over d plus one. And the way I like to think about this intuitively is that the strong product of paths is about the same, at least whenever you get rid of the diagonal edges, it's the d-dimensional grid. So you can just sort of keep on keep on going. And then to look at a higher dimensional analog of planarity, we have to view planar graphs. Log of planarity, we have to view planar graphs in a different way. And we're going to use the Coban-Drived-Thurston theorem, which says that planar graphs are precisely the intersection graphs of internally disjoint circles. So for any planar graph, there's some way of drawing it. So you can draw one vertex out. So you can draw one circle around each vertex. So the circles are internally disjoint, and there's an edge between two vertices if and only if the circles intersect. And of course, you can also go in the other way. And of course, you can also go in the other direction, beginning with the collection of circles. And in general, if you give me some collection of sets, I'm going to be interested in its intersection graph. And the intersection graph is obtained by adding a vertex for each set in your collection and putting an edge between two vertices if those sets intersect. So now that we have this definition, we can naturally just look at a higher dimensional. We can naturally just look at a higher-dimensional analog. So we'll get sphere backings. And in general, the intersection graphs of internally disjoint balls in Rd have separators of order n to the 1 minus 1 over d. So there's this really pretty theorem that says that. And what's nice is that this lets us deal with our problem of apex vertices because instead of looking at internally disjoint balls, you can also look at k-wise disjoint balls. At K-wise disjoint balls. So it's enough that no K of your balls have a common point. And in general, I'll say that a collection of sets is K-wise disjoint if there aren't K sets that have a common intersection. And so you can actually represent apex grids already in two dimensions, like this. And now you can make this even more general because instead of balls, it's enough to consider compact, convex sets of bounded aspect ratio. So something like this, where it's enough that the length isn't too much more than the width, where in general, the aspect ratio is the ratio of the diameter to the width. But unfortunately, these two examples. Unfortunately, these two examples that we've seen so far aren't compatible. So we've seen examples of classes with the product structure, and we've seen examples of these geometric intersection graphs, but the two aren't compatible. That is, if you take the strong product of a big enough star and a long enough path, and in fact, you don't even need the diagonal edges, then this thing isn't a subgraph of any of the geometric intersection graphs that we've been looking at. Geometric intersection graph that we've been looking at. So it's not a subgraph of any intersection graph of these k-wise disjoints, compact, convex sets, and RD with bounds and aspect ratio. I think there's a really pretty proof to sort of see why intuitively. So I want to go through that. So let's look at our graph. It looks like this. And I'm going to call these vertices along the top, the high-degree vertices, hubs. And so if you look at the hub of minimum. At the hub of minimum volume, and you assume it's actually represented somehow, then whenever you look at its neighbors, almost all of them have to be small, because you can't pack many circles into this small area without having one point in a lot of the circles. And so, if you do this again and you look at the neighbors of everything. Again, and you look at the neighbors of everything of all of these low-degree vertices. Again, almost all of these vertices have to be small. But now some other hubs are neighbors of that, and the hubs and the other hubs are bigger than the original hub we were looking at. And so if you sort of continue this process, you'll end up packing too many hubs of large volume into this really small space. And so that can't happen. Can't happen. And so, what we're going to do in order to address this problem, the type of representation that we found, we're going to replace this condition about the aspect ratio with a different condition about pairs of shapes. So, the intuition for what's going on here is that all you really need about the pairs of shapes is About the pairs of shapes, is that if you give me two of them, well, let me say first of all what holds for circles. So, if you give me two circles and you look at the smaller one, you can move the smaller one inside the larger one so that their boundaries intersect, and you can continue moving it around in order to cover the whole boundary of the larger circle. But the point is that this property. But the point is that this property also holds for some shapes that don't have bounded aspect ratio. So if you give me two axis-aligned rectangles, as soon as the smaller one fits inside the larger one, then you can move it around everywhere to cover the whole boundary of the larger shape. And so this condition is the only thing that we actually need. And we have an approximate version of this condition, too, because. Version of this condition, too, because, for instance, if you have a circle and a rectangle, you can't cover the corner of the rectangle, but you still can in some approximate sense. So here's the definition. The property that we want is that if you give me any two shapes, there's some way of selecting which shape is larger and which shape is smaller, so that for each point in the larger shape, Larger shape. There's a translate of the smaller shape, which contains that point. So the volume of the intersection is at least one arth of the volume of that smaller shape. So this dark gray part in the picture is certainly well more than half of the volume of the circle. And if you have a collection of shapes that satisfies Have a collection of shapes that satisfies this property, then I'll call the collection R comparable. And so, what Azinia Konsergi and I proved is that the class of intersection graphs of this type of objects has sublinear separators. Right, so there are comparable KOS disjoints, compact, convex sets in RD. And here's an example of a And here's an example of a collection of such shapes in three dimensions. And so, again, the point is that for each of these smaller cubes, you can move it inside the larger shapes in order to cover the whole boundary. And what's nice about this definition is that it works much better with the product structure. So, if you look at a single layer of this shape, it looks like this, and the intersection graph of that is a star. The intersection graph of that is a star, and if you look at the normal line of that hyperplane that we took in order to get all the layers, and you project onto that, then you get this hypergraph instead. I've got four intervals, and the intersection graph is just a path. And indeed, the intersection graph of the three-dimensional shape I've drawn in the middle is the strong product of that star and the path. And the path. And this is a more general occurrence. So if you give me some collection of these R comparable KYS district compact convex sets, so say on the left. And if you give me another collection, which had a slightly stronger property, the property is that any pair of shapes, you can choose either one to be large and either one to be small. Small. So that holds in this case because all of the shapes are identical. So as long as you have this property, then you can also represent the strong products of the corresponding graphs by just taking the Cartesian products. And the other thing is that these graphs on the right, where you can choose either shape to be large and either shape to be large. Either shape to be large and either shape to be small. Using a theorem of Kroth, Gamer, and Lee, you can show that these are exactly subgraphs of the strong product of a bounded number of paths. And so I think this is really nice. Like this example that we went through earlier where you had this D-dimensional grid, that's exactly what's happening. That's exactly what you're allowed to do with products. So, the representation works well with strong products. And the way that we showed that they have sublinear subratus is by this connection of strong coloring numbers. So it's known that any class with strong coloring numbers at most of polynomial and R, has sublinear subrators. And in fact, this is how we lose the whole thing in the exponents. So that's where that comes from. So, let me give you the definition of these strong coloring numbers. So, the art strong coloring number is small if there exists a linear order of the vertex set. So, the following holds. For each vertex V, there are few vertices smaller than it, so that there's an X V path of length that most R, whose internal vertices are all bigger than V. Okay, so having these polynomial-sized strong coloring numbers is enough to guarantee you sublinear separators. And there's a really pretty geometric argument for why this type of graph has polynomial bounds and strong coloring numbers. And that is that you can just sort the shapes by increasing volume. So your first vertex in the order is the shape of largest volume, and the next largest volume, and so on. So let's go through in pictures why you actually get polynomial bound from this. So let me start with some shape, which is like my shape V from the definition. And so I want to see how many vertices of larger volume I can reach by going through shapes of smaller volume. And in my example, I'm looking at a collection of access to the line of rectangles so that. Just the line of rectangles, so that for any pair of them, one of them fits inside the other. So any other shape of smaller volume looks like this in the picture. And the nice thing about that is that a small blow-up of my original shape will contain all of those other shapes. And then if I do this again, if I look at all neighbors of that, then again, I just need to blow up my. Again, I just need to blow up my shape a little bit more, and it'll contain everything so far. And so the point is: by looking at by only increasing the dimensions by a linear amount, you can contain all of the vertices, all of these smaller vertices with a short path to V. And so now if I look at their neighbors, which are smaller than V in the linear order. Are smaller than v in the linear order, these vertices x, they're actually large in comparison to v, and so I can't pack too many of them into this small space. And so that's at least an intuitive argument for why this works. Unfortunately, this is why we can't hope to use this representation to get a structural result for classes of sublimar separators, and that is. Separators, and that is that we showed that there exists a class that does have sublinear separators, but cannot be represented by comparable axis-aligned rectangles. So we didn't prove the same thing for the more general definition, but I would expect that the same thing generally holds. And certainly it seems like a problem that we have to overcome if we wanted a structural result for classes of sublinear separators. And so the example sort of looks like this. Sort of looks like this. You take some graph and then you're adding a big independent set to it. And each vertex on the right has a long path to each vertex on the left, right? So there's a bunch of stars that I'm moving on, which are subdivided a lot of times. And we're subdividing it a lot more than the size of the set on the left, but also we're adding a lot more verses. But also, we're adding a lot more vertices on the right than even the number of times it's subdivided. And so the point is that if you repeat this construction, we can show that it still can't be represented this way, even though it has these small separators. And so since this geometric representation doesn't capture every class with small separators, it seems that the best we can do is perhaps to look at the strong coloring numbers. The strong coloring numbers. So, one problem that I really like to see answered, which was asked by Jorain Wood, I mentioned in this paper of Esperan Raymond, asks, does every class of sublime separators have strong Collins numbers bounded by polynomial R? Right, so we saw that the converse holds, but this is still open. And moreover, this is asked by Vanden Boigl and Kirsten: does every Does every class with strong coloring numbers bounded by a polynomial R have the same thing but with a uniform vertex ordering? So, that is, if you have a class that has these strong coloring numbers bounded by a polynomial R, then is there a single vertex ordering which shows that that same thing holds for all R? And Van Den Huibwell and Kirsted proved that something like this holds, except for you don't put the polynomial bounds. I think their bound is like doubly exponential. I think their bound is like doubly exponential or something like that. All right, thank you.
