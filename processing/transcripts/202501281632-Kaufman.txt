The birds for a long time, so it's a dream come true. Thanks for a week that's going very well so far. Thank you all for coming to hear about Fricos trace identity and in groups. So this summer I found a proof of Fricas trace identity. I don't know if it's a new proof. So if you've seen it before, I'd be very happy. If you've seen it before, I'd be very happy to know. But on the other hand, I don't want you to spoil the ending. So if it's not an improved, tell me in 20 minutes. I don't know the history of this. It may not actually be due to Fricka. To Fricker. Goldman has some notes about Fricker's trace identity, and he quotes a paper of Vought. But dates are close enough that I assume they had it independently around the same time. So we've already seen it earlier in the week, but just to recall, Just to recall, for a pair of matrices AB and SL2, the functor SL2 works algebraically. We let x equals the trace of A, Y equal to the trace of B, Z or Z equals the trace of AB, and K is the commutator trace. There's a cubic relation between those traces. Sum of squares is the product plus a plus two. So, my goal in the next little while is to recall. We call the standard proof of this and other proof that may or may not be new and may or may not actually be that different from the standard proof. We'll see. There are some special cases of Frickett's identity that are maybe more familiar. One is if you just take both matrices to be the same, if A equals B, you're going to get the trace of A squared here. Commutator will just be the identity, so that'll have trace 2. And you can simplify the identity. It'll actually have two factors. The polynomial is reduce. The polynomial is reducible. But one of those factors, well, the trace of the square and the square of the trace are related. So the trace of A squared is the trace of A squared, trace of the square, rather than the square of the trace, plus two. Plus two. And if you specialize, you can further both of them being equal to a rotation matrix. A squared would be the rotation by double the angle. So this is just giving you the double angle formula from trigonometry. I think of Frick's identity as some sort of matrix version of the double angle formula. So, if you look, for example, in Eibner's book, you'll find a proof of Frica's trace identity, which I think is the standard one, presumably the one that Frica and Vlad found, where you first prove a lemma, and then you basically use the lemma three times. So, for again, any pair of matrices in SL2, the trace of AB plus the trace of AB inverse are related by Markov mover and once the move, you got the trace of A times the trace of B. A times the trace of B. As you've already mentioned, this follows from the Kayleigh-Hamilton theorem. B solves its own characteristic polynomial with a constant term. Or the constant term is 1, because we're in SL2. That we know what B inverse is. It's the scalar matrix trace of B minus B itself. So if you just multiply by A on the left, You get a matrix version of the lamp. AB inverse and AB are related by a specific multiple of A. So taking the trace gives the last. The lemma implies Brick's trace identity by starting from the trace of the computator and just doing it three times. So you think of B A inverse B inverse as the second matrix. So that'll be equal to the trace of the product, or sorry, the product of the traces. Minus the trace of what you get by changing this other factor to its inverse. So trace of A. Now it is BA, the inverse, using the letter one time. This other trace is now the same as the trace of A itself, because A is an SLT. So this lemma itself also has special cases. So you can take A equal to B, or you can just take A equal to 1. If you take, yeah, if you take A equal to 1, If you take A equal to 1, the trace of B and the trace of B inverse have to add up to the trace of, yeah. A have to be half the total. So here I know that B squared minus trace B plus I is zero. Did I make a mistake? It's trace of B times B. First of B times B. First line, we love this for you. Ah, yeah, good point. Oh, I'm going to deploy the full force of Hikomoto Chalk with my own mistakes. Yeah, so then Did I get it? Yeah, so as a special case, we know the trace of B and the trace of B inverse are the same. Welcome to SL2. This is the trace of A. That's going to give you trace A squared in Frica's identity. Here, we can now use the lemma again. So we've got trace of a squared minus, so it'll be the product of the traces. The traces minus what you get by changing one of them to its inverse. Since the trace is cyclic, you're just getting the trace of b squared. The trace of b squared from that second term. Using another special case, we know how the trace of b squared is related to the square of the trace. So far we have trace of A squared, trace of B squared, a factor of two. A factor of two. One more application of the lemma is going to give you the product of all three traces. So trace of V squared plus trace of so we now have an odd number of minus signs still minus two. Using the lemma one final time completely proof. So, you've got the sum of squares of all three traces minus two. Minus two minus the product. You put on the other side and you get the identity as stated. So I'm guessing most of you have seen this before, and I also got the impression most of you didn't want to see it again. And And I think that's kind of the moral of this proof. It's a calculation. It's a relatively short calculation. It gives the results. It's sort of hard to say where it comes from. You just prove a lemma and you use it three times, and that's how Frick's trace identity is done. So I'll tell you another proof, which is an even longer calculation, but maybe gives you a bit more of a gap feeling. Any questions before we try to do that? So, for another proof, the key point is that for AB and SL2. In SL2, you can multiply on either side of another matrix, and the determinant state is the same. So any E by 2 matrix M. And the special thing about SL2 here is that a 2 by 2 determinant is a quadratic form in the N trees. Yeah, maybe something in here? Yeah. That's aimed trace. So because A and B have determinate one, that of A at B is just dead A, dead M, that B. It's been a long day. It's been a long day. Yeah, so you can think of AB and SL2 as like an orthogonal transformation of this quadratic form. So for AB and SL2, you get some U of AB in the orthogonal group of the quadratic form TS. Ps minus QR. And to keep the action on the left, I'm going to write this U is actually A times M times B minus transpose. This way, even though the B is on the right, there'll be a left atom. It would be a left action of SLT times SLT. So we have a 2 to 1 math from SL2 times SL2 orthogonal group of determinant. The ambiguity. The ambiguity here is that minus a minus b acts the same as a b. You have a sign on both, it'll cancel out. But other than that, you can explicitly write down how this acts, and the four by four. And with a 4x4 orthogonal matrix, you can recover the two matrices A and B up to a single sign. So this is called a spin double cover. It's a two to one map. It's been an orthogonal group. At first I thought maybe you were asking about the D minus transpose, the extra inverse. So another proof of Ricke's identity is to compute the characteristic polynomial of u in two different ways. You are probably a few of E in two ways. So, my first claim is this is now four minutes. So this is now a 4 by 4 determinant. Say xi minus u. I claim the characteristic polynomial of u corresponding to the given a b is x to the 4 minus the product of traces plus the sum of squares. The sum of squares minus two. And then that's a palindrome. So that's sort of a general fact about orthogonal transformations. I could have told you in advance that it was going to be a palindrome, but anyway, the top part is product of part is product of traces for x cubed, trace a squared plus trace b squared minus 2 for x squared. So that's claim one. Claim two is that the coefficient of x squared is also the other side of Frick's trace identity. So it's the commutator trace plus, without the plus two, because I've already got the two on the other side. But plus the product of all three of them. minus the square of the trace of the product because I don't have that on the other side. So that's the outline of the other proof. You compute the characteristic polynomial in two ways. An interesting feature of this is that the two sides have different symmetry. Have different symmetries so here we can conjugate and b separately Trace of A is conjugation invariant, the trace of B is conjugation invariant, and you can conjugate by different things. Whereas on the other side, commutator trace and the trace of the product will only be invariant if you take the same matrix for both. So one side of Fricka's identity looks more symmetric than the other, but actually they kind of cancel out and they turn out to be equal to each other. So the proof of claim one is Is pretty direct. You just write out a 4x4 determinant and you get it. Claim two is where you have to do a long calculation, which is not really an improvement over the textbook proof. But where it comes from is a bunch of relations defining sort of a variety in here. So you choose coordinates, so a matrix PQRS. matrix PQRS corresponds to a column vector, PQRS. Then the matrix U is given by, if you take A equal to small A, B C D, it has a block form where it's just It's basically four copies of B just multiplied by the four entries of A. So you have lots and lots of quadratic relations where a given entry like, I don't know, U11 or whatever could be written as like A times an entry of B. But then if you multiply, yeah, so you'll have lots of relations like U. Ij times UKL is equal to UI prime, J prime, UI, K prime, L prime, for some other pairs where you can choose different combinations of the rows and columns. So those relations are how you can prove quite two. You start from the commutator and repeatedly apply them. Sort of like in the usual Sort of like in the usual proof, but I don't think it's quite line by line the same. Yeah. So you know this is the characteristic trinomial of this linear map, and so you know at least that it factorizes because you know for instance that if trace of A equals trace of B then they're actually conjugating you just know that if A equals B they're actually equals B, the action is triggered, but that it does not have to affect the yeah I don't think so. But that's a good comment. Because what you know is that this middle coefficient here is going to be the sum of product pairs of roots and you've got four roots, so you've got three double products and you have an interpretation of these in terms of these roots. Yeah, there are some of these relations are sort of Yeah, some of these relations are sort of a bit cleaner if you write out the roots of the characteristic polynomial. So I'll stop here and just tell you that this is sort of an exceptional thing. So spin groups are a thing in general, like for any orthogonal group. And there's a finite number of cases where something like this happens, where you can identify the spin group with a different group. The biggest one is the SL4. That SL4 covers a sixth variable or thought concrete. So maybe the classic one is like the quaternions are the double cover of the three of the rotation group, like orthogonal group and three variables. If you change the signature, you can use SL2 instead of SU2. So SL2 sits inside of the product. That's the diagonal. This is where G1 equals G2, so to speak, before. So the special cases I mentioned of Frick's identity, where you take A equal to B, or both of them equal to our rotation, those come from the bottom. Those are the lowest of the exceptional spit groups. And then there are some more complicated identities coming from the next two that I still don't really. The next two, that I still don't really have a good way of writing down. But if you're good at linear algebra, you can probably work them out. Basically, if you take a field K, the six variables are wedge 2 of K4. The quadratic form is just a 4x4 determinant. If you have 4 columns, If you have four columns, you can think of that as a pairing between two wedges. That's a quadratic form, and SL4 preserves the determinants. You get a map from SL4 to O6. And I think you could set it up in such a way that they all sit inside each other. Then Frickin's trace identity would be like one factor of a moment. One factor of a more complicated identity. So I can't say it's an easier proof, but I think I do have a better idea now of how it fits in with other things. Thank you. So so SL two plus SL two, that is just going to be four. So four, I guess. So yeah. Okay. So uh So, I guess the character variety that we've been talking about, right, is the potion of SL2 cross SL2 by diagonal action of SL2. Markov surface sits inside there. That means that you can take the diagonal, have a potion at O4 by the diagonal action of SL2, whatever that means, and then the Markov surface as a sub-potion at O4. Yeah, my hope is that there's another interesting variety which is Variety, which is character variety for sp4 mod out by conjugacy by the product, like sort of each one mod out by the previous. The other thing is that you can sort of change basis so that the two by two determinant becomes a different quadratic form in four variables. So, if you're interested in the Descartes form or other forms, you could set up some maps there, but it's always kind of There, but it's always kind of up to an arbitrary change of basis. Basically, to a more dot triple, you would associate some orthogonal matrix, the four by four orthogonal matrix of two. Yeah, so first you would have like the triple x, y, z. You have to lift that to a pair of matrices to trace it or the triple, and then the pair of matrices would go orthogonal transformation of four variables. So, up to conjugacy, you could sort of lift triples. Oh, again, it's kind of silly, orthogonal. Triple silly or plugged all transformations. But the thing is, you don't really know which level you're on. Like you have to fix the computator in order to know what you're getting. So you said that there are some identities, but they're hard to tease out what form they have, or is there some flavor of what the identity is? What the identity? Yeah, the identities are not hard to write down. It's more how you use them to get Frick's trace identity that's messy. The identities, so if you go to the top level here, they're just the poker identities, like the ones that you would use to map, like 1 to K4, and 2 projective space. Those are like three-term identities, which simplify because. Which simplify because two of the terms are zero. So in the original thing I wrote we've got like u equal to a times the a prime. We've got the same nature. You've got the same matrix with primes, just multiplied by different ABCDs. So for example, like u11 is AA prime, I don't know, what's your other favorite entry? Uij. Like U34 or whatever would be is dB prime. So if you take U11 times U34, it's AA prime times EB prime, but you could group it differently, like with the A with the B prime and the A prime with the D, so that would also be A times B prime is E12. you want to A prime times D would be B. So those are the relations. If you apply enough of them, you can show that the coefficient of x squared is what I claimed and claimed to. And at the top level, instead of just one product equal to another product, you have like a sum of two. Product, you have like a sum of three products equal to zero, and those occur relationships. The fact that if you look at the indices, they all add up on both sides, will that always occur? I don't think so. That just happened that the numbers that you chose here worked out that well. Yeah, although I think there is probably a nice, I don't know, like finite geometry that would describe all the relations in a systematic way. Systematic way. I mean, so yeah, the matrix is 4 by 4. You've got 16 entries, but it's only a six-dimensional lithogen. So there are 10 relations, and they're all of this form, but I haven't really found a clean way to write the indices that show up. Any other questions? Any other questions? I have a question. Have you seen this proof before? Can I erase? So I haven't seen that proof, but maybe you may want to look at there's a bit of Magnus on trace identities for matrices in SVL2. Another thing which is a bit related is forbidden use identity. For pen you use identity, where you look at a bunch of matrices in GL2 and you look at their action and then you follow identities which come from representation theory by looking at actions on the set of products and sum of certain geometric products or traces of products of these matrices. And maybe that's also another way of thinking that, but it seems like you're looking at Yeah, I I think it's like a finitely many cases type of thing. The symplectic identity, there is something you can write down. So just like in SL2, the trace of the square and the trace of the square of the trace are related. There's a symplectic version of that that works for any size, SB2N. But I don't think that's the one that factors into. The one that factors into Frica's trace size can be. I have not seen this before, but in climb, after they in the discussion of the PP identity, they mentioned that it has a shape similar to Vonstau formula for the array of spherical triangles. And this might be. This might be related to your proof. Yeah, I think this is also, as in your talk, x is twice the cosh of length. I mean, the area of the hyperorder triangle she was looking at is exactly the trace of the product of the three symmetries. And if you square that plus two, you get the commutator. No, no, no, the one with the one of the three of the four languages. Don't forget about the lightning session.
