So let me start with this motivation. So we have limitations like you know when, you know, timing and where, you know, the context genetic variants had the strongest effect. And we know, for example, that many human diseases are age-related and so many genetic associations are also age-dependent. The other aspect is that there are gene-by-environment interactions. We know from more organisms that they have to be. Organisms that they have to be very common, but they are difficult to identify in human studies. And so, all these kind of underlying kind of context dependencies and interactions, they lead to heterogeneity of genetic effects across different parts of the phenobike distribution. And so, quanta regression model allows us to basically identify these genetic variants that have Genetic variants that have heterogeneous effects across different parts of the distribution of political contacts. So, you know, one approach that's commonly used to identify variants that might be involved in bioenvironment interactions is these variants Fukiel. Is this variance QQL type of method? And so the idea is basically that, so this you have this example here where you have this variance QTL. If you look at the mean effect, there is no effect of this QTL on the mean trait value. But then when you look at, you know, there is an effect on the variance, and what happens is that there is And what happens is that there is underlying you have three different environments, the red, blue, and green, and the effect differs depending on the environment. And so you can detect this type of effect using a variance-based method, but not using some kind of the mean-based regression and using GWAS. And so, quanta regression. And so one direction is trying to basically go beyond these variance facts and kind of is a generalization of these variance-based tests. So I'm going to talk about two parts. One is about using quanta regression for genetic discoveries. The second part is about phenotype prediction. Right, so in GUAS, we pretty much We pretty much use this simple mean-based model. So we model the conditional mean of y, given the genotypes and covariates. And if there is no effect on the mean, this is taken to imply that there is no effect whatsoever of this genetic variant on the trait. And so I just mentioned this, you know, alternative variance-based tests where you can detect effects. Where you can detect effects on phenotypic variants. And so these tests are commonly used to follow up gene by environmental production studies. So polygression is a type of methodology that was introduced in the polymetromy many years ago. And it basically extends linear regression by looking at associations at different functions, right? So instead of testing Quantile levels, right? So instead of testing for association with the conditional mean of y, we test for association with different quantities on. So these are kind of some examples of distributional differences you could have between genotype groups. And so the first column corresponds to this location shift model. So if you have two genotype groups, So, if you have two genotype groups, there is a difference in means here. If you look at the quantile effects, if you look at the quantile-specific effect, it doesn't vary across quantums. So, this is where the linear regression mean-based model is optimal. The second column corresponds to a scale shift model, so you have a difference between the groups. One means the variance, nothing the means. Only the variance, not the means. And you can see that the quantile treatment, like the quantile-specific effect for the variant, varies across quantile levels. And in particular, right here in the mean or median, it's zero, so we cannot detect this type of detect with a linear dash approach. And then the third one is location and scale shift to have differences between the two groups. They have differences between the two groups, both in mean and variance. And then you can see again that there is heterogeneity across quantum factors. And you know, bottom line is that quantum regression will be more powerful than linear regression in this kind of areas where you have a good thing, exactly cross-quantal doubles. Right, so this is a you know. Right, so this is a kind of a basic introduction to the quanta regression. So, as I mentioned, you model now the conditional quantum of y given genotype and covariates as a linear function of human schemotypes and covariates. And what changes now is that these coefficients are um dependent on the quantile level tau, okay? They can vary across quantals. Vary across quartas. And you can estimate these coefficients by minimizing this loss function, which in quanta regression is basically called an in-ball loss function. It has this form. And you can write this optimization problem as a linear program and use methods like interior point methods to solve it. So, this is sort of more explicitly what that optimization program looks like. For example, when you look at median regression, so when L is 0.5, you're trying to minimize this expected absolute deviation criterion. And then, you know, for any quantile level tau, you have a weighted combination of this, you minimize this weighted combination. This you minimize this weighted combination of absolute deletions. So just for estimation, you can do hypothesis testing and one possible test is this quantile rank score test. You can test at any fixed quantile level tau, you can test as a beta tau is equal to zero. And then the good And then the good thing about this test is actually that it's distribution free in the sense that the asymptotic distribution of the test is the current particle distribution of the phenotype. So you know you don't need to actually transform your phenotype and worry about what the effect of that transformation has on type 1 error at all. So if you analyze quantitative traits and biomarkers Markers very useful feature. And it's also a rank score test, it's very fast. So this testing is done at different quantile levels. So now we're going to consider a grid of quantile levels between 0 and 1. And then we can combine those in different ways. So what we did with Cauchy computation method to combine. Computation method to combine that. So there's, you know, the main, I don't know how many of you actually are familiar with quantum regression, but the main challenge is applying this type of techniques to bug and scale data is that they are very computational intensive. So what we've been working So what we've been working on is basically techniques to make them applicable to large-scale studies and also when you have correlated individuals, like related individuals. And postdoc of mine is here, Fan Wang. So we should talk about this part tomorrow. How to what the regression is related to the segments. So this is an application to UK. Application to UK Biobank, so we looked at the number of continuous traits. So, what's shown here is to each of these parts corresponds to one trait. So, we have the green part is the common loss size that are discovered by both linear anti-regression, because there is a large overdape. Blue part is what is Blue part is what is discovered just by linear regression, but means by quantum regression. And then the red part is what is what is discovered only by quantum regression. So you can see that in this, you know, in the equivalent I've got this trait, but linear regression isn't it more powerful? But um yeah. So maybe you know you came back because market is most of the third genius, I guess I said out there, but um Out there. So you can then, as I said, you can, one thing you can do, like one of the reasons for this underlying heterogeneity BC is maybe due to interactions that we don't model, for example, gene-by-environment interaction. So we actually did some small follow-up gene-by-environment testing of those variants that we identify in quanta regression using a small number. Aggression using a small number of environmental terms like sex, age, physical activity, data behavior, and smoking. And we identify a number of significant interactions, especially with sex and age. So let me just show a little a more specific example of this interaction. So this is an interaction between an age and genotype. Between age and genotype for this plate called platelet distribution waste. So, this same variant was detected to have a dominant effect in paper from Beniel's group where they did some scans for dominant effects in UK bio band. Right, so this is um start the result on the left. Sell the results on the left. We have the results of this slope was for quanta regression and linear regressions. We can see on the top strong signal for quanta regression, which is missed by linear regression. When you look on the right, what happens, so this is on the right is basically an estimated effect across different quantiles. And you can see there is substantial hydrogen. Substantial heterogeneity, and in particular, here in the middle, and kind of it's a median, there is basically no effect of the variant on the phenomenon. So that's the reason we miss it using linear regression. So that's an example where quanta regression actually detects something new beyond linear regression. New beyond linear regression. But as I said, there is a lot of overlap with linear regression, so you can actually, even for those associations that are identified by linear regression, as of this example, both ECSK9 and LDL, we can still look at the heterogeneity of the factor post-mantal, and we can see by the group for this variant that there is a productive effect and the productive effect is more pronounced as you go towards. Go towards the upper one house. So where when the LTL means kind of in the higher one paths. So that's kind of the first part about genetic discovery. The second part is on polygenic risk for prediction. So I want to kind of mention what briefly what counteraggression can contribute to. Counteraggression can contribute to this prediction problem. So, in PRS, in usual PRS analysis, we aim to predict the conditional mean of y given gene. So, in other words, we want to write to basically, given a particular genotype profile gene, we want to predict what is a typical outcome for an individual with that genotype profile. And so, what quantages allows. And so what quant regression allows you to do is basically allows you to generalize this prediction to the entire distribution. So now for any quantile level, now I can predict the close quantile of y given G. So I can predict basically the entire quantite distribution. And so, you know, the PRS, in the PRS construction, right, you have this, you know, linear predictor tunnel. linear predictor, tungsten predictor of the trait. And we can do something similar. At each one of the tau we can basically have this similar linear predictor. And so what this allows us basically is to estimate prediction intervals, right? So we can look at low quantity levels, say 0.205 into high quantile level. One and that one. And then have an interval. And so the idea is that you know right, so I think this is kind of related to some work that was mentioned yesterday, I think, from Botan Pas and his group, where they looked at uncertainty quantification for TRS. And so, you know. So, you know, right, so the whole goal of this is basically we want to identify individuals that are in a high risk group. And so instead of just basing it on the point estimate, we want to take a separate content. Um so uh quanta regression is actually quite well um i i i i it can can naturally basically produce this prediction in process. Right, so that study from Ding and Dog, they showed that once you take assertions into account, very few individuals are actually in the high-risk group. And so I think one reason for that result, which I think is conservative, is that the type of confidence interval or prediction intervals that you get from these conventional methods, they tend to be symmetric and they also tend to be of similar lengths across individuals. So you know it's a six examples for BMI actually. Is that the approach did the approach. So I'll talk about these different category risk categories, but there is a category called certain above team, like kind of, you know, the high certain high risk individuals. And this sort of conventional method didn't assign any individuals to the high-risk group. So let me just explain what that risk ratification is, right? So we have this So we have this prediction of the phenotypes at different quantals, tau1 to tau l. And let's say we have a high-risk threshold team. So we're going to divide individuals into first two groups, high-risk and low-risk. And within each group, we're going to further assign them to like certain above t, which means that all predictive phonographic quantiles are above t. Uncertain above t means that the median is above t, but not all. Is above T, but not all quantiles are above T, and the same for the low-risk group. So you have a certain below T, where all predicted phenotypic quantiles are below T, and then uncertain below T, the median is below T, but not all quantiles are below T. This is an example of that. So these are four separate individuals. So for each individual, I basically get these predictions. You know, predictions of the phenotypes and different quantas. And so the first individual is in this certain above p group because all the quantas are above this, the high-risk threshold. The second individual, if you look at the median, the median is above the high-risk threshold, but then you have some patterns that are below. And then this is for the low-risk group, so you have similar Similar partition, right? So you have this individual is certainly below t, because all quantals, but if the quantals are below t. And for this guy, you don't know the median is below t, but then some of the quantals are a lot high with threshold. And so if you use this prediction interval from quanta regression and you obtain this Or doing this partition of individuals into the four risk groups, what we see is that we can, first of all, compared with a conventional approach based on linear regression, we can identify a meaningful number of individuals in this high-risk group. The other thing that you can see is that those intervals in the top, they are actually metric. Yeah, they're asymmetric and they are of varying lengths. So even for individuals that have similar PRS at the median, like or the mid-based PRS the same, their intervals can be quite different. And we can discuss why that happens. And so when we look at kind of like numerical results, Like numerical results, you know, based on assigning individuals in these high-risk groups or low-risk group. So, this is for our method based on the quanta-regression prediction in her balance. This is for the linear regression approach. You can see that, you know, if you just look at the first row there, that we still like, you know, there is a lot of uncertainty, only like a small number of percentage of the individual pass that high-risk threshold. that high risk threshold, like you know, being assigned to this certain above t, but you know, it's better than than the linear regression-based approach. Similarly, for the certain below t, we assign a much higher proportion of individuals in that category compared with the conventional approach. So this is sort of across 55 traits. Yeah, so it's kind of the percentage of individuals that are assigned to the different risk groups. So you can see that kind of in the middle there is a lot of uncertainty rates. So a large proportion of individuals cannot be assigned to these are certain below t or certain about t like the please dream. But can we cover more individuals in these extreme categories than Extreme categories by having this prediction interval as comparison. And then you can do, I mean you can kind of make this restratification even more general. So you can what you can do is basically you can compute these um tail probabilities, right? What is probability that the values about a certain structure, because we have the whole distribution, right? Because it has the full distribution, right? So, depending on the study, you can prioritize the cost-benefit of the particular study you're interested in. You can basically have these parameters, T and epsilon, as tuning parameters, and identify individuals you want to kind of prioritize for interventions based on. Based on these properties. So, just to conclude, so quantum regression can be used both for genetic discovery and phenotype prediction. It can be a very useful tool for biomarker data and molecular phenotype data. And I think it can provide more realistic prediction info since we can. Realistic prediction intervals so you can help with prioritization that you can go into
