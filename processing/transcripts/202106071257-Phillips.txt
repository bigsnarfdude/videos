This evening here in the UK is joint work with a number of colleagues in Mexico, Aldo Gomez-Lopez, Juan Nescandon, Ruben Mil Martinez and René Vargas. Both Aldo and René have spent extended research visits at Cardiff. Okay, so a quick overview of the talk. So it's fairly standard knowledge that dynamic oscillatory shear experiments can be used to characterize the linear and non-linear properties of complex fluids in either the small amplitude or the large amplitude settings. And if we look at And if we look at the nonlinear regime, then there we can find important information about the underlying microstructure of the material. And the way that this is explored is by looking at the Lissajou or Lissajou-Balditch curves to evaluate the qualitative nature of those curves. Of those Kurds. And here I refer to a number of works on the subject: Delian Wisprun, and then two papers by Hume and co-workers. The last paper is a very good review paper on this subject. So what I want to do in this talk is to look at these curves for a Feeney transient network model. And this network model was... And this network model was one proposed by Rincon and co-workers in 2005. One of the co-authors on that paper was the previous speaker in this session, Octavio Minero. I want to look at the influence of some of the parameters in that model on the Lissidu curves. So the outline of the talk then is first of all to describe kinetic theory models. To describe a kinetic theory model, then to look at the transient network dynamics very briefly by referring to that metal model by Rincon and co-workers, then to look at microstate kinetics, then to briefly introduce a sensory shear flow, which requires very little introduction to this audience, some numerical results, and then a summary. Okay, so Okay, so if we start by looking at kinetic theory models, this is an alternative to the classical closed form constitutive approach. It's a more generally applicable approach. So there are many models that can't be written in a closed form constitutive equation. Simplest of these category models, of course, is the linear Dumbbell model with linear form. Model with a linear force law here described by f of q is equal to hq. And for this Hookian force law, there is an equivalent closed-form curzov equation, the order B model, and that is used to validate micro-macro simulations with simulations based on closed-formed curzov equations. Another model, the Feeney model, with force law of The Feeney model with force law, the non-linear force law described at the bottom here, doesn't have a closed formulative equation and so needs to be simulated using different techniques. Now the behavior of the Defeeny-Dumbbell model can be described by a Fokker-Planck equation. Fokker-Planck equations are typically quite expensive to solve. To solve. And so, what is done usually is to write down an equivalent stochastic partial differential equation, which is the one I've written here for the Feeney-Dumbbell model, and then to simulate that using the method of Brownian configuration fields, which was introduced and described by Martin Holson in the very first talk of this session. And the idea is to approximate. Approximates the stochastic PDE by a large ensemble of configuration fields, each of which evolves using an equation of this sort. And then this is coupled to the hydrodynamics by using the Cramer's expression to evaluate the polymer stress, which is then substituted into the momentum equation. Momentum equation. So, in a moment, I'll talk about a microstate description of a fluid, but essentially, each of the microstates will evolve according to an evolution equation of this type. And there will be individual force contributions corresponding to each microscope. To each microstate. Okay, so that was just giving a brief background to the method of Browning configuration fields as proposed by Martin Hulson in 1997. So the basic idea is that each Liprotian particle contains the same initial local ensemble of polymer molecules, and then the corresponding molecules in each particle is. Molecules in each particle is subjected to the same random force, and then those are combined to form a global configuration field. So, moving on then to the transient network dynamics, and I'm just going to describe very briefly the basic elements of Rimcon's model. So, we're going to use five microstates in a way to try and represent the complexity of interactions. Of interactions among macromolecules suspended in a Newtonian fluid. We're going to look at various degrees of network entanglement, including fully entangled and free chains. We're going to look at the coupling of the kinetic scheme with the evolution of the microstates. The microstates. And then we're going to look at the average concentration of microstates at given time to define a maximum segment length during the entanglement points in the transient network. And then we're going to use Lissa Dew plots to try and determine the behaviour of the fluid. Okay, so here is a So here is a pictorial representation of a transient network arrangement. So we've got a number of microstates here. There are five microstates and they're depicted in this cartoon at the bottom of this slide. So omega naught is the microstate with just one segment. Omega 1 has got Omega 1 has got one node, the two four segments intersected at one point and so forth. And we're going to look at an ensemble of these microstates. They're going to be subject to creation and destruction, and the The processes are described here on the left. And on the right, we've got the kinetic equations for the creation and destruction of the microstates. So, A and B are creation and destruction parameters. And we'll examine the influence on the On the list of curves on these parameters later on. So, alongside the micro-macro equations, we will need to solve these evolution equations that describe the microstate kinetics at each time step. Okay, so let's look at your solution. Look at the oscillatory shear flow. So, this is a description of either small or large oscillatory shear flow. So, we've got a given velocity field V, and principally in this talk, I'm going to be concentrating on the large amplitude oscillatory flow. So, you can see that at each material points, we have We have collection of the various microstates, and we are going to look at how these evolve at a given point in the flow configuration. Okay, so the characterization is done as follows. So we've got a prescribed shear rate, we determine the shear stress, WI and DEE are the dimensions. Wi and DE are the dimensionless Weissenberg and Deborah numbers d defined here. And in the large amplitude oscillatory shear regime, we have the ratio of, it's defined by the ratio of the Weissenberg number of the Kepper number being greater than or equal to one. So that's the regime that we will be interested in and exploring in some detail. In some detail. Okay, so this is just a pictorial representation of a typical Lissidu curve. So we've got the viscous description on the left. So we have the shear stress against strain. And elastic behaviour is described by a straight line, viscous behavior by a circle, and visco-elastic behavior by And viscolastic behavior by an elliptic type curve. And the purple curve there shows the evolution to a final oscillatory solution, which is elliptical in nature. And what is of interest is the departure from these prototype curves under different flow regimes. So, if we look at the dimensionless equations then for this oscillatory shear flow, the momentum equation, dimensionless momentum equation reduces to this equation. So we need to determine the polymeric stress in order to evolve a velocity field. To do that, we have We have a stochastic PDE for each of the microstates. So those are solved in conjunction with the momentum equation and the evolution equation for each of the microstates. At the end of each time step, then we can update the polymeric stress using the Cramer's expression at the bottom, and that is used then to And that is used then to evolve the velocity field forward in time. The method of Browning configuration fields is solved using a semi-implicit predictor corrector scheme. So that's described here. So we predict a value of the configuration sensor Q for each of the microstates. Q for each of the microstates, and then we update it using the corrector scheme, which is described in this second equation. And that is used then to evolve the system. So let me look and present some results. So we're going to look at some different initial microstate concentration conditions. Concentration conditions, three different scenarios. Firstly, when the initial microstate just includes disentanglement, so only free chains. So initially we only have the microstate omega zero. Then we have a fully entangled situation where we have only the microstate omega 4. All the others are initially set to be zero, but they evolve according. But they evolve according to the corresponding evolution equations. And then we have the initial concentration, which is termed aleatori, where all the microstates are present. Okay, so first of all, let's look at the effect of the Weissenberg numbers. And I'm just summarizing some of the outcomes here before showing. The outcomes here before showing some detailed plots. So, for some of these situations, secondary loops are obtained, and there is a weak dependence there on the Weisenberg number. The non-inresponse is increased with increasing the Weisenberg number, so there is a departure from the elliptical Lissitou curves, one obtains. Discidual curves one obtains in the small amplitude limits. And for some of the microstates, thick-tropic behavior is observed. So let's look at the evolution of the different microstates. Microstates for each of the initial scenarios. So we have entanglement, entanglement, and aleatory. And this plot shows how those microstates evolve in time for different values of the Weissenberg number. So if we take this entanglement, omega naught is one initially, all the others are zero, and you can All the others are zero, and you can see that they converge. And so the concentrations are almost identical at the end. And we see similar behaviour in all cases. What is interesting here is that as you get increasing values of Weisenberg numbers, things begin to get a bit more interesting. Things begin to get a bit more interesting, and there is highly oscillatory behaviour observed as time goes. So it looks as if things are converging, and then things are set off again. Okay, so if we look at the list two curves, then first of all, for the disentanglement case. So here we have Here we have increasing Weisenberg number going across the top and then looking at each of the microstates and the combination of all microstates then at the bottom. And you can see that certainly as you reach higher values of the Weisenberg number, you do get the appearance of the secondary loops, which is an indication of. Which is an indication of strong non-linear elastic behavior. If we look at the situation where you have initial entanglements, similar sort of behavior, the appearance of secondary loops is again present at higher Weisenberg numbers. Eisenberg numbers. And similarly, for the combination of initial microstates, the anatory situation. And here it's higher Weisenberg numbers. You get literature plots that are indicative of phixotropic behaviour. If now we look and turn attention to the effects of the kinetic Of the kinetic rate constants. Here we can see, we will show in a moment, that the secondary loops are strongly dependent on the kinetics. And they're mainly generated when the destruction is faster than the creation of the microstructures. So when A is less than B and a vacuum A is much less than B. So if we look at the So, if we look at the evolution of the various concentrations of the microstates as before, so looking at various values of creation and destruction of the microstates for the three different initial configurations of the microstates. So, what we can see here is that As you reach situation where B is much bigger than A, you get highly oscillatory motion in terms of the behaviour of the concentrations. When A is much bigger than B, then things they tend to settle down, but then there is To settle down, but then there is some interesting behavior that occurs later on in time. We haven't yet explored at these higher times. So then, if we look at the elyssitu plots for this scenario, looking at first of all the disentangled regime. regime. In this case, for the when you've got a B much bigger than A, so when you're looking at more destruction than creation, you get very large secondary loops appearing in the lissitude curves. Similar behavior is obtained in the case of initial Case of initial entanglement of the microstates and almost similar with some differences in the case where you've got a combination of different microstates initially. Okay, so let me just summarize the findings then. The findings then. So we've developed this micro-macro approach to study the large amplitude oscillatory shear using a Fini transient network model using the method of Brownian configuration fields for the micro scale part of the computation. We've begun to look at the effects of elasticity and kinetic rate constants for different initial entanglement scenarios. We've also explored the effect of viscosity ratio and amongst other things, I haven't presented that data in this presentation. So the self-intersection of the literature curves is shown to depend on these parameters and we've shown the range of parameter values that produce secondary loops. Secondary loops in the Isidou curves, which is indicative of strong elastic nonlinearity, and highlighted cases where there is behaviour that is indicative of exotropic behaviour. So the approach provides a tool to understand the behaviour between the microstructure and the macroscopic behaviour. Microscopic behavior of materials and hopefully to characterize them. And one of the things that I know that running in the group in Mexico want to do is to look at doing some quantitative comparisons with experiments. There are a number of experiments, of course, that have been performed and are available in the literature, but a quantitative analysis using this technique with that data. This technique with that data has not yet been performed. So, thank you. Thank you. Very impressive. I think we need to move on in time, but I hope, I know it's late for you, but I hope you'll stay for the discussion.
