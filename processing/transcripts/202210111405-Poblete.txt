On the long-time asymptotics of large data in the KP months. Thanks for the introduction. First, I want to say to the organizer, Agrecia Vilajila and Claudio for my participation in this event. For me, it's a pleasure to be here. The work that I will present is a That I will present is doing work with Jenny Mendes, Claudio Mu√±oz, and Juan Carlos Pozzo. I divided my presentation in three parts. In the first, I will give a brief introduction to KP models. And in the second, I established our main result and some comments about this proof. The result are result of type, the gate result. Of type decay result in central regions. And in the last section, we also give some decay results in far region. We consider the Gadam ZPGS Villi equation poses on R2 given by the following equation. Here, kappa is a number that can be 1 or minus 1, and the non-local term here is formally the Here is formally defined in here. The Cadom Sef PTLP's models were first introduced by Cadom Sef Peter Phil in 1917 for modeling long and weakly non-linear waves propagating essentially along the x direction but with a small dependency in the y variable. It's well known that our universal integral model and two dimensional here And two dimensional harization of the when no coordinate degrees K dB equation. For kappa equal to minus one, we have the KP1 model under a strong surface tension and for kappa equal to one, the KP2 model under a small surface tension. KP model are interesting in physics and fluids because this special solution KP2 has a line solid on like those Like those observing the suture, but Kp1 has lamps, a solar oxyliton, but with a heraldic decay in this partial variable. Here we have another picture of a multiline sonitone in the C for the model of KPG. In general, the non-local term makes KP model hard from the material. makes KP model hard from the mathematical point of view. But in some sense, KP2 is better understood than KP1. In terms of well-postnet, we have that KP2 is global well-postnet on L2 by the foundational work of UGAIN. And after 10 years, by the works of MollyNet Southern Spectcope, we have that KP1 is global well posted in the natural Global well posted in the natural energy space E1 here, where the energy, independent of the model, is given here. Another relevant work for us is the work of Kenny when it was proved that KP1 model is well posted, but globally well posted, but in the second energy space, which is given here. Space which is given here, and the energy is here. The second energy. Sorry. For us, the second energy space will be important by this time within some work. We need to need some estimation. As a general objective, we want to establish some portion of plane growing in time. Of plane growing in time, in where the L2 norm of solution in the regions decays in time. For us, the region that I will take are rectangular areas or rectangles. At least we need that our regions stay behind of the lamps and lie solid in the JP2 case. KP2 case. It's important to say that KP model has Galilean transform and then Lamps and Lyme soliton can be traveled in any direction in the plane. In this sense, we consider a family of rectangles omega 1 which depend on some parameters and some chips. For us are important to are important to limit points here chart chart values of R when R is equal to 3 and R is equal to 5 tiers. Here we have a representation of the omega 1 and here in the dashed line we can appear lumps or lysolids depending on the mod. Obviously the rectangle is inside of The rectangle is inside of the square TT. We have two important configurations, two charge configurations. In the left, we have the limit-highest rectangle where Rs is equal to 5t, and in the right, we have the limit-widest rectangle where R is equal to 3. We remember that. Remember that our parameters are strictly here and extreme are chartered. The rectangle can be shifted, but if we want to be near over here where glams and lines only can be present, we need to reduce the window. the window. In this sense, we can establish our mind result or field result this presentation and we can say the following. Every solution of the KP model from initial data O in L2 in the Kp2 case and U0 in the energy space E1 in the case of PP1, then then satisfies this limit if equal to zero. Here we have the L2 north over the region growing in time. Here we have the fierce observation is that here we have a sequential times in where this expression decays to zero. But obviously we can believe We can believe that the Limpsuk is also true, but from now it's an open question. Two important things. The first is that our result is independent of the size of the initial data. And the second point is that we believe that omega 1 is chart in the sense that if we can take a greater rectangle. Take a greater rectangle, possibility false. Maybe false. Why we believe that omega 1 is chart? The physics is in the KDB context in where the same techniques and using the same variables, we obtain a chart window that can be compared with the estimate given by Iphrinkovs and Tataru in a regiment of small data. In a regiment of small data solutions in the KDB, and we can see that to obtain a decade on L2 norm in this window, we need to establish a window inside of this interval. In simple words, the chart windows are the same. Another important point is that some geometrical aspects on KPE models, and here's the key are parabolas. In fact, if we take the domain of once in the center case and we make this change of variable given in the work of Sapp and Hayachi and Rankins, we obtain new rectangles. Rectangles. Here we have the WS configuration, chat WS configuration, in where appears these two points. These two points are part of this variable, x bar equals to minus 1 e bar squared. And by this word, we know that here we have a bad decide. In fact, in KP models, here, In KP models, here is the worst decay of solution in all regimen. But it's important to say that here the regimen is of a small solution. In the highest rectangle, we have other two points that are important. This point are limited by a shifted parable in time, and this parable. And this parable is related with light soliton. In fact, if we take the line soliton solution and fix the time, fix the velocity and move the parameter t, we can change the direction of the line solid. Then if we collect all the configuration of the straight line in black, we can see that a tangent parallel A tangent parable appears. Now we can see how the parables appear moving the direction of the line solid. This tangent parable is Parable is here, which is the same given in this picture. Well, now I give some relevant aspect behind the result. For this result, we choose this functional. This functional depends on a dimension and some scaling, and a number satisfies. Satisfies in this. And this functionality is inspiring in the work of Munoz and Ponce. But what first used in our work in the context of Sakar Umnesov, the idea is simple. We take a time derivative here and we obtain the following estimate in the right. In the right, we have here some terms, many terms, that all them are integrable, selecting careful the attenuature and the scale. And in the left here, we have the L2 norm localized in the rectangle, multiplying by this function. Then, Then, integrating in time, we can see that this term need to be a sequence in time in where a course are added because this time function is not integrable with time. Okay. We have a second result in the KP1 model to control other quantities, but we need to pay a price. And the price here is to we need more regularity in the initial data and we need to reduce the windows. Here we have a picture in where we can see how the windows are contained. Here we have the omega 1, here we have omega 1 tilde, and here we have omega 2 tilde. To tie this result, we use some functional here. Functional. Here we take this functional and the same idea, we take the reality type, and we get this estimate. In the right, we have a cubic term that can be controlled with the quadratic term throughout interpolation inequality. Here, again, we have the quadratic term, which The quadratic term, which is controlled by the values functional, and here we have again many terms that we are controlled in the sense that are integrable in time. Here it's important to mention that to control this part, we need to use that our solution is in the second energy space. In a similar direction, to Similar direction to here is important to say that the interacting time decays over this term. Now, this functional, again taking derivative in time, produces the following estimate, depending on some terms. Here we have On some terms, here we have in the right this term, which is controlled by the above functional, and again the good term, which is controlled by the quadratic term, and here again some many terms which are integrable in time. Then, combining the three estimates, selecting careful the scaling and the attribution, we can conclude all the limits presented before. Here the scaling represents the way that the height of the different configuration of the rectangle dependent on omega 1 here, omega 2 here, and omega 1 tilde here, and omega 2 tilde here. And to final two funnel, you see, To finalize, we consider five regions. Here, we for Kp1 and Kp2, we consider omega21 given by this expression. We know that this type of region are far from the square TT in where lamps can be appears. But in KP model, we can say more. We can consider this type of region that Region that can be near of here in where lines can be appeared. In this sense, we have our last result. It says that every solution of KP models from initial data in L2, in the KP2 case, and in the energy. in the NFT1 or the KFP1, then we have if U belongs here, then we have the lim equal to zero of this quantity. This quantity is the L2 norm of the mega Q1. And for Kp2, for beta sufficiently large, we have this limit equal to zero. Here again, equal to C. Here again the normal Q over the omega Q2. It's important to say that this limit can be seen as a complement version of the limit given by Kenya and Martel, but here is in a small regime of solution. Small recommend of function. Then we recall that both limits does not depend on the size of the initial data. Another important point is that this value vidva depends on sigma tree. And if we move the parameters, the half. The half planes produce a parable, the same parable that will show in the previous. And we can see that in KP2 the the central regions compared with the far regions are near. Then it's another reason that the That make a possibility that our result are charged. The only corporation is in this word and the case. Questions or comments? Can you use these estimates to prove some sort of asymptotic study? That is true, but we had a We had uh what's uh we that's really yes, we believe that this thing so somehow you mentioned that the your regions are very close to economic away from the cell tons, right? But uh uh but um But um only have for now only have some heuristic uh intuition. But uh we we want to advance in in a better technique and we believe that our technique is detecting a lysoniton but uh is related with the With the dynamics of the multi-pilots, the parallels can be perfect and we can obtain a vector of the in Kp in Kp1. In some simulation, we can see that this part inside a Um inside uh appears all the dynamics of the interaction of the house. But this is uh it's a worrying progress. Other questions? We can save them for a coffee break and then speakers again. So we start again at three o'clock.
