Our next speaker is Professor Weidru Bao from the National University of Singapore. He is going to share with us improved uniform error bounds on time splitting methods for long-time nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Dr. Wedru Bao, the floor is yours. Okay, thank you. Can you see my slides and hear me? Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So, well, so thanks, organizer, for inviting me. I'm sorry, I'm not in the mainstream of kinetic, but I'd like to show some research with some technical which can analysis numerical methods for problems for the long-term dynamics of some dispersal PDE. This is a joint always from B. With Yun Yung Tai from Beijing Normal and the Yue Feng, who is a current positive Seban University in France. Brief outline: I will show some what's a problem for the long time Schrodinger equation and the nine leader Schrodinger equation. So for this problem, many existing numerical methods. Here we are interested is how to develop some rigorous error bounds to see how the mass size and time step requirement in order to get a long time. You want to get a long-term dynamics. And we find for the long-term dynamics, if you wanted to do some, so because a uniform error bound, the only message in space is so-called special method. Any finite order special distribution method, there are always, there are some dependence on the small primary epsilon if you want to for the method. And you will see later. And for time, this kind of so has a some kind of splitting. kind of some kind of splitting method have very good property you will see by developing something we call regularity compensation oscillation we can develop some improved error bounds and this kind of technique can be extended to nonlinear shruding equation and also some other dispersal pd like a non-linear client-godder equation or non-linear wave equation so this is the shrding equation everyone knows it it is written by irvin It is written by Irvin Schr√∂dinger in 1922-25. The problems, the equation comes from, so that well, it's written by Schrodinger. Well, people can explain the equation by using the force quantization by, you know, by replace the Newton energy-momentum relation. So here, E is energy, P is momentum, M is mass of particle with given potential. So here, if you replace E by IH by dt and P by minus. t and the p by minus by minus i h by gradient you end up uh like an operator equation then the equation applied to a wave function psi you get a shredding equation so schroding is always linear so it describes the evolution over time of a physical system in which quantum effects so called the wave particle duality are significant in quantum mechanics so of course size wave functions which is complex so there are physical observed like So there are physics observed like a density of perfect density and rho, which is epsilon side square, and g is a current. Of course, if you introduce this one, so if side solution of the Schrodinger equation, you get the Carnegie equation dt rho plus diversions dh equals zero. And with this one, you get a mass conservation and energy conservation energy, including kinetic energy and potential energy. Okay, of course, we need to study this problem numerically. To study this problem numerically or mathematically, you need to do that the transition. So, if you introduce Ts is time units and Xs speed units, Psi S is units. And also you introduce Vs, which is the potential units, which is the potential energy quantity. So then you plug it in, you do some simple calculation and remove all tier. You end up with the following dimension is short. Following the dimension is shredding equation here, you have i epsilon dt psi equals this one and epsilon square over two la gradient la placen plus r from v equals this one. Or you mathematically people even remote one over two. You fixed always have one over two here. Mathematically people society always minus law epsilon la plus and you have wave function and the division wave function and the current again you know here we have two diverse parameters one Different parameters: one is epsilon, the other is alpha. So, you know, since you have the defines of Vs is equal Xs over Ts, which is a velocity unit, and Es is energy unit, which is M V S square. So, with this one, you have, we can say abstraction, which is H bar omega over E s. So, this is so some kind of, this is one different parameter. The other is alpha equal V s. is alpha equal vs over yes so alpha is basically it's got the ratio between potential energy and kinetic energy ds so with this one you can see so you can see this if you so they have this different relation if you set a psi equal a expression i k dot x over epsilon minus i omega t over epsilon and equal v is a constant you end up with different relation from this one you get the group velocity of v equal to greater the group velocity v equals greater than omega key which you are key because when key the the wave number goes to infinity the v is infinite so that's why schrodinger is called non-relative quantum mechanics since you know so since here the wave speed can be unbounded okay you know there are different scaling if you have if one is famous one is called atomic scaling which used the in the physical literature basically formulated h bar Formally, take a h bar equal m equal one. Formally, corresponding to you take a t s equal over epsilon and xx equal to square root of h bar over m only, which is corresponding to the typical length of harmonic oscillator. And in this case, epsilon equal one. Okay, in this scaling, you know, the wavelengths in space and time and wave speed are all order one. And here, there are two regimes. One is because if the v. Because if the Vs equals EX, so in some sense, the potential energy, the quantity, and the kinetic energy are same order. So in this case, alpha equals one. Of course, in this case, you consider the dynamics of the Schrodinger equation up to order one time, boundary time. So this is a model. But the other scenario is very important too. You application is Vs. The potential energy, for example, the maximum. For the maximum potential energy system is much, much less the kinetic energy. So, basically, the Vs is much, much less than Es. So, close to alpha is much less than one. So, just replace alpha by epsilon. But in this case, consider the time, the dynamics up to T sub epsilon, which is capital T over epsilon. So, in this scenario, it's a small potential. To the small potential, but one consider the long-term dynamics, of course, in this regime, if you consider otherwise dynamics, which were two things, trivia, trivial problem, almost like a free shortening dynamics. Here, people interested is consider long time, consider dynamics up to T less than equal to T epsilon, which is big O one over epsilon. Of course, the other scaling regime is semi-classical, which corresponds to so that if Which corresponds to so that if Vs, so the potential energy and the kinetic are the same order. However, the H bar omega, much less as Es. So somehow the potential, the oscillation of the potential, somehow much less than kinetic some less regime. So in this regime of epsilon, much less than one and after equal one. Again, in this case, they call semi-class scaling. And in this case, of course, interest is considered the initial. The interest is considered the initial data is in a WKB anzox. So, in this regime, we can say the wavelength in space time is order epsilon, with speed is order one, with WKB data. So, here we are more interested in for this shooting equation with small potential, but for the long-term dynamics. Okay, of course, this problem, so it's here like I dt psi equal minus la plus plus epsilon v psi. epsilon v sine here of course one consider the problem up to time t up to big o one over epsilon with integer say inter psi zero is other one of course if you do a change of variable you rescue in time that s equal epsilon t then you get a so this is i d s psi equal minus one over epsilon la plus this one for this problem you need to check the wavelength in time is other one the wavelength in space is other epsilon The wavelength in space is other epsilon, and the wave speed is also one over epsilon. So, here is a comparison of different scaling, the classical scaling, everything is other one. And this is semi-class scaling, the wavelength in space and time other epsilon, and the left, the speed and the left spans other ones. But this is for numerical. And the other is for small potential, of course, consider the wavelength is speed. Of course, consider the wavelength in space-time is order one, and the wisdom is other one, but you can want to consider long-term dynamics. And of course, the other is called oscillator shooting equation, is the last one. Here you can see the wavelength in space is other one, wavelengths in time is other epsilon, and with speed as a big O1 over epsilon, and the left spend other one. So, this two problems are equivalent. So, so the long-term dynamics with small potential. Dynamics with small potential is equivalent to highly oscillated Schrodinger equation. Okay, for this problem, of course, we know for Schrodinger equation, there are this famous Kronix difference scheme. Basically, your digital problem in space, basically, second order center difference in time is chronic time, basically trapezoidal. And here, of course, what consider is, you know, for the problem is consider for this times of the n must be equal. Hampshire n must be equal, could equal zero, let's equal t epsilon over tau, which equal capital T over epsilon times tau. In other words, here, you have to do numeric analysis. Your n times tau is not bounded. That is somehow at a big O, one over epsilon, which is much bigger than one with epsilon small. So this scheme has some property. So we can do some regress error estimate by energy method. So EKN is error function. So, E D N is the error function. You can see, of course, for other one dynamics. So, you can get the error function L2 norm discrete on the H1 semi-norm. It's less than equal to some kind of C of T n times H square plus tau square. And if you use a classical analysis, you will find that this C of T may grow exponentially. Well, and if you do long time dynamics. If you do long-time dynamics, if my t up to t epsilon, then the arrow bottom becomes, you know, the arrow like the c of t n times h square over epsilon plus tau square over epsilon. Because since here n is, n times tau is somehow equal to big O1 over epsilon. So you can see, so this is easy to observe by classical method. You can say your look transition error is bigger, basically is big OH square plus tau square. And you can discrete energy relation, you have Discrete energy relation: you have E n plus one, let's equal this one. Remember, that's uh C one epsilon tau in front of E n. So, if you use a ground equity, just remember here is n tau times epsilon, let's equal t, which is bounded. So, you got this one. So, with this one, you can see in order to see the arrow is up to long time, the arrow is bounded by given like a tolerance dirt. You need somehow you need like your H must be chosen bigger. H must be true that bigger O epsilon power one half and the tau you got bigger O one epsilon power one half so this is not optimal since you can see my wavelengths in space time are order one but in order to do long time by a very different method your methods H times time must be depends on epsilon so that the error is under control okay of course for this string type of data is called time speed method which is very Method, which shows very excellent performance in like a semi-class regime and other regime. The idea is that you're from time 10 to 10 plus one, you first solve a free shredding, then you solve the linear OD, linear OD, then you can evolve, you can combine them by strong splitting second order. And this is kind of scheme is kind of strength preserving property, like some good property. And the question is, how arrow bonds depend on absolutely. Arrow bonds depend on epsilon for a long time. Because here, you know, epsilon is small, but I want to study until the dynamics until time t is at one over epsilon time. Okay, so under proper assumption, the basic regular solution, we can prove that the L2 norm. So the L2 norm is less than C of T n times H to the power M plus tau square, M to the regularity. And H1 norm. And H1 norm is less equal to C2 dot T n H to power n minus 1 plus 1. Here we can show that for L2 norm, the C of T is cousin C of T grow linearly with this little t. However, the C2T grow exponentially with capital T. So this, because for this split method, for an L2 norm, which is a unitary flow, some that. So the key step. Some that. So, key steps is just do some decomposition. And so, for the L2 norm, since the method is a unitary flow for off-the-method, you can get some, you get the property. Then you can do by method induction. So, here, you have for L2 norm, you can only use a method induction to get this C of T, the constant, grow linear with T. For H1 norm, of course, you cannot, you know, to get this first result. For the younger to get this first result, you cannot use discrete growth in quantity. If you use that one, you cannot get this C of T grow linearly. And this is some for the class of methods to do it. But when we solve numerically, we find, you can see this is L to normal. You can see here, what part here, the x-axis T and the Y-axis for is the arrow, the L to normal. You can see for each different curve is let it call. I let the call decrease by linearly and then my capital M T grow so quadratically. And it can say almost constant. And the next one I show is H1 now. Simon, H1 now. You can see what I show here is local T and I want to again want epsilon, you know, epsilon decrease linearly and my T grow my T capital T that end time T so also So also grow linearly. But you see, in the arrow bound, right? So it shows somehow how is you know it's second order in tau. But I already want to show that you can see when epsilon becomes smaller, the arrow becomes smaller linearly too. So we want to we want to so this observe and also you can see this is special arrow you can see for a fixed this one for each curve is for different epsilon and the group the Epsilon and the group the and this is matched h they the exponential exponential convergence and the right is for different epsilon you can see if so this is epsilon for each curve is different h you can see for when epsilon decrease the h1 norm is somehow for for for epsilon is some constant okay and this so this is for space but for temporary arrow you can see But for temporary arrow, you can see here you can see left one is for each curve, it is a fixed epsilon. And so it's a linearly is a quadratic second order conversion for tau and the red curve. You can see the x-axis for epsilon. And each curve is for different tau. Again, you can see here, show my special temporal arrow, which when epsilon decrease, it also decreases linearly. Increase linearly. But if I error bound only show, I see my error bound, classical error message, the error bound only is tor square. So the numerous shows that it's roughly epsilon times toss square. So we want to understand whether this can be proved. So then we, by using this colour we call regularity compensation oscillation, we can show the under proper assumption, we can prove that so the error at H1. So the error at H1 now lets you go constant C times H1m plus epsilon tau square plus tau zero times MS1. Suppose the solution is Hm, where tau zero is some fixed constant and m is regularity. If the solution is smooth, that means if the solution psi is in like C infinity, then the last term, the last term can be removed. So basically, if solution removed so basically if solution is smooth then we can prove that the h1 norm lets you can see times h power m minus one plus epsilon tau square for up to long time and basically when epsilon is small after long time the arrow become also decreases linearly with epsilon so so the the the field key increase the following so that we define a e n equal in the integer so n equals i n the integer so i is the integration operator and p is the projection operator so so then we can we can decompose the arrow function e n plus one equal exponential i tau la plus e n plus q and x plus epsilon well and this e n plus one is defined by propagation by so the up to e zero plus the other two terms i don't want to bother you to and qn basically can be bounded by Can be bounded by this term and the only proved the E key here. And this one piece is the projection of the S tau the divergent method of the projection of the psi n minus the projection of Pn plus one. So some this term. And then you can express the log transaction arrow and Rn in terms into this way. And then the And then the case is to error the submission term. And to build the summary term, we introduce a regularity compensation. So basically, you use it for the projection to the look, like a smaller space with some fixed frequency. And above the frequency, basically above, so because one over tauzer frequency, you just recognize to find the solution. Frequency usually recognized to find the solution. Then, the other term you can use is so-called using so called we call the Twitter variable. Since you have seen the IT psi plus other psi, this equal basically equal epsilon v times psi, which is other epsilon. So, in other words, if we define phi is equal, like experiment I t Laplacian psi, then you basically can say dt phi is other epsilon. Using this one, then for the Using this one, for the low frequency part modes, you basically got the phase cancellation and any master. You can bound, so you can get an extra epsilon to the air band. So if you use the data, you can check, you can have read our recent paper this one. Okay. And this result can also extend to the long-term dynamics of the Naile nitrogen equation. So you consider this natural equation with this model as field. This is the model as far as i dg psi equals minus epsilon psi plus epsilon square epsilon side square psi. And here you consider up to t let's equal t epsilon, which is equal t zero fixed constant fixed time over epsilon square. So in other words, for this natural equation with the weak linearity, with so basically the epsilon is somehow is somehow the order of the amplitude of the sign in some sense. If you scale to a If you scale to a small initial data problem, so you can say it's up to big O epsilon power minus two. So again, here you can see if you let a phi equal epsilon sign, you have you get the principle can be reformed as a Schrodinger equation with other one linearity, but with other epsilon data. So you can see the weak linearity with other one in the data for long time, equivalent to other one linearity with Other one linearity with small inner data. Again, if you do a rescue that s equals epsilon square t, you end up with a highly oscillatory equation. You get ids psi equal minus one over epsilon square la plus psi plus psi square. Again, here you can see the other one linearity and other one data, but and consider up to other one time. But this problem you can see the wave speed is at big O one over. big O1 over epsilon square. So for this problem again, if you do file chronic chronic chronic difference scheme, again you do in space to send out a five difference in time chronic step with a proper treatment generality. So again here consider this time the time steps total time steps n is up to you know as n times tau is equal big O one of f square which is much much bigger than one. than one so you use any method you can see this one this error but alto norm plus h17 norm is equal let's equal c0 times h square over epsilon square plus tau square over epsilon square again for this case you can see for this problem the wavelength in space other one in time other one but of course you do long time the order to error is under control your message h and the times of tau must be taken order epsilon so that you can do long time dynamics otherwise So, that you can do long-term dynamics. Otherwise, for the long-term part, the numerical rest is completely rubbish. Okay, I told my time just quickly. So, again, for this product, I do time simpler. Again, first of all, free threading plus a non-linear problem. And you do in space to first method in time into second order strong simplety. And for this program, we can prove that if you do by classical NG method, you can prove that you get a unified bond for this problem. Let's use C0 times H power M 0 plus tau square. So M 0 divided by regularity and tau is up to this up to N let's equal so T 0 over F square times tau. So you can see for this splitting method in time and the free source battery in space, you get a uniform error bound. Again, if you use a double hour recently, this is a regularity. Our resistance is regularity compensation oscillation technique. We can prove that the arrow bond is basically C0 times H power m0 plus epsilon square tau square for long time. So we get epsilon square in front of tau square for the long time for this problem. Again, of course, similarly, if you do, the key is if you do the twist variable phi, you end up with dt phi, which is a big O epsilon squared. which is a big O epsilon square since since the DTV right which is corresponding to the non-dinner term which is small and if you do further splitting you get again C0 H power m0 plus epsilon square tau so epsilon square term this this term this factor is nothing to do which order you do split in time okay and some earlier results confirm this one and quickly And quickly, you can see again, you can see here is for templar. This is why you can refer to red table. Is you can see when my fixed my epsilon, for you, fixed tau, which converges linear quadratically in terms of epsilon. And the idea can be extended to long-term dynamics for the non-linear current God equation, which is dtt u minus double plus u plus u plus f square, f u square u. u can be real, can be complex. So if you do second order method. So, if you do second-order method for this problem, if you do classical energy methods, you get a second-order uniform. However, if you use our regularity compensation oscillation technique, again, you gain epsilon square tau square from this one. So, with this, this can be found in our recent paper in Sanium. And the method can also extend to Dirac equation with small electromagnetic potential. Again, you're getting something. And also can do weakly non-linear. weekly non-linear draw equation. So I think I stopped here. So the key message is for if you want to long-term dynamics in space, if you want to do uniform error bond, in space, only the special method can achieve the goal. Any fixed order difference of added method cannot gain uniform error bound. And in time, this positive method will method well do uniform if you if you use our this compensation so regular compensation oscillation you can you can you can gain some improve the error but basically for if we for weakly potential or weak nanoity small potential or weak nanolatility you come longer the arrow becomes smaller thank you Can I not hear you? Oh, sorry. Can you hear me all right now? Yes. Okay, great. So I think we have some questions from the audience in person. Hello, Aituis Bertram. Thank you for the nice talk. Can I just understand better? Can I just understand better? It's all in a periodic setting, I think, here. Yes. Yes. Yes. And I mean, for the analysis, probably would be difficult, but if you had bounded domains and want to introduce some boundary conditions, do you numerically, can you expect something similar? It would be very difficult to have these kinds of behavioral uniform error. This is an excellent question. About if you bounded domain with other participation, you'd basically. With other party conditions, you basically, if you need to get the so got for the linear problem, get the corresponding sort of basis. If you do that basis in space, you can still get a uniform in space. Okay. Yeah. Of course, for the whole speed problem, you need to truck in a bunch of domain. Of course, in this problem, it's too long time. The size of one domain must be larger too. But this is a different story. Story, yeah, more challenge, challenge, challenge, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Thank you. Thank you very much. Uh, do we have any other questions from the audience in person or from Zoom? I have a very quick question. So for this type of like time splitting method, is it easy or are there any connection to like adaptive time stepping? Adaptive time stepping in numerics, or can you do like several stages when you basically change the epsilon as time goes on if you're dealing with some kind of multi-scale scalings in time? Do you have any comments on that? Yeah. Yes, so you can see that's a huge question. Of course, if you want those time-step adaptivity, it's very easy to do since three methods is a one-step method. method. See, see, first step you do 0.1, next step is 0.01, doesn't matter because it's not a multi-step method. Because it always from seven to seven plus one, you can first order, second order, are all first like a one camera is a first order. It's a one step, single step method. So adaptivity is not the issue, but also how to give a criteria to choose which, how to adapt the time steps. What's the indicator? Energy or by arrow, which is maybe different. I see. Thank you very much. And thanks again for the nice talk. So in lifetime, I think we are going to have 30 minutes.
