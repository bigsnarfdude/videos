First of all, of course, thank you. Thanks to the organizers for the kind invitation to participate in this workshop. And thank you all for being here, including all of you who are joining us from Zoom. Thank you for being here. And so this talk is about some recent developments in the theory of Nash blow-ups over Nash blow-ups over fields of positive characteristic. It is a joint work with Chad Jeffries and Luis Muni-S-Bettenkurt. And so I'm going to start by recalling what the Nash blow-up is, the definition of the Nash blow-up. But first, let me just say that the Nash blow-up of an algebraic variety is a modification that was originally introduced by Nash as a method to solve singularities. To solve singularities. Nowadays, it has some other applications. But the original idea was to look for the resolution of singularities properties of this blow-up. And the talk is about these properties in the case of this particular family of varieties. In positive characteristic. Okay, so the definition. So, okay, in this talk, X will denote an F. X will denote an affine variety, okay, irreducible of dimension D. And we assume that the field is algebraically closed, okay, of arbitrary characteristic. Okay, now let us consider the Gauss map, okay, which sends which goes from the smooth part of X to some Gauss management. X to some Grasmanian dn okay and what it does is takes any non-singular point and is sent to the tangent space at this point okay this is well defined and we can take the graph of this map okay which lives in x times the grassmannian okay so here in the graph okay we have couples okay of the form a non-singular point The form a non-singular point and the tangent space. Okay, to recover the singular points, okay, we take Sarisky closure of this one. Okay, we denote this as n of x. We have a projection here to x, and the restriction of this projection is denoted as new. Okay, and the couple n of x with this new is Is the Nash blow up Nash blow up of X is the this is the definition okay so so what are we doing here okay we start with with the graph of this map okay consisting of couples a non-singular point and the tangent space okay by taking this closure operation in particular we are adding limits of these couples okay so in particular we are adding Okay, so in particular, we are adding limits of tangent spaces. Okay, so the geometric idea, okay, in this construction is starting with a singular point in the Nash blow-up, okay, this singular point will be separated into several points, okay, depending on all the possible limits of tangent spaces. Okay, this is the geometric idea. So by construction, we are modifying the singular locus. The singular locus of the variety. And so this is like a natural candidate for a resolution of singularities. Now, typically, if you apply once the Nash blow-up, you still have singularities. So the question that was proposed by Nash is whether a finite iteration of this process, yeah, n of x, etc. etc okay whether the finite iteration of this of this process uh solve the singularities solve the singularities of x it gives place to a resolution of singularities okay uh this question okay this question has been uh studied um mainly in the characteristic zero case okay for fields of of characteristic zero Of characteristics here. Here, a lot of people have proved a lot of partial results. And the first thing I'm going to do is to give a brief summary of the results in characteristic zero. Javier, yes. It is, it is. It is an isomorphism over the non-singular rocks. Okay? Yes, yes, yes. It has all the properties required for the Properties required for the resolution of singularities problem. Okay. So the story in characteristic zero. Okay, the story begins in the 70s. Okay, the first basic properties between 75 and 77 were proved by Nobile, including an affirmative answer to this question for curves. Then a little later, Bao Rebassu, in his PhD physics. In his PhD thesis, he studied the case of binomial surfaces in C3, a very specific family of varieties. Okay, then from 77 to 85, we have like the golden age of the theory of Nash blow-ups. In these years, some major figures of singularity theory studied this question. Actually, a variant of this question. So, Gonzales Springberg. So Gonzalez Springberg, Ironaka, and Spivakovsky consider the following variant. Instead of just taking the Nash blow-up, they also take the normalization of this Nash blow-up. Then again, Nash blow-up and normalize, etc. Okay, so the question is the same, whether these normalized Nash blow-up solve singularities. So for this question, first, Gonzalez Springberg studied the case of normal torix. Springberg studied the case of normal toric surfaces. A little later, he studied the so-called Duval singularities. And then there comes an important step in the case of surfaces. Ironaka proved that if you start with an arbitrary complex surface, by iterating this normalized Nash blow-up, the regional surface becomes something that they call a Something that they call a sandwich surface singularity. These are surfaces, singular surfaces that dominate non-singular surfaces. And then at this point, I think Ironaka thought that it was a good idea to propose this problem as a topic for a PhD thesis. And he asked Markus Pivakovsky to continue with this problem, to continue iterating Nash Blue Apps for Sunday. Uh, Nash blow-ups for sand-beach surface singularities. Okay, so after some years of hard work, uh, Spielkovsky was able to prove that indeed you have a resolution, okay, in the for surfaces, okay. So, and this is probably the strongest result so far in the theory of natural grammars, okay. In 85, okay, uh, Arvarello, Cornalva, Griffiths, and Harris studied genetic determinantal varieties, okay, for the original question, okay, this question. Original question, okay, this question. And actually, they proved that just by doing once the Nash Glow Up, you obtain a resolution. Okay. And then something happened. Okay. For a long period of time, people just lost interest in the question. And it wasn't until 2010 that suddenly a lot of people started working on this question again in the case of Tauric varieties. Okay, so we have a lot of people, including myself. I also have a small contribution to this. Also, have like a small contribution to this problem. And here, even though you see a lot of people here, some of them actually famous people in this area, we didn't succeed in giving a complete answer for the case of Tauric varieties, just some partial results. And I don't know, it seems that it is a difficult question. And finally, for example, Pedro Gonzalez Berta. Pedro, Gonzales Mberda Tessier, and myself, we worked with the local version of resolution of singularities, the local uniformization problem. Okay, so for example, what I did was to prove that you obtain local uniformization for toric surfaces along a dense set of valuations. And they did something similar. This group at Anasov, they did this. They give this computational approach to the problem. They put this problem in a computer and computed thousands of examples. And in every case, of course, they obtain a resolution. So these are the partial results. So finally, the last result that I'm aware of is due to Nancy Chachapoyan. She's a Brazilian mathematician. And in her thesis, she studied some determinantal variation. She studied some determinantal varieties. She's very vague, but there's also an affirmative answer in this case. So, this is the more or less the characteristic zero story. In positive characteristic, the story is much shorter. To the question of whether Nash blow-ups solve singularities, well, the answer is no. Augustin of Illin, 75. Augusto Novile, 75, he gave a counterexample to this question. Now, for the counterexample, we need the following result. The normalized Nerf Blab or the usual Nerf Blab? The usual Nerd Lab. Yeah. Yeah, because actually the example is a curve. Okay, so we need the following result, also prove the following basic property proved by Nobile. Okay, so suppose that Suppose that the ideal of x is generated by these polynomials, okay, f12fr, and denote as c the co-dimension of the variety. Then, after reordering these fi's, if necessary, we can assume that the Jacobian matrix of the first c polynomials has rank exactly c. And then denote as j the ideal generated by the maximum minors of this. Generated by the maximum and minors of this Jacobian matrix. It's non-zero because of the previous assumption. And then what Novile proved is that the Nash blow-up coincides with the blow-up of X along this idea. So this is some kind of a recipe to actually compute the Nash blow-up. Now, for example, in particular, if X is a complete intersection, If X is a complete intersection, if R equals C, then this ideal is just the Jacobian ideal. So with this in mind, now we can construct a very easy conterexample to the question. So the note as C, the cusp, okay, it's three minus y. Okay, it's three minus y two, and assume that the characteristic of the field is two. Okay, then the Nash blow-up, okay, according to this theorem, is the blow-up of the Jacobian ideal, okay, which is given by just partial derivatives, 3x squared minus 2y of c. But then we're in characteristic two, this one is zero, okay, so this is. This one is zero, okay? So this is just the blow up of x squared at C along this idea. But we know that to blow up a principal idea is an isomorphism. Okay, so this is terrible. You start with the simplest irreducible curve singularity, do this Nash Broba process of limits of tangent spaces, et cetera, and you obtain the exact same curve. And you obtain the exact same curve, okay? So, forget about solving singularities in general, okay? Using impositive characteristics, okay. Now, maybe the normalized one should work in higher dimensions, you know? We're going towards that situation, exactly. Yeah, so here we have a very bad behavior. Okay, you start, we have a singular variety, and the nash blow-up is exactly the same singular variety. Another classical and basic resulting. Classical and basic result in the theory of natural abs is due to nobile. And it states that this bad behavior cannot happen in characteristic zero. In characteristic zero, if it happens that the Nash blow-up is an isomorphism, it is because the variety was already non-singular. In other words, if you start with a singular variety, when you do the Nash blow-up, something changes. Neither the state Okay, neither the statement or the proof says if it changes for good or for bad, it's just not the same, it's the same variety. Okay, okay, now of course, this theorem is false in positive characteristic. Okay, this is singular and jet is an isomorphism. Well, in a recent paper with Luis, we proved that by adding normality, you have the good behavior. Okay, if you assume Okay, if you assume that, in addition, that the variety is normal, then if the Nash blow-up happens to be an isomorphism, it's because the variety was already non-singular. Okay, so now we can ask the question again, but we have to normalize. Even if you start with a normal variety, when you do the Nash blow-up, this is not preserved in general. So the question is now whether the iteration of normalized Nash blow-ups solves singularities. Solve singularities, okay? Exactly as Mosale Springberry, Ronaka, and Spirokovsky do, okay? But in this case, well, it's because of this example, okay? So now this is the question we're interested in. Okay, we are going to study this question for normatoric surfaces. And we're going to study this case because historically, in characteristic zero, this was the first case that was proved. So we were hoping to get something from the characteristic zero case and try to add. The characteristic zero case and try to adapt it to the positive characteristic case. Okay, so now in the previous file, the previous, previous, previous. Oh what is what is what, sorry? N of x is the natural one. Ah. Ah, sorry, yeah. Ah, okay, it was written here. Sorry, ah, okay, it was written here. X is embedded in K to the N, and D is the dimension. This is the dimension. This is the dimension. Okay? This is the dimension. Yeah, so it is the co-dimension. Okay? Okay. So here we are. Okay, now let's talk about toric varieties. Okay, let me just briefly recall what a toric variety is. And also, in order to introduce some notation. So, starting with a set of vectors, gamma one to gamma n in c to the d. Okay, we're going to define a variety using these vectors. Okay, and one of the possibilities, one of the ways to define a total variety is using this monomial morphism. Okay, we take the each variable, xi, is sent to the corresponding monomial defined by. monomial defined by gamma i okay x i go to this monomial okay using here multi-index notation and uh we denote as i gamma the kernel of this map okay so here we have encoded the uh the additive relations among the the gamma i's okay this is the the toric ideal associated to gamma and then the toric variety defined by by this gamma is just the zero By this gamma is just the zero locus of this ideal. Okay, and this is called a toric variety. Okay, the name toric comes from the fact that a variety constructed this way contains an algebraic torus as a dense open subset, and there is an action of this torus on the variety. So that explains the name. Okay, so now what is really nice about this kind of varieties is the fact that we can translate geometric. Okay, geometric problems, geometric questions on the variety to combinatorial questions or properties of gamma or the semi-group it generates or the cone it generates. So we have this very nice dictionary between geometric and combinatorial properties. So in the case of Nash Blow apps, we do have a combinatorial description. So I'm going to spend some time now explaining this. Now, explaining this construction, this convenatorial description for the Nash blow-up in characteristic zero. Okay. Okay. Nash blow-up of total varieties in characteristic zero. Again, we start with some set of vectors and we ask that the group generated by gamma is all of C to the D. This is not a restriction. This is just to be sure that the variety. Restriction: This is just to be sure that the variety has dimension d. Uh, okay, uh, so the main ingredient, okay, to describe combinatorially the Nash Global Fatoric variety is given by the following object. Okay, this is called the logarithmic Jacobian idea. Okay, so what is this? Okay, so we have a bunch of vectors, gamma i's. Okay, take any d of them which are linearly independent, take the sum. Independent. Take the sum of them and consider the corresponding monomial. Okay, so this is a monomial ideal generated by the sets of d vectors which are linearly independent. And taking the corresponding monomial. For example, this will be my running example for the rest of the talk. Gamma. Let me illustrate this idea with a simple example. Well, yeah, let me. Ah, well, yeah, let me do this. One, zero, one, one, two, three. Okay, in C flip two. C two. Okay, so here we are looking for couples, okay, D equals two. We're looking for couples of independent vector, linearly independent vectors. Okay, any two are linearly independent. Okay, so in this case, J0 is just this just, well, take the sum of any two. Just well take the sum of any two. Okay, so this plus this is t one to the two, t two to the one. I'll say that. Then this plus this gives t one to the three, t two to the three, and this plus this gives t one to the three, t two to the four. Okay, and that's it. Okay, it's a monomial idea given by some condition on these gammas. Okay, well, this one. Okay, well, this one is important because we have the following result. It was proved by Gonzalez Prinberg in 1977, then reproved by Monique Legion and Ana Regera in 2003, and then again reproved by Gonzales Tessier. But they proved this theorem for normal varieties. Pedro Gonzales and Bernard Tessier gave another proof without the assumption of normality. Without the assumption of normality. So they prove that the Nash blow-up coincides with the blow-up of this logarithmic Jacobian idea. Now, this result is the first step, the key result, to describe combinatorily the natural blow-up because it is monomial. And the general theory of tori parities gives a description of the blow-up of a monomial idea. And we have a recipe. A recipe, okay, very concrete ingredients, very concrete process to describe this blow-up. Okay, this is the next slide. Okay, so I'm about to get there. Okay, so okay, so again, I start with a bunch of vectors, okay, satisfying. A bunch of vectors, okay, satisfying this property. And I'm going to give you a long list of ingredients that we need to describe the Nash Blow App combinatorally. Okay, so here we go. I'm going to illustrate every ingredient with this example. I don't need this anymore. Okay, so first, these three vectors, let me draw them. So you have here one, one, zero, one, one, two, three. One, two, three. Okay, so the first ingredient is just take the cone generated by these three vectors. Okay, so just the linear combinations of all these three. Well, in this case, it's just all of this. This is sigma. Okay, this is sigma. Then consider the set of sums of d vectors which are linearly independent. Okay, so we already did this in this case. We already did this in this case. So this gamma zero is two, one, three, three, and three, four. In general, just do this for the choice of d vectors, linear independent vectors. Now, with these vectors, consider the following neutopolyhedron. Okay, for each of these sums, for each of these sums, add the cone and then take the convex. And then take the convex hole of all of all that. In this case, okay, I'm going to draw these points. Okay, so we have like two, one, three, three, and three, four. Okay, these are the three vectors. Add the cone. Okay, this is an infinite cone. Okay. And then take the smallest convex set containing all of this. Okay, so we have something like this. Something like this, okay? So, all of this is n zero of that. Okay, this is the next ingredient. Another one. So we have a convex set. Look for the vertices of this convex set. In this case, we only have this and this one. V1 and V2. And finally, looking at these vertices. These vertices consider the fun determined by the cones, okay, having as apex these vertices, okay, in the following way. So at each vertex, okay, let me explain it in this in this drawing, at each vertex, if you look locally, okay, just do a zoom around this vertex, you see a cone coming out of this vertex, okay? Take the dual cone, okay? So, for example, here, the dual cone of this one is something like Like, like this, and this. This is like the dual cone of the cone coming out of this vertex. And something similar for this one, you get another cone, sigma v2 dual. Okay, and they all together form a fun, okay, which is a collection of cones which have some compatibility properties, okay? And then, so we have a fun. So, we have a fan. General theory of toric varieties tell us that there is a toric variety corresponding to this fan. So, the result is the normalization of the blow-up of this idea is the toric variety associated to this fact. This one is just the previous, the previous result, okay? But we need to take the normalization, okay? And so, there you go. You have a recipe called Have a recipe, very concrete description of the Nash Blow App. So we can study now properties like non-singularity, etc. Okay, so specializing this construction in the case of in dimension two, Gerard Gonzalez-Springberg proved that by iterating this process, okay, so by continuing, you know, to take these gammas, this neutral polyhedral, etc., you can solve the similarities. Okay, he associates Singularities. He associates to each vertex some invariant, some combinatorial invariant, and he proves that this invariant decreases strictly at each iteration. Now, what about positive characteristic? So notice that all of this discussion, this theorem, this description, this other theorem, all of that started with the With this first result, the Nash blow-up is the blow-up of the logarithmic Jacobian idea. Okay, this was the first step, okay? But it's not true in positive characteristics, okay? So actually, the example is the same again, okay? So, for example, okay, so here, gamma in this case is the set of numbers two and three. The set of numbers two and three in n. Okay, here d equals one. What is the logarithmic Jacobian ideal in this case? Well, j0 here is, I'm looking for elements which are single elements which are linearly independent, both. Okay, so this is T2, T3. Okay, so in this case, sorry, the toric variety, the corresponding toric variety is this one. That's right. Okay. But then, if you take the blow-up of this one, okay, this is the this ideal is the maximal ideal corresponding to the origin. Okay, so when you blow up this ideal, what you obtain is a non-singular curve. So, this is non-singular. But we already saw here in this part of the board that Part of the board that the Nash of C is C in characteristic two. Okay, so these two cannot be isomorphic. Okay, so we need to change something in the definition of the logarithmic Jacobian ideal or do something else, do something different. Okay, so this is false. Now, in order to explain what was the modifications that we did, okay, for to have a this is For to have a this is an important step, okay. We need to blow up some monomial ideal if you want to remain in the toric world, so we need to adapt this logarithmic Jacobian ideal. But to tell you what we did, I need to explain the key step, okay, in the proof of this theorem where the characteristic is used, okay. If I answer now. If I answer now, it's like a spoiler for something that's coming later. No, it's not, it's not even normalizing, not even normalizing. Okay. So so, so, so. Okay. So, so, so, so. Okay. So, recall that we have this isomorphism of rings x1 to xn. Well, we first we define this map, k gamma1, t gamma n. Each xi is sent to the corresponding monomial, and then quotienting by the toric idea, this is actually an isomorphism, right? Isomorphism, right? And recall that this one, okay. Sorry for the notation. This one is generated by binomials. Okay, okay, no, here, sorry. This is generated by binomials. Okay, this is another classical feature of toric varieties: x beta one x alpha r minus x beta r. Okay, sorry for the notation. Okay, so now, just I wanted to recall this notation. And okay, so first, remember the first of Nobile's theorem. Okay, that theorem was something about some ideal, some maximal minors, the Jacobian matrix, etc. Okay, I'm going to use that theorem. Okay, so again, I denote as C, the co-dimension, and assume. Codimension and assume after reordering, if necessary, that the first C binomials, okay, the Jacobian of these binomials has rank exactly C. And now consider the following idea. This idea is important. So take the product of any D variables with these indices times the times the determinant of this matrix by choosing these indices okay such a way that these indices and these indices okay are disjoint and together they give you all numbers from one to n okay so again take the product of any d okay any d variables times some determinant okay that is determined by this That is determined by these indices. Okay, and then with these ingredients, now one or I1 in the index of alpha one. I one, this is I1, I1 ID. So any D variables, okay? Yeah. So there are several monomials here. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, the condition is this one. Okay. Okay, decompose this one in any possible ways with d elements here and complementary indices. Okay, now because of novile, we know that the Nash blow-up of X gamma coincides with the blow-up of the maximal minors maximal minors of Of that Jacobian matrix, okay X bar. Okay, so now, okay, because of nobility, this is nobility. Okay, now, so here I'm talking about minus determinants of this Jacobian matrix, of this very specific Jacobian matrix. And now, because these are binomials, we can actually compute the determinants, explicitly compute the determinants. Explicitly compute the determinants. They are monomials. Okay? These monomials are essentially these ones. Okay? So this is just a computation and very important. Up to this point, everything is free of characteristic. Okay. So, okay. So now that ideal, J0, it lives here, okay, in this ring. Under this isomorphism, this becomes the ideal. The idea, okay. Here we are multiplying the variables, okay. So here we take the sum of these vectors, but this monomial appears only if that determinant is non-zero, okay? The determinant of this alpha i minus beta one over some case, okay. Case okay, okay. This is just using this isomorphism and seeing what happens to this ideal. Again, no characteristic is used, but then notice that here we are mixing the original gamma i's and some condition on the relations of the gamma i's. Okay, the alpha i's and beta i's are the relations among the gammas. So I would like to have some ideal that depends only on the gammas, not on the relationship. Depends only on the gammas, not on the relations. Okay, and this is where the characteristic is used. Okay, this one equals t to the gamma i1 plus gamma i d such that the determinant of these gamma i's is non-zero. Okay? Because the authors, okay, they prove that this one is non-zero. That this one is non-zero if and only if this one is non-zero. Okay, and to prove this, well, they uh and this is where the characteristic is used, okay? So we're talking about vectors in C to the D determinants. So naturally, exterior powers of lattices appear. Okay, so they use these duality isomorphisms, okay, these natural pairings between some exterior power. Some exterior power and the complementary in the dual. Okay, so this is where you see the complementary this condition. Okay, and then using this language, they prove that one is zero if and only if the other one is zero. Okay, now of course this is false in positive characteristic. Okay, we already saw an example, but what happens here in the proof? Well, this number, okay, this ideal lives here. Okay, so this number. Okay, so this number is actually a coefficient, it's an element of the field in characteristic zero. This number in the field is the same number, but not in characteristic p. That number, when seen in the field, must be taken module p. And of course, it may happen that this number, modulo p, is zero without this one being zero. This didn't change. We didn't impose any condition here. Okay, so what do we do? Of course, the naive or the obvious answer would be: well, if you're taking this one module of p, also take this one module of p. But then you have to prove that this one is a multiple of an arbitrary prime number, if and only if this is also a multiple of the same prime number. And this is different, okay? The classical proof just shows this is non-zero, if and only if this is non-zero. This is non-zero if you're not leaf, this is non-zero. Okay, so we had to go deeper into the structure of these complementary determinants, and actually, somehow magically, the obvious idea worked. So we just added mod p everywhere, and we have all the corresponding results. So first, the logarithmic Jacobian idea. Again, some gammas with some Again, some gammas with some condition. And now I take the same idea. Okay. Take a bunch of d vectors, but now I ask for they to be linearly independent modulop. Okay, and we call this logarithmic Jacobian modulop. And well, we were able to prove that this is non-zero mod P, if and only if this is non-zero module P, and the rest of the proof was characteristic free, okay? The proof was characteristic-free. So, this is true, and this is great because we have a monomial idea. Okay, so using again, so I want to use again this description. Okay, so same ingredients, just take everything mod P. Okay, and then let me illustrate what can be different here. Okay, so this is like a characteristic zero, and let me do the characteristic three, okay. The characteristic three case just to illustrate what is different. Okay, so again, the cone is the same, okay. The first row, the cone is the same, that doesn't change. Then, gamma three is made of the sum of couples of vectors which are whose determinant is non-zero modulo of three. Okay, so these two, the determinant is one, so we have two one these two. This two determinant is three, so it's not invited. Okay, this two, the determinant, is one again, so we have three, four, okay, and this is the second step. Then again, we construct the Newton polyhedron two, okay? We have two, one, three, four, okay, the cone. The cone and then the convex hole. Again, look at the vertices and then take the corresponding fun. Okay? Okay. So now, because of the general construction of blowing. The general construction of blowing ups of monomial ideals using this description, we have that the normalization of this logarithmic Jacobian ideal is the toric variety associated to that function. Okay, and once again, like Gonzalez Springberg, by specializing this description for dimension two, we can also prove that by iterating this process, okay. Process, okay, we obtain a resolution of singularities. And now I'm going to conclude this talk by saying that the proof of the second theorem is already written on the greenboard. Can you see it? Again, please. Again, please? I'll have to change when you get the fix answers. Thank you. Thank you, Javier. Exactly. These two are the same. Okay? So we were able to prove that, of course, here we have less vectors than here. Here we have all of those who are who determinate is non-zero. Here we have some less vectors. But we were able to prove that. But we were able to prove that those whose determinant was multiple of the prime idea, the prime idea, the prime number, is redundant. It's not necessary in the construction of the Newton polytheum. And once you have this, the rest of the proof is combinatorial, independent of the characteristic. So this is essentially the idea behind this. So using the work of Gonzalez Springberg and this nice coincidence. We have this result. Okay, so coming back to the question by Imon, so the in dimension two, so this theorem is, so what was the question again? The question was actually: we started with a normal gamma, not if you normalize after n. Okay, to be honest, I forgot to. Okay. To be honest, I forgot what the theorem was. Okay, okay, well, that doesn't matter. That doesn't matter. The thing is that in dimension two, the combinatorics are the same. Okay, and this is how we can prove this theorem. Okay. And I think that's also. Thanks for your attention. I'm curious now. So what was it? Could you go back? I'm curious now, so what was could you go back to that theorem that I asked you about? Yes, yes. Which one? Which one is it? Probably this one? Yes. So the X, my question was if X is normal. If X is normal, huh? Because your counterexample was the cusp, right? Of course, of course. If X is normal to start with, I'm just asking because normality was the crucial ingredient. What the crucial ingredient in your other theorem? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So, we are discussing this theorem. What is the question? What is the question? What is true? Yes. Okay, so because of that, is there a counterexample in characteristic P for a normal variety of this theorem? So you have to normalize without normalizing. I think this is this, there is no counterexample in dimension two, but in dimension three or more, there are examples. Yeah, yeah, we have examples of. Yeah, yeah, we have examples of a cone in dimension three. Okay, so the corresponding variety is normal and this is not true. Yeah. Yeah. And moreover, it continues to not be true after normalizing afterwards. So you start with something normal and then you do the two different recipes for the flow and they still disagree after normalizing. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, I will ask Jack to repeat. Okay, because I forgot what I said. Yeah, so moreover, you can start with a normal variety, normal toric variety, apply the two different recipes, and then normalize afterwards and still get different things in dimension three. So this combinatorial coincidence is only a dimension two phenomenon. Yeah, yeah, great. Thank you. So I guess his question then is so then this technique is not going to work to do to work varieties which which which technique? I mean I think this is what Jack was saying, the sort of this nice thing that happened with you. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I mean for so I think this is a this this is actually a good thing because if we if we had this this coincidence in any dimension, then it's the same problem in characteristic zero and characteristic p. So this is zero and characteristic p so this is not this is not fun so you you you you expect that the the positive characteristic case is different okay so now we know we have examples where in dimension three these are not the same so we have a different question okay okay it's similar because you are dealing with you know cones and subdivisions etc but these are different subdivisions okay so i i think this is a good good good good thing Other questions from online? Yeah, can I ask a question? Yes, please. It seems, okay, so this J0 and the JP, right? I mean, I'm wondering if you can sort of use, like, if you have like a variety that's like defined with, say, integer coefficients, right? So then you've got your characteristic zero model and you've got your your characteristic zero model and you got your characteristic p models of of that you know of that variety right um and i wonder if you can use j0 for kind of almost all p yes yes yes i think that just take p sufficiently large you know and you can actually estimate how large just uh yes just just by looking at the at the okay but for applying once for applying once the nash blow up it's easy to estimate Once the Nash blow up is easy to estimate. But if you continue to iterate, then I think there is no control on how large the P must be. Right. So that's why the question. Yeah, no, no, we don't know. I don't think this can be answered because it changes a lot. These subdivisions of the cone gives you very different gammas as you continue to iterate. So I don't think it is possible to estimate how large. How large this P must be. But if there is some P. I mean, I mean, because you don't know if this is going to stop. This is the problem. This is the question. You don't know if by iterating this Nash blow-up, you will eventually stop. So if you continue infinitely many times, then J0 and JP, they will not concite, even if you take P large enough. No. No. So so so the answer is no. Okay, m yeah, more or less. If you know that the iteration of normalized Nash blow-ups stops at some point, then yes, for P large enough, J0 and JP are the same. But if you don't know that it's But if you don't know that it stops, then you cannot say. Okay, thank you. Thank you for the question. All right. Thank you, Fred. Are there any more questions from online you want to ask? Do you want one more second? You might have not heard that yet. Is there any any other question from online? Any other questions from online? I don't think so. Okay, well, if not, let's thank Danielle again. Okay, okay, thank you.
