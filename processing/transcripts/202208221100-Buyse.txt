It's almost the same as Gerd's title, so be assured that the contents will be very different. Actually, Gerd and I had a nice dinner a few weeks ago to discuss on how we would split the topics. And he had this wonderful overview all ready to go. So, I mean, we decided, you know, in an instant that he would present that, and I would talk about other issues. And then we went off to have a good dinner and drinks. To have a good dinner and drinks. So, what I'm going to show today is, you know, not the theory of statistical evaluation of surrogate endpoints, but rather practical and statistical and clinical issues that we found over time with surrogate evaluation. We've done a lot of surrogate evaluations, and I think we can learn from all these experiences. So, I don't have to convince anyone here that it's important to look at surrogates, but I will try to put things in context by. Try to put things in context by talking about the regulatory point of view of surrogate endpoints, and I think that will be very interesting for our further discussions. And then I will kind of look at a summary of the frameworks Giert introduced so nicely to kind of introduce the two case studies that I'm going to discuss. And the reason I chose two case studies is that we have this wonderful situation of early breast cancer where we've tried to validate two different or to evaluate two different surrogate endpoints. Different surrogate endpoints. And it turns out that one of them is absolutely brilliant. It's probably one of the best surrogates you can ever dream of. And the other one is absolutely awful. It just, it doesn't work. It's not a good surrogate. No matter how you look at it, it's really bad. And so why is that? And I think that will lead me to the tough questions that hopefully will be the more interesting part of my talk. As far as the regulators, there's this nice guidance that FDA published a few years back. Published a few years back on clinical trial endpoints for the approval of cancer drugs. Most of my experience is in cancer, and my two examples are in cancer as well. So, you know, bear with me if I talk about cancer more than other diseases. But they make a distinction between two types of approval, the traditional approval, which has been around for many years, which consists of approving a drug if you can demonstrate a benefit or an effect of treatment on either. Of treatment on either the clinical endpoint of interest or a surrogate endpoint which is known to predict the clinical benefit. So I've underlined known to predict because that, of course, is a very high bar. And we don't know of many endpoints that have been validated and known to predict the clinical endpoint. But anyway, that's the FDA definition of when you can use a surrogate. The other type of approval is an accelerated approval, which is in a sense a sort of lower level of approval. Sort of lower level of approval where you can actually use a surrogate even if it's not known to predict clinical benefit as long as it is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. And, you know, of course, this is regulatory jargon. So, I mean, you know, you have to really try to read between the lines what they mean. But and the distinction between known to predict and reasonably likely to predict is sometimes a bit fuzzy, but I'll come back to that later. If we look at the number of drugs that are approved every year by FDA, Approved every year by FDA, and this comes from the CEDAR, which is the drug evaluation and research division. So, this does not include biologicals and other types of therapies like gene therapies and non-conventional drugs. This is only conventional drugs. The number of new drug approvals actually hasn't increased as much as what one would like, perhaps. But what has increased in the last years is these accelerated approval drugs. So, some drugs are now approved. Some drugs are now approved, about a quarter of all the drugs in cancer, are approved using this accelerated pathway, using again surrogate endpoints. And most of these surrogate endpoints, I'll come back to that, have not been shown to be valid surrogates in the sense that we would define the term in statistics. So let me move on to my examples. And to see, to show you what I'm going to do, I want to show this table, which I take from Joffe and Green's paper in biometrics. And Green's paper in biometrics in 2009. I think that's a useful classification of the various methods that exist to validate surrogate endpoints. And they make the distinction between the causal effects paradigm and the causal association paradigm. As far as causal effects, you can look at two different approaches, one which is based, as Lila and Hirt introduced, on the proportion of treatment effect explained using a classical model with and without the surrogate in the model. And then the other approach, the main approach, is really based on. The main approach is really based on causal inference and estimating direct and indirect effects and calculating then the treatment effect mediated, which is essentially the same concept as the treatment effect explained, but using causal inference approach. And then the causal association paradigm again can be subdivided into different approaches. One is the metra-analytic model that Geer has shown in detail. And then another approach that he has also mentioned, the association between individual level causal treatment effects. Between individual level causal treatment effects. So, again, a distinction between a two-level model that he and that I will use here. That's why I indicated in red. That's the method I'm going to show in my examples. And then also a causal inference approach based on individual level causal treatment effects. So let me go to the case studies. The first case study, and again, this is in HER2 positive early breast cancer. So that's a subset of all cancer patients. The question is, is disease-free survival an acceptable surrogate? Free survival, an acceptable surrogate for overall survival. And I've depicted here the sort of typical situation where patients come with an HERTO-positive tumor. The tumor is resectable. Patients undergo surgery. After surgery, they can be randomized between several treatment options, adjuvant treatment options. And then the treatment is actually pretty long in this situation, usually up to one year. And then patients are followed up for several years. Some of them will recur, and eventually patients. Will recur and eventually patients will die after a much longer follow-up. Early breast cancer, as you know, is a disease of very good prognosis, and so we're talking about years of follow-up before we see these events here. So we recently answered the question, you know, as to whether disease-free survival was, from a statistical point of view, an acceptable surrogate for OS. And we had data on eight randomized trials, 14,000 patients, because some of these trials had more than two treatment. Some of these trials had more than two treatment arms. We have, in fact, 12 treatment contrasts, so about 21,000 patients for the treatment comparisons. And the treatment comparisons were, in fact, any anti-HERT2 treatment versus any other treatment. So you really compare HER2 antibodies versus none here in this comparison. And this is, let me jump right into the trial-level association. Here is a trial-level association. As you see, we have here depicted the correlation. Here depicted the correlation or the association between the disease-free survival hazard ratio. Each circle here is one trial or one treatment contrast, rather, and the vertical axis is the overall survival hazard ratio. What we see here is a pretty nice association, I think, by anybody's standard. This is a very nice association. In fact, the R-squared for trial is 0.84. So, in a sense, you could say 84% of the variants in Sense of the variance in the hurt in the overall survival hazard ratio is explained by the variance in the disease-free survival hazard ratio, which is pretty nice. And if you look at the equation here of the regression line, and this by the way is on the log scale, so it's an equation on the log scale, what you see is that the line goes through the origin. It wasn't forced to go through the origin, it just goes through the origin, fitting the line between all these points. And there is a slight attenuation of the treatment effect. slight attenuation of the treatment effect on overall survival as compared to disease-free survival. Otherwise, it's a really, really nice association. Now, that was pretty convincing, but we wanted to kind of validate these results by taking other trials and see if their results also fitted. And it just so happened that there were three published trials of Herceptin duration. So these trials compared, you know, an anti-HERT2 drug given for a short course, nine weeks to typically three months. To typically three months versus a long course, at least one year of treatment. And so all of these hazard ratios are really for short versus long duration of herceptin. And as you can see, the predicted hazard ratios using DFS based on this regression line were pretty close to the observed hazard ratios. And so we felt that this was kind of a nice external validation of these results. In terms of the surrogate threshold effect, which again is the treatment effect on the surrogate that predicts. On the surrogate that predicts a statistically significant effect on the clinical endpoint. We also looked at this association. So, again, this is the regression line and the prediction limits around this regression line, the 95% prediction limits. And here, the intersection between the upper prediction limit and the null hypothesis on survival. This point here actually gives you a surrogate threshold effect by definition. This is the surrogate threshold effect. It's the effect on the surrogate that would predict. Effect on the surrogate that would predict a significant effect on the true endpoint. In this case, the surrogate threshold effect is 0.91. That's the estimation. That's the estimate of the STE. And so with an estimated surrogate threshold effect of 0.91, we can actually design a future trial, as we have mentioned already in the beginning sessions. That, you know, the goal of the surrogacy is really to predict the effect. And as we are predicting, the goal is really to plan another. The goal is really to plan another trial, a future trial, and using the surrogate instead of the clinical endpoint, or in addition to the clinical endpoint. So, if we were to design a new trial now and making sure that we will detect the survival benefit, we could actually do this with the surrogate. And because the surrogate threshold effect is 0.91, we could actually design a trial that is sized on disease-free survival and making sure that we reject the null hypothesis that the The null hypothesis that the hazard ratio for disease-free survival is greater than 0.91, which is in a sense equivalent, given the uncertainty of that prediction, to testing the same hypothesis on survival with a hazard ratio of one. So if we have a surrogate threshold effect of 0.91, we can design a trial based on the surrogate. And that will, of course, need more events because that's a more conservative assumption than this one. And so we were a hypothesis than this one. Hypothesis than this one. We will need more events, but we will gain time. And that's the whole point of the exercise: to gain time with a surrogate. And so, here, in fact, how much time do we gain? Well, we look at the Kaplan-Meyer survival curves here. The survival curves are the dotted lines here. So, blue is the control and red is the experimental in this set of trials. And then the continuous lines here are for disease-free survival. So, overall survival is dashed, and the continuous line is disease-free. And the continuous line is disease-free survival. So, if we wanted to now look at how long it would take to get 20% of events if we use DFS or if we used OS, well, supposing the new trial used the experimental treatment as its control, which would probably be the case. Now, the new control is in fact this experimental. We would probably look at the red curves. And so we would need about seven, what is it, six years, 72 months, six years to have. Two months, six years to have 20% of events on DFS, and easily twice as long, more than seven times two, 14 years, probably to have, not quite, but we would need probably about, yes, twice as much time to get the same number of events on OS. And so we've gained a lot of time by using the surrogate, even though we may require more events to do our analysis. So that's a really good surrogate. DFS, I think it's fair. Good surrogate. DFS, I think it's fair to say, is a really good surrogate. And you may remember, those of you who have been in the field for long enough, may remember a similar analysis that Dan Sargent did in colorectal cancer. And that got a lot of attention, whereby Dan showed at the time that three-year disease-free survival in colorectal cancer was just as good as the five-year survival in that disease as far as an end point in clinical trials. And that was really a brilliant. And that was really a brilliant analysis that made its way through the FDA. So, let me now move to the second case study, which is in exactly the same situation. We're talking again about HER2-positive early breast cancer patients who have a removable or resectable tumor. But now, in fact, instead of looking at the patients after surgery, we want to look at the patients before surgery. So they're going to be randomized between two different neo-adjuvant treatments. Two different neo-adjavant treatments before surgery, and then after surgery, they will again be followed up for disease recurrence and survival. What's interesting here is that the surrogate can be observed after three months. Surgery usually takes place after three months of neo-adjuvant treatment, and so pathological complete response is going to be our surrogate. So, that means whether patients at the time of surgery have any cancer cells left or not. If they have no cancer cells left in the Have no cancer cells left in the tumor that is in the specimen that is resected. That means the tumor essentially has gone away due to neo-adjuvant treatment. And that, of course, is biologically quite a finding compared to patients who still have cancer cells in their removed tumor. So PCR is, it's fair to say, is biologically a very interesting endpoint. And everybody thought before this analysis was done, everybody thought that pathological complete response was bound to. Complete response was bound to be a surrogate. It was so biologically powerful that it had to be a surrogate. So, the Food and Drug Administration FDA did a meta-analysis themselves and they used the same approach as the one we used. They had 12 randomized trials, 12,000 patients, and they compared any neo-adjuvant treatment versus none. So, they did the individual level association, and yes, they confirmed that pathological complete response is a huge prognostic factor. It's in fact, so it's a It's in fact, so it's a trial, it's an individual-level surrogate, if you like, to call it that way. But then, more importantly, when they looked at the trial-level association, they found nothing. So, here again, every point is a trial. And by the way, I didn't say it, but the size of the trial is the trial of the circle is the number of patients in the trial. So, again, this is really disappointing because now we see no regression at all. What we would have expected is something that goes down because. Goes down because you know an increasing hazard ratio means a higher response rate in terms of the odds ratio for PCR. And then here we would have expected the line to go again through the origin. And the observed line doesn't go through the origin at all. Of course, that regression line is completely non-significant. So there is no association whatsoever between the treatment effects on the surrogate and the trend point. How disappointing. So, of course, clinicians were devastated. So, of course, clinicians were devastated when they saw this. They say, well, this is, you know, how can we explain this? It just doesn't make sense. You know, the biology would predict PCR to be a good surrogate. And so they came up with a lot of clinical explanations. The effects of treatment were small on both PCR and OS. There was a lot of heterogeneity in PCR assessment, lots of heterogeneity in treatment comparisons, a lot of heterogeneity in patient populations, and so on and so forth. And so this analysis of idea was criticized, and people said, Idea was criticized, and you know, people said, Well, it's worthless simply because it didn't show what was expected. And then we redid the same analysis, but only on HER2 positive resectable primary breast cancer patients. So, in a sense, we tried to address the last heterogeneity here. And it's true that the FDA meta-analysis had a lot of different subtypes of patients. Now, we looked at HER2 positive patients only, and we collected more recent trials than FDA, and we redid exactly the same analysis as they did. Same analysis as they did. We also had information on baseline prognostic factors, and we like to have those because they are potential confounders. I'll come back to confounding in a moment. And then we looked at, again, individual trial, individual level association. We confirmed exactly what FDA found, you know, a huge impact of PCR as a prognostic factor independent of treatment, trial, TN, and HR. In other words, adjusting for all these factors, we still had this big prognostic impact of PC. Had this big prognostic impact of PCR, and again at the trial level, nothing. An R-squared of 0.12, essentially zero, no association whatsoever in the treatment effect. And here we have a relatively homogeneous patient population. So what happened? We were really worried and we thought perhaps, you know, this meta-analytic model doesn't really show everything. Why don't we try some other methods? And so we did try to also look at the two other methods here. So, look at the two other methods here: condition now, the surrogate, looking at the proportion of treatment effect explained. And I mean, I will cut the story short. You know, essentially, it was zero. And the proportion of treatment effect mediated, we had a colleague of ours, Stein van Steland, look at this, and he essentially found a proportion mediated of zero. And I'll come back to this in a moment. And we didn't do this analysis yet. I hope we will do it someday, but we haven't had the time to do it yet. But if you look at the direct and indirect. But if you look at the direct and indirect treatment effects that were used to calculate the proportion mediated, this is the analysis that Stein provided us with. Here are the observed effects, so the total effects of treatment, and here are the direct effects of treatments. And I can flip-flop between these two slides and you don't see any difference, right? So that means the treatment effects are the same whether you look at the overall treatment effect or the direct treatment effects. So it's fair to say that the proportion mediation is obviously exactly. Mediation is obviously exactly zero in this case. Now, be that as it may, so I think FDA has shown that the tri-level association is inexistent here. Be that as it may, there is a guidance for industry that says that pathological complete response can be used as an endpoint for accelerated approval, consistent with the guidance that I showed earlier. And in fact, even though we know now for sure that the PCR treatment effect does not predict. Treatment effect does not predict the OS treatment effect, you can actually get accelerated approval as a sponsor if you have a new drug, if you show an improvement in the level of PCR. And so in fact, you can get this accelerated approval, but FDA will actually ask you as a condition for accelerated approval that you come back years later with proof that in fact you've also had an effect on the long-term endpoints of disease-free survival and perhaps even overall survival. The problem, of course, is that are these long-term trials feasible if the new drug is approved? If the drug is approved for PCR, I mean, how many trials will go all the way down to DFS and OS measurements if the drug has always been approved? And more importantly, if PCR has been observed, are the treatments of these patients not going to depend on the fact that patients achieved or did not achieve? The fact that patients achieved or did not achieve PCR, and I'll come back to that in a moment using causal diagrams. Sorry, if we look at these causal diagrams, I think we can look at the two extreme situations. Here we have a causal surrogate. The whole treatment effect on survival goes through the surrogate. Here we have the opposite situation, which is independence. In fact, the treatment effects on surrogate and survival are completely independent of each other. Nothing is mediated by the surrogate. Nothing is mediated by the surrogate. And of course, in reality, we end up in situations that are in between. But the point here that's important is that even if we were under true independence, because we have confounding by prognostic factors, we may actually see a counterfactual effect of the surrogate on survival, which is due to confounding, not to the fact that there is an effect of the surrogate on the trend point, but it's just a result of confounding. And vice versa. If we look at a true causal surrogate, supposing that Causal surrogate, supposing that the whole effect of the treatment on survival is mediated by the surrogate. What if the surrogate induces new therapies that are given after observation of the surrogate that will have an effect on the true outcome of survival? And of course, you could say, well, maybe we can adjust for these surrogate-directed therapies, but not if it's given to all patients, because then we can't really use a causal approach because we have no patients who are not given such treatment. Patients who are not given such treatments, and therefore, we can't adjust for the fact that some patients have and some patients have not received these treatments. So, it's really a conundrum. Once the drug is approved based on the surrogate, it becomes almost impossible to show surrogacy and to observe the true clinical endpoints in an unconfounded manner. So, to finish, let me go not to the FDA, but to the EMA now, to the European Agency. And well, their terminology is a bit different. They use the term expedited approval. Use the term expedited approval instead of accelerated approval for some reason. I don't know why they use this different terms, but that's the way it is. And so, these authors here have looked at the number of expedited approvals, as we call them in Europe, that occurred in the last eight years. No, not in the last eight years, but from 11 to 18, so eight years. There were 51 such approvals, and 90% were based on surrogate endpoints. And none of these 46 actually were using We're using surrogates that had been validated. Now, of course, what do we mean by validated and non-validated surrogate endpoints? That's a big question. That's one of the tough questions that I think, and I hope this workshop will look at. We don't really know what we mean by that. And these authors have referred to two papers that may perhaps be used partly to define validation of a surrogate, a paper by Tom Fleming and colleague Powers, and they define. Powers and he they define an efficacy measure in clinical trials could be a true efficacy, in other words, using the true endpoint. It could be a validated surrogate, but they don't define what validated means, a non-validated surrogate that is, as FDA would say, reasonably likely to predict. And then finally, a correlate, something that is a measure of biological activity, a correlate, in other words, an individual level surrogate, but that hasn't been validated at the tried level. And then these other papers. And then this other paper by Ciani and colleagues, where they also look at the evidence requirement for a surrogate. Here they look at a validated surrogate, which is a surrogate that really predicts the treatment effect on the trend point, one in which there is a consistent association between the surrogate and the final endpoint. In other words, an individual level surrogate, not a tri-level. And here, a surrogate that is not at all validated either individually at the individual level or at the tri-level. Or at the tri-level, but that is biologically plausible. And so we end up with these various definitions for surrogates and for the validation of surrogates that we have to live with. So to conclude on surrogate and point evaluation, again, this workshop will review a lot of the methods that have been discussed already and others that have been proposed but not yet discussed. And I really look forward to hearing about other methods. And there is some evidence of agreement. And there is some evidence of agreement between the various methods. I mean, in the example of pathological complete response, I showed that there was, you know, by and large agreement between at least three methods. But I think more evidence would be valuable that if a surrogate is really good or really bad, you know, any method will show it and that we would be nice to have more evidence on that. And finally, about the surrogate endpoint validation, that's a huge issue. And I think we may be very limited in our ability. Very limited in our ability to show validation of a surrogate for the reasons I've discussed. It may be intrinsically limited, as Gecht argued with Fano's inequality. It may come too late to be useful in practice. It may require extrapolation from other treatment classes. And because of confounding, we may never be in a position to truly validate some surrogates. So I think we have a lot of work ahead of us, but hopefully this workshop will bring some clarity to the field. Thank you very much. To the field. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mark. That was excellent. I feel like your talk really put into words and pictures in some cases some of the things that have been floating around in my mind and that I've been struggling with and really highlights a lot of the challenges we're dealing with. And I think it's easy for. It's easy for, I mean, I'll just speak for myself, you know, for me to hear all this and then think, oh, this is just too hard. You know, this is a problem that is maybe not solvable. Even in a case where multiple methods have shown something is not a good surrogate, you can still get something approved early based on that thing. So I think it's easy to feel disheartened, but. It's easy to feel disheartened, but um, you know, we're not giving up, and there's so much work to be done, and it makes it more exciting. So, thank you. Um, uh, we have a few minutes for questions. We do have a 30-minute open discussion after the next talk. Um, but if anyone has any quick questions, go ahead. Anyone in the room? Okay, anyone online have any comments or questions? Any comments or questions? Okay. Well, thank you, Mark. Good time, good timing. And thank you for your question, actually, Laila. You said it in words that I didn't use myself, but so many people doubt that a surrogate can ever be validated that I think, in my view, one of the And I think, in my view, one of the interests of this workshop is to find inroads and to show that some methodologies can actually be quite helpful, even though they may not be the only ones. I think some methodologies can really make a difference between a good and a bad surrogate. And that, to me, even that is helpful. And how have you dealt with? So, in the example you gave where the results. Where the results were so much opposed to what people believed to be true. And did you have the opportunity to respond to any of that criticism? Well, we wrote a paper actually with these results and the clinicians are co-authors of the paper, but it was a struggle, yes, to convince them that we had no evidence. Doesn't mean to say that PCR is a bad endpoint in and of itself. Is a bad endpoint in and of itself because actually it's used for patient management. So there's no, you know, no way this going this endpoint is going to go away. But to use it to predict the long-term effect is just the thing that doesn't work. And it's a bit paradoxical. They don't quite understand why. You know, the individual level and the trial level are so opposed in this case. But we know mathematically that that can happen. You know, in a normal, normal case, the two are completely orthogonal. So you can have any configuration. So, you can have any configuration goes. Yes, and I've seen some situations where this exact thing happens, and then you hear the patient saying, well, actually, this earlier, this surrogate, this thing you're calling the surrogate is important to us. You know, it's a measure of how we feel and our quality of life. And so that might not be the primary outcome for the FDA, but we care about it. So, you know, don't pull the drug. So, you know, don't pull the drug from the market just because it hasn't shown this impact on the primary outcome because it matters to us. And I've seen that be a very difficult struggle. Absolutely. Okay, well, thank you. Let's move on. We have another mark.
