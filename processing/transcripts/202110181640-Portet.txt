I think my number only one market so it's not. In the nuclear page, and in shops, and the different monetary stage, intermediate expressed in the cytoplasm. So, for example, you will have a keratin for epithelial cell in fibrobras or All if I don't all astrocyte, you are going to have vimantin and other type, so type 3. But all the interval protein shares the same, so there is a conserved rubber domain in the middle, and after, depending on the protein, you are going to have variable tail and head domain. And so these five. And so this fibrous protein were all going, so that is a typical monomer, we're all going to assemble to form dimer and after the dimer are going to laterally aggregate to form what we call the ULF and the unit length filament. And this one are going to, after this lateral aggregation, we have some longitudinal aggregation. Aggregation or assembly, I should say, to have the elongation of the intermediate filament. So that is mainly the type of assembly for type 3, and maybe the other thing could work the same. So what is very important and that is very different from actin and microtribute, we do have this annealing between different filaments and no need of other type or other type of protein. Of protein. Okay? And there are semi-flexible protein. So there is another particularity for the. The virtual audience has lost video and audio. Is it red? It's red. It's just the color it's supposed to be. Just one second to see it. Did you forget to push the button? Pushed it. Which did you want to do? No, no, it's nothing to do with that. Okay, we have the back. Okay, okay. So, other specificity of entaminated signal are going to be also so they do not need ATP, GDP, R active, and microtubule to assemble. So, we are going to have polymorphism, so we are going to have some small particles show non-filament. So, filament organizer is network. Also, filament can bundle. And in here, so we have an epithelial cell, and so we are going to have the cutting. I'm going to have a meta-image later. So, that is from a group from AHANT as a lubber group. And so, with them. And so with them, I was working on keratin. And another group, so in pasta, so we are working on astrocyte, and so in this case, it's going to be to be the intermediate philamoid or going to be venative. So the property, the mechanical property for intermediate philamide is now pretty elastic, but the more you pull on them, they are going after a while to get stiffer. So we have your cells and So, we have ourselves a strength model. And they are very resistant to the case. And these mechanical properties are linked to the function. So, they are kind of the scaffold of the intercellular environment and they play as the organizer of the intercellular uh environment. They are kind of stress abs absorber and uh yeah, I I And uh yeah, I I maybe I forget to mention they are very very prone to uh post-transrational uh modification like phosphorization and so on. And so sometimes they are called anyway. And so they they also are in charge of the mechanical residence of cell and tissue and maintain the integrity of cell and tissue. And so it's what is with the long region? And so it's not these results because what is very important for intermediate filaments is how they organize, the structure. And so I say there is not only one intermediate filament protein, but there is, up to now, the the list like seven, seven T change expressing uh intermediate CNN and the R mutation the all uh the The catalogue, the mutation on anti-immediate phenomena, and they are able to link this mutation to specific disease. And what we observe always is when we have a mutation, that is going to induce a change, a disorganization, a misorganization, we can have aggregate instead of long filaments and networks. We can have different types of organizations. And so the structure for the intermediate filament is very important. And for this reason, I tried to understand how they organize and what are the main processes that are going to influence this organization. And in here, I just would like to show a movie movie. So that is a movie uh of uh uh Of epithetial cells. You see in here the keratin rack is from the lobo group in Artan. And so what I want you to notice is this in world motion. Motion is moving anymore. But but okay, okay. And so with this type of cell, what we have done some time ago, we add uh We we had uh the distribution, the fluorescence of the assembler uh periodly and we were looking at uh so so uh so we have some data and so we had some model in which we consider only transport and assembly disassembly very simple thing and after that we uh assume different hypotheses for the transport of the soluble or the transport of the assembled metal Transport or the assembled material, the assembly, disassembly, different profiles for where the thing assembled or disassembled. We create a 36 scenario using some model selection. We are able to get a best scenario. But what was the most important in here? In this best scenario, when we look at the time scale, what was the most important within all the processes where we did? We add measurements of this inward motion, but we have absolutely no clue where this thing comes from. Thank you, just some recall about what can also happen for the intra-central transport. So we have the microchips that are going to go into the track and so they are organized from the minus to the plus.   The uh kinetic, so the truckers that are going to move the material from here to here, what we can see is all the material is at the center. When the silence, the delaying, so the truckers that are moving the material from the periphery to the center, all the material is at the periphery. However, when they diesel with the nocodazole, the track for the transport, all everything is at the center. Everything is at the center. So, in fact, in here, we can assume the intermediate filament distribution depends on some active motion because if we dissolve the microtubule what state, we still have the actin and this retrograph stroke. And also, we have some microtribule. microtribule dependent transport. So first, other groups have been observing this interplay between actin and intermediate filament. For example in here what they do is they have this type of cell on this micropattern and so that are the normal organization when they deplete the uh the orc of acting The orc of actin, so you are going to have more, so the vimantin is everywhere. And however, when you remove the vimantin, the actin is more dispersed. And so, what we are doing now is just ongoing work with Pastor again. So, we have now our astrocyte on some micro patterns, but for us, they are going to be But for us, they are going to be squared now. And we are going to observe the vimantin GFIP, that is another type 3 intermediate phenomenal protein expressed by the astrocyte, and the actin. And so what we are doing for now, because I don't want to get into the dynamic of actin, what I'm doing for now, I will develop some images. Some image analysis algorithm to follow the arc of actin, and what we are going to try to do is a map of the velocity of the arc. And we are going to use this information to inform our model of intermediate filament. So that is ongoing. And well, now I would like to go back now to the Go back now to the transport, but now based on microtubule. And now I'm going to show you another movie. So now that is astrocyte, and we are going to... So all this fluorescence is the mountain, the fat. And what you are going to observe is anti-medic filaments that are going to just walk again in the um In the windows. Okay? So you see, and they are quite locked. Okay, so now the question is how so that is going to be our microtubule. How long, elastic we know. In fact, we can stretch up to In fact, we can stretch up to three times an intermediate filament before breaking. So how a long elastic filament that are going to be attached prontally to motor and antagonistic motor, some going this way and some going this way, how they are going to be able to move and how also the cell can regulate this type of transport. Transport. In here, no data because we are not, so we know we can have this type of thing. And so, in here, what we have done is try to develop some model and try to figure out with the model what are the parameters that are going to play an important role. And after, later, the plan is to test that experimental. Okay, so for Okay, so for our curvature, the curve is going to be an intermediate filament. The intermediate filament is going to be described as nodes and these nodes are going to be connected by spring. And the spring constant is evaluated, so approximated using the Young reduced of the intermediate phenomena. And at each node, we're all going to have some binding site. Some binding site for Deniden and kinesin. We are going to have a constant number and the same number for each type of motor and on each node. After we are going to allow the attachment and detachment, and from the theory of motor, the detachment are force-dependent. And after we assume And after we assume a tug of war, a local tug of war at the node, and we are going to see how for that local tug of war we can obtain some motion. So at each node, we are going to have this force balance equation. So in here, we are going to have a viscous excuse. And that is going to be balanced by the Going to be balanced by the force induced by the denadine, the kinadine, and the restoring force due to the elastic coupling. The elastic coupling, remember, is going to be alpha and in here we have some track. And N is going to be the number of DNA and kinasine attached to a given node. For the restoring force, the elastic force, we just use elastic force we just use a very simple linear response we can maybe do better later and using the for the load of velocity relationship for each type of motor we are going to be able to rewrite this force balance so in here now we are going to have the velocity and the force acting And the force acting, so the force acting on each motor attached to a node are going to be also dependent on the velocity of the node. So in short, we are going to have this ugly expression that is going to define the velocity of a node, and this one depends on what only finally the variable or the number of kinetic. Or the number of kinasine and denine attached. All the other things or parameters, what is very important is this Fs is the stall force. So for each motor, that is going to be the maximum force we assume a motor can generate. And after the other parameters are going to be the Are going to be the backward and forward velocity for each motor. So we need some dynamics now. So because the velocity depends on the number of motor attached of each type, and we know we have a maximum number of binding sites. So instead of working with an integer, so we can use the proportion. So, the proportion. So, in here, for the equation of the proportion, we are going to have just the attachment. And so, because we have a maximum number of binding sites, so we can go further than one. And in here, we have the detachment part. This one, remember, I said is going to be force-dependent. In here, we use for this simulation, for this example. Simulation for this example: I'm going to show you: we use just exponential distancement, but we can use also we can use a cash bound and so on. And so, that is the dynamic for the proportion of occupied binding side of each type. And to get the dynamic of the velocity, we differentiate the expression I show you. Expression: I show you, and in here we obtain finally 3n. So, for each node, we are going to have three equations, one for the occupancy of a binding site for kinesin, denadine, and the velocity of the node. And all these things are interdependent. And what I maybe forget to mention is because of a lot of The load velocity relationship for each one. So they are piecewise. And so this combination are going to generate, in fact, the system exists on three, sorry, four different regimes. So we are going to have the limiting regime, so the regime 1 and 4, and in here, in this case, the node, the The node, the motor cannot walk faster, so they have a maximum velocity. And otherwise, so if we start with velocity in regime 2 or 3, so we can evolve and so on. So the only thing we need to remember in here, these two limiting regimes are invariant and And once the velocity gets there, you are trapped there. Okay? And so four different regimes. And regime one and four are linear. And so we can find, so all the nodes are coordinate and work at the maximal velocity for the DNA and the kinesinide. And for these two regimes, the intermediate. These two regimes, the intermediate regime, we have a non-linear system, and we can show to have an equilibrium, all the nodes have to work at the same velocity. The velocity satisfies this equation, and we can show this, so we have many equilibrium. We can have up to in this only three regime two and three, we can have up to three. We can have up to three locally asymptotically stable equilibrium. And so that depends on if we have a strong or weak motor. And a strong or weak motor is just when we have the ratio of the stall and the detachment force. That is the diffusion. And so finally, so when we do finalize the analysis of these three Of this three n-dimensional system on the four regime, we have all the nodes that are going to work at the same velocity and so the motor also coordinates along the filament. We can observe three motions: retrograde, interrograd, and slow motion as we see in the cell. And because In the cell, and because of this multi-stability, we have, in fact, the effect of initial condition that is going to be very important. Okay, so now we can see all the nodes are coordinate, and so all the motors can't coordinate along the filament. How? So, our first, when we do simulation with two Do simulation with two or just a mathematical analysis, by the way. In this case, if we take two nodes and they are not coupled, so we have b stability. Depending where we start with the initial condition, we are going to finish with some negative velocity or positive velocity. Now, when we couple them, so if we start with both nodes from this part, obviously we are going to finish with a negative velocity. To finish with a negative velocity. And if we start with two nodes starting with this button of attraction, we are going to have an anterior velocity at the end. However, when we start with a nod, the first node wanted to go this way and the other one going this way, so that is going to be an extension. Or in this case, we are going to have something in compression. What is going on? Going on. And so, what we have done, we pick 10,000 random initial conditions and we run. And so, what we see in here, so when we start from this type of initial condition, yes, they are implicitly coordinated because they are starting from the same button of abstraction. However, so in this case, so the coordination is done by the initial condition. However, when they are starting from However, when we are starting from there, it is the non-implicity coordinate point and that, so the coordination is just induced by the elastic coupling. And so, what is the effect of this elastic coupling? Now, oh, I'm sorry, it's not that bad on the screen. For the strong motor, in this case, we have a In this case, we have four different equilibrium. So, what we have done is we take our 10,000 initial conditions and we run them for different coupling stripes. And we start with at the beginning, so no coupling. So, when we have no coupling, so in here we have most of the we have most of the points that are going to the initial conditions that are going to end up with the retrograde velocity and fuel interval. When you increase the coping, what you see in here is they are going, in fact, the coping is going to accelerate the motion. So when they are implicitly coordinate, starting with the motion, coordinate, starting with the same basin of attraction, the coupling, increasing the coupling, increases the velocity. When they are not implicitly coordinate, when the coordination is induced by the elasticity, we can have change of direction. Now, for the week, when we have filaments that are stalled, the tug of war is not resolved, when they are implicitly called When they are implicitly coordinated, increasing the elasticity, we have no change. However, with a very small elasticity, what we can see is the tug-of-war is resolved and so we have actual motion. Okay, and now the last part is really so. Really, so what is going on? So, how the cell can regulate the transport. So, in this paper, what we observe is depending on the situation, so when the astrocytes are non-polarized, we have a balanced transport between the enterograd and retrograde. However, when the cells are polarized, we have mostly enterograd transport. Ontario transport. And after when there are really immigration, again a kind of balance between both transport. So how a cell can switch and organize the transport. So in here we look also at the interaction between the cargo and the motor, so with the ratio, so detachment, attachment, and what is the effect. Attachment and what is the effect of the number of binding sites. We see in the deterministic model the initial conditions are very important, but as you mentioned, so the study is noisy. So if we add random fluctuation to the model, what is going to happen? And could we see what is going to be, so by comparing with the stock? Comparing with the stochastic and the deterministic, what is going to be the consequence. So, what we have done is first we vary the force of interaction between the motor and the cargo. So, that is the default value, that is something because again, we do not know how many banding sites we have for the motor along intermediate phenomena. Around intermediate phenomena, we do not know the affinity, we don't know anything here. And so we take this biologically plausible value and we vary it. So seven values for the kinesin, seven values for the Denidine, and so we obtain 49 pairs of affinity, and we also vary the number of binding side. Finding some. Now, with the deterministic model, we know exactly what is going on with the parameter and so on, and we have some conditions to know where we are going to end up. So, in here, we pick up again 150 random initial conditions. So, we have two nodes that are going to be coupled, and they start with. and they start with random number of motor attached. And in here, so that are going to be for the base value of the parameter, we are going to have 30% that are going to finish with anterograde velocity, the rate, and we are going to have 70% that are going to finish with the retrograde, the negative. The retrograde, the negative velocity. So, and we also look at the velocity of the individual filament, but the mean velocity of the ensemble of filament, and also the distribution between retrogrades, interrograd, and slow. So, slow is defined like that. And again, what we want to see is to try to access To try to assess what is the impact of the other. So, yes, we have entrogenic stochasticity for the motor, but there is also other thing that can play and be described as random fluctuation in the cell. So, what we do here, we do so we are going to run our one fifty initial condition. So, we have our analysis with a deterministic model. With a deterministic model. We do simulation, stochastic simulation that is done by John Dallon at BYU. And so we have the same force balance. And now the stochasticity are going to be just in the number of Denanine and kinasine attached to each knot. And we compute the instantaneous velocity of each filament, and we are going to compute. Filament, and we are going to compute that at four different times because in here it's very easy to define asymptotic behavior for the stochastic, depending on the parameter. We are going to see. So, in here we have result for the deterministic, result for the stochastic. In here, that is the base. Is the base value for the so in here? So we vary the desorption constant for the kinetine and the DNA. And in here, we have our base, remember what I show you, where we have 70% finishing with a retrograde velocity and here 30% with an anterior grade. With the deterministic, we can see we still We still have influence and the initial condition matter. However, when we are in the stochastic simulation, what we can see in here, we do not, so everything is just blue, and in here, everything is just red. For a minute, okay. And so that are the mean velocity and the reportition between Repartition between so retrograde in Sion, white is for the slow one and red is just for the anterograde. So obviously we have some discrepancy. In here, we try to have a closer look by comparing the result of the deterministic and the stochastic Response. So from the deterministic, we have, I show you the equation for the velocity. So we can calculate all the possible equilibrium. We run simulation and you cannot see anything. So this one in here is where the affinity are the same for the kinasine and the DND. And the DND. So that is corresponding to this one. So in here, the equilibrium, when they co-locate with the wide distribution, but the wide distribution, so anyway, they are the stable equilibrium. So this one in here is a saddle point in the deterministic. And for the stochastic, what you can observe, in fact, at so the the So, the distribution of the velocity for the stochastic simulation at 10 seconds orange and in blue at 550 seconds. So, what you can see, the stochastic are going to stabilize at the saddle point. So, when the affinity are the same. When the affinity are different, now instead of stabilizing. Now, instead of stabilizing at, remember, we have bestability in the deterministic. Now, we are going to stabilize to only one. So, in here, we have a kind of the deterministic is a kind of local optimizer. And when we add stochastic fluctuation, we are going to have a kind of global optimizer. So, it's going to find the global optimum. find the global optimum. And in here what we can summarize the impact of noise. So the noise really annihilates the effect of initial condition. So we are going to make the motor cargo interaction affinity as the driver, the main regulator of the transport and then synchronize the transport. The transport of the alphabet. And I'm almost done. Another thing, the noise, the addition of noise do. So in here, we are going to have the velocity that are going. So in here, we have the different velocity affinity for the DNA and kinesine. So that is like that. So this horizontal line is zero for the velocity, meaning so. For the velocity, meaning so when our mean velocity crosses this line, we have a switch in the direction of the ensemble of filament. With the deterministic, so the deterministic, you see, to switch the direction of the filament, the collection of filament, you have to have a big differential between the affinity. However, when you add noise, what is Add noise, what is going to happen? So the differentiate between the affinity is very small. So, in fact, the addition of noise is going to make the regulation easier for the cell. And as I didn't mention before, I forget again. So, depending on the number of binding sites, what we can see is to reach this. To reach this, the yeah, the switch, so more you have a binding site and lower, so more time the thing take okay. And the last thing when we have the same affinity, for example, in here what we can see is the toggle. Can see is the tug of war is not resolved, so that is not going to help. And so, if we want to summarize the regulation, possible regulation of transport of intermediate filament driven by antagonistic motor. What we can see is, it seems yes, we can regulate by biochemical property of the interaction. Property of the interaction. In fact, the noise is going to help this regulation by just washing out the effect of the initial condition. So what are the initial conditions? How many motors are attached at the beginning? So that might mean, so we do not care to know how many motors we have at the beginning. And so if we want to speculate. To speculate, what could be a good strategy for an efficient way to switch the transport of an ensemble of filament will be to have few binding sites along the intermediate filament with different, that is important, different affinity to the different type and not strong affinity. So short-lived uh attachment detection. Attachment detection. Thank you. So you will questions in the room? So I noticed in the movie at the beginning that the meshwork of intermediate filaments was very clear and it seemed to maintain that structure as it was contracting. And so I was wondering if this kind of tug-of-war and the binding sites. Yeah, so the exact. Yeah, so is that is totally different? So this toggle can only work for vimantine or neurofilament in neuron when we have actually this type of transport. So you have the microtubule and the intermediate filament really walk along there. However, when you have the first one, when we have the keratin So in fact, I think that is going to be different. We are going to have some type of attachment like that. So this type of model only for women, so type 3 and type what? 5, what is a neurophenomen? 3? No. So more of that kind of one-dimensional. No. So more of that kind of one-dimensional linear transformation. So you it's not like uh that is something, another type of uh transport. Okay. Why is the cell want to transport these filaments? What is the significance biologically to moving them? removing them. So they, what? I don't know what it was and what was that? So actin, we know, is helping to in some motility and microtubules help for transport. So intermediate filaments, what are they doing that the cell wants to okay? So for a number, when you're putting When you are putting, so you are epithelial. So, in the epithelial cell, you are like the, I think one of the more abundant protein are going to be keratin. This keratin is going to just reorganize and so on to maintain the resilience of the cell and the tissue. They form a scaffold in the cell to protect the nucleus and so on. The nucleus and so on to protect and form also the scaffold through the tissue. And so they have to, the cell needs to reorganize all the time to maintain this network. It is like a... Yeah, so and also is we for the moment all the the function for the intermediate phenomena
