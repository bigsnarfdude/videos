        Hello. Can I ask somebody in line to confirm if you can hear the speaker? Hello. Yes, no, maybe. Can you hear me, maybe? Yes. Can you hear me on this side? You said yes, but they said no, so I don't know if I should trust you. No, okay. Apparently, they cannot hear us online. Matthew, me mute it from here. Also, if it's just one person that says that they don't hear, they should check it there and  Okay, Mateo, can you hear us? The microphone seems to be on here and it seems to be working from what I see. Yes, can you hear me? A little louder. Okay. Okay. Now they can hear. Okay. Very good. So only 1201 were pointing on. All right. So the last speaker for this morning is Andrea Lagarder. And she also started her PhD, but she's in collaboration between INRIA in Po and Airbus with our collaborator Guillaume. So Andrea, your turn. And we're continuing with positrust methods. Yes. So thank you for giving. Thank you for inviting me. I will talk about my work on quasi-curve methods for aeroacoustic. So, after a little introduction with my aeroacoustic problem, we will see a variational formulation we want to use with this method. We have to define also a basis function to use in this variational formulation, so it will be also a quasi-solution of our PDE. solution of our PDE. Then I will show my numerical results on this basis function and on their properties. And I will finish with my ongoing work and my properties. So I work with Airbus and Airbus is continuously working on improvement to ameliorate their aircraft through several domains. So I will So I will focus on noise reducing. To do that, we have to model the sound propagation through a heterogeneous flow, the air, especially the sound generated by a reactor. So this is why we are interested in hydroacoustic models. So this is our final purpose in three dimensions. We have P the pressure, M mag vector, which is variable. Which is variable and a smooth and variable wave number. But for the beginning of my PhD, I will take a very simplified model with m equals to zero and only in two dimensions. So it leads us to the Elmholtz equation with variable correction. There are already several ways to solve the associate boundary value problem, but But in general, it's with the finite elements method. It's very expensive, so we want to use test methods. But due to the variability of our coefficients, we will use quasi-test methods, so quasi-solutions as test functions. And after all that, our prospect is to solve this problem in unbounded domain. So we want to couple this. So we want to couple these methods with a boundary element method, which is a very used by Airbus. So a little bit of physical context. This is the same problem where confirm our Helmholtz equation. This is the propagation of acoustic waves in the green. We have also P, the pressure, and V, the velocity field, the unknown. Here they are real, but They are real, but we are interested in the harmonic problem, so with the unknown complex. So for the following, I will work with the complex and with the harmonic frequency. So it leads us to our LMOL sequence. I have to introduce you the variable, the variational formulation we will. A variational formulation we will use as a TREF formulation, and this work is inspired by paper coming soon of Hélène Sebastian, who comes night normally, and Ibrahima Jiva, who is a PhD student. So, I have to introduce to you an hyperbolic system. So, it's written in one. We have In one, we have u the unknown complex and m x and fj are symmetric matrices. M depend on the space variable while the fj are constant. And we want to reformulate our Helmholtz equation into an hyperbolic system. So we come back to the harmonic system and system and while fixing u equals to p v and all these matrices we can have our hyperbolic formulation of the helmholtz equation and i also introduce to a hyperbolic symbol f which is the sum of the fj um i work with the discontinuous galactic metal so i have to show you my mesh Mesh and some notation. So, T and V are two elements separated by a phase F, and U T is a restriction of U in one element T. I also define here the tradition, which is a local space linear of a function which satisfies the hyparabolic system on one element. And we will denote this. Denote this space by x kit. So to find our variational formulation, we multiply fju by a test function, which is also in the trough phase. We integrate by part on one element t and we use the fact they both satisfied the PDE while and by summing on the on G we find this replicity principle which is an integral only on the faces and after that in order to have better properties on the matrices of the on the matrix of the numerical uh method we have to decompose F into uh positive and negative parts. Positive and negative parts. So, to do that, we solve a generalized eigenvalue problem. So, this decomposition is not unique. This is the one we choose. So, it depends on the Helmholtz coefficient, variable. And it permits us to define boundary conditions on the anterior elements and on the exterior boundaries with Boundaries with an incident plane wave, which is a data of the boundary value problem. Finally, we have our variational formulation by summing on all the elements and all the faces. And we can see if we replace the matrices by their analytic formula, we find the ultra-variational formulation when the coefficient. When the coefficient kappa is constant, but we don't have constant coefficients, so we have to define basis functions which are positive solutions of the PVE. And this result came from a paper of Liz Marie and Guillaume Silent. So, like I said, we have a variable coefficient, so we don't know analytical. Coefficient, so we don't know analytical solution of the PDE. This is why we have to define basic solution. So, like Kerra said, this solution, this function, have has residual of other Q in the PDE. And we define local positive space. So, we choose one type of function because. One type of function because we will see three types of functions, and it's also the function satisfying the quasitroft property. And there is several ways to define the quasi-traft property, but we choose the one like which requires the Tyler expansion of the equation. So here is the three types of positions. Is the three types of positron function we study? The first one is amplitude-based generalized plane wave. So it mimics a plane wave, but it's multiplied by a polynomial. So we modified its amplitude. The second one is phase-based generalized plane wave, so it's an exponential of a polynomial. It also mimics plane wave. And the third one. Sign wave and the third one is just a polynomial function. So here some notation. d is the degree of all polynomials I will use and I denote by lambda k L the coefficient of all the polynomials where k is the total degree of the polynomial and l is the power of x. So now Of x. So now we want to know how to determine these polynomials. To do that, we replaced in our PDE the unknown by the function we want, and we replaced the coefficient kappa by its scalar expansion. After that, we identify coefficient degree by degree and we find a recurrence relation. So for this recurrence relation, So for this equilibrium solution, we have to fix for each degree two coefficients, the two first columns, and we compute all the other for inferior degrees and the Taylor expansion, like you said before. So this is just the initialization we choose for each kind of function. So for the amplitude base, we choose the first coefficient of degree zero Of degree 0 to 1 and the two column to 0. Then we, for the phase base, we choose the other one in order to mimic pane wave and all the other red dots to zero. And for the polynomial function, we choose one of the coefficients in the two first columns, we fix it to one. First column, we fix it to one and all the other to zero. And here is how we work the precursor. So, for every kind of function, we fix the first coefficient of our polynomial. For the order one, we fix the two coefficients. For the order two, we fix two first coefficients and we compute the other. And the same for all the order. We fix the order like that. like that. So to build one polynomial, we have to fix 2d plus 1 coefficients with d is the order of the polynomial. Each set of fixed coefficients give us one trust function, but we need a linearly independent trust function to construct the basis. So uh this is how we fix the initialization to build a basis. To build bases. So, the amplitude-based generalized plane waves and the phase base both mimic plane waves, which are the exact solution for the constant coefficient kappa. They are both characterized by a direction, so we choose this direction equi-reported on a circle, as many as we need. And the polynomial function, there is no more direction, so we just choose one by one. So we just use one by one the equation in the two first columns, one to one and all the others to zero. So here are my numerical results on this basis function. This is the numerical parameters I choose for this result. So we have a domain one by one. This is the variable coefficient in the Elmoltz equation. So we can see Equation. We can see it's constant near to the boundaries, but it's a variable in the center. The wave number is almost equal to 5 in all C domain. For the following, all my polynomials will be of degree 4, and we construct the basis function from a point in the variable domain. So this is an example of the generalized main wave. So all these numbers are the initialization of this function. We can see they have the same direction and they look very similar. And I write the polynomial we obtain in each case. So this is just the real part, but here we have the imaginary part and the modulus. And we can see And we can see it's close to one like plane waves. So it's what we want. After that, two examples of polynomial functions. So the first one is initialized with y squared equals to one and all the other functions computed. And the second one is initialized with is initialized with y cubed equals to one and all the other coefficients computed. So we want to know if this function are quasi-solution. So here we have the residual of this function in the PDE. So we see uh around the near to the middle the residual is equal to zero. Is equals to zero, is close to zero, so they are positive solution. And we see better here. This graph we have R, the distance between the center, and for each value of R, we take the maximum of the residual on a circle of previous R. And we have the order of the residual. So The residual. So, as we expect, we have polynomials of degree 4, so we want a residual of order 3, and this is what we have. We can see the phase-based and amplitude-based generalized plane waves are always very similar, and the polynomial seems to be a little better. So, it's very great. And the ongoing work. And the ongoing work. So now I'm implementing the solver with the variational formulation and with the basis function. We want to adapt it to higher-agnostic problems, so the first equation we saw. We want to extend this result to the three dimensions. And after all that, we expect to couple this method with boundary element method. That's it. Thank you. Okay, do we have any questions in the room or online? It's getting late for people in Europe, so thank you for sticking around. Thank you. I have a question about the coupling, about the future plans. Future plans. Okay. So I'm assuming that at a distance from the plane, you will consider that the coefficients are constant. That's why you want to have like an artificial interface around the plane. There you will do trafts and then on the exterior just all the coefficients are constant. Yes, is that and the trust will be very close to the plane. Thank you. So it concerns just the previous slide, I think. No, yeah, this one. So the order of the same in the three methods, but the constant is very much in favor of the polynomial method. So, okay, the put the put an explanation of a scenario. An explanation or a scenario: What can be the reason why the polynomial is so much better on the other part? For the moment, I think the polynomials have a smaller value. So we compared the two phase, the two generalized phen waves with the same direction, but the polynomial we could have from. We could have compared with one other. I take one randomly, but we have if we compare with the polynomial initialized with the equation one, I think it will be a little higher. It's an absolute error, maybe if we had the relative error. It's not the relative error. Here, I just want to see. Here I just want to see the order. So it's not a relative error. It's just the residual. Yes. Ah, the residual. Yes. It's not the error of the function. Okay, so it's not the end of the story. Yes, exactly. So we will wait for the next conference. Do we have any further questions? I don't see any hand raised online, so I think we should thank our speaker again and head out to lunch.
