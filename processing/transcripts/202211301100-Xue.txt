who will give us the second lecture on comology of stack of circuits. Thank you very much for introduction. So today we will last yesterday we have defined a static austukas and their cohomology. homology. Today we will define the Hacker operator, the partial Fourier smoothies and see how we can use June Field's lemma to get the action of the I copy of the function field. So let's begin by some reminder. Yesterday we have defined a stack of Stukas with iPod. A stack of stukas with i pause. So i is a finite set of an element. We note yesterday we noted sheet i. In fact, I cheat a little and this is the semphinist notation I use, but usually in the literature and the stack I defined yesterday is not has some decor decoration on the app it's not this and for the moment where you For the moment, we use this notation and I will explain in some page that it doesn't matter which one we use. So this is the that I defined yesterday, but today I read some decoration. It's a stack that's the ice point in the group point. In the following data, we have In the following data, we have a triple of point, ice point of the curve, and a chain of G bundles over X times I when some modification between them. And the first modification is outside the first like, second modification is outside the second like. The last one is the image, inverse image of Fubinius movies of the first. Of Fupinus movies of the first one. Fupinus is on ice. In fact, so this is a stack of shtuka with an intermediate modification. We can also define a stack of stukas without intermediate modification. So usually the notation is like this. This classify n-triple of x. triple of x and triple of point as before but only one g bundle on x times i and the modification is outside all the legs outside the union of graph of all the legs we have a map between these two and stuka so this is stuka with intermediate modification and we say last day and this is the stack today and this is the stack of Shiduka without the middle mode in intermediate modification and the map is just we forgot the this G1 G minus one we only keep the first one G0 and the last one the inverse image of Fubinus of G0 and the the map the dotted map The dotted map is just the composition of this file one, file two, file n. So that's a map. And we have and in fact, on each of these stacks, we have a Z shift comes from geometric Zeta K equivalence. Equivalence. So recall that yesterday we saw that our stack of Stuka has a map to the quotient stack, which is a quotient by the Beninson-June field Afang-Grossmannian over XI, quotient by the blobo family of the loop group over Xi. And the map is restricted, the restriction will restrict the chain. We restrict the chain of modification on the formal neighborhood of the graphs of all the legs. And on this stack, by geometric settle K equivalence, we have a set of K shift. And the map each term is formally smooth. We define the canonical shift on Stuka as the inverse image of this dachi shift. And we consider the cohomology of this shift. In fact, the geometric set of K equivalence. In fact, the Penningson-June field, affin Grace Manny, there are also the version with intermediate modification, as we saw yesterday, and the version without intermediate modification. So the map is similar of this one. We just forgot the intermediate modification. intermediate modification and the SADA K map is the form of the geometric SADA K is the for each W representation of I copy of G height we have a SATA K shift on this one and we have a SATA K-shift on this one and the relation between them is that the direct image of this one is this one is equal to the the one the this one and because this map in fact because this map is a is small and the fiber is semi-small so this is we can use this as a part of the statement of the geometric set of equivalence the So, what's this give us? So, by base change, for the canonical shifts on stack of two casts, we also have this relation. The direct image of the upper one is isomorphic to the lower one. So, when we define the cohomology, Defined the cohomology. The cohomology is a direct image of the canonical shift to x times i and to x power i, the i copy of the curve. So we have shift here, we have shift here. We define cohomology by in direct image by this one or this one. Finally, they give the same things. The cohomology is. The co-homology is we can define either by this or by this. So that's why. So to define the co-homology, it's no matter we use which stack of shtuka, the one with intermediate modification or not. The reason that we but why we don't only introduce this toka, which seems This Stuka, which seems simple. The reason that we need the Stuka with intermediate modification is to define the partial Fubinus more face mode. So now I explain what are the patio for morphism. So let's first consider the following map. So let's first consider what happens on the eye copy of the curve. On eye copy of the curve, we can have we have the total for We have the total Fobenus because Xi is over FQ, but we can also consider the Fobenus only for the first factor, which means that way for X for the first copy of curve, we use Fubinius, and for the other copy of the curve, it is identical. And so and now we consider what happens to the stack of Stukas. So that is what we have yesterday. The stack of Stuka classify a triple of point and the chain of modification G0 G. Of modification G0, G1, and last one is to G0. We sent it to another stack of Stuka, which is almost the same one, also have eye legs, just the order is different. And we send this stuka to the following one. So the We keep this part, we keep the g1 to g2 to g n minus 1 until to g0. So this part we didn't change. So this part when f2 until phase n, f2 until fit n, this part we don't change. What is changed is these things. So the modification from g0 to g1, which is given by To G1, which is given by F1. We send it to Fobenus of this, which means Fobenus of G0 to Fubenus of G1, and the map is given by Fobenus of the 51. And we have a chance to put this part, collect this part to our chain because this chain is ended by is unded by the forbiddenness of G0. This chain is ended by Tau G0. So we can put toe G1 just we can put the Fubinus of this part just behind this. Now we get a new stuka. So the modification is that first wave make a modification on the second Modification on the second light, then third light on the nth light. At the end, we make a modification at the first light. So the point we send this to this point because the modification of because the toe F1 is a isomorphism outside the graph of Fubinus of Fubinus X1. X1. And the map of this vertical map is that we send the entriple to the so this is Stuka over XI. So that is what we call for one because we make forbidden for. Make Fobinus only for the first modification. Similarly, we can define Fobinus for the second modification. So we can put something here. And we send this one to the same thing, but we put F2 to Fubinus or V2 at the end. Like this, we define Fubinus 2. So similarly, we can define the Fubinish 2 until Fubinus 1. By definition, the composition of this forbiddenness map is the total forbiddenness of Shtuka, which means that we send the Shtuka to forbidness of everything. So the forbiddenness of this G0, G1, Toto is to G0, Tot, and at the end, it's two. We do two times. We do two times of beams. So, if you do this kind of operation, you get this one and the we can contract. So, that's what happened on the geometry. Geometry. Then we can contract a canonical morphism of the shift. So this is a canonical Zadak shift on this stack. And this is a canonical ZADAK shift on this stack. And the inverse image by for one of this shift, we can count. This shift, we can contract a kind of isomorphism with this one. And this isomorphism induce a morphism of the cohomology shift. Here we use what we have in the last slide: the cohomology. So this stack. So, this stack of Stuka, they defend the same cohomology because the cohomology can depend on the intermediate modification. So, this and this, they both give this hash EDWV and like this, we get a fashion. The partial footprint is more basic for an you turn on the cohomology shift. The composition of this partial Fubenus morphism are the total Fubenius morphism on the cohomology sheet. The total Fubenus is just because it's XI over IQ. And the name partial for Benis comes from this, which means that we want to catch the total forbidden part. So here is on the whole space of cohomology shift. Yesterday we saw that is the union of W is the union of IW smaller than mu by the pattern hash man stratification. I forgot to write this. And what Python that they partial for binis, they send a smaller mean piece to a slightly bigger pieces. So the patch of food, it doesn't preserve the The ash smaller than you. So, if you recall yesterday's lecture, so the ash IW is an adaptive limit of ash IW smaller than mu. Mu are the dominant COVID of the group. Hello Think I have a problem information. Have lost your screen? Your screen was frozen for about 10 seconds. Sorry, I think my internet is not very stable. Yes, we are stopping here. So that's what cash for being is more risky for the Uh nah translation. Now let's look at the hiker operator. Yes, we I think that we lost you again. Yeah, we cannot hear you right now. Perhaps my computer has a problem. Now let's look at the high curve operator. Let V be a place of the curve and let lambda be a dominant co-width of the group G. Weight of the group G. So let lambda be a dominant co-width of the group G. We can contract a correspondence between stack of Stuka outside the point V. So, what is this stack? The gamma lambda, the S point, is the group point. point is the group point classifying following data so we have n triple of point but this time they are as point of x minus v so they they can't be at v and under the top line we have a stuka g0 to dou g0 the modification are the phi is isomorphism outside Is the isomorphism outside the union of graph of the legs. And on the lower line, we have another struka. The modification are also outside the legs xi, unit of legs xi. And between g0 and g0 prime, oh, I forgot to say g0 and g0 prime are two g bundles over x times i. And what is the my alpha? And what is my alpha zero? It is an isomorphism outside the point V. So the modification phi is the isomorphism outside the Xi and modification alpha zero is isomorphism outside V. So they are different and X is different. So V and we have And we have modifications on XI for the horizontal line and modification on V for vertical line. And we give some bounded on the modification on alpha 0. The bound is given by lambda. We say that's the relative position of G0 and G prime. G0 prime on V is given by lambda. Concretely, this means that this means that so locally on v so let's consider alpha on the for each geometric point of i so we have the alpha is this and on the it's we can then restrict it to the formal disk on V and it is an isomorphism on the punctured disk so it is isomorphism outside the point V. Isomorphism outside the point V. This isomorphism is the determinant, it determines an element in G F point of G. So F is a fraction field of the complex local ring of the curve at V. And since we can have different tribalization of G0 and G0 prime of the formal disk, it's an element in the So it's an element in the double quotient. And this element will ask that it is exactly given by this double coset given by lambda. So this omega is a uniformizer. So that is the condition of alpha zero the map. My long gamma to the to Stuka in that we send this we send this one to the the projective one is send this to the upper line this note that's the X I X N they are outside V so it's a Stuka So it's a Stuka and restricted to the eye copy of the curve outside width. And projective two, we send it to the lower line. So between this one. This gives a correspondence between this stack of between the stack of Stuka. What it do on the now we want to get correspondence for the Correspondence for the cohomology. So let's look at what this does on the shift. Note that both we can complete this diagram by send everything to the Benin Central Field App and Grassmanu. The map is that way, we just check it to the form of neighborhood. form of neighborhood of xi but note that the alpha is modification around v so it is isomorphic outside v in particular it is isomorphism on the formal neighborhood of xi because xi they are outside v so this one and this one they have the same image in this quotient And over shift, the shift F is the inverse image of the SADAK shift on this quotient. So the inverse image of the shift on gamma lambda by definition equal to this, but the diagram commute, so it's equal to this, it's equal to this. It's equal to this. So we get a map between the inverse image of Xi Khayer and inverse image of Xi Khaya. By the standard position of co-homological correspondence, which means that we consider diagram or I copy of X minus V. I forgot to say that by definition, projective one, projective. Projective one, projective two, they are both finite accounts. So our cohomology shift restricts to this outside V copy. So by definition is this and by the adjunction map sent to this. Then PR1 is finite, so it pop with. We can change this star to this shrink. And this is this map, the map star. We put it here. And we can change the star to shrink because it's eta. And then by the commute of the diagram of each commute, so we can change this to this. To this, and then we use the co-unit map, send this to this one, so we get a map between the co-homology. And this is a hike operator associated to the character, characteristic function associated to long term. Sorry, it's not it's not free. So this is the Heichel. So, this is the Hike operator associated to Longta and in general for every function in the local Heicha algebra. So, and the local Heicha algebra, because that is the uncontinuous function with compact support on this double coset. Say for every function we can have we can define a hike operator so they are defined outside the point V. We can look at some decoration. So that's what it's doing on the Hada national truncation. It does not fix the Hada national truncation. And what we will what we interest interest as a as a high co-operator associated to a by the saddle k isomorphism to a representation so for any representation of g height by satak isomorphism we have a function on the local heicha algebra and we will see we will use this high Use this I calculate later. Another problem is in the for the similar or relative case, we want to extend our height operator on the place we and for this we use a special case of excursion operators so that that's what I will come on so steer late weight. So steal that y of x and take a representation of g height and let delta v be this canonical map and we can define data v so the creation operator it comes from Comes from so this is constant shift on V tensor with HIW, which is on Xi. This is isomorphic to the forka with I union zero light for this light. We put we put a trivial. We put a trivial representation. So this means trivial representation. So the cohomology, if you have a trigger representation for some light, it's restrict to any point with the constant shift. And then we use the functoriality. So, yesterday we saw that the SEDAKE geometric SEDAKE equivalent is functorial on W. So, this map by reality gives a map between the Sadaki shift, then gives a map between the canonical. some map between the canonical shift and stuka and that gave some map between the cohomology shift so this is introduced by this map and then by fusion so this also comes from geometric seduction equivalence on seductive shifts that i didn't explain so i didn't explain. So I just tell you what is the property we use here. So Stuka with two legs, when the with two legs with representation, V times V due. I forgot to say V, V star means the dual of the representation. It doesn't make. So for here, so theta is. So, delta is the diagonal map of the curve in two copies of it. And the cohomology of also when two legs restrict to the diagonal is isomorphic to the cohomology when one legs but the implantation becomes a tensor. become the tensor tensor representation so when we look at the fusion it has nothing to do with i and w it's just about the first and second leg i should let it separate So the fusion is just about first and second leg. When we restrict this cohomology on the diagonal, these two legs, fusion to one light, and the representation becomes the tension of the representation. So by this isomorphism, we arrive to the restriction of the Restriction of the cohomology when the and I restrict on the diagonal for V and the I is always on X I so the I part is always on X I we do nothing on it we what we do is just we we begin from one leg and we use And we use functorienti to put this representation, send this representation to this representation. And we use fusion to create two legs, but we can only stay on the diagonal. So that's why it's called create operator because we create two legs on the diagonal. Then we have the Then we have the annulation operator associated to the evaluation mic. So let this be the evaluation mic. The annihilation operator is given is the inverse direction of this way comes from the We come from the to homology with two legs restricted to the diagonal, use fusion. It's isomorphic to Schtuka with one leg and the plantation with the central one. And then we send it to this co-homology shift by the function and by the evaluation mic. And this is equal to the constant. Constant shift on V I the I W part is I W so here is two special case of creation and emulation operator associated to Delta V and evaluation V. And in fact, we can have other creation operator. Other creation operator or animation operator. If we give other maps here, we can get different operator here. So that's why I put this antex. You can replace this antex by other any other maps. And use this, we can construct a special case of. A special case of excursion operator associated to the place small v and the representation of g-height bigger v. composition. So we began from this, v times xi and use creation operator. We create two legs on data v Only for the first light and not that the partial for Benis Morphis, it changed V to forb V. But if we apply a degree V times, it will find V. So that's why they are your degree. Less wider your degree. So after the partial forgiveness map on the first like V, we still in the diagonal of V. And then we use animation map to cancel these two legs. And we get this, we define HIW. Then we can Then we can verify that this computation commute with the Galois group on V. So then we can do this map to map of HIW over XI so and here I add some decoration. It's true with lots of decoration. And if we want to know what it happened, what it does on the Hada Nahashma truncation, so it's send this piece to a bigger one. And the relation with the Hiker operator is that this operator I, which is the morphist of shifts over Xi. Of shifts over xi, it extends the high co-operator associated to the associated to this representation on this case by settle-smorphase. The Heichel operator is only defined on X minus V, copy of X minus V, and the S operator extended to XI. This is a very notable operation. Two population proved by the sound effort. Amazon, we have astro-shimura relation. So to state it So, in components, this Eischler-Schmurran relation that's the polynomial about partial for B-Nis with coefficient in Heicha operator or the extended Heicha operator, we have a polynomial gay which is the zero in the The own space of the cohomology concretely. So we write the I. So for each element in I, we have a cancellation of polynomial for partial for venous I. So we can consider for each i, we have these things. have these things we write the the set of uh so we write the set i and the the one we consider and the best part and representation for i we have a w i and the other part would put some w0 and then we have a polynomial which is zero so it's a polynomial for the partial for benefits for the partial Fobinus morphist on the left I and the coefficient is the S operator for this representation on place V and this this operator of the cohomology I and shift H I W restricted so for the like I and restricted to smaller V and for the other like Smaller width, and for the other legs, it can be three eggs. So, this is the and the combination of this population and this one is what we call Eischler-Schmurla relations. So So for the ice like, we have this relation for the operator of V. Then we will see how these relations apply a finiteness property of the Property of the cohomology immediate so the problem is that recall that yesterday so today we saw that on this cohomology we have a hyperaction but the hyperaction doesn't. But I I could actually add this back to the added ashram location. So again, you're back again. There were a few, a little bit. Sorry for this. So a little bit, just a little bit. I will state the financial property and then show you how we use this property and. How we use this property and Trinfield's lemma to guide the action of the Galois group of the function field. So the properties say that, so now we consider cohomology group, which is the restriction of cohomology shift on the geometric generic point of I copy of the curve. The population says that this is an increasing union of QL sub-vector. Of QL sub-vector space, and these sub-vector spaces are stable under the action of partial components morphism. And for M, there exists a family of clue points VI, so this depends on M, such that M is stable under action of this product of local Hiker algebra. Product of local Heiker algebra. So this is the local Heiker algebra. M is stable and the action of this, and M is of a net type as module of the product of Heike algebra. So we get something, I am stable, which have partial Fourius morphis, and which is finite type over some alpha. And how to get this. So we use so I can even write down what are these M for each mu dominant COVID with smaller than mu. Menu and wait. So, how to choose this? We choose an omega open-tance subscheme of XI such that this the restriction is a nice shift. So H I w small than mu, it is a QL construct for shift or X I and it is this. I and it means on some open subscriptions. So it shows some open screen where it means, and we take a point on this open subscribe. And the VI is just its projection of each copy. We have this piece. We act by all the partial for Venice movies. A partial for Venice movies are all the legs and with all the degree possible degree. So an eye there can be anything. And then we act by the local hacker algebra on this alt VI. What we will do is write a To the fiber on V because it's it is it is missed, so we bring it on V and on place V we have the isolation relations. It tells us that this sun in fact is not infinitely this infinite sun in fact is overall finite money because finite money because they otherwise they are canceled when degree when the alpha is bigger it it can be it is already in in the in this one so this standard argument by isolationuralization tells us that in fact Tell us that, in fact, we have a finite sign. So that explains how to view this, how to say this is a finite type or this hyper-F graph model, because here there are only finite thing. Finite thing so that is operation, and now we explain the June first language recall our situation. So we have So we have an eye copy of the curve, the generic point and geometric point over it. We have a computative diagram. So the lower, the upper line is an exact sequence. So we have the V group of eta i. So V group is the V group in the pi one of eta i, which is in. which is inverse image of Z in Z height and geometric part. And the lower line, we have eye copy of the exact sequence given by each X. So for each X we have this and we have I copy of this. We have a map from this V group to the I copy of V group. To the eye copy of the group of data, but this is not isomorphic, but evidently we say immediately that on the upper line, so for xi, we have only one copy of that, but for i times, but lower, we have an i copy of that and over cohomology. And our cohomology shift, HIW, for the moment it has an action of this one. We want to relate to an action of this one. The idea of transfer lemma is that action of V group of eta i plus partial Fouquet smofism give you an action of I copy of this because the partial Because the partial for Benis morphes, they complete this part. It turns off, they give complex this, they give you eye copy of that concretely. It is like this. We define an F V group which incorporates the action of partial Fouquenis morphism. So the F V group is defined like V group is defined like this. It's an element in the automorphism of your FI bar. So FI bar is this closure of oxygen field of I copy curve. Satellite, the restriction on the perfection of FI is a product of partial for. Product of partial forinous morphism. So we have this commutative diagram. So first we have an exact sequence about this group. This F V group, so F means for behind V group, by definition, it sent to I copy of Z. To eye copy of that, the variable is we send it to the partial for benefits. So this is the upper line is about SV group. We have a commutative diagram. The lower line are I copy of the V group. The V group of eta. So the low overline is the same as before, but for the upper line, we put partial for benefits inside. And to infuse lemma, say that a continuous action of F V on a finite dimensional QL vector space factorized through Factorized through this eye copy of Bay Eta So if we have a so uh but this lamp work only uh But we need some finiteness condition. It's not true on any if you take any infinite dimension QIL vector space, it's not true. However, there is a variant which is true, is that if you consider A finite generated QL algebra and I'm a module of finite type, then Of finite type, the continuous action of F V vectorized by I copy of the V and this is exactly our case. So we call that by the finiteness result, the H I W strict to generate point, is a union of QL. Of QL vector subspace Mu. Each Mu is stable under the action of partial Fogenous Morphis. And by definition, we have an action of the pi one of the generic point. So this and this, by definition of the V group, means we have an action of the means we have an action of the S V group. And then we can apply this Schoenfeld lemma to the space Mu. We just take A to be the product of local Heicha algebra, which are finite general to be this space. Fortunately, this space is a finite type over the high. A finite type over the Haiker algebra. So we can apply this variant of Brunfield's lemma to each m mu and get an action of I copy of the V group on each mu. And in this way, we get an action of I copy of V group on the cohomology group. And remarked in that way, we can't directly apply infused length on your co-homology group because a pure ray infinite dimensional QL of the pro space. So we need to, we need we need to write it. We need some financial. Some finite nice result will apply use to translate. So, in this way, now this cohomology group has an action of the weight group of the function, I copy of weight group of the function field. And so this is about today's lecture. Uh, today's lecture. Next time, we will see that how this. So, there are many applications of this action. In tomorrow's lecture, we will see how this applies to the co-homology shift is smooth or I copy of the curve and also use this. Yeah, and you will also need this actually in my summer folks talk tomorrow. He will use this to contrast the excretion ability. So that's all about today. Are there any questions or comments? So there is a question in the show. Can you make your slides available? So, any further questions? I did not. Oh, that's a question. I was just curious to see again how is the tensor part constructed on the two-legged stuka with as opposed to the one-legged oh, it's a fog um It's a hot higher tensor product on the right so here you have what Have so let's forgot the I and W and this one forgot all the I and W. So here we have a cohomology of Stuka with two legs, one and two. For the first leg, we give a representation W. For the second leg, we give a representation W due. So this is This is the representation of g height times g height because we have two legs. So, this representation of g height times g height. The things is that when we restrict this on the diagonal of x times x, it's isomorphic to the cohomology of Stuka with one legs on diagonal and the diagonal and the representation become the representation for this lag so it's a representation of geop height become become the tension product of this another this comes from the geometric set equivalence the Of the factorization structures in the geometric set decay equivalent. In fact, you have already similar field up and quasmi with two light. Grossman with two legs and the statate shifts, which is given by W or by the V and V. So this comes from geometric static equivalence, and there is a statement about the SATAK issues. Yes, thank you. There are other questions, the comments. No, we thank the speaker again. They're looking forward to
