For the introduction, and thank you to the organizers for this opportunity, and thank you to all of you for being here. So, the aim of this talk is talking about the analytic environment of separatrices of the critical volume, as more or less as the talk, Jessica's talk. But for this, I'm going to I am going to start talking about the analytic classification of plain branch. This is a well-known topic. And after that, I am going to state the problem that I interest. Okay, so let's start with C of plane branch. This is the sterile locus of an element of this. An element of this an element of this ring is series convergent series power ring with f zero equal to zero and irreducible. Okay, so we say let's see and and the plain branches Branches. And we say that there are analytical equivalent if C and D are analytical equivalent if there exists a biomorphism from a neighborhood to the origin in C two such that Such that one of the branches is the other on the ridge. Okay? So, well, this in a remark, if in this definition we consider H as homeomorphism, we recover the notion of equisingularity and the equisingularity is characterized by the Puce pair, the semi-group, The semi-group, the dual graph of resolution. And from now on, we are considering only branches with a unique quizzer. Okay, with a unique quiz. And in this case, the semi-group is given by is generated over the integers with n greater than one and n greater than n, and the greatest common. The greatest common revisor equal one. Okay? So, well, the modeling problem for prime branch was stated by Zardiski in the 1960s. And the idea is fix an eccisingulatic class, study the analytic classes, okay, of this ekisingular class. So it's possible to study this. It's possible to store this problem in terms of the parametrization of the branches. So we have that two analytic branches, two branches are analytically equivalent if and only if their parameterizations are equivalent. So, this means that there exists a biolomorphism H and automorphism tau such that the parameterization satisfies this relation. Okay. So, with this, here is a unique result there, or all of the curves have. pair or all of the curves have in the same we saw pair all the branches have the same same all the branches have with a unique and the same and same yes and same same same okay yes so um but with with this area equivalence are this scheme equivalence scheme gives gave criteria to to give a parametrization find a parametrization simpler than one that means that the new parametrization has less terms okay so let's assume that the parametrization the parametrization of the curve is given by this By this form, okay. Okay, so Sariski proved the following. So if these are the criterias of elimination and are the following if the If the k belongs to the semi-group, so then the parametrization is equivalent to a new parametrization with a k equal to zero. And if k does not belong to the semigroup, but satisfies this property, k plus n minus m is only in the generator m. Then also can be eliminated the term AK. So well, with these two criteria, Sariski cables, the following theorem. So Zariski proved that the parametrization of a branch is A equal. Is A equivalent to a parameterization given by this form T n plus T n T M plus M where see Is the conductor of the symbol? Okay, so and in some cases we have in some cases we have that this parameterization is even simpler. So in some cases The parametrization is given by Pn Pm. Okay? In this case, we say that the curve is n quasi-homogeneous. Okay? But in other cases, it's possible that the parametrization have the following form. Have the following form. But let me let me write this here. Now, in then, in other cases, it's possible that this parametrization is in this form. With okay, this is equation number one. So, where lambda obviously. That obviously does belong to the semi-group, does not belong, and also don't satisfy the second. This lambda is an analytic invariant of the branch, and lambda is an analytic invariant called the Sarisk invariant. These are the schemers. So with this invariance, I just introduce another criterion that is the following. If k is greater than lambda and k minus lambda is in the semi-group. Minus lambda is in the semi-group, then also you can eliminate this term. Okay, yes. So with these three criteria, Zariski gave a description of many equi-singularity classes, but the problem remains open until 2011. When Abramo Efes and Marcelo Escude Hernandez give a solution of the mobility problem. So they introduce a set. So they introduce the following sequence. They introduced the following segment. So, we have an application. Sorry, sorry. An important remark here. So, it's important this remark, remark. So, if we consider the holomorphic one form given by my dx minus minus n x dy. And x dy, and we compute the pullback under the parametrization of this volomorphic one form. This is a one form in one variable, in the variable t. So we compute the order of this of this series and we have the following relation: the order plus one minus n is this Sariskin variant, okay? Sariskin variant. Okay? So in the solution of the moduli problem, they introduce the following set. We consider the holomorphic one forms and we define an application to the integer number given by the following rule. So we take a holomorphic one form and we associate this. And we associate this number. That is, you compute the pullback of the holomorphic one form, take the order plus one. So that's the number. And we have with this application a set that is given by take all the holomorphic band forms. forms okay and this is a set what is the what are the properties of this set well first the semigroup of the curve minus zero is contained in this semi in this set sorry and Zariski proved that when the equality holds The equality holds if and only if the curve is N M quasi-moj. Okay. Yes? It's the simplest one analytic. It's the simplest analytic type, okay, in the simulator class. But if it's really quasi homogeneous or if it's analytically analytic analytic. Yes. Yes. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Okay. And so the theorem of Abramo and Marcelo is the following. So the theorem is the following. So let's see a branch in the equi-singularity class NM. Singularity class nm and let phi parametrization with set with the set lambda. Okay? Then the parametrization is equivalent to this one, the simplest one. The simplest one, or is equivalent to a parametrization given by the following form, t n t n plus t lambda plus j greater than lambda a j j where sorry sorry j minus n does belong to the set lambda. To the set lambda and j greater than okay, so the terms that appear in this part are the elements that belongs to the set, okay. And also they prove that if you have two parametrizations with the same lambda set, the parameter The parametrizations are equivalent if and only if there exists a complex number, different zero, such that lambda minus n is equal to one and the coefficient a r. The coefficient Ai is equal to R i minus lambda A prime, where A and A prime are the coefficients of the parameterization in their normal forms, okay? In this form, yes? So Okay, um okay so now I'm I'm going to talk about the foliation and the problem that I am interested in. Okay, so I'm going to Well, I'm going to take the volition given by the holomorphic one for omega one. So let's consider the volunteeration F. The foliation f given by this F1 given by omega 1 my dx minus n x py. So if you want, you can think in the same way as Jessica. You can think in the holomorphic vector field and x partial x plus m y partial y Parcel y and you can think in the ordinary differential equation and the solution of this ordinary differential equation. And this give us a partition of a neighborhood of the origin. So note that the origin is a singular point for this variation. And in this specific case, we have the following. So in this specific way, we have the following. So if you consider have the following so if you consider well this is a a real picture okay so you have the volume the origin and you have the the foliation the So you take the singularization of this volation, and this is given by the Euclidean algorithm between the pair N and M. So you consider the singularization and we have the following. So we have a chain of exceptional divisors and we have We have a special one. So, this special one has the following property. I call this the decritical component. So, all the leaves, we compute the singularization. We have a new fallation in this new space. And all the leaves of the fallation cut transversally this is the critical component. Okay, so we have here the strict transform. Here, the strict transform of the leaves. Okay, so and in this case, when you project these leaves to the origin, we have the separatrices of the foliation. So, in this case, I call to this package the non-isolated separate resistance, okay? Yes? And in this specific case, we have that the separatrices are given by this equation. So in this case, the separators are given by this equation, this simple equation. Okay? With K in C star. In C star. All these curves belong to the equisingularity class given by the pair n and n. Yes, I have in the case when s n is greater than 1 and m is greater than n, and the greatest common divisor is equal 1. Okay? So, and in this case, this specific case, all the Case, this specific case, all the curves are analytical equivalent. So, in that case, all the curves are Are analytically equivalent to the special one. Okay, are analytical equivalent to this one. So what's the problem? First, I'm going to introduce a family of poliations. Okay, so first, I'm going to introduce letters. I'm going to introduce let and let the family the family of cuspidal foliations are the foliations are the foliations that are. Are the foliations that are analytically equivalent? To be given by by this form. Okay? That are the family of cuspid afoliation, not afoliation. Family of cuspida foliation, or the foliation, all the foliation that are analytical equivalent to this one. So under analytic change, we have that image. Okay, so and I'm going to introduce another family, the family observed husbandal the critical foliations that are foliations. With the following properties. When we consider the strict transform defoliation defoliation by P. By P. Now I'm going to explain what is pi, sorry. So the poliation by pi, we have the strict transform poliation, we have at the critical component in the labs divisor. And there are there are not and there are not singular neither tangency points in that component. So, what is pi? So, in this case, I say that the designularization is given by a composition of finite sequence blowing of p is a pi, sorry, pi is a composition of finite blobinops, and this is determined by this pair, okay? This pair, okay? So in this case, there is pi. So I'm saying that when you consider the foliation and you take the strict transform by pi, obtain in a similar way to this case, the critical component and disappear in the last exceptional device. Okay. So and when you project the foliation, you obtain separatrices that are non-isolated separatris. non-isolated separatris and also and that separatrices are in this equi-singularity class okay the separatrices are in this echi singularity class so what's what is the problem so the problem is the following So, the problem is the following. So, what can be said about the lambda set for all the non-isolated parts of the So I'm going to draw a picture. So we have this situation. We have the foliation, the pseudocuspidal foliation. You take the strict transform by pi. The strict transform by pi add and you have this paratrices. So all the separatrices are in that. All the separate traces are in that equi-singularity class. So the question is: what can say about this set for all the non-isolates purposes? Okay. This theorem says that if you have two parametrization with same set lambda, then for the analytic equivalent, you need this condition. So the first step to To want, if you want that the parameterization are A equivalent, you need first this set is the same. This is the first step. So that's the question in this case. So what can say about this set, about the Lambda set for all the non-isolated separators? Okay. Maybe a more simple question is. more simple question is what can say what can be said about the about the Sariskimberg this is the first okay yes that's the first question so for this For this So it is clear or yes, okay so I'm going to introduce a definition So let if yeah, please If the affoliation given by this solomorphic one form, and let's see the a plane branch. So we define the tangency order at the origin between the plane, between Between the branch C and the foliation F of the foliation F as the order of the pure back. So C is parameterized by VC and omega IC. Okay. So you take the generator of the validation, you take the pullback by the parameterization, and that's the tangent. And that's the tangency or so, another definition is the following. So, well, first I'm going to denote, sorry, E and the key singularity class Determined by N and M, okay, or the semi-group. Yes? So, definition. So, let C a branch in this singularity class and G be a good speed alfoliation. Cuspid afoliation that are analytically equivalent to this one. Okay. So we have that then we say, sorry, we say that the tangency order at the region between C and G is maximal. And G is maximal if for every G tilde till the cospital volation, we have that the tangent here at the origin between C and G is that is less than the tangent. Is less than the tangency, less or equal than the tangency order between c and g. Okay, so with this definition, we have the following results. So we characterize the stadisk invariant in terms of the maximality of that tangential. So we have the following theorem. So let's see in this equisingularity class and the acuspiration. So we have that. Then the following statement are Are equivalent are equivalent. So the first one is that the tangency order between C and G is finite and maximal. And number two, that the number Two, that the number the tangency order plus one minus n is the statistic invariant of C. Okay. So what is the problem? So the problem is we have an infinitely We have an infinitely many separates. So, if you want to know what is the analytic type, you need to compute the parametrization of all the separates and after apply the theorem of Marcel. So, it's complicated, no? Okay, so first. So now going to introduce the Jacobian course of polio. Let's finish. So let F and G And G volations of T2 and well, this is generated by omega F and this is generated by omega G. So we define the Jacobian curve, the Jacobian curve. This is a Kovian curve between F and G as the zero locus of this two form we compo we compute the wedge product this is a two form two uh holomorphic two form. Holomorphic to form. And the Jacobian curve is the locus zero of this coefficient. Okay, so this this Jacobian curve is the tangency, is the tangency locus between the politicians. So it's as Jessica says in his talk. Says in his talk. Okay, so an example. Well, maybe the example is better here. So, the example is the following. We consider Omega f given by dy minus 2x dx and omega g dy. Okay, if you compute the which product, we have that minus two two x dx, y which dy. Okay, so in this case, the Jacobian. So in this case, the Jacobian curve is x equal to zero. So a real picture, but so we have the publision f. F and yellow is the volume G so that the tangency points are x y x equal to zero is this line. Okay. Okay. So well So now I'm going to introduce An application, so definition. This is more general, but I'm going to fix this case, this specific case. So we consider why the sequence of flowing ups and let a dick a dick and irrelevant. Dig a dig an irreducible component of the exceptional divisor. This is the sequence of blowing up. It's just an irreducible component of this divisor. And we define an application from the holomorphic one forms integers, well positive integers in the following way. So In the following way. So, if we compute, if we take a holomorphic one form, the value associated to this holomorphic one form is the maximum of the case, the integers, positive integers, such that you take the total transform by p and you look at the irreducible component. So this. it so this can be written as x equal to zero x omega prime where the degree the irreducible component is given by x equals here is a local equation of the of the irreducible component so an example Let's do a example here. So if we consider this is an example, if we take the holomorphic one form read in Holomorphic one form read in this form almost as Jessica talk and we consider the blowing up of the origin So, if we compute the pullback of this holomorphic one form, we have and sorry, if we compute the value to this irreducible component, we have the following. The value is n if x X P N minus Y Q n is different from zero and n plus one if x minus y q n is identical zero. So in this case, it's not the QT case. For the first rowing up or dictity. Okay. So with this value, we have the following. So we have So we take a pseudocospidary critical solution. So this has paratrises. We compute the blowing up and we have The critical components. Okay, and we have so we consider one of the separatrices. This is the special one. The strict transfer by pi passes through a point P in the decritical component. So we have the other. The other separatist, and if we take, we have the following. So, this is the branch C. Okay. So, we have the following. So, this is the foliation F. So, let F be pseudocuspiral the critical. Cospiral the critical foliation and see the separatrix, non-isolate. So here is the strict transform of the curve C. So we have the following. And sorry, and let G via speed R1. So we have that the tangency order between C and G is given by the value in the critical component of these two forms. We take the wedge of the generator of the volition minus the value. minus the value of omega f plus the intersection multiplicity in the point P of the strict transport between C and the strict transport of the Jacobian curve. So we have that this tangency order is given by this formula. Okay? So and it Okay, so and it's important to note that if the strict transfer of the Jacobian curve does not cut this component, this value is equal to zero. Okay, that's important. Okay, here the first one is a two-form, and the other one is a one-form. Yes, this is two-form. One form. Yes, this is two forms. This is one form. You can extend this definition to two forms in the same way. You take a two form, you compute the pullback by pi, and you take an order in the similar way. Yes, yes, sorry. This is available for two forms and one form. Okay. So I'm going. So, I'm going to introduce a definition. So, we say that let F be a so there could be large critical variation. And so, we say that F has the polar transversality property. Transversality property: if for every spiral volation, we have that the Jacobian curve between the volations does not cast a branch. In the Eki singularity class. This is a curve. So this curve has many branches. So we say that the affoliation has the polar transversality property. If for every cuspid affoliation, the Jacobian curve does not have an element in this singularity class. Okay, so this implies. So this implies that this number is always zero because the strict transform of the branch has by this component and this is always zero and this implies that the value of the tangency order only depends of this difference. Okay, so finally, the theorem is the following. So we have say Say so we want to say something about the SARISC invariant of the isolated separate. So, this turn says the following. So, let F be a pseudocuspidal decritical variation with the polar transversality property and Then all the non-isolated separatrics have the same chariskin bar. Okay, so there are examples. Are examples, so I'm going to write one. We have the following example. So this is given by given by this holomorphic one form by five plus two x nine y nine. X nine y minus two x nine y two minus nine a y two y four p x minus four y t x three minus x ten plus two x ten y minus three x y. minus three x y x minus x y two so this is an example in the equi-singularity class given by nine part nine and this is a pseudo-cuspidal decritical volation all the separate the separatrices are given by this in this case In this case, this particular case are given by this equation. These are the separatrices of this volume. The separatric of this volation, and for k equal to one, we have an unisolated separatris with different sharing skin variant. Okay, so for k different to one, all the separatrices have the same sharing skin variant that is 10. And for k equal to 1, we have a separator with invariant 80. Variant. Okay, so well the next step is to study all the all the all the lambda set for all the non-isolated parties, but for this talk it's all. Thank you. Very nice from the topic is here.   Perturb that one to see what happens with this. So this one does not have this PTP property. Okay, okay. Right? Yes. And so, I mean, the other was like a general statement, but in particular, you have this example. Yes. And so one could think that perhaps if you perturb, if a perturbation Could be that all of them have 10, or some, or could that be? Well, you can make the perturbation, but I don't know what could be happening. I don't know if if if you perturb you obtain all with the same series invariant or not, this is a good question that I I don't know the answer. I don't know the answer. I guess this Arisky invariant is like upper semi-continuous or something, no? Like, like there, it was 10 generic, and then it goes 19. And so general perturbation would be that you lose the 19 or you maintain 19. Is there some property of upper semi-continuity of the Zariski invariant? Well, Well, the question is: well, in the you have the singularity class, and the first analytic emergency is this SARISC, but I don't know if there is a upper semicontinuity in this of the SARISK. I don't know. Yes. And another question of a different type. Okay. A different type. Okay. So, so, so, so, you have these separate pieces passing through the origin, and then you were supposing that all of them are topologically equivalent to the homogeneous case. Now, could it be that you have one of these non-decritical foliations that have more than one puisope? More than one piece of pair? It's another case that I'm exploring. Yeah, when you have more pushboards. And it's... I mean, it could be possible. There is this possibility. I mean, it's not that for some reason you only have one piece of pair. That's a hypothesis you put from the beginning. but but you can study with more pieces and and maybe you have maybe but you can have a situation um that in some you have a tangent here and this is another analytic no with more pieces maybe but the generic one Thank you. But the generic one does the generic one have to have only one puissopair, or you can have a variation such that the generic one, the generic separator has more than one piece of pair, or the generic one always has one puzzle pair. I think that the generic only one piece of pair, but yes, I think only one piece of pair. Only one. Yes, yes. Yes, it is. Any other question, comment? Just a remark, maybe the Zaliski invariant is upper semicontinuous in the sense of the Turina number. If you perturb it, then the Turino number of the curve decreases in general, right? In this sense. Okay, okay. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Thank you. One little question. A classical invariant of one-dimensional holomorphic volations in dimension two is this Camacho Sal indices. Yes, yes, yes. They don't appear in this scenario. They appear, but in other exceptional devices, because this has. Because this has this critical collaboration, have another separate address in other places. So they're in that place are the Kamachosat. Okay. Okay, thank you. More questions? Comments? Online? No? Okay, so we think again, thank you.
