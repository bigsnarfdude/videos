Okay, let me start with the usual acknowledgments for the people who did all the work to set all this up. This is a fantastic group of people, and I'm really thrilled to be here this week and spend time with all of you guys. So, I'm going to talk about equivariant stable homotopy groups and various parts of this sort of large project. Of a large project are joint with other people, including Eva Belmont, Bertie Yu, Hannah Kong, Gojun Wong, and Joli Zhu. And I'll be more specific about that sort of thing as we go. Alright, so let's start off with some ground assumptions for the entire talk. I am thinking everything stably. I am working at P equals 2. I am suitably completing everything in sight so that all Everything in sight so that all the spectral sequences converge. There are different spectral sequences at different points, and so the completions that one has to take might not be necessarily obviously the same. And so there are some theorems to prove that certain types of completions of this are the same as certain types of completions of that, right? But I'm not going to get into any of those details. In the motivic cases that I'm talking about, I want to think about the cellular motivic. I want to think about the cellular motivic homotopy theory, which is the part of motivic homotopy theory that we algebraic topologists are comfortable with. Now, and that's good for the purposes of the sorts of things that we're talking about here today, but just to be fair, that is a damaging process. In particular, it sort of throws out most of the interesting algebraic geometry in motivic homotopy theory. If you want to study an elliptic curve, you can't just sort of work cellularly. You're going to throw out all the arithmetic. You're going to throw out all the arithmetic. And the only group that I'm going to be talking about is C2. Okay? So there's some of that. Okay, so in terms of the grading, everything I'm thinking, I'm very much taking the perspective, not the Machiefunctor perspective, but rather the real representation ring perspective. Okay, so my gratings are in the real representation ring, and I'll use this sort of motivically inspired notation PQ, right? So P is. Notation PQ, right? So P is the topological degree, like the dimension of the representation. Q is the weight, or the number of sine representations in your representation, and then there's also the complementary number of trivial representations, which nowadays we've been calling co-weight. And then that lines up everything, all the different categories. Alright, so yesterday Hanna wrote down this diagram of categories and functors. And this is kind of one of the, I would say this is sort of one of the main things. kind of one of the I would say this is sort of one of the main points of this talk is that we should be looking at all four of these homotopy theories R-motivic C motivic C2 equivariant and classical we should really be studying all four of these homotopy theories at the same time okay because they are informing on each other in various complicated ways that happen okay so in particular you know the spheres are sort of all compared You know, the spheres are sort of all compatible in this way, right? And that's why we choose these degrees, so everything kind of all lines up. And I'm just going to mention it here because I'm setting things, some background. I'm not going to talk about too many explicit maps, but I will talk about the map rho, which goes, well, stably, it's that, right? Equivarially, it's the inclusion of the fixed points into the sine representation circle. Motivically, it's the inclusion of plus or minus one into gene. Of plus or minus one into gm. And you know, and so there are motivic and C2 equivariant. And then again, they're compatible under this, right? You have a row here, and it maps to a row here. Later, I'm going to use the same element row when talking about it being in cohomology. And the point is that this map, row, induces multiplication by row in cohomology. So they're really the same thing. Okay? And some people might call rho A? Is it A or U? I can't. Okay, it's A. I come at this out of motivic homotopy theory, so I call it bro. All right, so full screen, though. You know what? I don't want to because I'm going to switch between different PDFs, and so it'll be easier for me to not have to leave it. Okay, I did think that through, but is there anything up there that's like compromising? Like up there? I just want to make sure there's nothing like, you know, there, that's embarrassing that you're seeing, because they're kind of okay. All right. Alright, so let's talk about where all these computations get started is with cohomology of a point and with the steam red algebra. So let's talk through some of this stuff. We have seen some of these formulas already over the last, well, this morning and yesterday as well. So first of all, classically, the Cohl-Algebra point is just F2, right? And the Steenward algebra has this description. Algebra has this description, or the dual Sewer algebra has this description. And I've written in a kind of a funny way here, right? Where I sort of have these polynomial taus, and then I throw in these polynomial X's, but then I immediately get rid of the polynomial X's, right? And so it's unnecessarily complicated, but the reason I do that is so that it aligns with the steamer algebra in the other contexts, right? This is a point that Bjorn was making this morning, I think. Okay, so in the singletific context, what you have, the What you have, the Commonwealth point is this F2 adjoin this parameter tau, right? And then the dual Steamroom algebra takes the same form, except now you've inserted this tau here, right? And that little wrinkle creates all kinds of interesting computational consequences down the line. So one thing that happens, right, if you invert tau, right, or set it equal to one, then you just recover the classical story. So if you make C motivate computations, you can then just simply invert tau and recover classical. Invert tau and recover classical computations from it. So tau has by degrees, zero minus one. Zero minus one. And I mean, I'm not talking about bi degrees here today, so explicitly. But yeah, it's zero minus one, but although that's, yeah. So the kind of the modern perspective on samotivic homotopy theory is that it is a deformation. Okay, we can think of it as a deformation with parameter tau. And the generic fiber, right? And the generic fiber, right, inverting tau, you get classical homotopy theory. But if you take the special fiber, you mod out by tau, you set tau equal to zero, what you get is something algebraic. You get BP star, the derived category of BP star BP co-modules. Okay, so this is a theorem of Gheorghe Wang and Zhu, that this really does happen. And I think this is sort of a powerful perspective that unifies a lot of the ideas and helps fit together the different players in seeing why things work a certain way. Players and seeing why things work a certain way. Okay? So, alright, so that's the semotivic category. And then we move on from there to the armotivic category. So now what happens here is we adjoin this other element rho that we've seen. Okay, and the other thing that happens in the dual service algebra is you get this relation, this is tau i squared equals tau xi plus 1 again. Then you have these other additional terms, these sort of look. Terms, these sort of look noisy-looking terms there that involve rows, right? And because that's what happens, and that's due, these computations are due to Vyvotsky. The other thing that happens armotivically is that the cohoduate point itself has steam run-up, supports non-zero steam run operations. In particular, square one of tau is rho. That's kind of like the fundamental thing. There are consequences of that, but that's kind of the key point is that square one of tau. And you can express that dually in terms of the right unit. The right unit, but that's all this is saying, is just that square root of tau is wrong. Okay. All right. And so from this perspective, what you're seeing here in these formulas is that the armotivic homotopy theory is, again, is a deformation with parameter rho. If you invert rho, what happens, and you kind of, you have to invert rho and you carry all these formulas and you do some computations. It's not immediately obvious, but if you invert rho, what comes out is classical again. Okay, so the generic. Again. Okay, so the generic flipper is classical again. But this time, what happens if you mod out by rho, if you set rho equal to zero, what you get is simultaneous homotopy theory. So if you invert rho, you also invert tau. Well, tau doesn't really... See, tau doesn't survive. Right? Tau is in cohomology, but it's not in homotopy. So inverting tau is a little bit subtle. I'll say something in a minute about a little bit more about that. When you modify rho, you get tau. Modify rho, you get tau. You don't have to modify rho. That's right. So when you modify rho, if you look at S mod rho modules, what you get is samotific homotopy. See, what's happening is tau is not surviving because it's killing something involving a rho. So if you set rho equal to zero, then it does survive. And so that's what, so that's, that's what I have. Okay? So this equivalence here, this is a result of Behrens and Shaw, and sort of independently myself, Kong Wong, and Zhu. Okay? All right. Okay? Alright, so there's more to say here about this. There's more to study here and understand about this one here, but maybe that's sort of a topic for a different talk. Okay, all right, so we're sort of working our way towards C2 equivariant homotopy through these other increasingly complicated situations. All right, so now when you pass to the C2 equivariant, right, what happens to the Colmodua point is you have this taus in. Of a point is you have this tiles and rows as before, right? And this is the same picture that Ahana had on her screen yesterday, right? You have these tiles and rows. Oh, well, it's not the same, right? I flipped it around, right? Because it's not, you know what? I've been saying the cohomology of a point, but look at my stars, right? It's the homology of a point, right? I'm doing everything, I want it to compute homotopy groups, so I want to grade everything homologically, right? So the so-called negative cone, right, is actually in positive. Is actually in positive degrees. But anyway, so there's, anyway, so this is the same picture, except I turned it upside down or rotated it. Anyway, so there's this extra negative cone. There's this infinitely divisible stuff up here, right? But the Steenrud algebra is really just tensored up from the R-motivic Steenrot algebra. And so this computation is for Hu and Crease. So in a sense, the sort of So in a sense, what's new here is this negative cone stuff, and the Steam Road algebra doesn't have anything kind of new about it particularly. Okay, so here's this remark about inverting tau. It's a little bit hard to make this statement precise. So this is maybe more of a slogan than a theorem. But if you take the armotivic category, and you invert tau, which, you know, tau's not really surviving there, so what you mean by that, you have to be careful, you ready like a row completion or something. To be careful, you need like a row completion or something. But if you invert tau in the R homotivic context, what comes out is C2 equivariant homotopic theory, okay? In some sort of slogan sense that Behrens and Shaw can make more precise at the cost of sort of being a little bit more complicated. And they've actually demonstrated that this perspective is good for computations. They can actually carry out some C2 equivariant computations using armotypic computations. Using armotypic computations as an input and then sort of doing some sort of, you know, something related to inverting tau. Okay. All right, and so I call this class gamma over tau. Other people call it theta, right? I just put that in there sort of for reference for people who, you know, know different notations. All right, so that's the starting point, right? All these C-word algebras and cohomology theories. And it doesn't really matter to me, you know. Matter to me, you know, the homotopical underpinnings of all these computations. If I have any homotopy category with these fundamental computations, then I can carry forward the computations further. And so I haven't talked at all about what motivic spectra are, right? Because it doesn't matter what motivic spectra are for this talk. What matters is these sort of computes, these steam-run algebra inputs. Okay. Alright, so what I do with these things, right, is carry out atom spectral sequence computations. Okay, so the classical and the semotivic computations, so the atom spectral sequences, those two atom spectral sequences, have been computed in a large range. So for today, we're going to take that kind of input as sort of given, as known, as sort of as, you know, and not completely known, but known as far as we sort of, you know. But known as far as we sort of, you know, for practical purposes, we sort of have that information. The armotivic category, the armotivic stable homotivic groups, have up ambiguity in a smaller range, still pretty big range, but in a smaller range, partly with Duggar and myself and partly with Belmont and myself. And let me say that this is just sort of like this 18 here. This is just kind of like the currently what I've actually done. There is a lot of room to extend these concepts. Of room to extend these computations. It just takes, someone has to, you know, decide to spend a year of their life kind of carrying these things forward. But this stuff is just sitting there waiting for someone to come along and just and simply compute out in a, and I hope a much larger range. But there's a lot of data that you have to sift through, and so it takes some time. Okay, so how does one, I don't want to dwell too much about armotivic computations today because this is supposed to be a Today, because this is supposed to be a C2 equivariant talk. But let me say a few things about how one goes about doing this. So, what you need to do is compute X over the R-motivic C-run algebra. And there's an algebraic Robolstein spectral sequence that allows you to do that. So it starts with C-motivic X, and then it converges to R-motivic X. And this is an idea that was originally due to Mike Hill. And this process, and then you know, this spectral sequence is only as good as the differentials that you can compute. And it turns out this is very computable. Like, shockingly so, you think, well, how are you going to get to it? It turns out you can just, like, there's combinatorial reasons why, you know, it's very rigid, okay? And you can produce huge quantities of data. And it's non-trivial, huge quantities of non-trivial data throughout that. And I'll show you a little bit about that. Throw off that. And I'll show you a little bit about that in a second. One of the, so I'm just kind of giving you some highlights of kind of like some of the key ideas. So this row boxing spectral sequence to get the E2 page of the antispectral sequence is a key idea. Another key idea is using this cofiber sequence involving rho and S mod rho. So when you apply homotopy groups, you get this long exact sequence in homotopy. But S mod rho, that's the same, this guy here, that's the same as the semotivic state of homotopy. As the semotivic state of homotypic groups. Okay? And so this sequence looks kind of just, you know, no big deal, harmless, right? It looks too formal to be very useful. But that's not the case. This thing ends up being surprisingly useful. You take, remember, this thing is known in a sense. And you take the computations here and you use these maps. You push forward, you pull back, and you can recover a lot of otherwise obscure-looking information about the arm octavic groups. About the arm octivic groups, about hidden row extensions, but also about other kinds of hidden extensions and differentials and things. It's kind of just that's the kind of when things. So, these are kind of like just two kind of highlights of what goes on in this. Okay, so I am a person, self-respecting person who does computations, isn't it, right? So I want to, so let's take a look at, you know. Too, so let's take a look at you know the point of this. I think of this, okay. The point of this, of course, is not that you will really get a huge amount of knowledge out of it, but this is more for cultural background, right? What I've given you is a, what I'm showing you here is a, as a part of the Adams E-Infinity page, okay? And this is in coate 15, okay? And I chose 15 because it's just sort of representative. 15 because it's just sort of representative. It has some interesting features. I have charts for lots of other co-weights as well. And so, co-weight, that means p minus q equals 15, right? So, pi 25 comma 10 is on here someplace and so forth. So, what you see is a lot of stuff here, right? And this whole pattern here, and this sort of a regular pattern, if you look at the upper edge, you see it's kind of following a regular pattern, and you look at the bottom edge, it's also kind of following a regular pattern, right? And this is all. Right, and this is all supposedly anyway, this is all like V1 periodic image of J kind of things. Although we don't have that's not meant to be a precise statement, it's just sort of obviously what's going on with all that stuff there. Once you, you know, kind of, and then you go further out, and then you start to see some more irregular things, right? And then there's these dashed lines or hidden extensions, and look at all these hidden extensions. I kind of like this little component here because it all fits together very nicely. It all fits together very nicely, but somehow in an obscure way. So, some of these red lines are row extensions, and the blue lines are H1 extensions, and the green lines are H0 extensions, right? That all fit together kind of interestingly. And you see lots of pictures like this all over the place when you carry out these computations. Okay, so that's what we know about armotivic stuff. Alright, so let's go back to this. Alright, so now let's jump to the C2 equivariant situation. Okay, so remember that the homology of a point is the aromotivic homology plus this negative cone. But this splitting actually happens as a co-modules. So that means that when you compute x, So that means that when you compute x'd, you can really kind of deal with these two things separately. And you get two, so your x groups end up, and you have to think that through and what that really means when you put things in, but what it ends up meaning is that the X groups split into, there's a piece of the C2 equivariant Adams E2 page that is the armotivic Adams E2 page. And then there's this other thing involving sort of X groups involving this negative cone, involving this infinitely divisible. cone involving this infinitely divisible stuff. Okay? So in order to get the atoms, the equivariant atoms YouTube page, you have to compute this, which kind of taking is known, right? And so you have to do some work to figure that out. So let me tell you a little bit about how you, so now we're in real, in actual equivariant territory here, not multi-fig background, right? So let me tell you a little more detail about how you go about doing this. So this thing is computable, again, by a Rho-Boxstein spectral sequence. By a row-box-9 spectral sequence. And these, sort of, like the details of this are in this paper by Guillhil and Ravenel that yesterday Hanna was calling G-H-I-R, right? It's that same paper. Okay, so, but the spectral sequence is a little bit funny, right? Because you have this infinitely rho-divisible thing, right? So when you filter by powers of rho, the filtration is sort of like it's a negative filtration rather than a positive filtration. But that doesn't really interfere. But that doesn't really interfere with anything. It's just you have to get used to that kind of thing. And then once you do that, then things start to work out. This Robachstein spectral sequence seems to be technically harder than the R-motific one. I was telling you earlier that the R-motific Robachstein spectral sequence was very rigid, and we can produce all kinds of computations without very much work. This seems to take more work, and I only know this just in a practical sense, having sat down to do it. It's just, it's harder, and it's slower, and it's more complicated. It's more complicated. Okay, so what that spectral sequence looks like? Well, it has an E1 page, right, that converges to X over N C. Okay, and fortunately, you could actually get a very good handle on what this E1 page looks like. So what you end up having to do when you carry through this filtration and you look at the filtration quotients and you write down all the algebraic definitions of things, what you get is you get a short exact sequence for the E1 page, the Robox dynamic. The E1 page, the Robachstein E1 page. It involves Tor, Tor 0 and Tor 1 of the semotivic X with this infinitely tau divisible module. This thing here is just a fancy name for a sequence of F2s that are sort of infinitely tau divisible. That's all I'm doing here. And the same thing here. This is just sort of a joining and making it infinitely row divisible. So you get this torr 0 and this Tor 1, and there's only Tor 0. This tor one, and there's only tor zero and tor one because this guy only has tor in those two dimensions, in those two dimensions, so that's why that's what's going on here. Okay, and so you can describe E1 and C from these two pieces, and we give these guys names just because we refer to them a lot, gamma and cubed, because that's just more or less arbitrary. Well, the gamma is kind of related to the gamma. Okay, so what all this means, so this is all fancy Tor language, right? But it means something much more concrete than that. Much more concrete than that. What it means is that there's two kinds of elements in this E1 page that you have to compute. First of all, you have sort of like these negative cone coefficients times x, where x is tau free. And you have to have x be tau free so that it shows up in torr 0. Okay? On torr 0. Then you also have elements and q is just kind of like a label that just doesn't need anything else, right? So you need just a descriptor. If you have tau to the This is a scriptor, right? If you have tau to the k torsion in xc, then it's going to come up, you're going to get some tor one when you compute, and so that's that qy arising from tor one. Okay, yeah? Can I ask an equal question? So the real conservative cohomology of a point is that simple as a co-module over the real module. It has, but it's not trivial. It has, so the co-module, the arbitrary co module, So the Comonj, the arbitrary commodity point has actually. Oh, I see, it's simple, yeah, it's simple. Yeah. Okay, so, alright, so the point of all this sort of, the story is that there's actually a very nice simple recipe for producing this Robloxstein E1 page from our knowledge of CMOTIVIC XT. Of C motivic X. It's very kind of mechanical. The E1 page, anyway, is very mechanical. Then computing Rho Bachstein differentials is not so mechanical. And there's some real work there, but at least you can get started. All right. And then again, the other thing that I would say about this is that, again, there's this Rho sequence, right? And the homotopy of the, the C2 equivariant homotopy of the cofiber of Rho is the classical homotopy tau periodicized. Homotopy, tau periodicized. Okay, and that just comes from the geometric description. If you look at what the cofiber of rho is, it's something involving C2, and so there's some forgetful functor that's an isomorphism. Anyway, you have this long exact sequence involving rho multiplications and also classical homotopy groups, right? And the upshot of this is that if you have a C2 equivariant homotopy class, its underlying class is zero if and only if alpha is a multiple of rho. Alpha is a multiple of rho. And so that tells you you can very easily, this is sort of an important fact that again is surprisingly useful. All right, so let's take a look at, I'm going to show you some charts involving all this stuff to give you a sense of how this goes. So the first thing that I want to show you is something that we call the Bradon-Landweber region. The Bradon-Landweber region, okay? And this is all about things that happen in co-weight zero. So we're talking about the groups of the form pi n, n, okay? And we call it that because this computation of the atom spectral sequence in this range recovers some results of Bradon and Landwever about the structure. I don't want to talk too much today about the details of what they're saying, but it recovers some of the results. It also recovers the Mohollen invariance of 2 to the K. You can just read them right off. You can just read them right off. You do the atom spectral sequence computation, and the Moholin invariants are immediate. Not like with some additional work, they're just right there. They're just sort of, you know, right in there. Okay, so let's see what that looks like. Okay, so this is part of the atoms, so this is C two equivariant, atoms E infinity. C2 equivariant, atoms E infinity, and it's co-weight 0, right? So when I look at this, you know, like say this eighth column, I'm really talking about pi 8, 8, right? So forth. So there's some noisy stuff down here that is interesting, very interesting, right? But not the purpose of this slide. The purpose of this slide is to look at what happens above this dashed line. Above this dashed line, what you have in blue, what you have is stuff that arrives. What you have is stuff that arose from the R-motivic computation. And then the stuff in black is things that came from the negative cone that are strictly C2 equivariant. And then there are hidden row extensions in here. And then there's this regular pattern here. It's like one up, one across, three up, three across, one up, one across, three up, three across, and so forth, kind of going on forever. Okay, and this and this sort of like this regularity of this lower boundary, this is what you're reading off the Moholidon variance along this lower boundary somehow. All right, so I mean this ends up, and this is just in coat zero, and it's already kind of recapturing a lot of the structure of equivariant homotopy groups that were sort of seen by other methods by other people. Okay, so that's one of the things. So the other thing. So the other thing. So just, is that what you meant by the Bridon-Land-Weber? But the Bridon-Land-Weber region, I mean the part of the Adams E infinity page in coate zero above this line. And we can sort of, you know, completely compute that. The dot, dot, dots are exactly what you think they should be. And there's nothing else above that line. All bits are off about what's below that line. But yeah. Dana. But yeah. Yeah, the part that you said was coming through the negative cone. Those aren't copies of the negative cone. They're not copies of the negative cone, right? Because they've passed through the filter of X, sort of on their way to showing up on this chart. So what you're seeing along these horizontal lines, what you're seeing are infinitely row divisible, it started off being infinitely row divisible, but then there were some row-Boxstein differentials that truncated them. And you're not seeing And you're not seeing tau at all, the tau divisibility at all, because tau changes the co-weight, and so that takes you onto a different co-weight. Okay, but that's where along those lines are the infinitely, the E1 page, so in the E1 page, these truncated lines start off going to infinity, and the differentials then knock them out. Okay, so that's part of it. But you know, in a lot of ways, the coefficients. The co-wait zero is kind of exceptional. That Bradon-Lanweber region is kind of not really what happens more generally. This picture is really a more general, kind of, has a more general feel. So this is co-weight 6. And again, I chose that because it just was sort of representative of the kind of things that I want to talk about. We have charts for co-weight 1, 2, 3, you know, I don't know how many co-weights exactly we have. This is very much in progress. This is very much in progress. This is, and this is X'd, by the way. This is X, not atoms E infinity, simply X'd. So, this is the result of the Robachstein spectral sequence, not the Adams spectral sequence. I haven't shown you an Adams chart because we don't really have anything complete yet that we could show. Even in this friendly, small group, I think we're not really quite ready to put up these sort of half-finished charts, right? There's a lot of data to sift through, as you can see, okay? There's a lot of data to sift through, as you can see. So, just kind of qualitatively, what's going on here is there are some things in green off here, kind of on the left part of the chart. All that green stuff, that's all R motivic. That's all arising from, that's the X to R. Remember, XC2 is the direct sum of X to R plus X, this negative cone, X. And so this stuff, and then over here on the right side of the And then over here on the right side of the chart, the black and the pink dots, those are from the negative color. This is a general phenomenon. One can write down bounds for the degrees where things lie. And you see in general that in a given co-wait, on the left is the armotivic stuff, and then to the right of that is this negative colon stuff. The pink and the black, the black dots are the ones that came from tor zero, from this gamma part of the E1 page. The E1 page. And the pink dots are these Q classes that came from the Tor 1 part of E1. It doesn't overlap. Oh, there's a little bit up here. Right. Do we have DC colours on it? Yeah, the colors on this chart are not real bright. Sorry. But yeah, there's a little bit of overlap. But for practical purposes, yeah, they're not really overlapping. They're not mixing. I mean, in algebra anyway, in X, they're not really mixing in any kind of real complicated way. In homotopy, there's definitely mixing. And there's lots of subtle, interesting, deep computations to be made there. And just to be clear, you. And just to be clear, you have. It's common for differentials to go from the negative couple part to the non-negative couple part. Adams differentials. I don't have an atom differential. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Absolutely, yeah. And that's good news in the sense that there's a lot of fun to be had in sort of working through all those things. Can I ask while we're discussing this as well? There's a duality between the positive and the negative cone. Does that translate into anything next, or it's not clear from the description? So I don't know. Okay. I mean, this issue has sort of been nagging me for years, right? I mean, so yes, there's this duality, right? And so this ought to be showing up as some sort of duality in the computations downstream, right? But, you know, first of all, it's got to be some sort of derived duality rather than simply just like taking the picture. Rather than simply just like taking the picture and turning it upside down, right? And so I don't know how to make that precise. But there's a lot of interesting, again, we have this empirical, we have a lot of empirical data, right? We have all this, like, we've computed all these differentials and we see all this structure and it's lining up. And what happens is that we do definitely see a duality in the differentials somehow. When you have an armotypic differential somehow becomes dual to one of these negative cone differentials in the Roblox time spectrosec. Differentials in the Roblox time spectral sequence. That seems to be where the duality is, because it's before you're deriving somehow, and so you see the duality a little better there. And then, but on the X groups, it's somehow it's a little bit lost. Someone should really come along who knows about duality, should come along and figure out what's going on with that. Because there has to be something more intelligible to say about that than the word salad that I just blurted out. But yeah. Can I add something with the point of view that trying to advertise it for somebody to do this right? You know, that result you mentioned about B and J's that relate the R motivus homotopy to the C2 equivariant homotopy, it's a kind of a localization process. It has associated to it a local duality that's similar to the kind of local duality that I know that you, John, and other people have thought about in the Have thought about in the context of chromatic applications. And I'm sure that that kind of framework could be adapted, you know, take what me and Jay do together with that theory that's been applied in so many other cases and be able to explain this phenomenon that you see empirically. That sounds right to me, although I can't really add anything beyond what Mark just said. Okay, so just to remind you, this negative cone stuff, this is the genuine. Negative cone stuff, this is the genuine, this is, well, I have to, I can't show you these, this is the truly equivarian phenomenon, right? And so remember, you know, that when I call these, you know, this pink and these black dots are these, you know, these really from where they arise in the Bachstein E1 page. The Bachstein E1 page, all these guys are infinitely row divisible, right? And then there are Bachstein differentials that come along that create, that truncate these infinite, you know, these infinite rows. And you're seeing some dash. These infinite numbers. And you're seeing some dashed lines, like right in here. There are some dashed H1 extensions, right? So those are like hidden in the Roboxstein spectral sequence. And so they're like connecting classes that don't look like they really belong together somehow. And that's the fun of this, is finding these hidden connections between things. Okay, so there's all kinds of atoms differentials that one needs to analyze and figure out. And maybe there are some hidden in homotopy, maybe there are some hidden extensions here. Who knows what, right? So there's lots of work to be done. So there's lots of work to be done. But certainly this can be done, and we just have to kind of get around everything. All right, so let's get back to the talk here. All right, so I kind of think of this slide, this picture, as kind of like the main point of the talk. So I want to try to describe to you kind of qualitatively what we're expecting to see. What we're expecting to see. I mean, beyond the technical computations that I've shown you in these other slides, like more qualitatively, how do all these computations fit together and what do we expect to see? So I'm plotting here, right? This is supposed to be a picture of pi P comma Q, C2 equivariant groups, right, where P is on the horizontal axis and Q is on the vertical axis. Okay? All right, so there are various sort of this plane is broken up into various regions, and I'm going to talk through these. Regions, and I'm going to talk through these kind of one at a time and explain what's going on in them. So over here on the left, 3 eighths of the picture is just 0. Those groups are all 0. Down here in this lower left corner, this octant down here in the lower left corner, these groups are all rho periodic in the sense that, and so rho is in degree minus 1, minus 1, right? Degree minus one, minus one, right? So multiplying by rho takes you down these diagonal lines. And these groups are all, multiplication by rho is all an isomorphism, it goes off to infinity, okay? And sort of like the kth diagonal is a copy of classical pi k. Okay, so in other words, this whole side of the picture is all understood. And this stuff was known at least to Bradon. So it's just like ancient history or something. Okay, all right, so then, I don't know what order do these in. Okay, so then there are these blue regions, okay? So there's a blue region down here and a blue region up here, okay? So these blue regions are what we are tau periodic, okay? But not necessarily tau to the one periodic, right? Tau to some power periodic, which depends on which column. And each column is periodic with period 2 to the k for some k that increases as you move out. Increases as you move out. Okay, and so I mean if you know this group is isomorphic to that group, is isomorphic to that group, and so forth up, and then the same groups, it's the same periodicity down here, you know, with you know of order 2 to the k. There are 2 to the k different groups, but then that pattern repeats. And also down here, there's sort of an overlay. There's the tau periodic groups, which are the same as up here, but also some of these row periodic sequences, they actually extend. Periodic sequences, they actually extend backwards through this region. And they're sort of like a direct sum of two different. In fact, I should have, I actually should have put an O plus there because it splits. That would have been a little clearer. Okay, so you can read off these tile periodic groups in terms of the homotopio-stunded projective spaces. So, Iraqi and Irier, sort of in the, I guess probably in the 80s, they did this based on work of Maholt studying. On work of Mahalt studying projective spaces, okay? And that's fine, right? But that's cheating, right? Falling back on Mahalt is cheating, right? You know, we don't want to just look up the answer, right? There ought to be, and I have no idea how to do it. I really, I'm not, you know, being cagey here. I have no idea. I would like there, in this sort of framework that I'm talking about today, I would like there to be some way to compute these tau periodic groups without just. Tauperiodic groups. Without just, you know, yeah. This in this quadrants, so you said this row periodicity goes into that region sometimes. Right, yeah. So there are elements up here that support infinitely many row multiplications, and eventually they get carried down into here. But not all the things that are in that octave. I guess all the things that are in this octave do land. In this octave, do land somewhere up here. Exactly, where is the Mohalden variant? But they're all above a line of slope one half. Yeah, exactly. At least as far as a line of slope one half, and then how much further is a question of the Mohalden variant. So it's not an easy thing to say. Okay, so that's the blue stuff. So now there's this green region which overlaps with this row periodic stuff and this part of the top periodic stuff. So below Of the tau periodic stuff. So below this, in this, you know, below these two lines in the green region, what we know is that the armotivic groups are isomorphic to the C2 equivariant groups. Okay, and so this is a theorem. Well, there was a weaker theorem that Dan Dugger and I proved, and then recently, Eva Velmont, and Burke Yu and I proved a stronger version of this theorem. This is a really, turns out, this is a really easy theorem. All you do is you look at that x. That x, that negative cone x, you look at that x n C, you trace through where the elements came from and what their possible degrees are, and you realize that they're in this range, there's nothing in X N C that can contribute. It just turns out that they're all, they're not, they're nothing in those degrees. So in these degrees, X C2 is just the same as X star. Okay, so it's really just, it's not hard. All you do is you just gotta do some bookkeeping, just keep track of. You do is you just got to do some bookkeeping. You just keep track of the degrees and transform them on various, you know, re-indexing, and that's what you get. Okay, so this is not a deep theorem, right? But nevertheless, but it is a very useful theorem. And let me say, and this line here has slope one-half. I want to kind of emphasize that, which means that it's really kind of getting into the interesting part of the computation. Some parts of the computation are more interesting than others. And near the top of this region, What I want near the top of this region is some really sort of interesting, non-trivial stuff happening there. I just want to, so somehow, even though the proof is really easy, the consequences here are pretty significant. Okay, so then finally, there's this little sliver here between this line of slope one. Oh, I should say that the, you know, that the co-weight zero, the Bradon-Landweber stuff, is all happening along a line of slope one, right? But this, but this. But this little slur between a line of slope one and a line of slope one half, well, that's where we should be focusing all of our attention. If you want to know groups down here, you're not doing equivariant homotopy theory. You're doing armotivic homotopy theory. So just do it that way. It's a lot easier. But if you're here, you have to do equivariant computations. So that's the juiciest part of the story. Okay, so yesterday, Jolie was. Yesterday, Jolie was telling us a little bit about the root invariant or the mohol invariant, right? And how you're supposed to, in order to compute, according to Bruner and Greenlee, in order to compute a Maholt invariant, you're supposed to take one of these classes in classical pi star down here, and you're supposed to divide it by rho as much as possible up into some place, and then look at the underlying class of that thing, right? That's what that was what he told us yesterday, okay? And that's what I'm saying here. Okay, and that's what I'm saying here. I don't want to have to go through all the details here. He just said it yesterday, and the details aren't so important. But you want to divide by row as much as possible. In many cases, not in all the cases, but in many of the cases, what happens when you divide by row is it ends up terminating in this armotivic region. Sometimes it goes further and it lands in this truly equivariant stuff. But sometimes it lands here. And that'll just mean in a few trivial cases. And I don't just mean in a few trivial cases, easy. I mean, like in lots of cases, okay? Many of the cases, it does that. And so, what that says is that in order to compute these root invariants, you don't have to do any equivariant homotopy theory. You have to do R-motivic homotopy theory, which again is a lot easier. And so if you do that R-motivic homotopy theory, you will get, this includes, includes, you do get some previously unknown examples. So for example, we can compute the root invariant of eight of 4. Well, what's A to 4? Of eta 4. Well, what's eta 4? Ata 4 is detected by H1H4. It's in the 16 stem, it's detected by H1H4. The root invariant of that guy is nu theta 4. Theta 4 is the Kuvert guy in dimension 30, so that's in dimension 33. And also, the root invariant of nu 4, nu 4 is detected by H2H4 in the 18 step, and then if you take the root invariant of that, you end up with sigma times theta 4 in the 37 step. In the 37 step. So these are just kind of like sample computations. And I wrote those down because those aren't like those were not previously known. And again, this is happening armotivically. I don't have to do anything equivariant. If we do, and we will eventually sort of handle this, have more information about this region, and will it be able to recompute all of the known Mahal variants and more new ones? And more new ones, additional new ones, eventually. It's just a matter of sort of time spending through processing data. Okay. So I have a table here. This one's maybe. What are we doing on? What is this? Okay, so here's a table of the, here's a table of the root invariance that we can compute arbotypically, right? Can compute armotypically, right? Just to kind of show you that there's really quite a few elements here, right? Most of these elements. And there are some that don't work. You see, here's sigma and two sigma and four sigma. Well, eight sigma is missing, right? Turns out that, well, but I get, yeah, eight sigma is missing. And there's some other elements in here that are missing. But there are lots of these elements, these low-dimensional elements, that you can get armotypically without having to do any equivariant work, which is a little bit um a little bit surprising and and useful. A little bit surprising and kind of useful. Okay. All right. So that's kind of where we're at with the atom spectral sequence, and that's kind of like, you know, the main thrust of all this. I want to say a few kind of additional miscellaneous comments. So first of all, let me say a few words about the effective spectral sequence. So Hanna yesterday talked a lot about the effective spectral sequence and the convergence properties and all that stuff. So I'm going to just kind of touch on this a little bit informatively. This is a little bit informally. One of the points, so first of all, just working motivically, right, the effective filtration, the layers of the effective filtration are typically, you can describe them in terms of classical Adam Denovikov E2 pages. Okay, so for example, the main example that I'm interested in is if you take the motivic sphere and you look at the effective layers, what you get is here's the classical Adam Dnovikov E2 page, right? And then you just this tensor. Page, right? And then use this tensor with HZ. Remember, what this means is that if you have a group Z mod N showing up here, then really you have an HZ mod n in your layer. And that, well, I did a sort of a weird thing here where I have like a spectrum over here that's converging to some groups, right? So I mean the homotopy of this thing, right, is the E1 page that converges to the R-motivic homotific groups. Someone should really sit down. Someone should really sit down and explicitly compute this. This is totally doable. It's sitting right, you know, again, someone who's got an extra year to kill on this project, just work it out and just see what happens. Just go step by step and just kind of crank it all through. Well, I do this because of the comparison and contrasting to the atoms story. You want to see the atoms and effective kind of side by side. Okay, so the C2 effective version of this spectral sequence takes this form, right? Where now you have the equivariant Eingrim-McLean spectrum showing up there, right? And again, I really mean the homotopy groups of this thing converges to the C2 equivariant homotopy groups. Okay, so that is a spectral sequence that should also be run eventually, although we haven't even really thought about the atom spectral sequence very thoroughly yet. Thought about the atom spectral sequence very thoroughly yet, so maybe that's a little bit further down the road. But the kind of like the point I want to make here is that the C2 effective spectral sequence, its job is to play the role of that the classical Adams-Novikov spectral sequence takes. You can try to write down BPR and talk about that thing in C2 equivariant homotopy theory and try to set up some Adams-type spectral sequence. That doesn't That doesn't feel like the right thing to do. That's sort of like too complicated and not really very practical. What I'm saying is that the C2 effective spectral sequence is the thing you should use instead. So if you have a classical theorem that you can get at using the classical Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, and you want to prove the C2 equivariant analog of that classical Adams-Novikov theorem, what I'm saying is that you should be. What I'm saying is that you should use the effective spectral sequence to do that, to try to prove that theorem. In particular, so what is classical Adams-Novikov good for? Well, one thing it's good for is V1 periodic computations. They're all in the Adams-Novikov one line, and it all kind of shows up very nicely. So the C2 equivariant V1 periodic computations, which we know very, very little about, by the way, they ought to be excessed by this effective spectral sequence. That would be, I imagine that would be the. That would be, I would, I imagine that would be the best way to kind of see to figure out what's going on, is to try to tackle that. Okay, so this is really more like a future project slide than anything, you know, real, than anything that I have any results about. Okay, and the other thing that I wanted to talk about today is a little bit more far afield, but again, also in sort of an advertisement for some projects that aim towards the future. Toward the future. So there is this thing, you know, earlier I was talking about these deformation perspectives on motivic homotopy theory. So there's this thing called HF2 synthetic spectra, which is due to Pyotr Postergovsky. And they are also a deformation. There's a parameter tau. The generic fiber is classical homotopy theory again. And the special fiber is algebraic. But this time, instead of BP star BP co-modules, BP co-modules, you get A-star co-modules. So it's a different deformation, which from this description sounds very plausible. And we've sort of known about this for a little while, but we haven't really had any real concrete reason to study this thing because we're not sure what it's good for, right? Well, it's now good for something. So I want to advertise this, you know, that this thing, Robert Birkeland, very recently. Very recently, sort of solved a problem of the classical 54 stem. In the classical 54 stem, there was this little, here, let me show you that. There was this little sort of, this is a classical atoms E infinity page. Okay, and right here, this is the 54 stone. In our charts, we have these dashed lines. You see, we know that this class supports a two extension, but we didn't know whether it hit that or it hit that. We couldn't figure it out. Or it hit that. We couldn't figure it out. We tried semantific tools and it didn't work. We tried classical tools and it didn't work. We looked at it a million different ways and we couldn't figure out which of the two where what the target of this two extension was. Well if you look in HF2 synthetic spectra, the answer pops right out. It's an easy proof. It's not a complicated thing. It's just you look at the data and there's the answer right there sitting right on the surface. So that's telling me that this HF2 synthetic spectra, it's a real thing that we need to pay more attention. That we need to pay more attention to. It is the answer. So the answer is the top. Which is kind of what you'd expect somehow from comparing to TMF, but you couldn't quite make it work. Okay, so is that. Okay, so one question I have about this is, do HF2 synthetic spectra have geometric significance, right? Because BP synthetic spectra, that's the same or. BP synthetic spectra, that's the same or equivalent to samotific homotopy theory, or cellular sigmotific homotopy theory. So BP synthetic spectra do have geometric significance. And this thing seems too important, too central to just be just some random thing that exists. I have no idea how to approach that question, but maybe other people do. And then another question I have is: can you further deform this thing? So remember here, there's this diet. You know, so remember here there's this diagram of four homotopy theories, right? Well, you know, we sort of know what these two are: there's HF2 synthetic and there's classical. Can you find some analog of R motivic? Can you sort of, you know, put in another parameter rho and deform this thing to put something up here? And then can you maybe invert tau to put something there that's somehow like an analog of C2 equivariant in this framework? I don't know, but you know, it seems, you know, it seems like it might be worth considering. Okay, and then along the line. Okay, and then along the lines of these deformations, there's another kind of deformation type problem that I would love to know the answer to. So I would like to know more about C2 cross C2 epovari homotopy theory because the element nu, the second Hopf map nu, is not nilpotent in that category. That's like, trust me, like, that's a really, really... That's a really, really interesting fact. And so I would love to know more about this homotopy theory, but it's really hard to compute equivariantly. There's just so much stuff to deal with. And sigma also, the third Hoffmap, and C2 cross C2 cross C2. So we sort of, in this story, we sort of know what these two are, right? And then the question is, well, is there sort of an analog of C motivic and R motivic in this picture? In this picture, with the hope that these guys would also have this non-nilpotence, but be much easier to compute it. And again, I don't have very many ideas about this slide, but I think these are all really interesting questions that I hope over the, say, the next decade or something that people think about and we can maybe sort out some of these things. Okay, so thanks very much. Okay, questions? So what about C2 equivariant armotivic with the upper left? Well, so yeah, so you could do something like that or C2 equivariant semotivic, right? So take semotivic homotopy theory and just add C2 actions to all your objects. Yeah, you could do that. That's definitely sort of seems relevant, seems related here, but there's still that C2 equivariance, so it's still not simple enough. not simple enough. But you know, if I have to, maybe that's what, maybe that's what we need to look at. Yeah, it's certainly possible. Yeah. So in the you advertised this, was it the mess? I couldn't remember the name of the effect. The effect? This is the equivariant one. Well, I guess either one, I don't really care. You advertise this as an You you advertise this as a as an adovica analog and to think about VN periodicity. Well, I'm not about VN periodicity, but V1 periodicity. But okay, but anyway, my point is I haven't, I didn't absorb the gratings from Hannah's talk, but would you do VN periodicity in XBP star? Would that be like a Vn flar periodicity? A Vn far periodicity? Is it going to be like a multiple of rho, or is it going to be like an integer multiple? I mean, Vn periodicity should be just like Vn periodicity. Well, there's like three different versions. I mean, like, you could think about, you know, periodicity where it, you know, it sort of gives you the, you can think about a Vn that lives in 2p to the, you know, 2 times 2 to the n minus 1. times 2 to the n minus 1, or you could think about a Vn bar that lives in 2 to the n minus 1 times rho. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, bar. Bar. Okay, fair, fair. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bar. So you're analyzing this kind of information perspective where you're building up this C2 for the disparate point where you either have row periodic city or you've got road portions where you have child periodic city. Is there kind of like, do you expect there to be some kind of monotopic? Like, do you expect there to be some kind of monotopic theory that's like oralotic, where you can set order and tau equals zero and kind of have the positive overthrow effect? Possibly. I don't know. Really? Yeah, I don't, you know, these are like first draft ideas, you know, that really haven't been explored in detail. So I think this question is sort of wide open. I mean, you know, I think someone can really come along with this deformation. Someone can really come along with this deformation percent. And Pyotr Postrogovsky has started this, right? But we really kind of want to build on that. I think there's a lot more to be done in that direction. Yeah. Awesome question about this. So do you suggest that R multiplicity should be like R synthetic spectra or start with C2 spectra? That's possible. It's certainly possible. If you do this naively, you have this like any naive synthetic thing for Synthetic thing is going to always have tau existing. So somehow the tricky part is to figure out a way to tie in tau and rho together. There is that relation square one of tau equals rho. And that's somehow like, that seems to me to be the fundamental fact that you have to kind of somehow put in to your theory to make it come out right. Alright, I'm scared of you. For those who signed up to go to Lake Louise this afternoon, we're going to meet right outside Orbit Hall at 1.30. And we'll be back in plenty of time for dinner. Unless you get lost.
