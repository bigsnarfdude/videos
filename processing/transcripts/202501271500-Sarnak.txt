About the wireless here, then I'll just uh reconnect if there's a problem. Also, let me apologize for not being there. I had every intention to be there and join in what is obviously going to be is already and going to be a great conference, but I got a little ill while traveling last few weeks and decided that I should probably stay put. So, thanks for the opportunity to talk on Zoom. And I will give you my view. And I will give you my view on the subject as it's evolved over many years. It's probably a little different to many others, but I will repeat some of what was said this morning. So let me try. Yeah. So let's review. By the way, spell Markov with two F's rather than a V, because that's how he used to spell it when he wrote the papers on Markov's surface and equation. The Markov. The Markov equation that we've seen and that we all love is this affine surface A3. And we want to study the solutions to this equation, Markov did, over the integers. But going forward, I want to study this over other rings, number rings, and things change when you change a number ring or if you go to other fields. And that becomes important. And there's some deficiencies in what I will describe to you here. Of course, Mark. To you here. Of course, Markov himself, as we've seen and I'll review again, was interested in this equation because of his explanation of properties of Diphene approximation, extending works of Hurwitz and, well, Hurwitz is not there, maybe Hurwitz was slightly before him. I don't remember the exact history. Certainly, Lagrange spectrum. So it comes up in many different contexts. There's this There's this interpretation of Markov spectrum in terms of simple closed geodesics on a particular congruent subgroup of the modular group that was explained by Christopher this morning. There's also a beautiful way in which the Markov integer solutions to the Markov equation come up in studying exceptional vector bundles over P2. So there's a purely algebra geometric. Algebra geometric problem. These exceptional bundles are ones which are rigid, they can't be deformed. And one asks if you can classify them. And this was done by Rudakov and also in joint work with Gorodinstead, where they explain that in one way of realizing these, they characterize these exceptional vector bundles in terms of integer solutions to Markov equations as well. As well. And moving from projective to del pato surfaces, hacking a Prokhorov study, something called, this is in the minimal model program, something smoothable over Q Bornstein Dilfezo surfaces, which have certain conic singularities, cone singularities. And again, you get some sporadic examples, and then the infinite families come from Markov and Markov-like integers. Markov and Markov-like integer equations. So it's clear this equation is very natural from many points of view, and I'm going to give you even more points of view in a second. But my emphasis is going to be on the Diaphantine side of this. But before I do so, let me comment on Markov's original Markov spectrum. So for Markov, he was looking at indefinite binary quadratic forms of the reals. Quadratic forms of the reals normalize the discriminant to be one. So the SL2R acts on these, and that's there's some natural dynamics here. And that's the reason the upper half plane and what Christopher was describing is related. In any way, for Markov, he's doing simply the following. He looks at the least inf, not the least, you may not attain this, f is an arbitrary indefinite quadratic form. You look at all the values. Form, you look at all the values assumed by f in absolute value where x is not zero, f is homogeneous, and you call that mu f. The actual attainment of the value might be at very large values, but the inf makes sense. So it's some number between zero and infinity. And the Markov spectrum, as he defines it, is, or as he, as people have defined it, but he described certain parts of it, as I'll explain right now. As I'll explain right now, is the set of numbers that Î¼f assumes as f goes over all these forms, over the moduli space of lattices, if you like. I like to call it the base note spectrum of the wave operator because there's a way of realizing it that way. And from that point of view, what Christopher was saying this morning, when he wants to look at variants of the problem, where maybe you go to congruence group and what's the Markov spectrum for that, this is completely natural where you take your base note spectrum. Take your bass note spectrum and vary the F. I'm using this cursor here to explain, you know, to point where I'm talking. You can vary the set and you can look at bass note spectra for different sets. If you look at all the F's, that's a Markov spectrum. We have this amazing story that there's a discrete set of points above one-third. My way of normalizing is the opposite to the way a lot of people do it. So I'm below one over root five, and one-third is a Root five and one-third is a crucial number that was mentioned earlier, but it was three in the other notation. There's this infinite set of numbers here called the discrete spectrum. So the set of values assumed has got this discrete set with the first limit point one-third, and that discrete set consists of numbers m over square root 9, m squared minus 4, where m is a Markov number. I do not like the way Markov numbers are defined on Wikipedia, for example, where it's a coordinate of a solution of the Markov equation. Coordinate of a solution of the Markov equation, positive, because that doesn't take the multiplicity into account. So, in this theorem of Markov, if there were a number here that was multiple, if m occurred multiply in the ordinary sense that we all know, you would put in the spectrum here a multiple value. The reason Markov defines these numbers and the reason they're Markov numbers is because of this theorem. So, they should be defined with multiplicity in the first place. Frobenius, who Frobenius, who gave a very beautiful account of Markov's work, introduced this unicity problem, and then you wouldn't have to worry about this. But I'll get back to this unicity. Some comments I have, very small ones. I understand we want to discuss it in this conference in great detail. But I prefer the definition of Markov numbers with multiplicity, and I'll assume that throughout. You could define a Markov spectrum for other number rings. In other words, instead of Z here, you might have a binary. Of Z here, you might have a binary form and you have a ring of integers, and you might think that the discrete part of that spectrum is related to some Markov-like cubic equation. And the answer is no. This is very special to Z and some imaginary quadratic fields, but otherwise, as shown by Balook, where you actually get some analog Markov spectra with Diefentine equations associated with Fouxian groups. But if you go to a genuinely higher-ranked If you go to a genuinely higher-ranked number field, meaning the group unit group is infinite, then measure rigidity comes in and these kinds of Markov spectra disappear. So the relation between the equation, this discrete part up top here, and the Markov equation seems very special to Markov, to Z and special imaginary quadratic fields. The rest of the spectrum here is also understood beautifully by Freyman. Understood beautifully by Freyman. There's a unique interval here which he identified the top point, and then there's a fractal transition range here. Anyway, for us, I'm trying to discuss in this lecture, in this review, the Diefantine properties of the Markov equation, and the Markov equation describes the discrete spectrum up there. That's Markov's view. And I gave you three other ways in which Markov's equation of Z comes up. I want to point out that for me, it'll be that there'll be much more than just that one particular equation. That's why the title of this lecture is Markov-like. So the key feature already discovered by Markov is that all solutions come from 111 by applying the eta involutions and this group gamma that I'll define again right now. I'll remove the three because it's just annoying, but it's if you But it's uh, if you actually write a paper, you have to keep track of this three, as Alex Gumbered, myself, and Bergen know, we've kind of messed up this three on many occasions. Anyway, let me drop the three and allow myself to, instead of putting zero on the right-hand side, which was Markov, to put any k. And if we're working over the integers, k is going to be an integer. The point is that this group gamma of Yeta involutions and Involutions and permutations of the coordinates, and their variance where simple variations of this, where you have just the you don't have the symmetries, but you always have the Vietnam involutions, act as polynomial morphisms of three dimensions. So they're non-linear maps. They permute. If you add in the coordinates, I just remind you what the Vietnam volution is. You fix, we've seen this in the cluster algebra setting. Setting, and of course, in the other lectures too, you fix two of the coordinates, the involution, and the third one is you switch the other root of the solution. That's why it's called the Vieta involution. And it's given by this nonlinear involution. And when you apply R3 and R2, then you get something non-trivial. And you get a non-trivial group of polynomial maps of A3. Abstractly, the group is PSL2Z. So it's a very, it's close to a free group. The most important. Group. The most important property for us, and this is the Diaphantine property, is that if you start off with it, it preserves integrality. These moves, these Vietnam moves and the whole group gamma preserves integrality. So if you start with an integer solution to this equation, you'll produce a new integer solution, maybe a new one, if you move the point. So the point of view that is more general, and there's one I will take, is not just the equation, the Markov equation. The Markov equation itself with k equals zero over the integers, but all these affine surfaces, Vk, and I'll put it in a general context later, but the VKs are realized in this case as the relative character variety, I'll define the general case later, of the fundamental group of the once-punctured torus into two by two matrices of an algebraically closed field. That's a character, the relative character variety is these representations divided by conjugation. Divided by conjugation. And these relative means that you fix the traces around the punctures. So that's your numbers k here. This is just the once punctured torus. So you fix k. K can be a real number, but we're working over the integers or over a number ring. In general, you would have a surface of genus G with n punctures, and you would look at the same character variety, and I'll return to that briefly at the end. All right, so from this point of view, So, from this point of view, the Markov-like equation comes up as a relative character variety of the ones-punctured torus. It also comes up as the parameter space for a non-linear monogram group for Penlov A6 equation in Schlesinger coordinates. This is another serious indication that the equation is clearly fundamental. So, there are these non-linear Pain-LevÃ© equations. Equations, they classified from type 1 to type 6. The most interesting one is type 6, as far as their monodromy groups. And if the monodromy group, which is acting non-linearly on the parameter space, which is a surface, acts with finite orbit, then the corresponding solution to the equation is, in fact, algebraic. So understanding the finite orbits of the action in question here over the complex numbers. Over the complex numbers is a fundamental question and was answered, in fact, in the context of classifying algebraic pain levies. This will be at the heart of what we're doing. And I should say, it gives another reason that this Markov surface is fundamental. And then finally, there's another viewpoint where this comes up, and it's one, and I'll just say a word about all these viewpoints in a second. In a second, but these VKs and gamma are intimately connected to the transitivity properties of the action of the Nielsen moves of pairs of generators of a group like SL2FP. These problem of transitivity were introduced by the group theorist Bernard and Hannah Neumann called T-systems. And there's a beautiful paper of McCullough and Wonderley, in which they discuss conjectures about transitivity properties. That is, if you Properties. That is, if you take the group SL2FP or PSL2FP, if you want to make it simple, and you look at this group, it's got many pairs of generators, two generators of the group, and you can move from two generators to another set of two generators by Nielsen moves. And the question is, what are the transitivity properties? Can you move from any pairs of generators to any other pairs? And there's one relation which is a trace of the commutator. And then basically, the conjecture says out of. It says outside of some exceptional sets that I'll return to, which are connected with these finite orbits of monodromy, these moves should act transitively. Beautiful conjecture, and that's not unrelated to yet another viewpoint that was certainly exploited beautifully by Will Chen, which is that if you look at the moduli space of elliptic curves, not with level n structure, as all us number theorists like to do, but with g structures where Do, but with G structures where G is some simple group like PSL2FP, then the connectivity properties of these moduli spaces are very intimately connected to these transitivity properties of the Neumann, these T-systems. So we have now maybe five or six viewpoints on the Markov-like equation when I look at more generally. So this is now with the arbitrary k here and Here and trying to solve it over different rings and fields and finite like fp and these different contexts. Usually, when you have these different viewpoints, if you have a difficult problem in one viewpoint, it will be difficult in all viewpoints. So, if you make a breakthrough, you usually make a breakthrough in all the different viewpoints that you have here. However, sometimes the viewpoints allow us to understand something first in one direction. Something first in one direction rather than another, and that's certainly the case here. But to me, when I over the years seen all these different realizations of this problem, it indicates that these, let's say, Markov surfaces, just this to stick with these Vks here, with the ones punctured torus, are mathematically rich and fundamental. So, let me give you the diaphanine. So, let me give you the Diophantine point of view, which is what I want to give in this overview because it's where I come from. So, the Diophantine point of view is you want to understand the equation over the integers or over the integers in a number ring. So, our equation is a hypersurface in A3. It's an affine hypersurface, it's not projective. The leading coefficient is degree 3, so we've got a cubic hypersurface, cubic affine hypersurface, and you can ask about. And you can ask about integer solutions to such equations. And what I must tell you is that we know almost nothing about these things. So, firstly, in terms of classification of what these affine surfaces are, they're called log K3s. I've never liked K3. It's an invention. It's a name invented by, I think, Andre Wei, named after, of course, Kuma Kodaira and well, another K. Well, another K uh K low, probably. Um, yes, am I right? I think that's right. Yes, yeah, okay, good. Uh, anyway, that's why it's called K3s. Um, but it comes in the classification of surfaces, just like in Kodaira's work of classification of projective surfaces, yeah, projective complete surfaces. If you start to classify affine surfaces, you will get to a classification. Surfaces. You will get to a classification in these case. Please enter. I prefer the definition because that's the one that generalizes in terms of this moduli space. They log collabillas. So these are the closest thing in a surface to an elliptic curve in terms of the diaphragm geometry, meaning there can be infinitely many integer points, or there can be a risky dense set of integer points, or there may be none. It's a very delicate business, but you don't have a Very delicate business, but you don't have a group. And that's why this is much harder than anything like an elliptic curve and an abelian variety. It's not, you don't have the luxury of, if you have two points, you can make a new point by adding. So if you're going to make new points, it looks very difficult. Sorry, I still have this off, so I need to keep okay. The Diaphantine analysis sorry, so the Diphantin Sorry, so the definition of log collabia is in you have a projective compactification in which the canonical class plus the divisor at infinity is linearly equivalent to zero. That's the definition of log collabia. And that makes sense in any dimension. And it's precisely what makes these, from a Diaphantine point of view, very delicate, say from the point of view of Voitter's conjectures. So these log K3s or log KalabiRs. Or log collabias are juicy, and we know very little about them. And if you want to see how little we know, the most basic log collabial that's not something linear is f equals k, where f is a sum of three cubes. And we know nothing about this. Integer points on sum of three cubes equals a number. Which numbers are sum of three cubes? One can make lovely conjectures. One can make lovely conjectures. I will just mention that Victor Wang, in his thesis a few years ago, has made great progress on this conjecturally. Assuming everything under the sun, he's able to show something first, the first non-trivial theorem about sums of three cubes. But that's not the direction I'm going here because we can make a lot of progress for the which are the Markov surfaces, and that's the point. So, as a number theorist, what do you try and understand? As a number theorist, what do you try and understand here? If you want to decide which numbers are some of three cubes, then you first check if there are any local obstructions. So you say k is admissible if there's no local congruence obstructions to solving the equation. It doesn't matter what the equation is. And then if there's no local congruence obstruction, you might get excited and hope that there may be integer solutions, and maybe there are many integer solutions. So once, if there is an integer solution, Once, if there is an integer solution, you might try to show that the solutions are rich, meaning, so firstly, that there's one point. If there's no local obstruction, that could be called the HASA principle. When that happens, we are very happy. That's very rare. And if there's one point, maybe you'll have many points. Maybe there'll be Zariski dense. Now, if you are in a situation where you had a group structure on the solutions, you usually can make more points from all points, as I said. All points, as I said, and you will quickly be Zariski dense. But if you are like here, where you don't know how to make new points from all points, then you might have one point, but to find another point might be very difficult. However, this is where our big group acting, our group Vieta group, which has been acting here, and I should have emphasized that in the case of the once-punctured torus, this symmetry is coming from the mapping class group. So the Vietnamove group, the Markov group. Vietnam group, the Markov group is just the mapping class group, which is the natural symmetry of the variety. And it takes integer points to integer points. So you are in business to try and make new points if you have any at all. And so for these VKs, I like to say we have the rudiments of a theory. So this is what I want to go through. And that's what my colleagues and I have been working, and students have been working on for many, many years. So the first thing. Years. So the first theorem, which was only published recently with Amit Ghosh, is the following, and that's the Hasse principle for these Markov-like surfaces. So the VKs are always going to be the Markov surfaces. And the theorem is that we're not in a situation where we have a HASA principle, but we do have it a lot of the time, in fact, most of the time. And we also have some understanding of where the failures are coming from. Failures are coming from something that for some of three cubes, we have no handle like this. So, this I view is good progress. So, the theorem that we were able to prove is that the Hasse principle holds for almost all K in the sense of density. So, it's in the weakest sense. That is, the number of K is less than capital K for which the Hasse principle is true. So, you can work out which K's are admissible, that's an exercise. And then you'd want to find global points, and in fact, Want to find global points, and in fact, many points. As I said, once there's one point, you've got this mapping class group that's all set to produce for you more points as long as you aren't stuck in a finite orbit. And the finite orbits, I already mentioned, are very much studied in connection with algebraic Pain-Levies. And we, of course, can use such methods. I won't go into them, but they are relevant, and we understand those very well. So, the hard part is to show there is a point. To show there is a point, and that's our theorem that for almost all k in the sense of density, we have a Hasse principle and a rich set of solutions. On the other hand, it is not true that you have a Hasse principle for all K. In fact, we have the number of Hasse failures for K less than or equal to capital K, everything has over the ordinary integers, is at least k to the half of a log K. So one can improve that a tiny bit, but that's not the issue here. The exponent is one. The issue exponent is one half. So there are HACCA failures, and some come from reciprocity obstructions, Brown Manning obstructions. I'll explain that in a minute. But some actually, and many more, are not explained by that. And this makes this rather unusual. There are very few cubics for which such information is known. In fact, I don't know any other setting of cubics for which one can make such statements. Okay, so one. Okay, so once we have one point or many points, and it's a risky dense, then you could ask: well, are we not very rich? In other words, if we're not empty, and there's a caveat here with the finite orbits, which we have to recognize, then we might hope that we have some form of strong approximation. That is, the solutions are is it possible that the solutions are so rich over the integers that when we reduce them modulo p, we get every solution modulo p? We get every solution modulo P. And that would be very nice if that's true. And that's the second theorem here. We don't know that in general. We know that if P is large enough, then outside exceptional set, which was mentioned earlier today, and I'm just repeating this, exceptional set of primes up to T, this is the theorem of Berger and Gambetta and myself. That you have the strong approximation. As they'll explain, there's a much stronger theorem in the case of Markov. But for general, this is, as far as I know, still the best, though maybe this conference will advance things. In fact, for the Markov, so I always specialize, single-out Markov. That's the equation, the Markov equation with k equal to zero and the three inside there. Equal to zero and the three inside there, because that's a very interesting case. Then, thanks to Will Chen, who a couple of years ago proved this beautiful theorem that the mapping is onto if P is large enough, and as was explained earlier in the beautiful talk by, I think it was Paul B. The you can make you can even put a number here, which is large enough. It's too big as far as I know. Enough, it's too big as far as I know to actually work out all the numbers between P, this size and that size. But at least if P is large enough, this reduction is onto. I will give applications of this a bit later. When we were working on this, Bougain, Gambel and myself, we've been doing this for at least 15 years. We quickly came up with this conjecture and questions about whether these graphs are expanders. We were working without knowing what other people had done, though I was. Other people had done, though I was certainly aware of Baroga's papers, but I had never seen his thesis in which this ontoness is conjectured explicitly. So, the first place where this conjecture and a beautiful conjecture is formarkov itself is in Baraga's thesis in 1991. All right, now I want to say a few words. Is there a question? Please interrupt. Let me say a few words about the proofs of these theorems. The proofs of these theorems. So let me start with the theorem of Gauche and explain with Gauche and explain where the reciprocity failures come from. Our first passage to find this was by brute force. We were looking around playing with certain connections to the Cayley cubic and when K was had certain properties for certain primes if it gave if it's congruent to four modular prime squared or something we were able to use that connection and find To use that connection and find a HECA failure, but there's a much easier way to explain it, which we found later. And this explanation will clarify why it's connected to brow mining obstructions and so on, at least some of the HASCA failures. So let me just explain this because it's quite beautiful. Suppose I give you three integers, A1, A2, A3, and I form the determinant of the matrix, which has got the A's down the diagonal, but otherwise the matrix is. Diagonal, but otherwise the matrix is symmetric. So this is a cubic form in three variables determinant there with the A's. If you put A1 equals A2 equals A3 equals 2, you will see this determinant is one way of realizing the Markov equation. So we have the determinant of a symmetric matrix. And we want to understand the solutions in x1, x2, x3 of f equals, so a will be the twos, but you. So A will be the twos, but this is part of the argument is general. I'm making F equal K, and I want to understand: do you have a local to global principle here? And one way to see that there's a non-trivial reciprocity obstruction is if I want to solve F equals T, I have an integral quadratic form in three variables, and I know it's a determinant. Now, if I look at changes of variable with symmetric. Of with symmetric quadratic forms of the reals, you can always change one quadratic form to another if you know the law of inertia. You just need to know the signature. Over the p-adics, and even integrally, there's a beautiful theory due to HESA. There's a HESA invariant, which is the same as Sylvester's law, which allows you to decide whether two forms are equivalent over Qp and even over ZP. Qp and even over Zp. And for each P, if you're given your quadratic form, if it's non-singular, there's a number CFP, F is fixed, that's given by your quadratic form in three variables. And it's a plus, minus one at each prime, and at infinity, it's the signature. And if you take the what Hesse proved is a remarkable thing, is suppose you have a quadratic form that you want to find, is there a global quadratic form which locally gives you? form which locally gives you each of these local invariants. In other words, is there a local to global lift of quadratic forms, symmetric matrices, as we have here? And the answer is, he proved, and this is equivalent to quadratic reciprocity, is that the CFPs are one for all but finitely many p's. So if you take the product of all the places, including the Archimedean place of the CFPs, if there is a global integer solution, then this product. Integer solution, then this product must be one. On the other hand, locally, you don't know that. So, this is an obstruction, and it's completely equivalent to quadratic reciprocity here. And it's an obstruction that's non-trivial to solving this equation. And if you build that into the Markov equation, you are able to make examples of HACA failures, and that gives the HACA failures I was discussing. In fact, it leads to that many HASA failures that I was telling you about, Kate, to this. Failures that I was telling you about k to the square root of k over log k immediately after our first paper. This is an interpretation that Gauss Shumeiri and I gave in a later paper that I'll return to in a minute. Lochron and Mitankin, Goyote Len, Wei, and Chu interpreted our Hasse failures as integral Brauer-Mannian obstructions. Now, the integral Brauer-Mannian obstruction. Now, the integral Brau-Mannian obstruction or the Braum-Mannian obstruction is related to the Brauer group, which involves algebras generalizing Hess's work on quadratic forms. But the nice thing about this integral Brauer-Manny and obstruction is it limits this kind of analysis to how you might find these obstructions. So, all these obstructions that come from this kind of thing that I just did here are explained that way. However, in our paper, in my paper with However, in our paper, in my paper with Gauche, we found many more obstructions which use this algebra together with the action of the mapping class group to make much more complicated examples. And so we aren't able to prove asymptotically them anymore, but numerically we find that they're about k to the point nine as a failures. And that remains a very interesting question. There are many interesting questions here about Uh, about how many HESA failures you have, but it is a warning that you can't explain the HECA failure for a cubic or a log K3 merely by a Braumannian obstruction. So that's true for these Markov-like equations and more general Markov equations in terms of HACE failures and And also the case of truth. I didn't explain how we get almost all are true, but I'm just giving a survey. All right, so the strong approximation results are really about the transitivity properties of the action. This was explained earlier, and many of you probably know about it, but this is really where the action is. It's a group theory question. We look at the action of the mapping class group in this case on the variety VK, and we reduce modulo P. Well, of course, it adds. We reduce modulo P, well, of course, it acts naturally on the reduction, and you can ask what the transitivity properties are of that action. That's related to all those questions I had on a previous slide. All right, now the tools that we developed there were explained again very nicely this morning, at least some of them. And those tools lead to a means of trying to understand this transitivity property. And there's an And there's an when we first were working, we were just doing what we had to do. But I think the right way to formulate all these things as we have evolved, and many people have pointed to this now since, and it's become quite interesting, is that we look at this character variety X, and we have the mapping class group M acting on X. And now there's a natural set which is compact, which you don't see if you're working over the reals. So the character variety has. Character variety has a compact set of solutions because the piadic integers, this is ZP, the p-iadic integers, not z mod pz. This is zp, the p-adic integers. x star means I remove 0, 0, 0 in the Markov case. And in the more general case, I would have to, there's a caveat, I'd have to remove these finite orbits, these bad finite orbits, because you get stuck in them. But we understand what they are. In the Markov, it's just a point 000. So X1 means remove 000. means remove 0, 0, 0, or start off with a point which for at least one of the coordinates is relative to fin P. And you have this compact set and the mapping class group now is acting as continuous maps of this compact space. And the question is, what are the closure of the orbits? That's a very natural way to formulate all these transitivity questions. And one theorem that we were able to prove. We're able to prove is that this action. So, if the action on FP is transitive, which as I said, thanks to Will Chen, and maybe later this week we'll see an elementary proof from the title. It looks very exciting. That's one reason I would love to have been there, but I guess I can listen on the Zoom, which I will to see exactly what's proved there. Anyway, we will prove the following. Anyway, we'll prove the following that I've already mentioned his theorem that you're onto mod p, then are you onto mod p to the k for all k? In other words, is this action minimal? Is every orbit dense? And we are able to prove that by the techniques of our paper. And in our paper, we gave a number of proofs of the connectivity. At some point, there's a combinatorial argument which carries over in the setting very naturally. There's also a proof, part of the proof. Part of the proof where we used Stepanov's elementary proof of the Riemann hypothesis for curves. That when you start working about P to the K becomes perhaps a little messier. In any event, the theorem is that, thanks to Will Chen's theorem, is that for P sufficiently large, this action is minimal. And that's, I think, the way to formulate all of this. As I'll explain, when you take different P's, we get that for free in a minute. But this is the way to formulate it. But this is the way to formulate it in general if you want to go to more general character varieties, which are for which all these questions make absolute sense. Just last week, Jang, who's on the I think on the Zoom here, has given a different proof of this transitivity, this minimality. If you assume that you want to, he doesn't get all primes, but essentially all of them. So he's got a different proof to ours. Proof to us. All right. Now, one can promote this transitivity on, say, suppose I go back to Z mod P1Z and Z mod P2Z, where these are different primes. Just want to explain this because this is disjointness at its best. If you're an ergodic theorist, you call this disjointness. If you're a group theorist, you call it Gaussat's lemma. And the point is that suppose I'm acting on the first factor and I'm onto, I'm transitive, and on the second factor, I'm transitive. And on the second factor, these are different primes, and I'm onto. Could I for free get that I'm onto on the product? I'm just using a Chinese Romainda theorem here to get the product. And the answer is yes, if you know something about the automorphism group here and the automorphism group there, if the Jordan-Holder series have nothing in common, then Gaussat's lemma gives you for free that you are transitive on the product. So that would be lovely. And you can use finite group theory. Unfortunately, we don't know this for. Group theory, unfortunately, we don't know this for every p. We know that we have to put a congruence condition in order to use some old theorems of Jordan about transitivity in finite groups. But if you are congruent to one mod four and you act transitively on x star z mod p z, which we know is true for large p, then you act, then you're acting on as permutations now, very different to what would happen if you're in linear groups. Linear groups, you're acting as full permutations of these solutions, and you are either the full symmetric group or the alternating group. And of course, the symmetric and alternating groups. Sorry. Can you see this? What happens is I have something that stopped. Let me just get back to. Okay, I'm back. I'm back. Sorry. You see it. There's something. You see, it there's something that I keep on telling Princeton University. There's something called CrowdStrike, which I know stopped the world for a day, and it stops my computer all the time. And it comes and it just says, CrowdStrike. Anyway, CrowdStrike has been struck, and I'm back. So I was explaining Gaussat. Gaussat will give you the fact that these groups are basically simple, the alternating group on different primes. Group on different primes of no Jordan-Holder factors in common, so you're going to already get the transitivity on product. So the basic thing is to prove X Z mod, X Z star, Z pad X is acting minimally. That's the beautiful and summarizes everything. That gives you an ergodic viewpoint, which may mean that there's at least some parts that could be proved much more simply than the way we do it. The way we do it. All right, now I'm going to spend some time on applications. I have two of them. I've got a question about this Gaussa principle. So is it true in general that if you've got an action of a group gamma on two spaces whose automorphism groups have disjoint Schotten-Holder series, then it acts also transitively on the product? Yes, that's a Ethereum in group theory. Yes, that's a theorem in group theory. If you have a subgroup of a product of two groups, G1 cross G2 projects onto each factor, the subgroup, and the Jordan-Holder series of G1 and G2 have nothing in common, then you automatically the full group. That's called Gaussat's lemma. It's used very heavily. And in dynamics, that's the great invention of Furstenberg of disjointness. If you have two dynamical systems which are disjoint, then you automatically have the same feature. In fact, he always highlighted his work in. In fact, he always highlighted his work in the abelian setting, where he explained it as if you have Z mod NZ cross Z mod MZ and N and M are relatively prime, then you have this property. But the non-abelian version is even more beautiful and very close to his notion of disjointness. And that disjointness is the answer to your question is yes in Spain. So here P1 and P2 may not have been fine. Not have been fine. You could have chosen N1 and N2 as long as the Holder, Jordan-Holger series were disjoint. And you need to know what the automorphism groups are. Yep. The whole point here was that the transitivity on the thing gives you so much. And then when you want to know how they interact with each other, then you need to prove more. And you need to know what the group is. And in the case that P is constant. In the case that P is congruent to what mod 4, that's not very difficult. You can infer it from finite group theory. All right, let me get to these applications. So I want to get back to this multiplicity for a second. So the applications are, of course, to Markov numbers, which I insist on defining with the multiplicity. But the first question, Frobenius, in his paper, where he asks this unicity, also asks, points out that if you're a Markov number Markov number, and you look at a prime, which is not three, but three mod four, then the Markov number cannot be zero or plus minus two-thirds mod p. And that's just coming from the Markov equation. And basically, what this strong approximation or Chen proves is the converse. And that's the first theorem that I know about Markov numbers of this type, which is remarkable, that you actually know the congruence properties of Markov numbers. Congruence properties of Markov numbers. That's the application which I really like. Now, I want to state a theorem, which is one of the reasons that we developed this theory. So the Markov numbers are very Lycanry. If you count the number of Markov numbers with multiplicity, of course, less than t, you can do that. Maybe this was done before Zaghier. People point to some other thesis that I haven't seen. Anyway, I'm familiar with it from Zagier's paper. Azagi's paper. And I want to point out that McShane and Ribbon give a also give a proof of this theorem that the number mark of numbers less than t is a constant times log t squared. And their proof has certain advantages even for us and even for other things. So I think a proof that maybe has fallen a bit between the cracks, there's Zagier, it's part of a special case of Mirzakani's very general work, which is the way I used to present it. But if we just talk about the once-party, Presented, but if we just talk about the once-punctured torus, this McShane ribbon is extremely important. Let me say a word: why. Anyway, the theorem that Bergen, Gumbert, and I were able to prove is that almost all Markov numbers are composite. Okay, so we were after this for a while, and that's why we developed the strong approximation and then some small sieving ideas. Of course, you usually want to prove that there are infinitely many Markov numbers that. That there are infinitely many Markov numbers that are prime, that's beyond humans, I think, at this point. We'd have to have some really new techniques to do that. But even this was something we were quite satisfied with. And I want to point out that the proof that's most useful if you want to effectivize our proof, which has been done by Alejandro Lopez in his thesis, undergraduate thesis in Princeton a couple of years ago, is the McShane proof. McShane proof, McShane and Ribbon proof. And the reason is they reduce the problem in very much almost to the point of what Christopher was saying this morning, but he didn't describe this norm. You can put a norm on a R2 such that the length, the Markov length, is given by this norm. This norm is a convex norm, but it's not differentiable at rational points. So it's a bit much true. But you're counting the number of integer points, sorry, relatively. Sorry, relatively prime integer points in a ball of this weird norm, and that allows you to count less than t beautifully. So, in fact, they can give a remainder term in their work. But this norm is convex, that's very important. And if you want to effectivize these proofs and you want to go through Mirzakani or Zagia, it's kind of tricky because even though the mixing properties for Mirzakani are known to have certain exponents, nobody knows how to estimate. Certain exponents. Nobody knows how to estimate them when you put congruence conditions. So, the kind of thing you want to do if you want to do a sieve is to count the number of Markov numbers less than t, that should be m's less than t, with m congruent to m bar modulo m. So, you're putting m bar, you choose some point in x star n, which is in the image, you're assuming that you've already understood that you want to. And you want to compare that with how many you expect to be, which is n of t divided by the cardinality of x dot n. Cardinality of x dot n. And you can effectivize the Riven-McShane proof using Selberg's theory of Eisenstein series because you'll be counting the subgroup of SL2Z, which will be doing this counting to give you the primitive points, PQ, will be a non-congruence group of SL2Z. And Selberg, this is something that is incredible in his theory, is he gave the analytic continuation of Eisenstein series for non-configuration. Eisenstein series for non-congruence groups, that's in fact non-arithmetic groups, and that's really the depth of what he did. He gave a spectral proof, which then led to the whole Langlands theory. So the fact that you can analytically continue, you can use that and effectivize the Riven-McShane proof, and you can get a power saving here. Well, it's not a power saving. We don't know these graphs are expanders. I assume Matthew de Cosi Island and maybe. De Cosi Island and maybe Gumbard might speak about this. So there's not a uniform constant here, which we expander. That is probably true, but we certainly don't know how to prove it. But to make it effective, you get some exponent here, which gets worse as n gets large. But anyway, this effectivizes the proof and allows Lopez to prove not only that almost all Markov numbers are not prime, but they're highly composite. So almost all Markov numbers have the number of prime factors is at factors is at iterated six iterated logarithms of m you could put t m m is at most t six iterated logs is a very slowly growing function but it does uh effectivize everything and i should say that this convex norm on r2 introduced i think maybe it wasn't introduced by them but used by mcshane and ribbon uh also allows you to give as mcshane points out a very proof of these kinds of Of these conjectures of Egner and Gastor further versions of this, just exploiting the convexity of this norm ball, and to give another proof of the beautiful theorem of Li, Li, Schiffler, and Rabidio, which use cluster algebras, which is something I know very little about, but it's clear that That the first proof coming from there means they understand something rather remarkable. Anyway, this convexity also gives the same results as far as I know. I may be a bit out of date. So I'm pointing out that there's some great advantage to the McShane-Ribbon paper because it introduces that norm and it allows you to effectivize our work and it allows you to do other things as well. All right. Um, there's a joke that uh um Mumford talks about a theorem with a little t and a big t. I learned that somewhere, and so I've often said the theorem with a little t maybe here's a proof with a little p, meaning our methods which we described in our paper and which we, this book, and Gumped and myself are still writing up, work to prove those kinds of theorems that I was stating before. That I was stating before to prove these conjectures of Wonderlay and McCullough. But we've never written out all the details. So this should be a proof with a little P, or a film with a little T, but the methods clearly will give that. The hard part is you need to understand the exceptional, what you have to remove, and that that coincides with exactly what they discover are the bad pairs of generators. Of generators. And for large P, I think that's kind of clear. But the methods are quite robust. Let me just put it that way. All right, I have 10 minutes and I want to give an application and then end with where I view the Diaphantine geometry as going. So there's another application which I like very much of this HASA failure to Markov, and it comes from a problem that I popularized because I'm. That I popularized because I like it so much of Aner Shalev. And the question is about a local to global principle, pro-finite principle, for whether elements are one commutator in a group. So the group generated by one commutators we all study, and the group divided by the group generated by them is the Belianization. So that we study all the time. But often, if the group's highly non-commutative, Often, if the group's highly non-commutative, already the one commutator is hitting all the elements, say, if the group is perfect. So Shaleb asked the following, very interesting question. He asks it for SL3 or SL2 over numbering. Is pro-finite HACE principle for a one commutator for arithmetic groups? That is to say, if Z is a one commutator in gamma, gamma is an arithmetic group like SL2Z. Gamma is an arithmetic group like SL2Z or SL2Z1 over P. Then, of course, if it's not a one commutator in some finite quotient, then it can't be a one commutator in the group. But is that a necessary, that necessary condition is also sufficient? In other words, is it true that if something is not a one commutator in gamma, then you can find a finite quotient in which it's not a one commutator? Of course, you need to have a lot of finite quotients, which arithmetic groups have. Safe. So there's a big difference between SL2Z and SL2O, and there's a big difference, and there's a good reason I'm really interested in these problems, because in all our work that we've done with this rudiments of a Diophantine theory of a Markov equation, it's all over Z. If you change the number ring to Z square root 2, we have much weaker results. And that's because that group does not. And that's because that group does not change, and the group acts with not finitely many orbits. I'll return to that maybe in a second. So, there's a big difference between Z and O, and the difference in terms of SL2 is the fact that if you're looking at SL2 of a ring of integers, where the ring of integers has infinitely many units, then it's got something called the congruent subgroup property. That is, every finite Property that is every finite subgroup, every finite quotient, every finite index subgroup is a congruent subgroup. So, a congruent subgroup is just a generalization of the following. If gamma is SL2Z, then gamma delta is a congruent subgroup if it contains a principal congruence group, which is something which is congruent to the identity moduli. Meaning, you can study everything that's got to do with delta in terms of congruences. Of congruences. And SL2Z has many non-congruence groups, while SL2O, where O is Z say Z square root 2, is a theorem of Meneke and Ser, has the congruence subgroup property. So there's a big difference between the, if you allow all the finite quotients of SL2Z, many of them are non-congruence and you can exploit them. And in fact, in a paper, recent paper, Ghosh Meheri and myself, we showed that there is a local to global congruence. There is a local to global congruence principle for the one commutator if gamma is SL2Z. So let me repeat: an element in SL2Z is a one-commutator if and only if it's a one-commutator in every finite quotient. Now, there are many non-congruence finite quotients, and this theorem will exploit that. Our proof is based on a beautiful paper of Caleb, who proved this theorem for free groups. So it's not trivial to generalize it, even though we're very close to it. Generalize it, even though we're very close to a free group, and we haven't been able to do it for free product of Z mod n cross Z mod n, but we can do Z mod 2 Z cross free product Z mod 3 Z. There's some special tricks we have. Okay, but let's, what about when you have the infinite group of units so that the congruent subgroup property holds? And I think it was expected that you still have this local to global principle. Local to global principle for one commutator, but the answer is no. And this comes from the Markov equation and the failure of the Hasse principle. So, the minute you have the congruent subgroup property, you can convert all your questions, whether it's a good idea or a bad idea, to a number-theoretic question. In other words, we are asking whether we can solve x, y, x inverse, y inverse equals z, where x and y are two by two matrices. So you could just think of this in A4 cross A4, and you're trying to find the integer solution. The integer solution and local obstructions are just congruence obstructions. So, do you have a local ordinary HACE principle for solving this Diefentine equation? Local obstructions all passed. Does it have a global solution? Well, there are three varieties here. One is this commutator equation. Another one is if I take trace from there down to what I'll call TT, then I'm looking at the equation over the integer. Equation of the integers trace equals t and is there local to global principle for that? And then there's a further map, all of which over here you'll have the action of the Nielsen moves over here too. Here you'll have the action of the Markov group. They're all equivariant. When you take this map down from here to here, you use Fricker identities to get finally to Markov. So since Markov has a HACC failure, it's perhaps not surprising that you can promote it to a HACA. Surprising that you can promote it to a HACA failure over a number field through some reciprocity of this problem of Shalev. And we were able to do that. Let me, for the reasons of time, not explain that, just tell you the example. So here's an example. Suppose L is, I didn't give you a counterexample to mark off, but that's because I was going to set this one up, which is more delicate. So L, if you choose L odd. So L, if you choose L odd prime with these congruence conditions, and you take the ring of integers Z1 over L and the 2 by 2 matrix, so gamma is the S arithmetic group SL2 of this ring, and you take T of the form 2 plus 20 times mu squared, where nu satisfies some congruence, and all its prime factors. This is all side conditions that are easy to arrange. Then the upshot is this, that if you write down this. Is this that if you write down this matrix here, which is given in terms of this data, and I've chosen some congruence conditions, so these are all integers in O, then Z is in gamma, and Z is a commutator in every finite quotient, but it's not a commutator in gamma. By the way, we have not been able to give a counterexample. Is it true that every element in SL3Z is a one commutator? That's the, and then you don't put any side. And then you don't put any side frills or anything. Just that question, that's the kind of question that attracts my attention. In fact, that was the one that was popularized more by Charlemagne. All right, so there are many, these are explained by HACCA failures over the number field and could be viewed as brown money and obstructions. Whether there are not Whether there are non-Brauer money obstructions in this case, even for the Markov, that's much more subtle. And it's related to this measure, this rigidity that I told you. If you look at number fields, the Markov equation, the very beginning where I said the Markov equation and the discrete part of the spectrum changes dramatically the minute you have infinitely many units. And these things are all related. So I must make clear that we do not understand. I must make clear that we do not understand well the Markov equation of a ring which has got infinitely many units. That feature was already pointed out by Silverman very early on in his paper on a Markov equation. All right, let me end my last two minutes by just telling you what I view as the subject is going since this is a big conference on this. So the cluster algebra is new to me, but I suspect there may be a bit interesting. I suspect there may be interesting Diefantine equations connected with the cluster algebras, which are not just Markov's equation that we're familiar with. There's also the Hurwitz equation, which is an immediate generalization of Markov. But the setting in which I'm most interested, because this is the setting which captures this once-punctured torus, is the character variety of representations, a character variety of representations of a surface of genus. Of representations of a surface of genus G with n punctures into SL2. You could replace SL2 eventually by another group, but this is already interesting enough. So, this once punctured torus was the Markov-like equation, and we have some Diephantine theory. And you have a relative character variety in general. In other words, you have n punctures, and you fix the traces of the matrices at the end punctures, and so you have a coordinates k1 to kn and you the most. And the most important point about all this is these character varieties, which has not been exploited enough, but which has been known since Fricker, and certainly Horowitz is a student of Magnus at NYU in the 70s, made this very explicit, is that all these character varieties are affine varieties and defined over Z. And the mapping class group preserves integrality. So we're in this position that we were with the once-punctured torus very genuinely. The once-punctured torus, very generally. And so, the question is: are these interesting diaphantine affine varieties? And the answer is absolutely. So, Wang, in his thesis from a few years ago, showed that these are all log calabia. He found a projective compactification of these relative character varieties, showing that they log calabia in the sense that are defined at the beginning with the divisor plus the divisor at infinity plus a canonical class being linearly equivalent to zero. As being linearly equivalent to zero. So they are interesting from every point of view. And they do not, they could go, have many points, the risky dense set of points, or they could be very sparse with points. And so they're kind of delicate and they are examples that we need and love to understand. So Wang proves on the mild hypotheses, again, he has to assume Z or an imaginary quadratic field that there's a full descent. His proof is There's a full descent. This proof is quite ingenious that you can reduce. So, in the Markov proof, you take your point and you reduce it the height in some clever way. Here, it's much more complicated, but he shows that the mapping class group acts on the integer points with some other hypotheses with finitely many orbits. So, we're now in a position where we can ask all the same questions. There's a very beautiful paper of Golsefidi and Tamam just recently. Just recently, where they studied the action on the Zp point, showing that there are finitely many orbits, but those number of orbits may grow. There's also, Jang and Kantat have a recent paper which also proves something like this in some generality about the action on ZP points. But those theorems are all that they're not that you're transitive, but that they're finitely many orbits, which is, of course, a good start. But I think in these cases, Good start. But I think in these cases, once P is large, the mapping class group always wants to act minimally. I may be wrong, but that's, I think, one of the interesting questions. So this gives us a very rich family of moduli spaces of representations, all defined over the integers and all having this very natural compact set of points, which are preserved under the mapping class group, and the minimality properties of the mapping class group on that. Properties of the mapping class group on that is what I think is one of the really interesting directions. All right, I'm over time. Let me stop. Thank you. Any more questions for Peter? Well, if not, let's thank him once more. Thank you, Peter. If I want to participate in some of your things, can you do that from Zoom? Is that legal? Yes, 100%. In fact, we will start again in 25 minutes. We'll have an informal problem session, and you are more than welcome to participate. Can you tell me when you're going to have the session on uniqueness? Yeah, we can start with that discussion in 25 minutes. How about that? How about that? Well, I see Ian Eagle is also on the line. Yeah, so I think he wants to put. I shouldn't tell him what he wants to do, but I would want him to participate. So I think it would be good if you announce when it is. Yes, so we'll have this informal discussion at 4.30 in 25 minutes. It's fine with me. Thanks. Thanks.
