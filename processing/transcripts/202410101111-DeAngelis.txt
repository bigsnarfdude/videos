All right. Great. So let's welcome our next speaker, Dan DeAngelis, and he will talk some of the work which is for our students. Welcome, Jim. Thank you. Thank you. And first of all, I thank the organizers. This is probably the first time in a long time I've actually been snowed on. And it talks about exciting too. So I really enjoyed my state. So, I'm going to talk about the worker of my grad student, Lynn Hao-Chu. And this is really all her work. What you see in the title, Spatial Patterns and Log Transients, those are things that she found. And really accidentally, that wasn't the initial purpose of this work. So, I'll talk. This work. So I'll talk about what the purpose is and how the these. Well, let me okay. Talk about the purpose of the bottling study of the invasive Ponditaria crucipis, which is water hyacinth. It's a very, very nasty, invasive plant. A specially explicit model of the species competition of that plant with. Of that plant with subverse vegetation, the results, formation of long transient, regular spatial pattern, and a description of the end explanation of how it ends. If there's time, I'll talk a little bit about another student's work, my former Matt Grett, master's student, John McBlue, who's now working with Bob Hope. Bob Hope. Okay, the curpus, the study of the dynamics of interaction of submerged native aquatic macrobrite, we call it SAV, an invasive floating aquatic vegetation, water hyacinth, we call it FAV, with biocontrol weevil, Diogitina iconia, which is applied to the FAV. The objective is. The objective is to guide how to best balance herbicide and biocontrol treatments. So the water hyacinths is very nasty invasive. It forms, it's a floating vegetation and it smothers the submerged vegetation underneath it. That's other problems too, because it decreases oxygen in the water. In the water. So the idea of the model was to try to figure out how to, well, we have to use herbicides, but we don't want to decrease that as much as possible. So biocontrol can help do that. Some of these papers show how that has biocontrol can decrease the necessary use of herbicides. So that's all very well and good, but that's. Well and good, but that's not what I'm going to talk about. So, first, I'll say what the model system looks like. It's a floating vegetation up here. It reduces the sunlight to the submersed plants. They're both competing with with for nutrients, but the submersed is a better competitor. It doesn't rely as heavily on nutrients in the water column. Nutrients in the water column. We're using biocontrol weevils on floating plants, and there's also nutrient. And we're doing this in a spatial grid model, 50 by 50 meter spatial grid. It's a simulation model. Okay, the model is based on Based on the model of computation of submersed and floating vegetation. Skeffer et al. 2003 is a classical model for submersed and floating vegetation. We simulate it in daily time steps. We have equations for each of the 2,500 pixels. And I'm not going to go through and explain these because the model is very well explained in both, of course, the original paper at Skeffer et al. Original paper at Skepretal, but also in the paper that I've uploaded in the folder. One thing is that there is direct competition of floating vegetation on the submersed vegetation by this term in the denominator. But there's indirect competition of Of the submerged vegetation on the floating vegetation through reduction in total nutrient in the water column. And according to the Skeffer-ad-Al model, the total nutrient in the system is constant. Water column, that which is in the submersed vegetation, which is in the floating. Okay, we've combined this, so we've combined this now with. So, we've combined this now with the model of Helena von Schalkig of the weevil Neocitina liconia. And I won't go through that, but the basic, the two important key functions are the consumption rate of the feeding rate of the second stage larvae of the neocetina on FAV is given by this expression, where total This expression, where total L2 is the total population of L2 larvae. And there's a survival, there's a density-dependent survival of the larvae. So it's density-dependent and it's a little complex, but it depends on, it's inversely dependent on the total population of L2 larger. The other aspect of the model is the life cycle of the biocontrol weevils, which goes from eggs to adults by 75 days. And so there's time, there's intervals of time in each of these stages, daily time steps. We described that by a Leslie matrix and the And along the diagonal are the matrices 12 by 12, 29 by 29, and so forth. The T submatrices, they're just simple, they're just one element that transfers the final stage of each of these stages to the next stage. Then the aspect of The aspect of fire control is that adult weevils are added every 300 days to get both fire control started, and then they act as a disturbance to areas of the center of the grid. We're not adding these adults everywhere, but to an area in the center of the grid. A few other important aspects of the mom. A few other important aspects of the model. The adults, weevils, have a daily survival rate, and that is also density dependent, depending on the FAV density. So they need some density of FA to survive. And of course, the pupae add into adults every day. Their movement rules, vegetation concerns. Movement rules: vegetation can spread to adjacent empty pixels when threshold biomass is reached in that pixel, in the pixel from which it's spreading. Adult revolves can move to adjacent pixels when threshold density, when they reach a threshold density, and the threshold density of FAB in an adjacent pixel is high enough. The weevil larvae don't move, the nutrient diffuses. The nutrient diffuses, and we're looking in the high nutrient, high nitrogen regime. We're saying that nitrogen is high enough that the floating vegetation will take over. At low nitrogen levels, the submerged vegetation will survive. At intermediate levels, there's a bi stability. And this is all shown in the model scaffolding off. Things are. Things to remember: 41 days are taken from day one egg class to the day one L2 larvae class, the older larvae that actually are the main feeders on the vegetation, on FAB. 34 days from day one, L2 larvae to adults. And this model is described in 2 and De Angelus. Junior and De Angelis, which is on the folder. Okay, so that's the model. And I essentially worked with Lin Hao Chu in developing this. And we thought, well, we'd use it for the rates of applicability, application of the thing, probably a couple of thousand dates, a few years it might be about. Years it might be valid as for projecting the use of fire control and herbicides. Lin Howe is a very curious person, very good scientist, he's curious and persistent. And what she did was carry out these simulations for much longer periods of time. Long enough to show the development of what I'll show. Development of what I'll show is the stripe pattern, and then to show the final end of the stripe pattern. Okay, so a dynamic regular stripe pattern of rock scissors paper. It's the Weevil FAV. SAV forms and persists for thousands of days. Thousands of days is long beyond what you'd think actually this system really is, now is really valid for. That was really valid for, but theoretically, it's interesting. And despite the stochastic disturbances in the form of added adult revolves. At some point in the simulation, which varies, depending on the random number initiator, an apparently insignificant spatial deviation. Insignificant spatial deviation of a small set of pixels triggers an instability that grows rapidly until the stripe pattern has been replaced by a chaotic appearing pattern. So this is what happens. So by day 4000, this pattern has formed. These stripes are moving left and upwards at a rate of about a few centimeters per day, maybe five centimeters or so. Centimeters or so. And by day 13,000, it's still there. But at each of these stages, you can note little dots in there. And that's where adults have been added, and they've kind of eaten into the FAV. And the SAV has grown in response to that. And that keeps happening. It happens every 300 days. And generally, nothing. Nothing really happens. Pattern persists. And then by day 15, 1500, it's gone. Totally changed. And you can see these patterns of the change here in these diagrams. The end of a long transient occurring here. Okay, so why does this happen? So, we're going to talk about the anatomy of the end of the long transient. And we're going to examine only the last days of this. We're not going to talk about the formation of the chit. It's a different story. But the following slides are going to show the FAV, the adult weevils, and the L2R larvae, and only the L2R larvae, because they're the ones that are actually feeding on the epilevium. On the equilibrium. Okay, so what is going to happen? We're looking at time period from about days 12,700, which is 100 days after a disturbance, after a number of adult weevils have been added. So you can see where the adult weevils have eaten into this stripe of FAB. Of FAV. These are heat maps, so you can see the yellow is high densities of FAV. They've eaten into that, but there's a feedback because they sort of over-exploit the adults, the weevils overexploit the FAV, and there is a density dependence of adults on the FAV. So you can see the adults. These. So you can see the adults having some whole gaps in their pixels, also. But the larvae are doing okay. There are a lot of larvae in there. Okay. About 12,800, 200 days after the disturbance, everything seems to be sort of okay again. Now there's a new disturbance in day 13,200, and then 50 days after that new disturbance. And 50 days after that new disturbance, you can see the pattern with a lot of adults there. The larvae, second stage larvae, have started to come in. Now, this is 100 days after the disturbance, now there are a lot of holes in the FAV and also in the adult. But Romney seemed to be doing okay. To be doing okay. But then you get up here that the FAV is a little bit hollowed out, the dolls hollowed out, and now the larvae is starting to have a hole. So things have happened in the meantime over the last 65 days that have caused this to start to look a little bit ragged. Then, on day 13,300, On day 13,375, almost precisely, something is going on here. You can't see, you may not see it. There's a little blue dot in the center. That blue dot is a growth of the FAV in a pixel. It is slightly out of step with the wave. The adults are a little bit hollowed out. Now the larvae are really high. Now, the larvae are really hollowed out. And then, as we proceed down, you can see this instability is growing. The larvae continue to be hollowed out, and then by day 13,500, you can see this large island of FAB has broken away. Okay, so that gives you an overview. So that gives you an overall picture. But we want to understand exactly what's happening. Linau, she's very persistent and really wants to know what's going on. So we're going to look at these days, about 3,000,600, actually about 13,375 up to about 13,500 in a little more detail. And now we're going to zero in. We're going to zero in. What's happening is right in here. It's this little point, which is the source of everything. So if we now zero in on a 5 by 3 grid area, we can see, yeah, well, I'll go to the next slide, which will start to show this. Okay. Okay, day 13,374. There's some FAV here. There's some FAV here. There's some larvae here. Okay, larvae here, some larvae there. They're not in the same cell as the FAB. The larvae don't move. So that's important. The larvae don't move. The adults can move. The larvae don't move. So these larvae are somewhat irrelevant, at least to this guy. And by this, there's some adults. There's some adults here. Adults can move and then they can produce eggs, but that takes a long time then for that to become a martyr. Okay, so by day 13,386, we still have the FAV here. Larvae seem to be going away. They are here. Away. They are here, but they're kind of irrelevant down here anyway. So adults. By day 13,396, the FAV is starting to grow. Neither the larvae nor the adults can catch up. The larvae can't move. The adults are there, but they're by the time they produce eggs, by the time they produce larvae, it's going to be a little bit late. So the FAB is growing. So the FAB is growing now. Larvae still hang in there. Adults are starting to move in a little bit more. But now the FAV is growing. Larvae not doing too much yet. Adults kind of going in, but the FAV is ahead of them. So the FAB continues to grow. The larvae and adults really can't catch up. Really can't catch up. So, by day 13,416, you can see this little island is broken off, and larvae still coming in a little bit, but not too much. Adults now are starting to move in a little bit more. And so let's go to the next. Okay, so now the FA, by this time, the FAB has really broken away. Really broken away. Adults starting to come in big time now, but it's going to be a long time before they produce larvae that can feed on the FAV. So the FAV continues to grow and grow. Finally, we're getting this thing, this little island that's broken away where the FAB is ahead of the adults. Head of the adults in orphan, and that by day 15,000 it becomes this. So basically, that shows everything that's happening. And it's basically all, it's based on the idea that of the ecology system, that adults can move, larvae can't move, and there's long time gaps between when eggs become larvae and larvae become eggs. And largely become adults. So I think it's all explained. Okay, the summary model of regular species competition between FAV and SAV with biocontrol of FAV, rock sissues, paper, regular stripe pattern, dynamic pattern emerged. The pattern was a long transient that ended. This showed how a long transient changed into a Changed into an irregular pattern. So Lindhauf calls this a butterfly effect. You could also call it a weevil effect. So the end of the long transient is ultimately due to stochastic factors. A paper by Ellen Hastings that talks about that. Stochastic vectors can end these long transients. This is an This is an actual example of exactly how it happens. The stochasticity was mainly due to adult weevils being added to FAV above a certain biomass near the center of the lattice. The causal factors is that the weevil's life history causes it to be unable to control the specific spatial pattern of disturbance. Now, this is not a one-off simulation. We've done 15 to 20 simulations, and it just happened, the same thing happens. And it just happened, the same thing happens in a different time and a different place. But it seems to be a consistent pattern with this model. Okay, so are there time constraints yet? We have time. Five minutes. Five minutes. Okay, great. Okay, so that is an interesting start. But now we have a simulation model. We think it does interesting things. And we can use simulations as experimental systems. So we can do little manipulations, whatever we want, just to see what happens. Alternative evolution of spatial pattern, I'll talk about. Suppose a small press disturbance can cause the following transformation. And this press disturbance is, in this case, we decreased the feeding rate of the L2 larvae on. Larvae on the vegetation. Just decreased it by a bit. So, what happens? It was decreased on day 13,000. And this is just showing the SAV. In this case, we're not looking at FAV. We're looking at the SAV a little bit, make a little bit pictures that are easier to see. Not too much is happening. There's some disturbances here, but the There's some disturbances here, but the system seems to recover. But then, something by 600 days after the initial disturbance, something weird is happening here, which then grows and turns into another type of pattern, a sort of circular, expanding circular stripes, which then. Stripes, which then that seems to turn into something else. And you can see kind of on the diagram where this has turned into the circular pattern. And then, although the pattern does, the pattern does, it goes through this pattern for a while, but then it seems to be returning to a circular pattern. So that's a lot of unexplained stuff that, you know, we're thinking about. You know, we're thinking obviously things are going on at these points like right in here, right in here, which we would like to explore. It takes time to do that. Okay, I mean the problem is it takes a couple, it takes at least a day to do a simulation. It takes at least a day to do a simulation this long, so that's why we haven't explored it any further. But I'd like to see if there continue changes in these patterns. So, okay. Okay, I'll just, okay, I have a I'll just talk about, very quickly, talk about work with Yuan Ningliu. And she's working on He's working on spatially explicit modeling of mellaluca quintaria, which is an invasive tree in many places in South Florida. And we have a biocontrol weevil oxyopsvitiosa acting on that. And so John Ling has done a lot. Yuan Ming has done a lot of work. Basically, the work with Yuan Ming, studying invasion of Malaka trees, is to look at the ability to predict invasion success. In other words, search for an early warning signal. So it's a very complex model. It looks at the, it's an individual-based model of the growth of every tree going through all of its phases and competition with neighboring trees. Neighboring trees, as described in some of her papers. One of the objectives is to predict, try to predict when you have invasive, these reds are invasives at the edge of this area of forests, native forests, whether they will be able to invade or not. So in this case, you see these reds accumulating and sort of moving in. Sort of moving in, starting from this strike. But the trajectories of the invader biomass can go in all directions. Sometimes it succeeds, sometimes it doesn't. So why does it succeed? It seems to be that given some scattered invaders, if they can sort of form a kind of a common Kind of a compact group inside, they can succeed. If a critical size and shape of invading mellow literature is reached, it should be able to advance in a phallax fashion because it has the property of its litter having a suppressive effect on native sweetlings. So, okay, I'm just going to quit there and Okay, we're looking at larger systems too, but we're okay. I think I'll just skip that, go straight to the acknowledgements, funding resource, USGS Survey's Greater Everglades Priority Ecosystem Science. And thank you. Do you guys have any questions? Yes, we will. In your rewill model, do you always introduce the rewill in the center when you try? Yeah, yeah, I mean, yes, yeah, we've always had, you know, it was just a choice. There are a lot of factors that can be varied, and we haven't changed that. But it could be, you know, we could do a lot of different things. We could introduce it uniformly over the whole. But I think looking at Looking at things like fire control, you probably well, you probably had look you're looking for specific patterns of introduction. We haven't looked carefully at the number of different invasive patterns. Oh, John, uh, Talon, over there. Yeah, hi. Hi, great talk. And um And funny kind of question I'm going to ask you, which is that you remember long ago I had a paper with Kevin Higgins where we had a spatial model that had a long transient and then it broke down. And it seems like it was, it seems like the mechanism also been somewhat similar. So this was one where, I mean, never, after the initial paper, we looked at this, we never published it. It would be interesting to see if it ends up being. It'd be interesting to see if it ends up being the same. Because that was one where it was just a single species, and essentially there was more or less overriding time to oscillation, the two-step oscillation in the spatial sense with a weight that didn't quite fit the domain. And the domain had essentially zero flux.
