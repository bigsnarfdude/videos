Dave has to unmute. You're muted, Dave. Sorry. So let me remind you that at the bottom of the slide, I have a URL where I've posted both these slides and a number of survey articles that are related to what I'm talking about today. What I'm talking about today. Okay, so last time I talked about quantifier elimination as a model-theoretic tool that can be used in a number of different algebraic settings. What I'd like to do is okay, sorry, let me give you the outline of what I'm going to do today. I'm first going to describe a model-theoretic test for when a theory. A model theoretic test for when a theory has quantifier elimination. I'll give an example of that, how that works in algebraically closed fields. And then I'll introduce differentially closed fields, which Lev mentioned briefly in the last talk. I'll sketch the proof of quantifier elimination of that in a couple of applications. Then, hopefully, I'll have time to talk about canonical definitions, which is intimately related. It was basically what Leb was talking about at the end of last. Was talking about at the end of last talk, and hopefully, I'll get to say at least one slide or two to talk about further interplay between model theory and differential algebra. Okay, so this slide looks very technical, but it ends up being crucial to everything, to a lot of applications of model theory to algebra. And it's going to be a test to see when a theory has quantifier elimination. So it says, okay, start with a theory. So it says, okay, start with a theory T, like algebraically closed fields or real closed fields. And suppose I have the following conditions, that for any quantifier-free formula, if I have two models of the theory and a common substructure of the two, and some parameters coming from the common substructure. Then, if an existential formula in one variable Formula in one variable is true in one of them, it's also true in the other. Okay, if that's true, whenever I have this picture, then the theory has quantifier elimination. So here's the diagram. Anytime I have two models of the theory, I have some common substructure inside of them, but inside of both, and I have this quantifier-free formula phi and some b that satisfies that formula. Some B that satisfies that formula in one of the structures, then I have to be able to find that in the other structure as well. Okay, so let me give an app, let me show how this test can be used to prove quantifier elimination in algebraically closed fields. So let ACF be the axioms for algebraically closed fields. They say the field is, they say first they go a field, and then for each D, you'll have an axiom saying that any non-zero polynomial of degree D has a Zero polynomial of degree D has a solution. We saw in the last lecture how we can say things like that in the first order language. Then Tarski's theorem is that algebraically closed fields have quantifier elimination. So here's a proof of that using this test. So the data is what I have to show is that if K and L are algebraically closed fields, and A inside of K and L is a common domain, and phi is a quantifier-free formula where A fire-free formula where the parameters come from A. If I can find a B in K that satisfies phi, then I can also find a B in L, a C in L. So let's look at this formula phi. It's a quantifier-free formula in the language of fields. So all it's going to say is going to be a Boolean combination of saying P of V equals zero, where P is a polynomial in just one variable. Where P is a polynomial in just one variable, mind you. This is the beauty of this test, that it simplifies things to just looking one variable at a time. So P is a polynomial in one variable over the domain A. Now, just doing some algebraic manipulation with the quantifier-free formula, without loss of generality, I can assume it looks like this. It just says that finitely many polynomials over Finitely many polynomials over A vanish at V, and some polynomial G doesn't vanish at V. I mean, I could say finitely many polynomials don't vanish at V, but then I can just take their product. So it's enough to look at just one. Okay. So this is the data. I have a quantifier-free formula that sits over some subdomain of both K and L. Then I want to show if I can find a solution to it in one of them, I can find a solution. Solution to it in one of them, I can find a solution in the other. Okay, so this is my formula. Okay, there are two cases to consider. One of this is the case where there actually aren't any Fi's, and phi in this case is just G of V is not zero. Well, if G is a not, you know, so I know that G of this element B is not zero, so G is not the zero polynomial, so it only has finitely many zeros. So in L. Many zeros. So in L, you know, most of the elements of L satisfy g of c not zero. So all but finally many. So that's easy to find something in L satisfying this formula if there are no F i's. Okay, the more interesting case, suppose that at least one of the Fi's is a non-zero polynomial over A, and Fi of B is zero. Now I take K0, the algebraic closure of A and K. Okay, so B satisfies it. Okay, so B satisfies a polynomial over A, so B is in the algebraic closure. Okay, so I've got this picture. I've got K. Inside it, I've got K0, the algebraic closure of A, and then B is inside the algebraic closure of A. But now we just use some basic algebra. That there's a field embedding of K0 into L fixing A. And that field embedding is going to take B to something. Going to take B to something that satisfies exactly the same polynomials over A. So, in particular, it'll satisfy this formula phi. Okay, so this is, I think, a good example of this sort of general model theoretic picture that ultimately I prove quantifier elimination results by having to prove some kind of algebraic embedding results about fields. So, here it's just the fact that. It's just the fact that it's just basically the basic properties of algebraic closure. The algebraic closure extends into an embedding of the, so I can embed the algebraic closure into A and any field that contains A. If I wanted to go through Tarski's, if I wanted to go through a proof of quantifier elimination for real closed fields. Elimination for real closed fields, it would be almost exactly the same. The quantifier free formulas are a little bit more complicated because they involve inequalities, but ultimately I'm going to use the fact that the Art and Schreier theory of real fields, that every ordered field has a unique real closure. And that'll give me, allow me to more or less copy this proof in the real closed field case and get a quantifier elevation for real closed fields. And this is sort of a general. And this is sort of a general model theoretic idea that this result allows me to prove quantifier elimination results by understanding sort of algebraic embedding theorems. Okay, let me quickly just say that the kind of applications I gave of quantifier elimination in real close fields, the same arguments. The same arguments carry over here. ACF by itself is not a complete theory because it doesn't determine the characteristic of the field. But if I can take ACF 0, which says I have an algebraically closed field and infinitely many axioms, which together assert its characteristic 0, then in fact, this is going to completely axiomatize the theory of the complex numbers. So anything I can prove about the algebraic properties of the complex numbers. Algebraic properties of the complex numbers, I can prove just using the axioms of algebraically closed fields. I mean, this means things like if I wanted to show something about the complex numbers and for some reason it was easier to show it about the algebraic numbers, I could do that and it would still be true about the complex numbers. Okay, definable sets are going to be quantifier-free definable. And again, what are the quantifier-free definable things here? Well, they're just Boolean combinations of polynomial equations. Combinations of polynomial equations. So these are the constructible sets of algebraic geometry. And quantifier elimination here has this form, which is sometimes called Chevrolet's theorem, that the image of a constructible set under a polynomial map is constructible. This follows from quantifier elimination because the image of a constructible set under a polynomial map would be definable. But if you think about it carefully, this in terms of And in terms of you know, if you think about one of the things this tells you is the projection of a constructible set is constructible, so the projection of a definable set is definable, and that's exact, that's sorry, that this is sort of exactly um quantifier elimination. I think it's I think it's debatable whether Chevrolet knew of Tarski's result at the time. I think it's a lot of conjecture that he did. Of conjecture that he did. Okay. Another property of this is: I want to look at existentially closed fields. So I say that a field is existentially closed. If any time I have a system of polynomials and it has a solution in some extension field, it already has a solution in k. And a corollary to this is that algebraically closed fields are exactly the same. That algebraically closed fields are exactly the extension, the existentially closed fields. This is sometimes called the weaknel-Stellens. Okay, certainly every existentially closed field is going to be algebraically closed. But for the converse, start with an algebraically closed field and an extension field where I have a solution to a system of polynomial equations. And again, in many variables over L. This statement that there's a This statement that there's a solution to these equations by quantifier elimination is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula with parameters in k. But this quantifier-free formula, this is again one of the properties of quantifier-free formulas. They're just sort of computations about the parameters. It doesn't matter which field you're looking in. If I look in one field and do this computation, I look in a bigger field and do the same computation, I'm going to get the same thing. I'm just doing arithmetic operations and checking equality. Arithmetic operations and checking equality. So when I take the quantifier free formula psi that's equivalent to this existential formula, that's going to be true in K, and if only if it's true in L. And so that tells me that this is also true in K. Now I should say I did this for this formula, but I mean take any formula you want with parameters from K. If it's true in L, it's going to be true in K, and vice versa. Okay. Okay. So I did this to motivate the definition I'm going to come up with in a minute. So now finally, we're going to get to differential fields. So we have a field. I'm going to restrict myself to looking at characteristic zero and a derivation. So it's a linear map that satisfies the Leibniz rule. And often I'm going to write x prime for dx. If I have a differential field I can extend to a differential polynomial ring. A differential polynomial ring where I take the just the ring in infinitely many indeterminants x1 to xn and then all their derivatives. And I can extend the derivation from k to this ring in a unique way just by setting the sorry this should there should be parentheses around these j's and j plus 1. These are formally the jth derivative of xi and the j plus first derivative of xi. And the question I want to ask is: what are the existentially closed differential fields? So, again, if we're studying solutions to systems of differential equations, algebraic differential equations, it makes sense to try and work inside some kind of universal domain, which one of the first properties you want of a universal domain is that if I could solve equations in a bigger field, I can solve them here already. So, I might want to know what are these? So, can we axiomatize this class? So, probably the first result in this subject was due to Abraham Robinson, which says that the existentially closed fields can be axiomatized. His axioms are, to any outsider, not very transparent. I mean, they very much use sort of the written theory of differential ideals. So, I'm not going to describe what they are, but I'm going to give, at least in the case of a single derivation, a much easier accuracy. Derivation, a much easier axiomatization. And this is the collection of differentially closed fields. So these are axioms given by Lonar Blum, who I'm pleased to see is here at this meeting this week. So I have to start with the algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. I need to say something about solving differential equations. And much like, you know. And much like in algebraically closed fields, existential closures about things in all in any number of variables, but the axioms for algebraically closed fields just talk about one variable. And we'd like to do that here. And that's what, so here's a simple thing that would be true in an existentially closed field. And I want to argue, and that's that if I take two non-zero differential polynomials, Differential polynomials, and the order of f is bigger than the order of g, then I can find an element of k where f is zero and g is not zero. Now, it's very easy to give axioms for this class. As I said before, you can't really quantify over all differential polynomials. But what I can do is for a fixed order and degree, I can say that I can write down this statement. Say that I can write down this statement, and then I write down those statements for all possible orders and degrees, and those will give me axioms for this class. And ultimately, we're going to show is that this class is exactly the class of existentially closed differential fields. Now, the embarrassing question that might be on your mind is what's an example of this? And the answer is there are no natural examples, no known natural examples. Examples, no known natural examples. I would say no natural examples. I mean, any field you can think of, even if it has a you can solve a lot of differential equations, it's hard to give a concrete example. I mean, there are results of Seidenberg saying that, for example, you can find that any countable differential field arises as a ring of germs of Meromorphic functions, as a subring of the germs of Meromorphic functions at a point. Terms of Meromorphic functions at a point. So I can find some examples that way, but those I think are again a tough construction rather than a natural example. Let me just say why this is true in existential closed fields. If I start with a differential field and I have two polynomials where f is of higher order than g, I can always find an extension where I solve the equations. Again, using some of the Again, using some of the basic ideal theory, I can find a prime differential ideal P with f in P such that no higher order such that everything in P has order at least the order of F. Then I can build L by just taking k of x mod passing to the fraction and passing to the fraction field and extending the derivation in the unique way to the fraction field. And that'll give me an example of a field that extends k. Extends k where if I take the image of the image of the variable in this, that'll be a solution to this equation. So I can always find some extension, and then by carefully iterating this, not so carefully, if k is any differential field, I can extend, find an extension that's differentially closed just by doing some kind of transfinite induction using this law. Okay, so differential closed fields. Okay, so differential closed fields do exist, and it has the property that every field has a differentially closed extension. And now the key result of the subject, and why there's a good model theory here to begin with, is that you do have a quantifier elimination result. And this is one of the results from Blohm's. Okay, so we're going to apply the quantifier elimination test from the earlier screens. Let K and L be differentially close. Let K and L be differentially closed fields. Let little k be a common differential subfield. And take some element that's in big k but not in little k. And suppose it satisfies some differential polynomials over, sorry, this should be a little k. Then we need to find a c at l that satisfies the same. Okay, well certainly. Certainly, it would suffice to do even more, namely to find a differential field embedding of the differential field generated by K and B and L. That would be good enough because the image would satisfy the same equations over K. All the same equations, not just F's and G's. And then a little bit of model theoretic yoga. And I'm using the name very rich here. This is slightly, I'm asking slightly less than what. I'm asking slightly less than what Gleb was asking for when he said large in the last one. What I really need is this: that if I have a set of equations and inequations from little k and every finite subset is solvable in L, then the whole system is solvable in L. So sigma you think of here as being an infinite system. But if I want to solve that, if I can solve every finite If I can solve every finite subset of it, then I can solve the whole thing. And again, model theory tells me I can always extend L to a bigger structure that has this property such that the same finite systems are solvable in K and L. So this would be the same. So it's just as good for me to work in that setting. Okay, so I've drawn L to be very big here. So what I need to do is find a C and L such that F and C satisfy exactly the same. C satisfy exactly the same equations over little k. So there's an easy case. If b is differentially transcendental over L, I'm going to let my set system sigma just be g of x is non-zero for every non-zero differential polynomial over. Okay. If I take finitely many of these equations, again, because L is. Again, because L is a differentially closed field, I can find something where the product of the Gi's is not zero. And therefore, every finite subset of cis sigma is solvable in L. Therefore, by this richness assumption, there's a C and L that's differentially transcendental over K, and I can just map B to C, and they'll satisfy the same equations over little K, namely none of them. Okay. The second case is that B is differentially algebraic over K. Differentially algebraic over k. Let p be the prime differential ideal of all the polynomials little k satisfied by b. I can find an f in p that's of minimal order and degree. And then p is actually the unique prime ideal over little k, such that f is in p and no or and no g of lower orders in p. Again, this is somehow the basic written. This is somehow the basic writ theory of prime differential ideas. Okay, so I'm going to let sigma say that f is zero and none of the g's are zero where g has lower order. But again, since L is a differentially closed field, any finite subset can be solvable in L. Thus, by richness, sigma is solvable in L. And any solution to sigma, any solution to, sorry, that should be a big sigma. That should be a big sigma. I can then map B to C, and that would, so C would then satisfy exactly the same polynomials over little k. And that would be my, so that finishes the proof of quantifier elimination. And again, it satisfies the same sort of paradigm. I'm eliminating quantifiers by proving natural algebraic embedding theorems. Embedding theorems. We can go through some basic consequences just as before. If I take any two differentially closed fields, they're going to satisfy exactly the same sentences. Why? Because I can find a quantifier-free sentence, psi, that's equivalent to phi. That sentence psi will be true in K if it's true at any substructure. And the substructure here I can look at is Q, which is just the rational field with the trivial derivation. So if K is true and if psi is true in K, then Q is true, and Psi is true in Q, and this should be an L. Psi is true in L. And then again, since psi and P are equivalent in differentially closed fields, they'll be equivalent in DCF. So that gives me, let's see, do I say? Um, let's see, do I say it here? No, so in particular, that gives me the theory of differentially closed fields is decidable. There's an algorithm, there's going to be an algorithm that decides for any sentence whether or not it's true in any differentially closed field or every differentially closed field. Again, the algorithm I'm this gives you is this silly logician's algorithm where you search for proof of. For a proof of, if I want to know if phi is true, I search for a proof of phi or a proof of not phi, and eventually I'm going to find one or I'm going to find the other. Okay, definable sets, again, have a natural interpretation here. They're going to be finite Boolean combinations of differential algebraic varieties, or at least sometimes Colchin constructible sets, we call these, or differentially constructible. Also, Also, differentially closed fields are going to be existentially closed. So I'm going to have satisfied what I wanted at the beginning. And it's exactly the same proof. Suppose I start with K, I have an extension field L, and a system of equations over K that has a solution in L. Then there's a quantifier-free formula that expresses this system of equations has a solution, and that is going to be a quantity. Is going to be true in L if and only if it's true in K. So the equivalent formula, namely, if there is a solution, is going to be true in K. So this is the wonderful thing about Bloom's axioms in that while we're just talking about very simple systems of equations in one variable, we've gotten this result, we've gotten existential closeness. We've said we've basically can solve any. Closeness. We've said we basically can solve any system of equations that could be solved anywhere. And again, this argument I gave here, I could replace there exists xf1 up to fm is 0 by any sentence. And I could do the same argument there. That sentence would be true in K if it's true in L. Okay. Let me give an algebraic consequence. Suppose I have a prime differential ideal. Differential ideal and a g that's not in p. Then I can find an x in kn such that the entire ideal vanishes at x and g doesn't vanish at x. Okay, so a fact which is the Ritt-Raudenbusch basis theorem, the sort of an analog of the Hilbert basis theorem for radical ideals in different Theorem for radical ideals and differential fields. I can find finitely many differential polynomials in P such that if those polynomials vanish at a point, everything in P vanishes at that point. So what I want to do is let L be the fraction field. Again, I'm going to let L be the fraction field of the polynomial ring mod P. And in L, I look at the image of the And in L, I look at the image of the parameters. All these polynomials over K vanish vanish at A. And G, because it's not in the prime ideal, doesn't vanish at A. So again, by existential closeness, I've got this system of equations that are true in L, they're going to be true in K as well. And I should say, I mean, I can always replace G of A is not zero by adding one more variable. not zero by adding one more variable and saying that it's that that times y is zero. Okay, so this gives me a proof of this this version of the Nolstellensatz. You can extend it to radical ideals using sort of differential, again, the differential primary decomposition. I want to give a second I want to give a second example. I'm going to go back to the algebraic closed fields case just because it's notation and a little bit simpler. And I mean, this is something a lot of people work on doing concrete versions of this. It says, suppose I fix d, m, and n, then I can find a k such that for any algebraically closed field, so m is the number of equations, n is the number of variables, and d is the number of numbers. Variables and d is a bound on their degree. Okay, then if I want to know, does the system F1 up to Fm have a solution? Well, the Nilschellensatz tells me it has a solution if and only if I can't write, if and only if one is in the ideal they generate. But this says I can find a bound k depending only on dm and n such that this has a solution if and only if I can't write one as a combination. Can't write one as a combination of the Fi's, where the Gi's have degree of most k. I mean, there would be a differential version of this where I would bound not only the degrees of polynomials, but I have to bound the number of derivations I take. But just for notation, I want to just do this. So here's a proof of this. And again, this is sort of a generic pattern of a proof that you can be used in a lot of different settings. In a lot of different settings, I'm going to write down generic polynomials F1 up to Fm of degree D, where I just put down generic coefficients, just new variables for the coefficients. And for each L, I can write a sentence down saying that one can't be written as a sum of GIFIs where the GIs have degree at most k. Again, I'm quantifying over the possible coefficients. Again, I'm quantifying over the possible coefficients of all the g's. This is just a single sentence. Then I look at the theory, which says that t has that, sorry, the system of equations has no solution, and all the phi i's hold, the phi i's hold. Now, this theory can't be, there's no model of this theory. Because if I had a model of this, sorry, I should add in the axioms for algebraically. Sorry, I should add in the axioms for algebraically closed fields here, too. If I had a model of this theory, I would have an algebraically closed field and a system of polynomials that doesn't have a solution where I can't write one as a combination, where I allow the GIs to be any possible degree, and that would contradict the Nolstellen sales. So, by the compactness theorem, which I mentioned, So, by the compactness theorem which I mentioned last time, there's already a finite subset that's not satisfiable. And that finite subset will then give me a bound, such that if I have F1 up to Fm equals zero, I just basically look for the largest K that's in there. So if I can find the smallest, then, anyways, we can find polynomials of a bounded degree that have most k. And again, what I'm And again, the importance of this proof, I mean, this is something that's, you know, there are much better and more concrete proofs a lot of ways, but it gives you: I can prove bounds that there are bounds in the differential Null Schellensatz the same way. I can prove bounds in the real Nusschellenzazz. I can prove bounds on Hilbert's 17th problem. So the same type, this exactly same pattern of proof gives those results. Okay. Okay. Okay. So rather than, I'm going to change gears now, rather than talk about quantifier elimination, I want to talk a little bit about the connect to Leb's talk, Leb's talk, which when I wrote these slides, I didn't know he was giving it. So it might be different if I had seen it first. I'm going to call this existence of canonical parameters, canonical bases. So I'm going to. So, I'm going to fix k a differentially closed field. This is going to look like a very different setup, but it's really not. I want to take, I want to first look at the notion of a definable family. So I'm going to take a definable set in n plus m space and a definable set in m space, which I think of as the space of parameters. And then for every element b and b, I want to look at I want to look at the definable set A sub B, which is just the, oh, sorry, this is a horrible typo. I've left off something horrible here. It's sort of the A and K to the N such that AB is an A. Sorry. Sorry, so let me do an example. I'm going to let A be the sets in a set in six space. A set in six space such that this system of differential polynomials is zero. And I think of the b's, the y's, as being my parameters where the y's are coming from four space over the constant field. So I've got a definable set in a high-dimensional space. If I name, if I fix four constants A, B, C, D, then A sub A B C D should be This system, the solute, the x that satisfy this system of equations. Okay, so I hope this makes sense, given there are a number of typos on this slide. I'm basically looking at a space in a higher, a definable set in a high-dimensional space, and a subset of M-space, which I think of the set of parameters. For each element of the parameter space, I look at the fiber above that. Fiber above that. And I think of that as giving me not just one definable set, but giving me this whole family of definable sets. Okay, so one way of thinking about an identification problem is suppose x is somewhere, I know x is somewhere in this family. Can I determine for which b x is a b? So can I determine the parameter that gives me this? So the kind of questions I want to know is, first, So, the kind of questions I want to know is: first of all, is there a unique B that does this? And it's easy to see maybe not. Even in the example I just gave, I could take all these constants and multiply them all by seven. And that would give me exactly the same definable set. So there could be lots of different parameters. Leb gave examples of this earlier today, too. And if so, and I know enough elements. And I know enough elements of X, can I determine B? So the theorem of Poisson from the early 80s is that, okay, so we know that there's going to be a problem here because the answer, possibly it's impossible to do this. What Bois says: suppose you have a definable family. Definable family. Then I can find a new definable family D. Possibly, I put the L in red here, so it's possibly in a possibly in a different dimensional space, such that the families they define are the same. So if there's a B that defines a family that is a parameter for in the family. That is a parameter for in the family given by A, there'll be an E such that it's in the family given by D. And if it's in the family given by D, it's also in the family given by A. But we have the additional property that in the family given by D, the parameter is unique. So in model theory, this is called elimination of imaginaries. Is called elimination of imaginaries. It's not necessarily related to quantifier elimination. I mean, it's and it's not necessarily, I mean, it's a good property of a theory to have. And some of the good theories we've been talking about, like algebraic closed fields and real closed fields, have this property as well. But some good theories, like the theory of the Piatics, does not have this. This is not true in the Piatics. And some bad theories. In the P-adics, and some bad theories like the theory of the integers, this kind of thing is true there. Okay, this is so what this says is that if I have a definable family, I can change the definable family, possibly changing the dimension of the parameter space, so that I have this sort of unique parameter for each definable set. Something that I think is important to the kind of real application. Of real applications. If you actually had this definable set B in the constants to begin with, then this set E could be taken in the constants also. And I think that's useful for making this general result useful in the applications. Okay, and then I can call DE a canonical definition of x and e a canonical parameter for x. And E a canonical parameter for x. Then the question is: suppose you have a canonical definition, then the key fact for model theory is that if I have sufficiently many independent elements in x, where independent has a technical model theoretic definition here, but then I can always express e as a differential rational function in the x i's. Now, Gleb was looking at the case where you didn't want Was looking at the case where you didn't want a differential rational function, but a rational function. If I'm in the case where everything is in the constants, this is the same thing. It would be a rational function. But again, the result is more general so that you could actually talk about canonical parameters, even if the parameters are non-constants. Again, depending on how big this parameters. What is the dimension? How big this parameter space is, I can always do this, but I may not be able to bound n. But if the parameter space is in any ways finite-dimensional, I can bound n by the dimension of d plus 1. And in applications, if it's contained in, say, the m space over the constants, m plus 1 space always works. And again, if I know more about if the Zariski closure of D is smaller, I can do get the bound to be smaller. And as I said, And as I said, this is connected, but maybe at the level of generality, hard to see, to the work the Gleb was talking about, where they're able to perform, they're able to apply this and to give reasonable algorithms that do things like pass from the definable family to the original definable family to the family where you have canonical definitions. Definitions. I've got a few minutes left, and I want to. So, I want to, I've been talking so far about things that are related to the main theorems of the meeting, themes of the meeting. I want to talk just a little bit more, give a very high-level distant overview of just some of the other places where model theory and differential algebra connect. I won't say what omega state. I won't say what omega-stable means, but this theorem, the observation of Bloom from her thesis, that the theory of differentially closed fields is omega-stable, which is a class of theories that is extensively studied in model theory. What this means for us is there are powerful theories of dimension and independence that we can use when studying differential algebra. Model theory, differential algebra has several notions of dimension. Model theory has several other notions of dimension. Theory has several other notions of dimension. You could say the same thing about algebraic geometry, and in algebraic geometry, they're all the same. In differential algebra, they're all different. They all have interesting properties and are useful at different times. These could be the model theory notions are Morley-rank or U-rank. There's differential curl dimension, there's differential transcendence degree, and more generally, Colchian polynomials, all of which are useful in doing this. Are useful in doing this. One of the early consequences of this is there's a notion of differential closure. For any differential field k, there's a differentially closed field big k extending little k such that if little k is contained in any other differentially closed field, then there's a differential embedding of k into L fixing k. This is exactly what you would say about an algebraic closure or a real closure. Algebraic closure or real closure, just changing to the context and most. And moreover, that K is unique up to isomorphism. So I think even at the time of Bloom's original work, once we knew the differentially closed fields were omega-stable, we knew the existence of differential closures. And later work of Shala allows us to conclude, allows us to actually, it was inspired by this, allows us to conclude. This allows us to conclude uniqueness. Colchin later gave proofs of this which didn't use model theoretic language, but I think were largely just translations of the model theoretic proofs into a more algebraic setting. So there are a huge number of areas where in differential algebra where model theoretic insights are helpful. Are helpful. One is differential Galois theory. Poisson showed how Colchin's differential Galois theory of strongly normal extensions could be viewed model theoretically. The main theorem could be proved model theoretically. Pele extended these ideas to a lot of settings where you look at differential Galois groups, which are differential algebraic groups rather than algebraic groups. Because that's the second topic. Because that's the second topic. And Colchin and his student Philip Cassie developed a theory of differential algebraic groups. And Pele, in particular, was able to show how the model theoretic, the things we know about in model theory about stable groups, was able to give us a lot of new insights into differential algebraic groups. I mean, one of the open questions of Colchin is whether every differential algebraic group Is isomorphic to a differential algebraic subject subgroup of an algebraic group. I mean, play showed this using model-deduct techniques, and in particular, using this sort of identity, these canonical definitions, canonical parameter ideas play a critical role there. There are applications of model theory differential algebra together to Diphantine geometry. The most noted is the Noted is this old result of Rushovsky's result in the early 90s proving the geometric Mordell-Lang conjecture. Although what I should say is Khachovsky gave a new proof of the geometric Mordell-Lange conjecture for in characteristic zero using differential algebra and gave a new proof of or gave a first proof of things in characteristic P that was motivated by And characteristic P that was motivated by this, but using separably closed fields instead of differential fields. And there's more recent work of Kasal, Freitak, and Naglu, sort of in transcendence theory and proving Ax-Linup and Weierstrass theorems that I don't think is what it's not what Ronnie's talking about this week. And then just in general, if you're trying to understand differential algebraic geometry in the sense of Boim. Geometry in the sense of boom. I mean, model-theoretic tools become very helpful in dealing with any kind of notions of dimension and of dimension and things. So, for example, RID has examples saying that algebraic, that intersection theory and differential algebraic geometry behaves very weird and doesn't have a lot of the properties you want. But there's results of Frytag saying that generically it behaves quite well. It behaves quite well. And then I have a minute or two left. So I want to say this in part because it's an introduction to two of the talks that are coming later this week. What I consider the key model theoretic problem about differentially closed fields. I say that a definable set X is strongly minimal if for any definable subset either that set is finite or the complement is finite. So basically I can't find a problem. So basically, I can't find a proper definable set that's infinite and co-infinite. So you can think of these as somehow the indecomposable sets. So in algebraically closed fields, these are more or less irreducible algebraic curves, plus or minus finally many points. And much as understanding algebraic curves is a key to understanding algebraic geometry, understanding the strong minimal sets should be a key to understanding. A key to understanding differential but optical brake geometry. So let me give three examples which show these can be extremely strange here. I mean very different. So the one example that's easy is the constant field, which is just an algebraically closed field. And the fact that it's the constant field of a differential closed field gives you no extra structure. Any subset of n-space over the constants that I can define in the differential structure, I can already define. Differential structure I could already define just in C as a field. Another example that's extremely different is monon kernels. These end up being sets where the only real structure on them is a divisible abelian group structure. And the construction is start with a simple abelian variety and take the closure of the torsion points in the Collichian topology. And these results are crucial to Hershovsky's Diophantine equations. Hershovsky's Diophantine equations. And the things which we know less about, some examples of this example of Rosenlich, y prime equals y cubed minus y squared, sort of independently Rosenlich, Colchin, and Schilla, and generic Panlevais equations. It's coming out of the work of Maglu and Pele. And these end up being sets with have no structure on them whatsoever. Let's take the first equation. Let's take the first equation. There are two special points, 0 and 1. We'll throw out 0 and 1. And then basically any permutation of the solutions of this extends to a differential automorphism of the whole field. So there's really nothing structure on these at all. These are so-called geometrically trivial sets. And trying to understand what could arise here, you know, if I look at a family, what happens? You know, if I look at a family, what happens generically are some of the more fascinating questions going on in the subject now. And the talks later this week by Reme Zhaoi and by Ronnie Naglu are contributions to this subject. So at that point, I'll stop and remind you that I will correct the slides and then repost them, but all my slides are going to be posted on this website and some auxiliary materials as well. Auxiliary materials as well. Thank you. Thank you, Dave. Let's give Dave a hand. How about we open it for questions? You can just unmute yourself and ask the question if you have one. In fact, can I say something? Can I say something? Yeah? Yeah? Yes, please. Go ahead. It's just a slight clarification, which is of today. So, Dave was talking about. Dave, can you go back to the slide where you had the canonical parameter stuff? Yes, yes, yes, yes, this one, right? So, so this is connected with what Gleb was saying. X here is an arbitrary definable set, right? It's a member. It's a member of a fiber in some family. Is that right, Dave? Yeah? Yeah, so just I think that to recover the canonical parameter from independent things, you need to have X being a differential algebraic variety. Yes. So, I mean, I'm so just a little, yeah, that's connected with. I think I want that. I probably want your, I really want a stationary, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. A stationary, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want it irreducible to here. Yeah, so I guess okay, thank you. Other questions? So I have a question. Oh, but there is a question in the chat. Maybe the author should go ahead. Why don't you ask your question, Gleb, and then we'll go to the chat? Ah, okay, okay. Ah, okay, okay. So, Dave, you mentioned the different notions of dimension again by model theory, and I read about them in the book. But would it be possible to say on high level what's the reason we have different notions of dimension and in which situations one could be more useful than another? If it's possible to say in some shirt form, if not, then not. Four. If not, then not um so one reason why we have different notions is that the sub-variety structure of a differential algebraic variety behaves very different than the algebraic variety structure of an out the algebraic sub-varieties of an algebraic variety. So, for example, you can have transcendence degree. You can have transcendence degree D differential algebraic variety, differential, transcendence degree D differential algebraic varieties that have no transcendence degree D minus one sub-varieties, or have exactly finitely many dimension D minus one sub-varieties. So, this is, and for reasons of that, say transcendence degree and cruel dimension don't work out that way. There's an example from Jim Freitag's thesis of a differential equation, one variable of order three, where there's one order two sub-variety, and somehow all the complexity is inside that sub-variety. But outside of that sub-variety, it's a strongly minimal set. Inside, it looks like two-dimensional affine space over an algebraically closed field. So, somehow you can concentrate the complexity in. The complexity, and the model theoretic problem is you can concentrate the complexity inside a small sub-variety. Somehow you expect that, you know, in algebraic geometry, your intuition is that the generic behavior is the most complex. But here the generic behavior might be the simplest. So it's one of these strange anomalies between algebraic geometry and differential algebraic geometry. Geometry and differential algebraic geometry. A good question? Okay, and Jim actually posted the example to the chat. So, yeah, thank you very much. Thank you. So, there's a question on the chat by James Hanson asking what would count as a natural model of DCF. I mean, when you say there are no natural models, what would a natural model mean? I mean, so a field of functions or a ring of power series that somehow arises in some natural setting in mathematics other than that you've tried to construct it as a differentially closed field. Could I make a comment here to that question, if Dave doesn't mind? Well, a kind of natural quotation marked example is the difference. In quotation marks, example is the differential closure of Q. It's natural, but it's a bit complicated. In the same way as the algebraic closure of Q is a bit complicated, because its absolute Galois group is right, mysterious. So it's natural definition, but it's mysterious for different reasons. It's even more mysterious in that the differential closure of Q will actually be isomorphic to proper substructures, to subfield. Perfect to proper substructures, to subfields of itself. Yeah, there are some, yeah. And we have to know the strongly minimal sets over Q. So lots of things you have to know. But the algebraic closure of Q as a field is also a mysterious object. You know, if I'm not mistaken. So, yeah. Anyway, thank you. Sorry. Are there any other questions? Okay, there can be further discussion in There can be further discussion in the coffee rooms. There's two, one starting at 11 and one at 11.20. Gleb has sent those links in the email. And I have just posted them in chat. Ah, and they're now on the chat. So these are new Zoom links, right? Yes, yes, yes. Well, they're the same as yesterday, but they are different on this one.
