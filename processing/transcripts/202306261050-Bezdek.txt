Hello, everyone. I wish everyone a very successful meeting in Mexico. My talk, as you see here, is going to centered around two topics, Knieser-Pusen conjecture and herbal bodies. So let me start with then with the Knizer-Pusen conjecture and And conjecture, and in order to state that, I just need a sort of minimal notation. So the d-dimensional Euclidean space will be denoted by ED. And if we take two points, Pi and Pj, in the D-dimensional space, then their distance is equal to the norm of the vector difference pi minus pj. So this vertical bar refers to the Euclidean norm. Then it is convenient to talk about point configurations. So when I say that P is a point configuration, that means a collection of labeled points such as P1, P2, and P capital N. The central notion that's needed for the conjecture is the notion of contraction. So we say that the Contraction. So we say that the point configuration Q is a contraction of the point configuration P in the D-dimensional Euclidean space if the distance between Qi and Qj is smaller than or equal to the distance between Pi and Pj for all ij chosen from the interval one n. And contractions are And contractions are playing a central role in this story, but they are very important in general. One more thing that I need as a notation for a ball. So a D-dimensional Euclidean ball with center PI and radius RI, a closed ball will be denoted in this way, as you see here, B D of P I R I. Volume, D-dimensional volume refers to the Lebesgue measure in the D-dimensional. Lebesgue measure in the D-dimensional Euclidean space. So after this, the conjecture that has been put forward independently by Knieser and Pulsen can be stated as follows. So we start with the contraction of the point configuration P onto the point configuration Q. Moreover, we have balls centered at these points. In particular, we assume that the balls centered around That the ball centered around the point Pi has radius Ri. And the same way, the ball centered around Qi has radius Ri. We don't make any assumption on the radii in general. They can be equal, they can be different. And then the conjecture states that the volume of the union of the balls after contraction is smaller than. Contraction is smaller than or equal to the volume of the union of the bores before contraction. The picture indicates here, so the procedure, so we contract the center points, do not change the radii, and we shoot for the inequality that stated here. It took some time to realize that there is a very close related inequality, and this was put forward by And this was put forward by Gromov. What happened here? We just replaced union by intersection. So the second part of the Knieser-Pusen conjecture states that the volume of the intersection of the balls after contraction is at least as large as the volume of the intersection of the bores before contraction. So that's the important thing to remember: that the Knieser. Remember that the Kneeser-Poisson conjecture has two parts. The first part is about the monotonicity of the volume of the union of bores, second part is about the monotonicity of the intersection of the bores. Let me briefly state what we know about this conjecture. The first result here is about continuous contractions. It turns out that continuous contractions form a subfamily of contractions. Subfamily of contractions. They are not, I cover all possible contractions. Still, it is interesting to know that they behave very nicely with respect to the conjecture. So the notion can be introduced as follows. Let's start with the contraction of the point configuration P onto the point configuration Q. And then we say that this contraction. And then we say that this contraction is a continuous contraction if there is a continuous motion P of t consisting of the points P1 of T, P2 of T, etc. Pn of T, where T varies between 0 and 1. And at time T equals 0, we are at the point configuration P and at time t equals 1, we are at point configuration Q. Q. And in the meantime, we assume that the distance between the points Pi of T and P J of T is a monotone decreasing function of T over the interval 0, 1. And this holds for all possible choices of i, j between 1 and n. It is not hard to see that there are contractions which are not continuous contractions. Which are not continuous contractions. But still, as I said, it was an important question to answer whether the Kneeser-Poisson conjecture holds for continuous contractions. Chikos proved this in the paper that is highlighted here on this slide. Although the title is about union of balls, it turns out that the paper, the method of the paper works for intersections as well. For intersections as well. So Chikosh managed to prove the Knezer-Pusen conjecture for continuous contractions in D-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Well, it is also worth mentioning that the two-dimensional case has been done earlier by Bolobash for the case of union of disks and Capoelas for the case of intersection of disks. Once again, not every contraction is a continuous contraction. So it made sense to actually try to prove the Knieser-Poisson conjecture in the plane. And this was done in this paper that I've written with Bob Connolly. And we proved an affirmative answer. So the conjecture holds in the plane for all countries. In the plane for all contractions of disks. The proof is an approach through a higher-dimensional argument. I skipped details here. I just want to emphasize the following two theorems, which are proved in the paper, and they also tell the nature of the technology that we deploy. The first theorem says this: if Q is the Q is the point configuration Q is a contraction of the point configuration P in D-dimensional Euclidean space such that Q is a piecewise analytic contraction of P in two dimensions higher, in other words, in D plus two dimensional Euclidean space, then the Knaser-Poisson conjecture holds in the D-dimensional Euclidean space. In the d-dimensional Euclidean space. One has to note here that it is not true that if Q is a contraction of P, then there exists a piecewise analytic contraction of P onto Q in D plus two dimensional Euclidean space. Instead, we know only that there is such a piecewise analytic contraction in the two times d dimension. In the 2 times d dimensional Euclidean space. And exactly when d plus 2 equals 2 times d, we get the result that the Kneser-Poisson conjecture holds in the two-dimensional case. The other theorem from the paper that I put forward here on this slide is a slight improvement of Gromov's theorem. Gromov proved the Theorem. Gromov proved the Knezer-Poissan conjecture in d-dimensional Euclidean space for up to d plus one balls, and we were able to extend this somewhat. So now we know that the conjecture holds up to d plus three balls. So it is clear, for example, that the first interesting case, which is open in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Euclidean space would be the case of seven poles. What else should I mention? Can you put it full screen? Can you put the slides like control L or somehow full screen? Just full screen. Yes, full screen. Yes, yes. Does it help? Ah, perfect. Yes, much better. Thanks very much. Thank you. Better. Thanks very much. Thank you. Okay. So let me next let me talk about another special case, which is special in the sense that we are going to look at a subfamily of contractions called uniform contractions. And also we specify the radii and we look at And we look at bores of the same radius. So we try, in other words, here we try to understand the Knieser-Pusen conjecture for congruent bores, for intersections and unions of congruent balls under uniform contractions. So I need to introduce what a uniform contraction is, and you will see that. Is and you will see that this is another special family of contractions, just like continuous contractions. These are easy to define. In fact, this concept works not only in the Euclidean space, but in non-spaces as well. So the definition of uniform contraction is here on this slide. It is a good idea. slide it is a good idea to ignore the the general the presence of general norm so we we should think of euclidean norm for the sake of simplicity for the sake of this talk so we assume that rd is equipped with the euclidean norm this notion works for arbitrary norm that's why you see here k in the subscript k is the unit ball of K is the unit ball of a general norm. But as I said, it's sufficient to think of the Euclidean norm here. And then we take a point set Q and a point set P, and we say that the point set Q is uniform contraction of the point set P if the following holds. If there exists a lambda There exists a lambda that separates the distances from each other as follows: the diameter of the point set Q is at most lambda, and the smallest non-zero distance in the point set P is at least lambda. So if there is such a lambda, then we say that the point set Q is a uniform contraction of the point set P with separating value lambda. So after this, So, after this, it's clear that a uniform contraction is a contraction. And it's also clear that not every contraction is a uniform contraction. So we are dealing with a subfamily of contractions. Okay, now let me wrote this slide and actually introduce the other notion of The other notion of the title of my talk, Arbo Bodies. And this can be done conveniently now. So, if we take the D-dimensional space and we choose an unempty set X in it, and we choose a positive radius R, we can define the R ball by the X to the R generated by X as the intersection of closed balls of radius R centered at the Of radius r centered at the points of the set capital X. So X to the R is the object that we are looking at now. As I said, we will study Knieser-Pozen conjecture for uniform contractions under the condition that the balls have equal radii. In particular, we are interested in the behavior of the intersection. I could also include the case of unions of congruent balls, but for this talk, for the rest of this talk, let's just focus on intersections of congruent balls. Let's just focus on R-ball bodies. And if X, the generating set, is a finite set, then X to the R is called an R-ball polyhedron. Now, the theorem that can be proved. The theorem that can be proved for uniform contractions reads as follows. So the conditions are this: the point set Q is a uniform contraction of the point set P in the D-dimensional Euclidean space. We have both of radii R centered at these points, and then we, well, token. Well, talk about not only the d-dimensional volume of a convex set, but also the intrinsic volumes of the corresponding intersections. We have heard the notion of intrinsic volumes in the previous talk. So, on my previous slide, you see I record the definition of interest volumes. These are the coefficients of a polynomial which can In of a polynomial, which can be generated with the Steiner formula. And V sub D of A refers to the D-dimensional volume of the compact convex set A. V sub D minus 1 is eventually the surface area of A. If we put factor 2 in front, then we get the surface area. And V sub 1 of A, the first intrinsic volume of the convex set A, is basically the Set A is basically the mean width if we put this factor in front. So in this theorem, we see the intrinsic volumes showing up. K is any index between 1 and D. So here we see that the K's intrinsic volume of the intersection of the balls of radii R after contraction, uniform contraction, is at least as large as Is at least as large as the case intrinsic volume of the intersection of the balls of radius are before uniform contractions, provided that the number of balls is sufficiently large. So this is the condition here that makes all this possible. So provided that if we have sufficiently many balls. Well, this condition can be relaxed somewhat if the dimension is. Somewhat if the dimension is sufficiently high, but the nature of the condition remains the same. So that means that not only we can control the monotonicity of the usual d-dimensional volume, but we can look at, in fact, all the other intrinsic volumes and they change in a monotone way, same way as the dimensional volume for intersections of. Intersections of congruent balls under uniform contractions, provided that we have sufficiently many balls. This condition of having sufficiently many balls in the three-dimensional Euclidean space means the following. This is problem two highlighted here. We are almost there in the sense we have an almost complete proof of the Kneser-Pusan conjecture for intersections of Conjecture for intersections of congruent balls in the three-dimensional Euclidean case under uniform contractions, except in the following cases when we have seven, eight, nine, etc. 14 congruent balls. This you get from this theorem, the sufficiently many, in other words, one plus square. In other words, one plus square root of two raised to d translates into something slightly larger than 14. And the other thing that we know from the earlier discussions is that we have proved that in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, the Knaser-Poissan conjecture holds up to Holds up to up to six balls. So, really, these are the missing cases. It would be interesting to close this gap. Now, let me move to other volumetric properties of arboreal bodies. It seems that our ball bodies are interesting because they carry a special type of convexity. Moreover, they carry other features. Where they carry other features which distinguish them from classically convex bodies. This theorem on this slide really distinguishes the geometry of arbole bodies from the geometry of convex bodies. In order to see that, let me just remind us that if we have a convex body, compact convex set with non-empty internet. compact convex set with non-empty interior d-dimensional equilinear space. Then it has an in radius. If k is the convex body, r in of k refers to the in radius and it has a circum radius which is labeled by r c r of k. In radius is the largest radius of the bores contained in the convex body k. Circumradius is the smallest radius of the bores containing. Radius of the boss containing the convex body K. We shall need one special object, a special R-ball body called an R-lens. An R-lens in these spaces an intersection of two balls of radius R. In particular, this notation here, L R rho D, refers to the R lengths of the D dimensional Euclidean space. dimensional Euclidean space having in radius rho. So by nature, rho is at most r and positive here for our theorem. So the theorem answers the following question. Look at the family of Arbore bodies of given in radius. And then the question is, can we find the largest volume? Can we find that body, arbore body of given in radius? Arbore body of given in radius whose volume is large as possible. Theorem one gives the answer. It says that if we are looking at R-boh bodies of in radius r minus r0, then the largest volume member is the length of in radius r minus r0. Putting it somewhat more in more More in more details. What we have here is the following. We want to generate Arbore polyhedra within radius R minus R0. How do we do that? There is a simple way. We take the following point set P consisting of capital N points, P1, P2, P sub capital N are the points that we take with the proper. With the property that the circumradius of this point set is R0. If we take any such finite point set whose circumradius is R0, and then we draw balls of radius R around these points, then their intersection is going to be an R-ball polyhedron within radius R minus R zero. So the R-ball polyhedra. R bore polyhetera generated here and labeled by P to the R are of in radius R minus R zero. And it turns out that their D-dimensional volume is at most as large as the D-dimensional volume of the R lens of the D-dimensional Euclidean space with in radius R minus R0. Putting it equivalently. Putting it equivalently, this theorem proves that among R ball bodies of given volume, the R lens has the smallest in radius. The next theorem that I want to discuss on this slide is a very close relative. The question that we have here is similar sounding. Here is similar sounding, a kind of dual question. We look at arboreal bodies of given circumradius. Instead of fixing the in radius, now we fix the circumradius. And what we want, we want to minimize their d-dimensional volume. Which one has the smallest d-dimensional volume? In order to answer this, I just need two. I just need two things to introduce. One is good also for the reason that it is referring to the underlying convexity, which is anyway a good thing to mention. Arbor Mention our Bohr bodies come with a special convexity. So we can, for that reason, do the following. If we start with a non-empty set K in the D-dimensional space, and we look at the so-called R ball convex whole of that non-empty set and label it by conf R of K. Then this concept is a very basic. concept is a very basic turns out to be a very basic and useful concept and really the easiest way to introduce the r-convex wall you see here is simply the intersection of balls of radius r containing the set k and it turns out to be a very useful concept also in this way we can introduce arboll convex set namely we could say that a set k is arboll convex if it is equal to its Convex if it is equal to its R-convex hole. And this is the type of convexity that is entering along with R-ball bodies. The other thing that I want to mention is the notion of R-spinner. If we take a pair of points, X and Y in D space, and we assume that their distance is at most 2r, then. R, then of course, this pair of points we can cover by ball of radius r, and we can talk about, and we can be sure that the r-convex hole of this pair of points is non-empty. And in fact, the r-convex hole we call the r-spinel. The r-spindle, as its name suggests, has a rotational symmetry, and its circumradius is just half of the distance between Just half of the distance between the points x and y. So finally, S sub R lambda D here stands for the R spindle in the D-dimensional Euclidean space whose circumradius is equal to lambda. So now we are ready to state the theorem. And this gives the answer to the question that I started with. That I started with, namely, let's look at a point set P consisting of points P1, P2, P, capital N in E D with circumradius R0. By assumption, R0 is strictly less than R, therefore the circumradius of the R convex whole of this point set P is going to be R zero. So on the right, we see the volume. The right, we see the volume, a d-dimensional volume of an R-ball body showing up whose circumradius is R zero. And the theorem states that this volume is at least as large as the d-dimensional volume of an R-spindle in D-space with circumradius R0. Again, one has an equivalent. Again, one has an equivalent form here, which says that among R Bohr bodies of given volume in the D-dimensional space, the R-spinder has the largest circumradius. These two theorems lead to the following two conjectures. Both are of reverse nature and emphasize the special nature of arboreal convexity. Convexity distinguishes R Bohr convexity a great deal from classical convexity. So the first conjecture says that among R Bohr bodies of given in radius, the R lens has the largest case intrinsic volume in Euclidean D space. Remember that we proved this for K equals D, or stated at least, I haven't proved it, but stated it for K equals D. And now the good news. And now the good news is that just very recently, Drach and Tatarko proved a conjecture A for surface volume as well. In other words, for K equals D minus one and for all D larger than one. This is a substantial progress here and a very good supportive news. Conjecture B is a twin brother, unfortunately. A twin brother, unfortunately, still open. This is connected to our second theorem from the previous slide, which says that if k is any integer between strictly between zero and d, then among other Bohr bodies of given circumradius, the R-spindle has the smallest case intrinsic volume in Euclidean D space. Other inequalities. Other inequalities of volumetric nature also enter into this picture in a rather natural way. In fact, the theorems of uniform contractions towards a possible proof of the Knezer-Poisson conjecture for that class of contractions led us to this. This theorem here. So, it is a tool for Kneiser-Poisson-type results. On the other hand, it can be stated separately and expresses another special property of Arbore bodies. So, let's just state this. So, A here is a compact set of positive volume, and R is any positive real. Is any positive real? And then the question that we are dealing with: we are looking at compact sets of given volume in D space. For each of them, we generate the R-ball body with that given radius R, and we ask which one has the largest volume. Another extremal problem similar to the previous one, and this theorem gives an answer, characterizes the extremal set. Characterizes the external set. It says that if we take a Euclidean ball B, whose volume is equal to the volume of the compact set A, then the R-ball body generated by B, namely B to the R, has a volume, D-dimensional volume, which is at least as large as the D-dimensional volume of the Arbore body generated by the compact. Generated by the compact set A. In fact, as you see here, this holds for all intrinsic volumes, not just for the d-dimensional volume. And also, we can characterize the case of equality here. Here, equality happens if and only if A is congruent to B. The article on the right here in the title says Blashka Santa Rota. Says Blashka-Santa Root type inequalities. Reason lies in the following. There is a corollary of this theorem which reminds us the Blashke-Santavo inequality if we state it in the following form. So now A stands for an Arbore body in the D-dimensional Euclidean space. K is any integer between 1 and D. integer between one and d and r can be any positive real. And then we take the case intrinsic volume of our arbore body and multiply it by the case intrinsic volume of the arbor body generated by A. So that is A to the R here. And this product we call the case intrinsic volume product. Volume product assigned to the RBOR body A. And the question is: can we upper bound this? How large this can be? And the answer you see here, which follows from the previous theorem, says that the case intrinsic volume product of A is upper bounded by the case intrinsic volume product of the ball, D-dimensional ball of radius r over 2. I think I skip the reference here to the proof. Well, let me ask Martin, how much time do I have? Yes, hello. So you have seven minutes left. Say it again. Again, seven seven minutes. Ah, seven minutes. Okay, okay. So then let me continue with this problem, which would be a natural counterpart of the theorem, of this theorem here. Here we fixed the volume of compact sets and we asked for the maximum volume of the arbore body generated by those compact sets. Generated by those compact sets. How about the minimum volume? This one has to phrase in this way, and that way we get a mala-type problem for arboreal bodies. So we are given a volume, V, which is, of course, positive, strictly less than the volume of the D-dimensional Bool of Radius R. Bole of radius R. And we look at the family of R-Bohr bodies of volume V. And we ask which one has the property that when we take the case intrinsic volume of the Arbore body generated by that set, then that volume is small as possible. How can we minimize the case intrinsic volume of A to the? Volume of A to the R for all R bore bodies A of given volume V. Can we do this? This is a largely open question. On the other hand, at least for the sake of completeness, I show you that we know how to do it in the plane. And the two-dimensional case can be done as follows. So, in the two-dimensional case, we choose an area. We choose an area label it by V, which is strictly less than pi times R squared, and then the minimum of the first intrinsic volume of A to the R, respectively, the minimum of the area, second intrinsic volume of A to the R for R disk domains A of given area V is attained only for R. Only for R lenses, which are, as we know, intersections of two disks of radius R. So in the two-dimensional case, we can solve this minimization question. The way it can be done is highlighted here, and I think it fits into the remaining time, so I will attempt to do it. So first we recall a very We recall a very useful observation that if we take A as an arboreal body, then A plus, plus here refers to the Minkowski sum, vector sum of A plus negative one times A to the R is equal to the D-dimensional Bohr center that the origin having radius r. And this equation allows And this equation allows us to derive that in the plane, and actually in a higher dimension as well, the sum of the first intrinsic volumes of A and A to the R is a constant, depends on R only. In the planar case, we have point pi times R here. So this is the first observation we can make. Can make and this equation actually will dictate the rest of the proof, pretty much. Namely, according to the so-called reverse isoparametric inequality of R these domains, and this is another very special property of R-ball convexity. If you look at R these domains of given area, the largest Area, the largest parameter belongs to the R lens. And this was proved by Boryshenko and Drach. This means that in our case, L denotes the R lengths of area V, then its parameter is larger than or equal to the parameter of the artist A of area V. A of area V. Well, there is a constant here in order to get the parameter, but it implies that this inequality holds for the first intrinsic volumes. This is a very nice theorem. And also we can characterize the case of equality. They prove that this happens if and only if is an R lens. So this tells us right away then that Right away, then that the first intrinsic volume of L to the R, which is pi r minus first intrinsic volume of L, is smaller than or equal to the first intrinsic volume of A to the R. This follows from the equation 3,1 that we derived earlier, because if you substitute L here for A, then you get this equation. This equation of the left part of 3.3. On the other hand, using 3.2, we know that V1 of A is upper bounded by V1 of L. Therefore, this difference here lower bounds V1 of A to the R. So we immediately get the desired inequality, namely that the first intrinsic volume. The first intrinsic volume is minimized for L to the R, which is an R length, and so is L itself. That's an R length. Finally, we want to get the similar inequality for L to the R and E to the R with respect to the second intrinsic volume. And this is derived here by observing. Here by observing that the inequality of Boryshenko and Drag implies another inequality. Boryshenko-Drag maximize the parameter under the condition that we fix the area. The immediate twin brother inequality says that if we fix the parameter, then the area is minimized for the Barriers minimized for the R lens. And that results in the inequality what you see here, namely that if we fix the first interest equal, in other words, the parameter and A prime is an R disk whose parameter is equal to the parameter of lens L prime, then the area of the lens L prime. The area of the lens L prime is smaller than or equal to the area of A prime. And from this, it follows the statement that in order to minimize the area of A to the R under the condition that the area of A, R this domain, is fixed, we have to actually turn to an R lens and that gives Our lens, and that gives the answer to that. So, with this, I stop and really would love to see any progress regarding problem three. Thank you. Thank you very much, Caroy. Thank you very much for the talk and all the. For the talk and the many interesting problems. I ask the audience: any questions? Yeah, Grisha? Okay, I have plenty of them actually, but let's start with the simple one. So, as you mentioned, the characterization of air convex sets is that they are summons of a ball of the corresponding radius. What summons there is a convex set that such that the convex sum is equal to the ball of the desired radius. Sorry, can I interrupt here? Yeah. So you are talking about the Euclidean balls, right? Euclidean balls, or it's not only for Euclidean balls and it holds for some more general setting if you consider like You consider, like, uh, I don't know how it is in English, it's generating sets, it is called generating sets, yeah. Yes, what generating sets it holds, yeah. But uh, but then you can you can write uh clever inequalities related to intrinsic volumes for the Minkowski sum, which are more in this case they are more tight than Alexander Fenchel Nipolit or whatever. And the final inequality or whatever with precise constants. And then, in this inequality, the only equality case, more or less, is when you one of summons is a segment, which in your case means that the other summant is a lens. And then I have a question: What if you just simply write these inequalities? What do we get? Yeah, well, this is. Well, this is trying. Are you addressing problem three here? So my question is what follows directly from, like, I would say, standard inequalities related to intrinsic volumes in general, such as Alexander-Frienke inequality and a more neat result about the intrinsic volumes. About the intrinsic volumes of the Minkowski sum of two convex sets? Yeah, you see, it's a very good question. I mean, of course, behind the lines, there are powerful tools that one can try to deploy. For example, in the proof of this theorem, which is about maximizing the volume of Arbor bodies of this form. Arbo bodies of this form A to the R under the condition that area of A is fixed, volume of A is fixed, when we address that question that indeed inequalities like the Brun-Minkowski inequality turned out to be very helpful. I haven't had time to talk about the proof, but indeed you are right that if one uses If one uses such as Brun-Minkowski inequality, then has a way of controlling some kind of bounds that enter for the quantity in general. But I don't see the honestly the way how to address problem three through a technology like A technology like this. In fact, the only thing that I see here is summarized on this slide: that if you really try to attack problem number three through a procedure which gives a chance for deploying inequalities such as Bruminkovsky inequality, is perhaps this where Is perhaps this, where again, while we know that A and A to the R satisfy this equation here, this is the first interesting volume. So when we look at problem three and we look at arboreal bodies of volume, of given volume, A is such an arbore body whose volume, V D of A is given. Of A is given, and we want to minimize the case intrinsic volume of A to the R of this other set, then we could approach this through this equation here in these two steps. First, it would be nice to solve problem 3A, which means this. Among our bore bodies of volume V in D space, find the one. space, find the one, and denoted here by A, whose first intrinsic volume is the largest possible. This is a question which is rather elementary. Fixing the volume, the question is how large the first intrinsic volume of such a set can be. An equivalent question is fix the first intrinsic volume, minimize the volume, D-dimensional. Minimize the volume, T-dimensional volume. As soon as you stay that way, something immediately enters there, the classical Bonnes and Fenschal conjecture that instead of fixing the mean widths, you fix the minimal. Sorry, it's not really Bones and Fenschal, that's more recent. Fixing the minimal widths and minimizing the volume. But this is different. Here we fix. But this is different. Here we fix the mean width, the first intrinsic volume, and want to minimize the volume. Or if you put it in this form, which you see here, 3A, you fix the d-dimensional volume and maximize the first intrinsic volume. And after that, using this equation, we turn to the close relative equivalent formulation. We now fix the first. Now fix the first intrinsic volume and minimize the case intrinsic volume, or this includes the usual d-dimensional volume. So, somehow it seems to me that, well, one way to approach this problem could be this way, where you, as it is stated in problem 3A, problem 3B is just the relative, I mean the reverse or dual question. So it's Dual question. So it's really about problem 3EAA here. When we fix the d-dimensional volume of set, we want to maximize the first interest equilibrium. Sorry, maybe I couldn't really give the right focus answer, but I tried. Thank you very much for the question and answer. Do we have like we have time for a quick question? We have time for a quick question. Nobody from the audience, but I do want to encourage the online audience. So, if you have a question, please just ask it now. Don't be kind. Just go ahead, turn on your microphone and ask. Onliners, again, any question? Okay, so then thank you. So then, thank you, Karo, again. Thanks for the talk. Thank you. Thank you. And so we'll resume after the coffee.
