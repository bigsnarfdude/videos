My topic is about the recent results on steady vertex rings or small cross-section, also together with my supervisor, Professor Hsao. This presentation is divided into four aspects as these aspects. First, I will talk about the vertex ring in Watering in pure mathematical region. So I think possibly these results are also known in physics, but we prove this in mathematics again. As we consider the 3D incompressible Euler equation as in the equation one, the first equation is the conservation of momentum. And the second equation is the conservation of the mass, also known as in Also known as incompressible condition. By introducing the vastity function, curl on the velocity as a kernel is defined as this. Then the equation 2 is known as the vorticity formulation of the traditional Euler equation, also known as the Hemerhot equation. Then we consider the bias. Then we consider the Bai-Sava law, which means the velocity can be recovered by the vorticity as in the equation 3. Note that in Hamilton's equation, the omega will not only be influenced by this term, but also stretches or twists due to the non-linear term. And in this aspect, as a possible finite time blow-up, we can. Blow up, we can reference to the work of Thomas Ho or Agni in recent works. Now we consider the axisymmetric flow, which means the velocity V has only two terms, that is VR and VZ. It doesn't have the V theta term and the velocity only depend on the R and only depends on the R and Z coordinates. Then Hamaha equation 2 is then transformed to this, to the first equation as a transport equation, which means we define the omega theta over R as the potential vorticity. Then the potential vorticity is transported by the velocity field as in the equation for As in the equation 4, which means the distribution function of omega Î¸ over R is conserved. Then this is the vortex ring, big vortex ring, which is on the Etna volcano of Italy. Then the vortex ring can be characterized as x symmetric. Characterized as x-symmetric flow. So we can write the potential vorticity zeta, which equals omega zeta over R. And in the fifth equation, this quantum then satisfies this equation. Especially a steady water text string has the following form, which have a V infinity as V infinity and the infinity speed and the transnational speed in the infinity. And the first equation is equation five. And the next equation is by Sava law, which connects the vorticity and the velocity. Then there are two kinds of vortex ring. The first is a vortex ring with small cross-section and the second And the second is known as the Hill vertex, whose vortex core or the cross-section is sphere. So it is also known as the Hill spherical vertex. Let us recall some history about the vertex-strain study in mathematics fields. In 1858, Haimerhorst detect the vortex ring travel with a large constant velocity along the axis of the ring. Along the axis of the gene, which is in the Kraft's journal. And in the 1860s, Lord Carwin Higgs opened the well-known Carwin-Higgs formula, which we will introduce later. And Hill discovered the Hill spherical vertex. The first mathematical construction for the vortex ring of small cross-section was by Franklin. And then nobody finding a class of large vortex ring near. A large vortex ring near Hill's very cool vortex. Then Franklin and Berger gave a general theory for construction of steady vortex ring in the atom mathematica. And from 1918, Friedman, Abro City, Villarova, and my supervisor Tsao constructs what has rain from different aspects of PDE, including mountain path theme, variational theme, and And perturbation perturbation method. Now we consider vertex ring, which since it only depends on R and theta, so we can consider what text ring in R2 in half of R2. And the what has created what has cross-section can be described as area near Near a circle, and we defined two numbers to describe the vertex ring. The first number is the cross-section parameter, which is the random of the cross-section. And the next parameter is the random of the ring. So by these two parameters and the translational speed, and the translational speed, we define it as the W. W. These three parameters satisfy the following Calvin-Higgs formula, which is first detected by Carvin. Carvin, which describes the dynamics of the vortex ring. Now, we introduce our first existence result in mathematics. Let kappa and w be two. Let kappa and w be two positive numbers and there exists a small number which is which is the same order as the sigma. Then there exists a centralized diverte strain, zeta each, with fixed circulation kappa and transnational velocity W long and E Z. And this class of vortex rings sanctifies. Vortex ring sanctifies the three properties. The first sees the vertex distribution in the cross-section is the characterized function and the characterized function of the Randius O epron. This is the second property, and the third property says the R star. R star, this is r star. This distance is r star sens by the following following property, which equals which near kappa over 4 pi epsilon. This is coincidence with the current Higgs formula before. And the construction is divided into three steps. The first step is to transform the voltage ring. The vertex ring transforms the equation of vertex ring to a non-linear or semi-linear elliptic equation. Since the transport equation is equals to the string function pi and the vorticity function omega is functional dependent and the string function pi psi satisfies an elliptic elliptic equation. elliptic equation. So in six, the first, in the sixth equation, the first equation is a semilinar elliptic equation and the third and second equation is a boundary condition. The elliptic equation has the following form, which is uniform elliptic. And the A epsilon is the characterized function of the water core area. This is a special. uh this is a special truth of distribution function which equals i equals uh equals u u and power p you're at you at power power zero which equals pi u more than zero and the second and the other choice can be if the distribution is like the distribution is like a peak then the truth shall be f equals u as a power p they are also there they are both they are both fully localized what is then how to construct the vortex strains we consider the grain function of the elliptic operator since when the vorticity is localized then the then the strain function Then the strain function of the vertex strain must be like the green function of the elliptic operator, since the green function describes the most singularity case. Now we have the green function has the following expression. Now the seventh equation is a scaled version of the well-known ranking vertex. The ranking vertex is The random vortex is defined by its vorticity function or its string function by its vorticity function. Its string function is 1 over 4 1 minus y at part 2 and outside the core area, it's one over 2 loin. one over two loin y one over y so we scale this function and use it as the building block of our of our our solution but there are also other terms in gray function these terms are regular terms like v q bar and h and the perturbation term phi epsilon then the Then the equation is transformed to a non-linear equation for the disturban term phi e zhong. And we can solve this problem by a fixed point theory. But the linear operator, linear operator L has a kernel, has a kernel. So we cannot do this directly. But we can first solve a projection problem. First, solve a projection problem. The nice equation, then we solve a finite dimensional problem, which this method is also known as the approach-Schmidt reduction in mathematics. Then we can obtain a class of vortex rings. Now, we consider the uniqueness of these vertex rings. There are two results about vertex rings. The first is by Ami, Kai-Franco, and is by Amika and Franco and the second is also also by them. They prove the Hill spherical vertex Unix and the Unix of Nobrilli vertex ring. But there are not a result about the vertex ring of cross of small cross-section. Now all result is about this, which means if there are two families of vertex strings saying sanctify this property and they must be the same. This property as they must be the same. They must be the same. We consider the two things leading to the unaxis. The first is a non-degeneracy of hydrogen for the regular part in grain function, because the single part is the fundamental solution of the R2D Laplacian. 2D Laplacian. The regular part will influence the Part will influence the dynamics of the workplex train. So, actually, this part depends the uniqueness. We consider a simpler case, which is a planar case. It is all known that the KOPORUS function for the K-point vortex system Key point whatever system influence its dynamics by the gradient of the K of the KK of the KK that is the hymn of the system. So if the vertex has a steady form, these points must be a critical point of the KK and the non-degeneracy of the Haissian The Haitian Haitian influence the uniqueness of this system. So, this is the first fact, and the second fact is the non-degeneracy of the limiting linear problem. That is the non-degeneracy of the linearized operator near the ranking vertex, which means the kernel of the linear operator has only two elements. That was the partial WO or partial. W over partial y1 and the partial w over partial y2. The proof of the unity is divided into two steps. The first step is to obtain a precise estimation for the vertex ring, including obtain a precise version of the current Higgs formula. And the second step is to use the Pauza if identity to drive a contradiction. To drive a contradiction. For more details, we can refer to the two articles. Now, we consider the stability in non-linear things. For this purpose, we first introduce the kinetical energy and the impulse of the vortex ring, that is E and P zeta. Luckily, these points are also conserved and the time. Conserved and the time involves, which is proved by other mathematics in this form. The first equation, LP norm is conserved, is by its distribution function is conserved. And the next is the conservation of the impulse and the conservation of the energy. And the third inequality also can be drived by the conservation. Also, it can be drived by the conservation of the distribution function. Using this fact and things that the vertical string can be described as the maximizer of the maximization problem, which is in the admissible class A Ipson. This construction is the variational construction, but our uniqueness result says this maximizer is unique and Is unique under transform translation in Z direction. And over the flux constant mu is the vertex core. And below it, it doesn't have any vorticity. Using the energy conservation and the description description in Description in variational method, we can obtain our non-linear stability result, which says if the perturbation in L1 norm is sufficiently small, then as the time involves, the motoring is near the initial data by a translation in the directions. And the LP norm is an integral norm which integral norm which means LP norm we say it this we write the LP norm as L P U equals U at power P dx R n and as a power one over P notice that our case doesn't come Uh notice that our case doesn't come consist of the L infinity case L infinity case now the proof of the non-linear stability is from from from the energy aspects and and this before our work the only religious stability result for vortex strains is the orbital stability for Hill's vortex by psi it is in the By SI. It is in the CPAM in 2022. And our strategy is to use the UNIX result. And we know the zeta hat is unique under translation in zeta direction. Using the conservation law and the compactness of the maximization sequences, we can show that zeta is non-state stable in L1 camps, L infinity camps. Infinity camps. Oh, this L infinity is should not be existed. No P is exist. For this topic, we refer to GR Barton's results and also a PhD on proficient house Wangodong's results. Now, thank you for your attention.
