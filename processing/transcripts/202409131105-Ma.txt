Let me begin my talk with the background warmth matter. As we all know, material at the extreme conditions always bring changes for material simulation methods. The warm dense matter is the It's the changing region between the cold condensed matter and the hot plasma. The temperature of one condensed matter is higher. So if we want to use indensity functional area to simulation it, we couldn't use the ground state density functional as we simulate the condensed matter. We should use the finished temperature density functional theory. Density functional theory. As we all know, the quantum density functional theory is accuracy, but the computing cost of this method is higher. Additionally, if we want to use quantum density functional theory, we must solve the quantum equation. The computational complexity of solving this equation is solving this equation is squared to the it's got square to the number of eigenvalues when the temperature increases we must we must get more eigenvalues so the combination cost is increased for the for the orbital free density and function theory it's a prospective method for solving this question but one one problem we've solved is the got the free and It's the got the free energy density functional. This would like the, we must go the kinetic energy density functionals in the ground stage of the free density functional theory. Here, I will give you a brief summary of previous works. The free energy density functionals would begin with the most female models. In recent years, In recent years, some work has been done, such as provider trigger, provider framework. If we have a generalized identity of mission functionals, we could change it from the kinetic energy functional to the free energy functionals through this framework. And recently, yes, two non-local functionals and some GG level functionals. Some GGA level functional has been provided. And here you can see that the RKT functionals and others. About two years ago, Professor Kylo went to our campus and gave me the talk about LKG functionals and our work are also motivated by him. And before I talking about my free energy density functionals, we should energy density functionals we should we should introduce the connective energy functional of XMA this this functional was developed him by our groups prepares this this functional we consider the linear response relations and we're using line integrities and we're choosing a special integrity path and finally we got this is functional this functional is a functional its functional is purity for example for the equation of z for the b central cubic silicon it's work better than the previous work okay i will i will show you the details for we derive drive our finite temperature free energy functions we began with the kinetic energy functional at zero at zero kernel and the put the Carbon and we first change the mass vibe on term to the finished temperature version. And then we taking the we thinking the lin-hard response and we also change it from zero temperature to the filling temperature. And finally, we got our free energy density functionals. This work was published in a physical review and as an editor's suggestions. As we all know, we only have the functional is not enough. We must inflate it in a software to do the simulations for the matters. Our group prevailed developing an AP initial orbital freedom functional series software named ATAS. It was released with Fortune and paralleled with passenger interface. It has the capability to do the electron-density augmentations. Transit optimizations, geometry optimizations, and molecular dynamics. We have performed 100 minus items, photo energy minimizations. For the molecular dynamics, we have simulated more than 10,000 atoms and the time and we simulated it for one nano second. And I have during this years, I was the co- During this year, I was the co-developer of this software. I would engage our functional and to prevail functionals in our software. To detect the accuracy of our functionals, we first do the state that has calculations of the fixed standard cubic aluminum and the cubic diamonds. As shown in the picture, As shown in the picture, our functional occurs is through the whole range of temperatures. Then we do the A-B initial molecular dynamics simulation for the warm dense hydrogen. Here I show the pressure predicted by the construction density function theory and the optimal free density function theory. I showed that the mean absolute derivation of our measure. Of our method is smaller, is about half smaller than pre-war results. And we also calculate the structures and we show the pair distribution functionals here. Here, we can see that for the pair distribution functionals, at lower data case, our method is more closer to consumption result, but for the Some result, but for the higher densities, all functional get better results. And we also simulated the warm density hydrogen, helium, and their mixtures. Here, we can see that the mean percentage of method is about 1.4 percentage. And there are a stereotype that we also think. A stereotype that we all think that the non-local form functionals have the lower speed, but in our testing our functionals, the computation cost of our functional is not so higher. It's still in the same scale with the Thomas Female. At last, we're also finding that we could calculate the electron entropy. Here, I show you. Here I show you the formulation and our results. It's also occurred. And for the further works, we also taking the finite temperature exchange coloration into considerations. Here, these two finite temperature functional, we also engage in our software. You know, previous. you know, previous, all the most of calculations are done with ideal backend operation of exchange correlation functionals. Here, I will give you a brief summary. We have built a new nano brief energy functional and this functional with accuracy and we now searching for a realistic system to simulate it with our functionals. If you have a functionals. If you have a good idea, please feel free to contact us. I would like to say thanks to our group leader, Professor Yan Min Ma, and my professor, Professor Wang, and Professor Mi and other members of our Atas developing groups.
