Well, thank you for inviting me. I'm very sad that I didn't go to get to be on site and see everybody, but I guess we live in times where we have to deal with what we have to deal with. So the work I'm going to talk about today mainly was done with my colleagues here at Brigham Young University. So Emily Evans, Mary Ellen Rosen, Chris Grant, and Bill Smith. And so that they're making a quite popular. So of course we've all know the importance of cell motion in this conference and people have talked more about this than in better than I could have. But cell motion can be life-forming, life-saving, and life-threatening. So life-forming, we've had at least two talks this morning about the Two talks this morning about the morphogenesis in the early embryonic stages. And so here you see the Drosophila and you can see tracks of cells moving along in the early development. Here's a nice little video of tracks in the primitive streak formation of a quail, and you can see the cells move on. Life-saving in wound healing. And so this is the dermis, and this is the epidermis. The dermis, and this is the epidermis. And so, if you have a wound in your tissue, the skin, then cells are recruited to the region and they cause chemical changes, and a provisional matrix is formed. They can fight infection, and then eventually other cells are recruited to the region and they move in and they change the provisional matrix and create a new tissue to regenerate the old tissue, create new tissue. And here is a movie from this lab where this is just an epidermal sheet and they do a scratch. Epidermal sheet, and they do a scratch on it. And here's the front moving into the wound region. And then finally, life-threatening. And so again, this is cancer, like Alex talked just a little bit about his introduction. The tumor, you have the tumor, or I guess Holland and Hans did as well, but the tumor, and you have the cells which at some point may leave the tumor mass and start moving to different parts. Tumor mass and start moving to different parts of the tissue of the body and metastatize, and so this can cause grave problems and be life-threatening. So, cell motion is important. And so, we all know that. So, I wanted to sort of give you a history of how I came about the model that I'm losing my paper. How I came about modeling the model that I'm going to talk about. But I'm going to talk about. I'm just a little bit lagged. Sorry about that. How I came about modeling the model that I want to talk about. So when I first started, and I first started with Hans Olthmer as my advisor, we modeled dictacin dysphoidum and the early aggregation. And so here you see a picture of the nice stream, which Hans had in his introduction, nice streaming pictures of dictacin dysphoidium. And I have a less nice video, but I think. My media player is not playing. There, there we go. I don't see it. Okay. No, we didn't see it either. Let me see if I can get rid of it now. Okay. Well, that was just supposed to show you the streaming of the dictasan disquietant. Of the Dictusian Descuedian. And so we did a model of that. That was in fact when I first started as a graduate student. And here the cells were just points. They had no volume or area. It was a two-dimensional model. They were point sources of sinks and they moved in this chemotactic gradient and we could mimic things and learn stuff about the system. And so this was sort of my introduction to cell motion and started me off on my career. Then I wanted to model quorum sensing with Richard. Form sensing with Richard Bomer, and he was trying to see how the dictostilium decides how large of an aggregate to form so it could form the right sort of fruiting bodies. And so this is in the corn sensing. And here you see the streaming where it breaks up into smaller aggregates, which will form smaller slugs. And to do this, we had to think more about adhesion. And of course, the cells couldn't be point sources with adhesion points, so they had to have some area. So I modeled them in circles. Some area. So I modeled them in circles, and it was a very simple model. And then there was some adhesion, and we could get the streaming like we did before with the points. But then at some point, they broke, the streams would break up. And so we could sort of learn something about quorum sensing. And then back with Hans again, we went to the later aggregation. And this was the first model was Ericer Paulson and Hans. And then we formed something after that. And hope, yeah, this is so in the later aggregation with the slug. So, in the later aggregation with the slug, you see this very interesting motion within the slug where you get this nice swirling pattern, and now the slug's sort of standing up and will form the fruiting body. But it's sort of as the slug moves along, you have this very dynamic pattern of motion as the sails moving and sort of moving the whole slug in some way. And so, we wanted to sort of learn more about that. So, the models were, this was a visceral ellipse, we made a viscous. A visceral ellipse, we made a visceral elastic ellipsoid, and we were able to model it and form something like this and try to see how forces were transmitted to the substrate. And I was very happy with this model at the time, and I went and gave a talk at Washington State. And so some of you may remember Bob Dylan. He was a student when I was a student with Hans. And I showed, I gave my talk and I showed him this, and I was very happy with it. And he's just like, yeah, but that doesn't look at all like what was going on with the picture with the beautiful swirling pattern. Picture with the beautiful swirling patterns of the slug, what's going on here? And I said, Well, you know, I'm not modeling the signaling very well, and so this will, I'll never get that. But that comment just stuck with me for several years. And I thought, I would like to model this in a better way where I can see this more complicated pattern. And the modeling here, the cells, the adhesion was sort of a potential energy. And so once the cells get into some nice configuration, there's no reason for them to leave that configuration. Reason for them to leave that configuration, and there's no randomness in it. If you add some randomness, you might get a little bit of mixing. But I was very dissatisfied with these formations of the model after that comment of Bob Dylan. Thanks, Bob. But so then I went off and worked at a place in a lab in Pennsylvania. And one slide too fast. And we started looking at fiberglass. And so here are some slides of fiberglass. So on the bottom, you see fiberglass on a two-dimensional substrate on a tetri dish. A two-dimensional substrate on Petri dish, and here they're in a three-dimensional substrate, and they have this very different morphology than the dictostelium viscodium cells. And they're these stellite forms. And this made me think even more, sort of about the adhesion of how the cells adhere to each other. Because I was thinking about it in terms of the slug, but these made me think, this made me think even more and sort of expanded my view of how cells would adhere. And I also was introduced to these beautiful sort of images of where the cells are forced. Where the cells are forced to adhere only in small islands on the substrate. And then you can see this very complicated structure that is formed within the cell and it's sort of how the cell is moving and adhering. And it made me think I wanted to model adhesion in a much more careful way. And so that leads me to the models that I sort of want to talk about today. And so these are models for switching terms. And so they're actually quite, so it's not really very sophisticated. It's just a very simple model. You have these focal adhesions. So the red X's are focal. So, the red X's are focal adhesions, and they're attached to the center of the cell by a spring, and so they exert forces. And so, that's what it is. And so, this would mathematically is pretty simple, except for this term and this term. So it's a first order differential equation. It's low Reynolds number, so we ignore acceleration. And this is just the spring forces. But this is a random variable, and it's either zero or one. And so, this tells me whether the adhesion is adhering or not. When it's not adhering, this is zero. Not. When it's not adhering, this is zero and it doesn't contribute to the force moving the cell. So the cell center is, you know, x. And so this is the velocity of the cell center. This is where the adhesion sites are, the focal adhesions. And so they are, this is a random variable b. So at the cell center at some time, it will choose there, a random variable will be added to that location. And that's where the focal adhesion will be. And the focal adhesion will stay there for the duration until this random variable. Until this random variable becomes zero, at which point that focal adhesion no longer plays a part in the motion of the cell. And then later on, another random variable will be chosen and the focal adhesion will change location. So this randomness makes this interesting. And this value right here is sort of the lifetime of the focal adhesion. And so those are sort of the two things that I want to key in. And so I wanted to model a sales. Model cells, we looked around for lifetimes of focal adhesions. And at the time, we found this for dictostylum dyscoidium. So, dictostylum dyscoidium doesn't have focal adhesions, but these are actin foci. And actin foci are believed to be related to how this DD adheres to the substrate. And so, this is the lifespan of actin foci. And so, we the histogram was the data. So, we sort of superimpose this Poisson distribution on top and say, okay, well, we'll approximate it with this Poisson distribution. This Poisson distribution, and so this is the wait time that we're going to provide for the cell for these adhesions. So, here's the model. So, you see the little green dots are sort of these focal adhesions, and the cell center is somewhere where this red, this big black arrow. And it sort of jumps around as the focal adhesions change, randomly change places, being put out from the center of the cell whenever they're put out. And so it sort of jumps around like that. So here you see DD on a compliant substrate from Ryu's lab, John Hall Ryu's lab, and you can see the forces exerted by it, and it sort of migrates around. And this is somewhat reminiscent of the model I just showed. So I thought, well, maybe we have a chance to sort of learn something from this. So we did a bunch of simulations and simulations. And here are the, yeah, this is, these are the surfaces we generated from the simulation. So we, you know, for each parameter set, we ran several simulations and took the average and generated these surfaces. And so the parameters we changed were the average detach time, so the time that the focal adhesion is detached, and the average time the focal adhesion is attached. And these came from Poisson distributions. And so this we just specified the average. And the color is the speed. And the color is the speed, and the color over here is the force. Now, of course, when focal adhesions are detached, the components are disassembled and the cell will reform a focal adhesion later. So the detach time is really not very physical. And so the nice thing here about the speed is if you fix the detach time, or if you actually if you fix the attached time and you vary the detach time, there's not very much variation in speed. Not very much variation in speed. So, this non-physical parameter doesn't affect the speed very much. If I fix the detached time and I vary the attach time, the speed changes really a lot. And you get high speeds for very low attach times. So if the adhesions don't stay attached very long, you can get higher speeds. But over here with force, you can see that as you vary the, if you fix attach time and vary the detach time, you get a large range of forces. Time you get a large range of forces. Similarly, if you fix the detach time and vary the attached time, you get a lot large range of forces. And so, up here, you have a small detach time, which means most of the focal adhesions in the simulation are attached. And here, they're attached for a long duration. And so you can imagine that they're pulling against each other. Some are holding the sail back from moving, and some are trying to pull the sail forward. And that's why you're getting high forces. Okay, so I. So we looked. So these are the dots which were used to generate those surfaces. And the red dots are experimental values from Jean-Paul's lab. And the black dots are if you fix the parameters. So if you fix the attached time and you fix the detached time, then this is just the randomness due to the Poisson distributions and how we reach out from the cell center. So this is, so we're sort of simulating things in the appropriate way. Simulating things in the appropriate range for dip distinct squared n, this is speed, and this is force. And now, if I color the different parameter sets, so here you color the detach, similar detach rates, so they're always Poisson. So, the red has the slowest detach time, and the black has the longest detach time. And you can see that for this fixed detach time, you get a large range of speeds and a fairly large range of forces. Over here, Of forces. Over here, if you do the same thing only with the attached time, so now the attached times are colored. So if you fix the fixed attach time for a low attached time for 14 seconds would be here, this is a higher and this is the highest attached time. And so for the lowest attached time, you get the highest speeds. And although there's a range of speeds, there's a much larger range of forces for each of these fixed values. So again, the attach time, if you fix the attach time, you sort of specify the speed, but you don't really specify. But you don't really specify the force. Okay, so then I wanted to think about other parameters in the model and how they would affect the speed and the force. And so, of course, we change the spring constant. And so here the spring constant is changed. And here, the average attach time again with the Poisson distribution is changed. And you can see that if you fix the attach time and you change the spring constant, the speed just does not change very much. But yet the force does, and that makes sense. If you have the springs exert more force, they have to give up. Springs exert more force, if they have to give a higher spring constant, then you should get larger forces, and that's what this is telling us. So, again, this is just sort of saying attach time determines speed, the force or the spring, it doesn't, the forces and the springs aren't as correlated as the speed of the setup in the model. And then I can reproduce the same sort of figures where you have, again, I plot here the colors. This is for the strength of the springs, and the black is the large. And the black is the strongest spring, the red is the weakest spring. And again, you get all sorts of speeds for one strength of the spring. It localizes, it makes the forces less, although here you have quite a range of forces for this value. But if you look at the attach times and you fix those, then you get less variation in speed, even though you have a large ratio in the force. And again, the red dots here are the experimental values from the lab, and the blue dots are what we're generating in the simulations. Okay, so then we can also vary the number of adhesions. So these are integrant-based focal adhesions. And so the number of focal adhesions are allowed in the simulation. And again, there's not much variation in the speed as you change the number of focal adhesions. The greatest variation comes when you change the attached time. The interesting thing here is you have sort of a maximum here at about 10, which is actually the average number of focal adhesions in the paper. Number of focal adhesions in the paper where they measure the lifetime of focal of the actin foci for DD is about nine. So it looks like nine has been or DD has been optimized sort of for speed in terms of the number of attachment sites at any one time. And I've never really looked into that, although I would like to go back and look at that. Okay, so you might say this is very model dependent because what happens, so look down here at the bottom, I have my cell location. Bottom, I have my cell location, and I randomly pick a value and add it to it, and that's where I attach the focal adhesion. And so the spring is stretched initially to a long length. So this is supposed to be a caricature of the absolute value of the magnitude of the force. So at time zero, when I first put it out, I have a large force because the spring is stretched. The cell starts to move. Let's say the cell is moving to the right. As the cell center moves towards this location where the focal adhesion is, the spring is. Where the focal adhesion is, the spring isn't stretched as much, so the forces decrease. Then, as the cell center moves beyond that focal adhesion site, then the forces start to increase again. Now, this isn't very realistic. So although there are strong forces at the periphery of the cell on the focal adhesions, there aren't as strong of forces. There are some strong forces in the front, but there tend to be more of them, but just a little weaker. So you might think, and when a focal adhesion first forms, it's a nascent adhesion and then it It's a nascent adhesion, and then it can the cell starts to make the complex larger and causes stress fibers to go to it and all sorts of things so it can support more force. So you would expect that maybe initially it doesn't support a lot of force, but later it would support more force. So something like this might be more realistic, where initially the forces are lower, they increase, and as the cell moves over the top of it, they might decrease. And then as they move, as the full flow adhesion is in the back, then the cells increase, the force increases again. Else increases, the force increases again. So we can change the model. And so here's the new force rule. And we've just added this term, and this term is just a linear term. And this is the lifetime of the focal adhesion, the j-th focal adhesion. So this is when the focal adhesion is first attached. And so this is zero when it's first attached. So it can't exert any force. But then as time goes on, it can exert more and more force. And so with adding this linear term of the lifetime, you can get something like this out of the can get something like this out of the time force sort of curve if that's what you're trying to plot. So we can recreate all of our rerun the simulations and we get the same sort of surfaces and these don't look very much different from the ones before. So it wasn't just because of when we threw out the put the focal adhesion initially it had the largest force that we still get the same result even if it doesn't have a large force it has a smaller force. And here you can see the data the blue is the data generating these graphs and the red is the convex hole of the red is the convex hull of the data that generated the graphs from the original model with just straight springs and you can see there's not a lot of difference for the speed and the force in this but just to make sure things were working right we looked at the position of the cell and so this is the x position and the y position so these are the positions as we run the simulations and this is a new force rule this is the old force rule which is screens the convex hole of these points are given here in the red and then these are the average location of all the points Average location of all the points. And the red is the average for this one. The cyan is the average for this one. Cyan is more advanced in the X direction. The cells have a tendency to move in the X direction in the simulations. And that's what you would expect from the spring ones because there are greater forces. Because when you throw out the first focal adhesion, there's a longer stretch of the spring. So you have a bigger, so they should be moving. So this sort of tells us that the new model is working the way we expected it. Way we expected it. And this tells us that it didn't really change the results. That this average attach time seems to be important in determining the speed and the forces don't really correlate with the speed they mention. Okay, so then we looked at different cell types. And so here red is fibroblast, green is endothelial cells, this light blue is neutrophils, the black is murine dendritic cells, and the dark blue is DD cells. Dark blue is DD cells. And so the square tells us the values which are in the literature for fibroblasts range these speeds and these forces. And for neutrophils, these speeds and these forces. And so the box sort of indicates the parameter range and where they have been measured experimentally. And then we used various parameters to try to simulate the cell. And we got our dots and we could simulate cells. Dots and we could simulate cells which sort of lie in the right region for each of these different types of cells. Then, if you take these dots and you plot rather than speed and force, you plot speed and average attach time, you get this sort of a graph. And so this graph again shows that there's some more functional, more of a functional dependence on the attachment time to the speed than the speed to the force. Okay. So in conclusion for this part, we've sort of learned that the dynamics of these We've sort of learned that the dynamics of these attach-detach really is important in thinking about the speed of a sail, whereas the force wasn't. The simple model gave some realistic results that could model sort of what was in the literature for several types of cells. So it was applicable to several, it seems applicable to several cell types for those perhaps. So we wanted to do some analysis on this and sort of try to see if we could figure out something about the velocity mathematically. And so we have this ODA model. And so we have this ODA model with these stochastic terms, which was a little too complicated to start out with. So we simplified, the first simplification was to make it a continuous time centroid model. And so I'll talk about, and then we simplified it to a discrete time centroid model. We were able to prove some things with the discrete time centroid model, then the continuous time centroid model, and then link those results to the ODE model. So, and Dr. Chris Grant was the one who did most of, he's the probably. One who did most of he's the probabilist and knows most of the probability in my group. And so he did all the heavy lifting in terms of the theorems. So here's the idea. Once you fix the adhesion sites, it's the simple ODE. And so you can solve the ODE. It's only when the adhesion sites change that the ODE changes and you have to think about it. So if you fix everything and you let the ODE and you, if we set this equal to zero, this guy would be the centroid. Solving for x would give us the centroid. Solving for X will give us a centroid. So here's the centroid model. You just set the left-hand side equal to zero, and you have the centroid model. And so here's the picture. If all the focal adhesions are fixed, which are the green dots, and you start out here, the cell center starts here, with the ODE model, you can solve it. Here's the solution. And it just continuously moves towards the red dot, which is the centroid location of all these focal adhesions. And that's given by this. Whereas so the continuous time centroid model jumps from the black dot to the red dot. Jumps from the black dot to the red dot and just sits in the red dot until a focal adhesion event happens. And an event is an attachment or a detachment until one of the green dots attaches, a new one attaches, or one of them detaches, at which point the centroid will jump to a new centroid location. Well, the ODE will be moving along this path until an event happens, and then wherever it is along the path, the event will happen, and then it will start off moving along another path to the new central location. Okay. Okay, so the idea was: well, if we could, if we knew that if the centroid model were started close to the ODE model, the ODE model is going to sort of relax towards this value and stop somewhere when the focal adhesion attaches or detaches. The centroid model will just jump to a new place. If we know something about this distance, can we determine something about this distance? So here's the So here's the cell with the focal adhesions and the forces on it. And so we just think about these focal adhesion sites and the cell center. So we have a state. So this is a jump type process. And so now we want to go to just a discrete time. So we're just going to have discrete time. And each time an adhesion attaches or detaches, that's going to be, will increment our time. And so we have the state space, which includes. Have the state space, which includes the location of all the focal adhesions in the centroid. And we want to think about a projective process. And so, the projective process is just the number of attachment sites. So, in this case, at time one, I have six attachment sites. So, the full state space incorporates all this information, but the projected process just tells me I have six attachments. At time two, one of my attachments went away. The centroid jumped somewhere else. Jumped somewhere else to the new location, and now the projective process has only five attachments. And then at time three, another one goes away, the centroid moves, and now I only have four attachments, so the projective process only has four. At time four, I add a new attachment site, so the centroid moves, and now I have five attachments. And then at time five, I have six attachments because I added another one and I jumped again. And so this sort of tells us this is the discrete time jump process. It's a Markov process. Process, it's a Markov process, and it's a discrete-time centroid process. So, from this, we can prove some things. So, if we assume that we put these attachment sites out and they come from a random variable which has a specified distribution, and only one attachment or detachment occurs at each time event, and we have the probability of detach to attach is r times the probability from attach to detach, then we can define a probability kernel and we can probability kernel, and we can define a Markov chain. And given an initial distribution, so we can see how the chain evolves, the initial distribution will evolve. We don't expect it to have a stationary distribution because these cells could just sort of migrate off in some place and just continue to move. But, and this is why the projective process, why I've talked about this projective process where you just count the attachment sites, the projective process is an irreducible Markov chain and it is positive recurrent. And it is positive recurrent, so there is a unique stationary distribution. And so, if you let the process go, although the cell will sort of move off or do whatever, depending upon how this distribution is chosen, the attachment sites will approach, the number of attachment sites will approach the steady state distribution. And so it will eventually approach that. Okay, so we could prove a theorem. And again, I'm interested in the velocity of the cell. I want to know how the velocity of this. Of the sail. I want to know how the velocity of this discrete centroid moves, but of course, it's discrete, so it doesn't have a velocity. But I can think about the expected value of the centroid from one position minus the position before. So this sort of tells me how much it's moving at each discrete time unit. And so we can prove that this is the expected value, provided that you start off in a distribution which is compatible with that steady state distribution of the projected process. Distribution of the projected process. So basically, you need to have the attachment sites be in the steady state distribution, the probability corresponding to the steady state distribution for this theorem to hold. Although that doesn't seem very restrictive since it is a globally attracting steady state distribution. So if you let the process run long enough, it would approach that. And so this tells us, you know, n is the number of attachment sites. R is that probability, the ratio of that probability, those probabilities I showed you. Those probably as I showed you, this is the expected value of the random variable of the outreach of the where the focus locations go. So then we extend the continuous, the discrete time jump process. So here's the centroid. It's jumping from location to location at the discrete times. We extend it to a continuous time jump process. And so we have to decide how long it's going to wait here and then the jump process and how it jumps. The jump process and how it jumps. And so we use the theorem from Callenberg. And the theorem from Callenberg requires that you have these exponentially distributed random variables. So the weight times have to be exponentially distributed. And then you can get a continuous time pure junk type Markov process from the discrete time one. And so we got that. But now the inner event times, the time that the full floates are attached, are these exponentially distributed random variables as opposed to the Distributed random variables as opposed to the Poisson ones which we did in the simulations before. We again have this projective process which just counts how many adhesion sites we have. Again, the projective process has an attracting invariant distribution, which if you roll long enough, you'll get there. Then we can show that the expectation of the continuous time-junk process is a continuous function with time. And we can prove. And we can prove that again, remember, I'm interested in velocity. I want to know the velocity of the centroid is how it's moving around. So I can look at the time derivative of the expected location of the centroid, and we can show that it is this. And again, this is the distribution of my outreach. These theta D and theta A are the exponential rates are the rates and the exponential distributions for the attach, the time the adhesion site waits to detach and reattach. Attach and reattach. So we can also extend this to one where we have chemotaxis. So here, eta is the distribution for the outreach from the cell center, but we can let eta not be just a fixed distribution, but it can be a distribution which depends upon X, its location. So as the cell moves to different locations, it has a propens, the distribution of where it will reach out will be different. And we can find the Can find the time derivative of the expectation here. This is the centroid location, and it's equal to this, although this is a more complicated expression, and it's not actually very useful in practice because this rate kernel, it's hard to access, to determine what this is without just running a simulation, sort of seeing what the average value of the centroid is. So it's this calculating this, you just have to calculate this numerically. This, you just have to calculate this numerically so you can just take an average. But we were able to prove that this get the results for this, which was why it was happening. So we went back to the non-chemotactic version where the distribution is just independent of space, and we have this. And now we want to link this to the ODE model, which is what we're doing. So again, if we start with ODE model here, it's going to move off to It's gonna move off towards this centroid according to whatever the current status of the focal adhesions are. But at some point, there will be an event, and a focal adhesion will attach or detach. And then at this point, this is where it will be at the next time when that next event happens. If the centroid started here, it would just jump to the new centroid location. So if I can get a bound on these two quantities, I can get it bound here. It turns out this quantity. Here. It turns out this quantity is related to this value, and this quantity is related to the solution of OD, which we can solve. It's this piece. And so we can get this lemma, which tells us that in one, you know, in one of these time increments before an attachment event, we have this, we can bound this distance with these two distances. And so we can get an approximation on this distance knowing this distance. This distance, knowing this distance, and with that, okay, so let's skip all of this stuff. We can prove that we can prove this theorem, which we call the expected velocity relationship of the ODE. So here we have the location of the cell at time t and the location where it started. And so the expected value of this is given by this value. And so the velocity, which This value, and so the velocity would just be this constant value. And so the theorem says that again, if you start out in a distribution which is compatible with this projected distribution where you have the right sort of probabilities for attachment sites, then in the limit, and so alpha and mu, this is the spring constant, this is the drag coefficient. In the limit, as these get very large, this quantity is a constant times time, so the velocity would be constant. Would be constant. And the constant, this well, okay, this is constant with respect to alpha and mu. It has nothing to do with the spring constant. So, in the limit, the velocity is independent of the force. And that was the expected velocity relation conjecture, that the force didn't play a part in determining the velocity. And so, in this limit, it doesn't. But so, we were very happy with this result, even though this is with exponential wage targets. So, here's some. And so here's some simulations. And so each point is the average of 30 simulations as we change the spring constant with the other things fixed. And we look at the force and the velocity in the x direction. And you can see that the velocity approaches this constant value as the theorem says it should. And these are the force values where we've already got close to that, we've asked to go close to this value. And realistic force values for And realistic force values for sales are certainly in this range. And so this looks like that for realistic force values of cells, you're probably close to this limit, at least in this experiment, this simulated example. So again, this was just sort of to say it looks like force doesn't really play a large part in terms of the speed of the cell. It's really the dynamics of the focal adhesions, which are determining the speed and sort of the motion of the cell. Of the set. So, in this last little bit, I want to talk about some work which Mary Ellen Ferner or Mary Ellen Rosen did with me as a graduate student. And we went to look for some data on focal adhesions and see how that matched with her model. And so I wanted to, from this slide, you're supposed to get one sort of idea, and it's the idea of the sort of the life cycle of a focal adhesion. So a focal adhesion starts out as a small, just a few integrands, and then it forms a nation. Just a few integrands, and then it forms a nascent adhesion, a focal complex, a focal adhesion, a fibular adhesion, and then it starts to disassemble. Now, anywhere along this way, it can be reinforced to become this more complicated structure, which can support more force until here where it starts to deassemble, or the dotted lines, you know, any one of these places it can start to deassemble. So, a focal adhesion sort of can will grow to a more, well, a nashent adhesion will become a more complicated structure, which can exert more force, but then it will start. More force, but then it will start to be disassembled, and so it will support less force and can be and can go away. Okay, so that's what you're supposed to think about from this slide. So we went out and looked and found the lifetime of folklore in the data, you know, in the literature. And so we found three data sets, which the authors very kindly sent to us. And so we could actually recreate the distributions. Two data sets were, there was enough information in the figures. There was enough information in the figures in the papers that we could sort of reconstruct distributions. Three articles we found for the lifetime of these focal adhesions, there were histograms which were pretty coarse, but we could sort of reconstruct somewhat a distribution. And then there were four papers which gave some central tendency statistics, the average standard deviation of the lifetime of these focal hegions, but not much else. So we really couldn't reconstruct the distributions of those. So we So, we started thinking about these distributions. So, these first three are from the data sets. These are from the two papers where we could reconstruct distributions, and this is one of the histogram ones that we did. So, we took these and with MATLAB, we approximated them with various distributions, and we sort of settled on this, which is the gamma distribution. And so we approximated these with the gamma distribution, and they all, the gamma distribution seems to sort of fit these two. We have the data, so we can sort of reliably think this is what's going on. Think this is what's going on. These are fairly reliable, but then things get a little coarser over here. But a gamma distribution seems to match most of these pretty well. So it seems like the life time of a focal adhesion is distributed by a gamma distribution. So then we want to take the model and we wanted to alter it. So rather than specify a distribution for the lifetime of vocal adhesion, we just wanted it to come out of the model. And so we added this off rate. Off-rate. So the focal adhesions detached according to this off-rate. And the off-rate was a function h times a function g. And the function h is a function of the lifetime of the focal adhesion. And the function g is a function of the force exerted on the focal adhesion. So we tried four values, four functional forms for each of these, for h and g. So h is the time dependent. So, h is the time dependence of the lifetime of the focal adhesion. And so, we tried a constant, so it didn't really depend upon the time, one that was linear, one that was quadratic, and then this one, which is it was zero and up to some point, capital T. And at capital T, it goes up with this logarithmic term. So, it grows like that. So, this is the off-rate for that one. For the force function that we multiplied this h by, we also tried a constant, we tried a linear function. Constant. We tried a linear function, quadratic function, and then we tried a function which was constant for a while and then went up linearly and it started up linearly. So a piecewise function. So these are the two piecewise functions. When we had H as a constant, and so we did all 16 possibilities here, and we had this one and we matched it with all four of these, we always got an exponential distribution for the on top. Distribution for the on times of the focal hegion, so that for the lifetime of focal. When we have a linear one, we would get a gamma distribution, but when we tried G3, we got exponential. When we had the quadratic, we had gamma except for G2 when it was normally distributed. And then when we had these two, we had gammas except for G3, or well, this one and all of these. We had gamma except for G3, which was exponential. And so in the end, we settled on these two because. We settled on these two because that's what we were, we were thinking, we were able to use these two to fit the data that we had gathered from those papers to get the right sorts of distributions. So let's see. Okay, so before we go there, I want to tell you how the distributions change with the parameters. So here we have t as a parameter, we have f as a parameter, so this is when we start to go up. We start to go up for the lifetime, and here you have capital F, which is when the piecewise function goes out. So these two parameters. We also have the number of attachments available in our simulations and the average number that are attached. And so we wanted to see how those change the distributions. So these are the lifetime distributions generated from the model. And so if the maximum number of focal adhesions allowed is 40, but I'll Is 40, but on average you always have about 30, then you have the cyan curve. If you allow the maximum to be 50, but you on average have 30, you get the green curve. And so these are the different values. So this sort of shows us that the maximum number of focal occasions in the model isn't really important. It's the average number that are attached, which is important. So the maximum number isn't an important parameter. And this also confirms it. So forget the red line, but the dotted line is the average. But the dotted line is the average of 20 simulations when 40 is the maximum and 30 is the average. And you can see the error bars here. And so these error bars are about this, the error going on here is the same as the error if I would have fixed one of these and just done it. And so this is just the random variation going on in the simulations. So the maximum number of focal hesions in the model really isn't important in determining the life time of this distribution. Of these folders, this distribution. So then we can change the average number of fold adhesions attached, and then you see quite a change in the distribution. So if there's only 10 attached, you have this distribution. And if you have 100 attached on average, then you'll get a distribution like this for the lifetime. Okay, so then as you change t, you get changes like this. And the most important changes in terms of fitting the data were in this upswing, right, in this region. And so as And so, as and then changing as you change f, then you change the distributions in this manner. So, once we learned how these distributions changed, we were able to fit the distributions. So, the colored curves show the distributions which we got from the literature from those histograms when we fit them with the MATLAB code to fit the histograms with these densities. And the dotted lines are the distributions that came out of our simulations when we chose the T. Chose the T and the F appropriately. And so we could fit all of them except for this magenta line, which the fit didn't work very well. Although, if we increased the number of average attachment sites for the astrocytes, we were able to fit the magenta line much better. But keeping it the same with all the other ones, we couldn't fit it. But we were able to fit many of these distributions by just changing those two parameters, and so we were quite happy with that. But of course, I was interested in how the speed. In how the speed of the cell is related to the distribution of the lifetime of the focal adhesions. So, I wanted to investigate that. And that's in this graph. And so, of course, in the literature, not all, so they reported the lifetime of the focal adhesions, but they didn't always report the speed of the cells. And when they did report the speed of the cells, it was unclear whether it was the same experiments or just the same cell type. Or just the same cell type, or exactly what was going on sometimes. So, this is data, we plotted all the information we could find where the focal adhesions and the cell speeds were both reported. So, this is just the mean of lifetime of the focal adhesion. And in some of these, we know what the distribution of it is, some of them we don't. Some of them, so we can, so then we look at the model and see what happens. So, the triangles are from data in the literature, and everything else is. In the literature, and everything else is from our simulations. So, the asterisks, the colored asterisks, show us the ones which are supposed to match with the data. So, for instance, this one, we were trying to mimic this data set because we knew its distribution. And so we're a little off on the speed, but it's again, it's hard to know exactly what they were reporting with this one. If I mean, ideally, you'd want the same cells, you're taking the lifetime of the photohesians, you'd want to report their cell speed and whether. Their cell speed, and whether that was done or not was unclear in these papers. And then the green one was to, okay, so on this green one, we modeled a distribution, but the distribution that we had didn't have a velocity with it. But the paper did give some velocities related to other experiments where they told the mean lifetime, but we couldn't recreate the distributions. But they're sort of in the same region. This red asterisk is the one that is the worst. It was supposed to mimic this point, and the velocity is quite different. But again, we Quite different, but again, we don't know if these how they reported the velocity compared to the distribution of the focal adhesions that they gave. And we can make this point get closer to here by changing various parameters in our model, although it also changes the shape of the distribution, so it doesn't match the distribution which was given for this. These two magenta astraces show the data for this one. We split them into two Into two distributions, and this is sort of the average of those two. So it looks like this was a pretty good fit. And then the pluses just show how as you change that force parameter, how it changes the lifetime, average lifetime, and how the speed changes. And the squares show how changes in T, the time, affect it. So the qualitative idea here is: well, we're not too far off except on a few, on this one. Except on a few, on this one. And all of the simulations show that as the focal adhesion lifetime increases, the speed decreases. And the data shows the same general trend. So it looks like the longer focal adhesion lifetime, the slower the cells can move. And that seems accurate. The other thing that we learned from this, which is this, we could not fit, let's let me go back here, if we didn't include in the If we didn't include in the off rate a function which was time dependent on the, you know, on how long the focal adhesion had existed, we could not get the right sorts of distributions. And so this makes us think that we really need this time dependence as well as this force dependence in order to determine the right sort of distributions for focal adhesions. Now, it could be that we really should have a spatial distribution in the off-rate because when the focal adhesions are in the back end of the cell, they're more, they will more. Of the cell, they're more they will more readily disassociate, or maybe that's what we should have for our off-rate rather than their time dependence. We should have a spatial, you know, whether it's in the front or the back of the cell, but we haven't tried that. So, in conclusion, we learned that the focal adhesion dynamics are really key to understanding cell motion and cell speed in particular. Force isn't so important, and we would really like to study more about how these the lifetime of these focal regions affect the mobile. Affect the motion of the cells. So, thank you. So, yeah, thank you very much, John, for a very interesting talk. I'd like to invite questions, comments in the chat or in person. So, Luigi, please. Hello, hi, John. How are you? My question is the following. Can you comment on how this is Can you comment on how this is related with the catch-sleep bonds, the behavior of lifetime with respect to the force that is applied, which is somewhat reverse to what you are doing in your function H, I believe. I mean, is the last part that you described has to do anything to do with this behavior of, say, TPJ or something like that on the force that is applied on the on the cell. That is applied on the cell. Can this be done? Yeah, I don't. We haven't. So I know, so I know that the catch bond behavior of these adhesion sites is quite important in showing how the cell behaves in compliant substrates. And we haven't really looked at anything like that. Although, how it affects these functions, I haven't thought carefully about that. But I assume it would change, you know, the Know the yeah, I mean, the it would, I yeah, I haven't thought carefully about it, so I don't know, but I assume it's it would be a very good thing to do. Okay, okay, thanks. Thank you, Luigi. Other questions? Hans, you seem to be ready to ask something. Well, I was going to ask much the same question, exactly, because of this clutch model. Clutch model and the fact that you're treating H and G independently, your time and your force, whereas it seems to me the force should, or the time should certainly depend on the force. Because if you think of the binding back and forth, the more force you put on it, the less likely it is to make a successful bond. And so that's what I. Uh that's what I that's what I would have thought uh would would apply here. Yeah, no, I think that's accurate, but in a way, the um so if the way the forces that the um by multiplying these together in the way you have this, the the functional form here may not be the quite quite the right way. So maybe the force the force here should be time dependent, what are allowed here. Dependent what are allowed here. But in the model, so I mean, I think that the model tells you something about the relationship between the forces and the time, if not quite as precise as you are saying with what you're saying, but I think you can conclude some things about it by looking at sort of how these, the product of these two, how the forces, what sort of forces you can obtain and how they work in time in terms of and that sort of will help you understand how the distribution of these. You understand how the distribution of these lifetimes forms. These give us distributions which sort of were measured. I'm not sure these functional forms are quite accurate, but we were able to work with these in an easy way. And the other one's a little bit more complicated, but I think it sort of gives you the same, it gives you information, which is still useful. Well, I was going to suggest that possibly as a next step, you might take what you learned will work here and put it into a somewhat more realistic. A somewhat more realistic model for the attachment and then see how it goes. I mean, basically, what I would say is your work here has put you very close to the correct model because now you can get the macroscopic data out of your model and now go to the next step. Yeah, no. So, you know, I agree that a fun thing would be to be very much more careful on seeing how the adhesion sites are formed and the more complicated formations of adhesion. And the more complicated formation of the adhesion sites rather than just sort of throwing something out and having it attached for a permanent period of time. Yeah. And say hello to Mariella. John, can you show again where these functions H and G come into play? So it's right at the off-rate. We have an off-rate for this random variable. It's in the psi, okay. Okay. Right. And so this is the off-rate for the off-rate. For the okay, yeah, thanks. We have this product, and then we tried, as I said, we tried all 16 combinations of these, and then we're able to get these kind of matches. John, for your internal cell dynamics, I think you assume all the springs are the same, right? But would it make sense to consider strings to maybe become stronger if they have a stronger force to deal with? Yeah, no, that's also very, isn't very interesting. know that's also very is a very interesting thing and much more complicated yeah yeah sure okay any further questions for john i see none so then thank you very much john for a very interesting talk then um then the official talks have ended for today so we have still we can continue the meeting on gather town i invite you all to come there and hang out and talk to To come there and hang out and talk to somebody, I myself will be there too, but not for too long because we have another talk of a postdoc candidate which I should attend.
