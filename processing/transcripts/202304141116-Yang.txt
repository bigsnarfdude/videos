All right, excellent. So, our icing on the cake will be a talk by John Wood Young, and he's going to speak on infinitely renormalizable unimodal anonyms. Thank you very much. So, thanks to the organizers for this wonderful conference and also for inviting me to give the very last talk, which I take it, you know. Uh which I take it, you know, means they either trust me to give a a satisfying conclusion, or they thought that if anyone needed to leave early, my talk was the most necessary. But in any case, I'm very happy to be here. And I'm going to talk about real HANO maps. And one thing I learned from this workshop is that everyone has their own favorite way of parameterizing the Hanon maps. This is my favorite. So let's denote the family of Hanon maps by H, and it will consist of maps of the form say x squared plus a minus by and yes so it's a two parameter family which can be visualized by the parameter plane say a b and on the axis this is the line when b is equal to zero so note that the parameter b represents the jacobi of your map right so when b is equal to zero you have So when v is equal to zero, you have the set of degenerate panel maps, which can be identified with the real quadratic polynomials. So the whole plane represents the set of panel maps, and this A-axis represents the real quadratic polynomials. And here, the dynamics is completely understood, thanks to the randomization theory of unimodal integral maps. And what I'm going to present to you today is a generalization, a two-dimensional Is a generalization, a two-dimensional generalization of this renominization theory, which can be applied to the study of non-degenerate anomalies. And a key step will be to identify what it means for a 2D diffeo to be unimodal. So what is the correct analog of a 1D map having a unique critical orbit? So that, I suspect, will take most of its time, but I'm hoping after that, I'll still have 10 minutes or so. I'll still have 10 minutes or so to describe how well we control the dynamics, how well we control the geometry of such mass. But one disclaimer before I get into it, what we can be pretty sure is that unlike in the one-dimensional case, the renormalization theory probably won't get us everything. It won't give us a complete understanding of the dynamics of the Hanon family. And the reason is because in 1D, infinite. Get 1D, infinite renormalizability is kind of the worst case scenario. So if you can deal with infinite renormalizable quagita polynomials, well then you're in good shape. But in 2D, most likely, well in fact, we know that there are behaviors that arise which is possibly more complicated than infinitely not like. For example, the New House phenomenon. So it probably won't be the whole story, the renalization theory, but I think it's still a very important. But I think it's still a very important part of the story. All right, so let's get into the minimalization theory. So let's set up our dynamical system. So our phase space will be the two-dimensional analog of an interval, which will be a Jordan domain. So let omega be a Jordan domain. And by Jordan domain, I mean Jordan domain, I mean a topological disk with a topological circle as its boundary. And already there's a difference with the one-dimensional case, right? Because in one dimension, an interval has very nice, simple geometry, whereas a Jordan domain could have horrible geometry. In our map, we'll be taking this Jordan disk compactly into itself. Yes compactly contained and we will require that F is C2 and it's dissipative so F will be C2 diffeomorphism dissipative and I won't write it down but orientation preserve as well actually we need something stronger than just dissipate dissipation so we will actually Dissipation, so we will actually require what's been mentioned several times during this workshop: mild dissipation. But we don't really need to use it in any explicit way, so you don't need to really keep in mind. Okay, so we have this infinite diffeomorphism, and then we say that this is renormalizable if it satisfies the following condition. Definition: F is renormalizable. F is renormalizable if, okay, well, in general, if you have a dynamical system, we would say that it's renormalizable if it exhibits self-similarity at a smaller scale. In this particular instance, we define renormalizability as the existence of a periodic Jordan subdomain inside your base space. If there exists our periodic Jordan subdomain, let me call it D. It's contained in only graph. And R, the period has to be something greater than or equal to 2. So what does it mean for a domain to be periodic? Well, it's simple. Let's say that you have a disk, a region inside your phase space. A region inside your phase base, which we'll call B. We say that this thing is R-periodic if when you first apply your map, it moves off of its original position. And then you keep iterating, and it will always be disjoint from the original domain. But then after you iterate by R times, it will map compactly into the domain that you started with. So that's what it means for a domain to be periodic. So if you iterate once, let's say it goes over here. Let's say it goes over here, iterate one more time, it goes somewhere else. But then, if you iterate r times, so let's say r is equal to three, then this thing will be taken compactly into itself. So under the first return map onto this domain, so first return map will be F to the R, you get this subdomain mapping compactly entrance. And here we see that it's consistent with this general definition of renormalizability because Renomizability because we started with a map of a disk into itself, and now we have a smaller scale version of the same kind of method. And in this case, we define the renormalization of F, renormalization of F of F to be this first return map. So we denote it by fancy R. So we generate by fancy R of F, and this is equal to the first return map restricted to the renormalization domain. Technically speaking, this should be the pre-renormalization because as Dennis mentioned, renormalization usually incorporates some kind of rescaling to normalize your map, but we don't need to sort of worry about this. Oh, never left. Yes, thanks. Okay, so this is once renormalizable map, right? If it has a periodic subdisc. If the renormalization of F is also renormalizable, then we will say that it's twice renormalizable. If the second renormalization is also three times renormalizable, and so on. So we will suppose that our math is actually infinitely renormalizable. F is infinitely Is infinitely renormalizable, which means that, well, you have an infinite nest of periodic suffixes, right? So for all n greater than or equal to 1, there exists Rn periodic sorted subdisc DN, which is compactly contained in the preceding subdisc. So I'll call it D10. So I call it D templates. Your definition of renormalization is just the ones that are restricted to a different region through the D. That's right, yeah. So we're just defining renormalization to be the first return map onto a periodic substance. Okay, so that's infinitely normalizable. So what we have is we have this first renormalization on D1. D1, and then if it's inferiorizable, there should be an infinite nest of periodic disks. So let me just draw one more level and then you'll kind of get the general picture. So there should be one more disk. Let me not use red, let me use green. So there should be another disc in here, which we call D2, right? And this should be periodic under the return number. So if you map F to the R, then it should come back not exactly onto itself, but somewhere else. Let's say over here. Else, let's say over here. So that's the image of D2 under the first return. And then, if you keep mapping by the first return, it will eventually map back compactly into itself. And then, of course, once you have this periodic disks inside the sub-disk, you can spread this by the dynamics to get a whole cycle. Any questions so far? No, we're good? All right. So, if we So, if we are infinitely normalizable, then we can obtain a totally invariant, compact topological attractor by taking these cycles of periodic domains and taking their nested intersection. So, I'm going to write it here. Hopefully, everyone can see. So, we define, we call this logical tractor the minimalization limit set, or more simply, the odometer. So, the odometer. Odometer of F, I'll denote by lambda, capital lambda, and this is equal to, you take the nth cycle, so for n equal to zero up to infinity, take the union of the images. You take the ant disk and then you take their images so that you get the full cycle. images so that you get the full cycle so i equals to zero up to rn minus one and then you take their intersection zero to all basically you take these cycles and then you take the intersection and then you should come up with some kind of compact nested set like this which we call and what we're interested in is trying to analyze the geometry To analyze the geometry of this odometer, the first before we get into that, we need to make some remarks. So, the first remark is that this odometer will be uniquely ergodic. So, it has a unique invariant measure mu. And with respect to this unique ergotic measure, the dynamics will have two Lyophonic finds. One will be zero, and the other one has to be negative. Has to be negative. So let me just write that down. F on the odometer is uniquely robotic and it has Lyapunov exponents. Has Lyapunov exponents 0 and something negative. I'll call the negative Lyapunov exponent log lambda less than 0, where lambda is some number between 0 and 1. between zero and one so actually the fact that the you have unicornicity is not obvious it would be obvious if the odometer was like in the 1d case a cantor set but a priori you don't know that's a cantresset right so you actually need to use proper the mild dissipation to prove that's really great right and the fact that these are the Lyapunov exponents is also not super obvious but it's something that can be Super obvious, but it's something that can be proved. So, I don't know how many people here are familiar with the open of exponents. But in case you're not familiar, let me tell you how I interpret this statement, that the Lyapunov exponent is zero and something negative. So the fact that these are the Lyapunov exponents means that if you look at the odometer, then a typical point has two transverse directions associated to it, one corresponding to the opponent of exponent zero. One corresponding to Lyapunov exponent zero and one corresponds to negative Lyapunov exponent. So the one corresponding to zero is called the center direction and the other one is called the stable direction. So if you look along the stable direction and you iterate your map, then the fact that the Lyapunov exponent is negative means that you have exponential contraction along the stable direction as you iterate forward. If you iterate backwards and it's the opposite, then you'll have exponential expansion along the stable direction. By factor lambda, or one over lambda after it. Or one over lambda expansion. Okay? And along the center direction, it means that you have sub-exponential growth or expansion. Or if you first think of it, if you iterate your map and you look along the center direction, then you kind of, on average, see neutral growth by expansion factor. Any questions? Yes, Dennis. I don't know if you're going to explain the later on, but Later on, but in which way can this fail to be canterset? In which case can it fail to be canterset? Because I'm not sure what you mean. I mean, if it has a non-trivial component, then it should found a canter set, but that's probably not the answer you're looking for. So what we can prove using model dissipation is that almost all components will be singletons. But we can't immediately rule out that. We can't immediately rule out that everything has to be set. But of course, once we assume innovality, then we will be able to set it. Okay. So now let's try to understand the geometry of this object. And our main tool will be the synth theory. Actually, for what we needed to do, we needed to reformulate the synth theory a little bit. Needed to reformulate the SIN theory a little bit so that it is more quantitative. And its statement, I can say it in words, but I think it's better to do it with a picture. So let me draw what we obtain when we apply Cassin theory to ourselves. So Cassin theory tells us that if we have this odometer, then the following statement holds, there exists some very small epsilon such that. Such that for almost every point P naught in the odometer, there exists some constant L which depends on the point and the epsilon so that P naught is L Piss in breakthrough. So, what does this mean? Basically, what it means is that we have a very explicit description of the local dynamics of F along the orbit of this regular point. And what kind of description? Let me draw. You have your initial point, which is L is in regular, whatever that means. So then let me draw its whole orbit: P1, P2, P3. T3, and then pre-images, T minus 1, T minus 2, and so on. So if it's L Positive and regular, it's a typical point, then like I said before, it has the two directions, the stable direction and the center direction. So let me draw the stable direction kind of looking vertical. So this is the stable direction at P0. I denote the stable direction by E, yes. And then I can distribute this by the dynamics, so it'll look something like this. And we also have the center direction. So you have these two directions. And like I said before, if you look at the average growth rate along the stable direction, the average exponential growth rate will be like lambda to the n. Right? If you look along the stable. Right, if you look along the stable, and if you look along the center, it would look something like one to the end. So it would be that. All right, so, but we can say more because what we can actually do is so we have this dynamic taking you from one orbit point to the next, and we can actually linearize the local dynamics in what I will call an epsilon shrinking one over L neighborhood of the sport. Neighborhood of this orbit. So, what does that mean? It's actually quite simple. You draw a disk to cover your orbit. So, I'll draw a disk at the center, starting with this. And the radius will be 1 over L. L is the regularity. And now I go forward and backward, but each time I move forward, I have to shrink the radius of this disk by a factor, an exponent factor, epsilon. Excellent. So I move here and I can draw another disc, but the radius will have shrunk a little bit. So the radius of this will be the same as the radius before, 1 over L, but I have to shrink it by lambda to the epsilon. And the same rule applies if I keep going. So this one, the radius will be 1 over L lambda to the 2 epsilon. This will be 1 over L lambda to the 3 epsilon, and so forth. To the 3 epsilon, and so on. And when you go backwards, same thing, this will be 1 over L lambda to the epsilon, 1 over L lambda to the 2 epsilon, and so on. So what is the importance of this? Okay, so the picture is a little bit too squeezed together, but what is the importance of this lambda to the epsilon? The point is that if you're trying to control the local dynamics of your map, you can't do it globally, certainly. And in fact, if you start And in fact, if you s start to move away from the point where you know you have regularity, you lose control of how your map behaves. But the loss of control is very slow. And by very slow, I mean relative to the amount of contraction that you will get along the slope. So the contraction that you get is lambda, and something much slower than that is lambda to the epsilon. So this is the kind of interpretation of these, what are called regular domains. What are called regular domains. So, this regular domain, like called u0, u1, u2, and so on. U minus 1, u minus 2. So, we want to linearize the local dynamics. So, what it means is that on these neighborhoods, we have changes of coordinates. So, I call these phi naught, phi1, phi2, phi minus 1, phi minus 2. So, we get some disk. Some disk right here, and it sends the orbit point to the middle, to the origin, and it sends the stable direction to the genuine vertical direction, and the center direction to the genuine horizontal direction. And when you factor your dynamics through this change of coordinates, your map becomes. Coordinates, your map becomes as simple as it can be. Basically, it becomes a linear map of the form, so 100m and so it's what it means to linearize the dynamics. So you have this. Disks around your orbit, and on these disks, you can simplify your dynamics tremendously. So, under this linear action, nothing happens along the horizontal direction, but along the vertical direction, you have this explanation contraction. Okay, and why this helps is because it gives you this explicit control of the geometry of the stable manifold and the central manifold for regular points. Central manifold for regular points. Because down here, the stable manifold will be just a genuine vertical axis. So that's the curve which contracts exponentially by lambda when you iterate the map. So down here, the stable manifold are just vertical axis. And if you want the stable, the actual stable manifold for the dynamics, then you just pull the vertical axis up by this change of orbits. And so you get these nice curves. Ice curves that follow your orbit. And you can see that at the initial point, when you have L push in regularity, you have control of the geometry of size 1 over L. And as you stray away from your center point, you start to, well, you know, so you lose the length of the stable manifold on which you have control of the job. So that's the stable manifold and the center manifold. That's the stable manifold, and the center manifold the same here. You take the horizontal axis, which is the center manifold for the map 1, 0, 0, lambda. And then if you want the actual stable manifold or a center manifold, you just pull it back by the change of points. So I called the stable manifold WS of P0, and the center manifold will be denoted WC. Will be denoted WC of people. This is the way Pacin theory tells you about the local geometry of the Pacific. Any questions about this? It's very important. Yes, that's it. You have this quantifier in epsilon. I hope it's more actually. Maybe is it somewhere in the definition of health does it? Yes, so well, okay, so epsilon just needs to be, it actually could be for any epsilon. It just Epsilon. It just when we choose the epsilon smaller, we need to choose L bigger. L is a function of epsilon. Yeah, L is a function of epsilon and do you have an estimate on this side, the charts? Ah, yes, I do. Yeah, I do. So basically, the size of the fee is the regular. So the CR norm of fee or C2 norm of fee is L. Is L. And the idea is that if you start to move away from the point where you have L regularity, you start to lose regularity, so the L starts to grow, but by L, by lambda to the minus epsilon. So the regularity of this point is, let's say, L. The guaranteed regularity of this point is L times lambda to the minus epsilon. Here it's L times lambda to the minus 2 epsilon. Okay? And the norm on the phi is And then the norm on the fee is exactly the regularity. Okay, now a remarkable that we're using as in theory to control the local geometry of the stable. The local geometry of the stable and central manifolds. But actually, these are two disjoint stories in a way. Because if you wanted to control the stable manifold, you don't need the full orbit of this point. You actually only need the forward half of the orbit. Because the stable manifold, you can think of it as a set of points with the same future as your orbit point. You only care about what's happening in forward time. So if we just have this picture, then we say that this point Then we say that this point is L forward regular, not Pacini. And if we want the center manifold, well, then similarly, the center manifold you can think of as a set of all points with the same past as P0. So you only need the backward part of this image. Then, if we just have this part of the image, then we say that this point is L backward regular. And we denote the set of regular points in the following way. Denote the set of L SN forward backward regular points and lambda by okay, so I'll denote it by lambda subscript L and if it's percin regular I'll call it P if it's forward regular I'll call it plus If it's forward regular, I'll call it plus, and if it's backward regular, I'll call it minus. And this gives us a way to define what it means for a point to be, for a dynamical system to be uniformly, partially hyperbolic. I don't think anyone's ever defined uniform partial hyperbolicity or uniform hyperbolicity in this workshop. Okay, so here's the definition. Definition. F is uniformly Uniformly, partially hyperbolic. If, well, every point is L Pacific regular for some reason. If there exists L such that if you look at the set of L Pacific regular points, it's equal to both. So this is kind of the easy case, the uniformly. The easy case, the uniformly partially hyperbolic case. And I'll try to convince you why it's easy by using some kind of simplified example. So if you have a uniformly partial hyperbolic system, and let's say that the domain, our disk omega, looks something like this. Let's say it looks like a long ellipse, like so, where the size of this is something much smaller than one over L. 1 over L. So you have this logometer in this domain, and let's say that you have L is indegular. You have uniform pressure hyperbolicity. So every point is L is in regular for some L, let's say. Then look what the dynamics look like. So all these points will have stable manifolds with good geometry of size at least 1 over L. So you can kind of pretend that you're stable. Pretend that your stable manifolds, every point in your attractor, has stable manifolds, which looks something like this. Well, then you don't actually have to worry about the two-dimensionality of the system because it's just factors by the stable manifold. You can just factor by the stable manifold, and then you just have one dynamically relevant direction, which is the center curve. So, this kind of situation will be very simple to analyze. It will be very simple to analyze, but unfortunately, if you assume that our map is infinitely normalizable, it can't be uniformly, partially half-walled. So it has to be, by necessity, a non-uniformly, partially half-walled system. And the reason is because you can ask later if it tricks why it's non-uniform here. Okay, so I'm gonna erase here. Any questions so far? So we defined what it means for a point to be assumed regular. To be cosine regular, forward regular, backward regular, and uniform partially hyperbolic is if every point is cosine regular. But our system, our F-Mormalizable system, cannot be uniformly, partially hyperbolic. So that means that something has to go wrong with the geometry of the stable and center membranes. So they can't all be nice and straight locally. So something has to kind of deteriorate. So the way we're going. So, the way we're going to define a unimodal diffeom is by saying above, a diffeomorphism is unimodal if it's not uniformly partially hyperbolic, but the cause of the non-uniformity in the partial hyperbolicity is exactly accounted for by the presence of a critical work. So, we need to find. So let me first define what a critical orbit is, and then I'll define what unimodality is. So we say that if you have an orbit, definition, so if you have an orbit, let's call it Cm contained in your odometer, that we say that this is a This is a regular quadratic clinical orbit if it satisfies the following three properties. Actually, you know, before I write down the properties, let me say that the simplest way to define a regular quadratic critical orbit will be to define it as an orbit so that each point has a stable manifold and a center manifold, but they're not transverse. So these two manifolds are transverse. So they're so these two manifolds are tangent to each other. And the fact that it's quadratic means that this tangency is quadratic. That's the simplest way to define a regular quadratic critical orbit, but we're going to specify a few more details so that it makes it easy. But basically, this definition boils down to what I just said. So if we have this critical orbit, then we will assume that the critical value has good stable manifest. So we will assume that C. So we'll assume that C1 is forward regular. For the definition, I really need it to be just forward regular for some L, but for simplicity, let's assume that L is equal to 1. So this has to be forward regular with, let's say, regularity 1. And I need the clickable point to have good center manifold. So the clickable point will be nice and backward regular. And the third point will be right here. Right here. Now, I don't know. The third point will be that, okay, so you have stable manifold for the critical value, you have central manifold for the critical point, and actually at this point, let me draw a picture. So you have this critical orbit, C naught, C1, C2, so on, C minus 1, C minus 2, and so on, like this. The fact that the critical value is for regular means that. Value is forward regular means that it has a nice stable manifold like this. And the fact that the critical point is backward regular means that it has a nice center manifold like this. It has a nice center manifold. This is worse. A blue pot there. It has a nice center manifold. Like this. And since the critical value is forward regular, The critical value is forward regular, you can draw the picture that I just erased, right, for the forward orbit of the critical value. So you can start with a neighborhood of size O1, and then you iterate forward, and each time you have to shrink by lambda to the epsilon. This will be lambda to the 2 epsilon, and so on. So you have this neighborhood covering the critical value, and you can linearize the forward dynamics starting from the critical value so that you have. So that you have what? You have phi1, phi2, so on. Critical value orbit is sent to the middle, and the stable manifold just becomes the vertical axis. And the transition from one point to another is just given by the linear map 0, 1, 1, or 1, 0, 0. The first condition guarantees that we have this very simple description of the local dynamics. Description of the local dynamics around the critical value, right? Which is nice in the forward direction. Same thing with the critical point. You have this neighborhood, which is epsilon shrinking, lambda to the two epsilon. And then you have this coordinate chart, phi naught, phi minus one, this. And up to the critical moment, the dynamics is given by just one, zero, zero, lambda. And the center manifold is just sensitive. Okay, you're with me so far? Yes? All right, so if you were to map the center manifold to the critical value, and if these two manifolds were transverse, then this orbit would just be a Pacific regular orbit. Right? So, in order to break this regularity, we need to create a tendency, and we demand that this tendency is quadratic. So, if you take So if you take a stable manifold at the critical value and you take the image of the center manifold at the critical point, then they have quadratic tangence. And so the picture should look something like this. Okay, so now let's try to move downstairs. And you want to, it would be nice if the transition Be nice if the transition from the critical point to the critical value was also something as simple as 1, 0, 0, lambda. But of course, that's impossible because if you map this by 1, 0, 0, lambda, horizontal goes to horizontal, not the parameter. But there is a nice map which sends the horizontal to a parabola, which is what? Everyone should know. The head-on, right? So the transition map here, you can normalize it so that it's x squared minus lambda. x squared minus lambda y x. So this will take horizontal lines and map it to graphs. All right, so this is a regular critical orbit, and any system which has a regular critical orbit will not be uniformly partially have a ball. And it's very easy to see this just by looking at what happens to the geometry of the center and stable manifolds, right? Because if you're looking at the geometry of the center manifold, for example, Of the center manifold, for example, what will happen is this thing will send to this parabola, and then its future images will just be images under this linear map. So, what this center manifold will look like if you start iterating is it will start to squeeze and start to pinch more and more. So, you see this kind of blow-up of curvature near the orbit. You can't have a nice long, unfolded central manifold. Unfolded center manifold in the forward image of the critical value. And same thing with the stable manifold. So if you were to pull this back, it will look like this parabola, like this, upside-down parabola. And then if you start to iterate backwards, it'll expand this way. So it'll start to pinch more and more, like this, and you have, again, that's the generation of the okay, so any system which contains a critical orbit is non-uniformly. Critical orbit is non-uniformly partially equibolic. We will say that definition F is unimodal if the following conditions hold. First of all, okay, people can see if I write here. So first, if you take, so this causes all the non-uniformity in the hyperbolic sphere. Okay? So if you have a point which stays outside Which stays outside this neighborhood, and we want to say that it's in regular, but let's be a little bit more specific. So, we will say that if you take a point in the odometer and it's outside the union of the backward neighborhood of the critical orbit, so let me again label the regular neighborhoods u0, u minus 1, u minus 2, u1, u2, so on. Right? So, if you're outside the union of these neighborhoods, we will say that some. These neighborhoods, we will say that such a point is forward rated. Well, that's the requirement. Okay, so if you're outside, the union as n goes to zero to infinity, union of the backward regular neighborhoods, u minus n. And this point is L forward regular. And symmetric condition on the points which avoid the forward. The point which avoid the forward regular neighborhoods, two P inside in odometer, but outside the forward regular neighborhoods of the critical value, then P is backward regular. If there exists some L such that this works, then it's said to be. Let me give a little intuition why this is. Let me give a little intuition why this condition is natural, right? Because basically, we want to say that a point is forward regular if, well, nothing happens when you go forward, right? But if you're inside one of these neighborhoods, then what happens is when you start iterating forward, at some point you kind of come very close to the critical point. So that will destroy the forward regularity at this point. And same thing with the backward regularity. If you start somewhere here, then as you iterate backwards, at some point you hit the critical value. At some point, you just hit the critical value, and then at the critical moment, you're regular. So, as long as these two things don't happen, the points should be forward regular and backward regular stuff. Then we say that's tuning. Questions? Yes? Just an indication, yeah. Six minutes. Six minutes. Um all right, okay. Um So, what I wanted to say takes 10 minutes, so I don't know. Okay, all right, so let's see. So, alright, so this definition of getting a model, okay, and I guess I have to justify the definition by showing that it's non-empty. So, the definition is nice, but I mean, if it doesn't actually apply to any examples, then choose this. So, what you can show. So, what you can show is that, and maybe this theorem will only make sense to the experts. So, what you can show is that if you have a Henon map, yeah, Henon, then it is unimodal if and only if its renormalization converges to a 1D. Non is unimodal in the sense that we define if and only if. If and only if F is contained in the stable manifold of 1D renormalization points. So this excludes conservative right-wing. It excludes also all of the stories for J, but equal to 5 and last of all. There is no okay, like. Okay, like yeah. Yes, Michael. Do you generally expect that this is a co-dimension one condition? Uh yes. Well, I expect that um the infinite renormalizability is a co-dimension one. Okay, well okay, so I didn't know whether to propose this in the problem session yesterday, but I suspect that for Henon maps, whenever you break uniform partial hyperbolicity or hyperbolicity or dominated splitting, I suspect. Or dominated splitting, I suspect that it's because of a presence of a gradient. Yeah, so an infinitely normalizable system is codimension one. It has to have some kind of critical point, and I suspect that you can kind of prove by general principles that it has to be critical. Okay, and just one more theorem is that, right, so if Right, so if you can show, so it's not easy to check if a map is unimodal. Currently, the only thing that we have figured out is actually using the 1D renormalization operator theory in order to conclude that something is unimodal for nearby parameters. What we would like to do eventually, and I have some ideas, is to have some kind of independent way of checking unimodality for a map. And once you do that, then you'll be able to actually prove that the stable manifold. To actually prove that the stable manifold goes on the way that you could. That's something in the future. But for now, what you can say is that if you have an infinitely normalizable Henel map, which is Unimodal, then you actually can completely describe the stable and center manifold of every point in your model. If F is unimodal and infinitely normalizable, then there is There is a complete description of WS and WC for all points. And so I was kind of hoping to get into exactly what all the stable and center metaphors look like. All the stable and center manifolds look like, but I think I'm out of time. Two minutes? Okay, I'm gonna try and then I'll just kind of fizzle out. Okay. Let me start with a let's say a regular point. So most points. Regular points. So most points will be outside the data hood that I just erased. So most points will be considered regular with some bound on the regular. So if you take, let's say, let P be a L considered regular point, then from what I just described, you know that this P has a stable manifold, which is kind of nice. Let me draw it just straight vertical, right? And the size of this stable manifold would be 1 over half. And the size of this stable manifold will be 1 over health. And it will have a center manifold. It will have a center manifold, which is also nice and straight, at least on a neighborhood of size 1. But actually, what's more important than just the manifold at this one point is if you take different points in this regular set, how the stable and central manifolds Stable and central manifolds compare to each other. It's very important, right? So, what you can actually do is cover this point by a rectangle, a small, thin rectangle like this. And what you can guarantee is that if you have another point, which is regular, which sits inside this box, let me call this box BP, right? So, if you have another point Q, then you're guaranteed of the stable and center manifolds that the stable and center manifolds. Stable and center manifolds will just look like parallel curves to the one in the center. Right, so inside this box, if you just consider the Pacific regular points, you have this nice laminar product structure for the stable and central box. Yes? Is this, there exists such box that could be this? Yes, that's right. Well, for every regular point, there can find such a box. And in fact, you just need to choose the box smaller, and you'll have this. Okay? All right, so what's interesting. Alright, so what's interesting in the 30 seconds that I have are the points which is not regular. Okay, so how do you control these consequences? So if a point is not regular, then it has to be contained in this regular neighborhood around the critical orbit, like so. Let's look at a point which is not forward. So its stable manifold is not nice. It's not nice in vertical. So the failure of forward hurting. The failure of four regularity means that you have to be somewhat close to the critical, or its image is close to the critical. So let's try to describe what that manifold will be like. So what you can show is that if you have a point in here, which is not contained in any of the backward images of the critical points, then it will be forward regular. So it will have a nice stable. Forward regular. So it will have a nice stable manifold which is parallel to the stable manifold at the critical value. Right? So if you assume that this point does not come too close to the critical point in its forward. So you have a point here, which is not forward regular because it's too close to the critical point. But what you can do is you can take its image. So let's say this is P0. You take its image P1. Now it's free of all the backward orbits of the critical point, let's say. Of the critical point, let's say. Then it's going to be forward regular like this. So, therefore, the stable manifold at the initial point when you don't have forward regularity will just be the pre-image of this vertical line under the Henona, which will be brown. So, what you can show is that if you have a point in here, which is not for regular, then what you can show is that there's actually a pre-image of a critical point nearby. Image of a critical point nearby, and all the points in here, which is not contained in a deeper critical neighborhood, will have stable manifolds that look like this. And then the question becomes, what happens if you take this point, which is not for regular, and you move it, and it's still not free of all these backward regular neighborhoods? Well, then you have to keep iterating forward until it comes back to this, and then you back it again, and then maybe it's. And then you back it again, and then maybe it's free of any backward images, and then it'll be four regular, and then you pull back. So there's a way to describe the geometry of state elements. But I think I'm out of time, so let's start. Thank you.
