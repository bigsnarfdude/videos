So, I will present joint work with Jeomin Han and Juhi Song from He Konk University in Korea. So, I reconsider the following n component Gens-Bon-Londo equation. London equation when so when n equals one is a standard against Molondo equation studied by Bituel, Brisis and Dela. So we given a boundary condition G1 G Gn. From the boundary of omega to S1 with degree dg for if dg is a greater, is an integer, it's greater or equal than zero. So the system corresponds to the Euler Lagrange equation for this for the energy. For this, for the energy, so we have so the this part is the same. So, this it's a sum of gradient uj, uj h1 j u j is in h one j g and this is a relaxed uh is a relaxed potential. So for n equal to 2, it's 2 minus u1 square minus u2 square. So we can say we look for the answer is achieved in H1, G G and we want to study the asymptotic behavior of Eurepsion as epsilon goes Euro epsilon as epsilon goes to zero. I just want to say a word about the motivations. So I refer to these two papers, so I just give you just the reference. It's Vakas Pachi and Ashokaru in 91. So, this what it is written here is corresponds to the n equal one. So, the Lagrangian density is given by this by L0 for the problem for the classical Guys-Bo-Londu equation is when A Equation is when A is zero. So what the Elder equation is as here. And as a direct generalization, so the authors proposed to the following generalization. Generalization for C equal to U1, Un. UK is from, this is a Mankowski space, so I will not speak about this. So the Lagrangian corresponding to L0 is this one, which as usual also still invariant by A variant by under the Joseph transformation transformations this one and this and the Euler Lagrange equation is the following and I will refer to n component Guys-Warlonger equation for this for this system this model is useful is useful so uh and the study of some uh some uh some uses and cosmology for for for example the formation of cosmic strings that have both local and uh local and global nature for the for for the for the physical uh application of this model i refer to uh so the the the paper of So the paper of Vakaspati and Ashokaru and also Hindmar March. And for our studies, we suppose that A equals zero. So I recall a very known result for n equals one. So we know that. one so we know that the we have for a sub sequence ux converge to some so your u star which is harmonic and this with harmonic maps and and the smooth and omega minus d point is the degree and the energy is the u u u epsilon of u e epsilon of u epsilon is E epsilon of u epsilon is 2 pi d log of epsilon plus a constant which gives the location of the vertices A G. I just give some idea to understand the problem. So, that's what I will say here. It's from Say here, it's from it's due to Brazil and the case n equal one. So we if we if we take if we take omega is the interval 0, 1 and key g1 take n equal to so we have this constant. So an n equal to n equal to 1. And n equals n equal to we speak about harmonic maps. So u square equal one and omega. If we take the if we minimize the energy on zero one, so and for n equal one, we have four possibilities. And we can see that if u is in h1, it is not possible to have the multiple. To have the modulus of u equals one, since u is continuous and for if j is not a constant, so from minus one to plus one must vanish. When we give some there is 16 possibilities, or I gave some possibilities, and we can see it is there is no obstruction because if Because even for, for example, G1 equals minus one, G1 of 0 minus 1, G1 of 1 equals 1, for G2 d of 0, 1, and G2 of 1 equal minus 1. So U1 can be 0, but of course, we have this constant equal 2. So this can be 0, but this We can have zero here, and the sum is not zero. So there is no constant. I will give also another way to understand also the problem. So the purpose of this study is to study the To study the asymptotic behavior of the many measures as HM goes to zero. And here there is a difference because a big difference comparing to the case n equal one studied by Betuel, Br√©sis and De Helen. And the case so the the the the limit The limit. So, we consider the possible limit equation, which could be n component generalization of harmonic maps, as I say later, and some sense. For n equal 1, so the limit must have when d is not zero, have this angularity. But for our case, for this case, for the case when n equals For the case when n equals greater than 2, it will be like the case when the degree is zero. The difference is related to the non-existence of singular harmonic maps and for n equal 1, h1g omega. H1g omega s1 is zero, so it's it's empty and that is u epsilon can be zero. So for the to study the system one, so and component Gizborne and component Gizbolondo Equation. So we use this set key G1G2 GN so far which is the maps U1 UN and with this construct. The asymptotic behavior of minimizer of UX is closely related to the maps and To the maps and J1 or KJ1GN, since it is expected that the sum of minimizers will converge to n here. N is the number of the equation of the system. But so the limit will be n or. Will be n almost everywhere. And thus, it is important to know that if the set is empty or not. So when n equals one, it is empty. And for our case, it will be not empty. Another way to understand the problem is to see a solution you want. A solution U1 Un and the set key G1GN as a point in the sphere S to n minus one, because each U1 is U11, U12, etc. And for n greater than one, the homotopy group of group of S2N minus one is trivial. So there is no topological obstruction and we can expect that the limit problem will have will have no singularities. So more precisely, for n greater than two, we can show that the set is not empty. empty we can have this so they for the degree positive or zero for every j so this this set is not empty and if and the minimization for the minizer minimization problem has is achieved it is not empty we we can find we can construct not very Not very difficult. You can construct a function in this set. So if we take vj here in H1, which is not, with the sum is not, it's not zero, take WG is as written here. If you compute the energy of Wj, it is bounded. So beta is finite and is achieved by standard argument. So it is achieved. So the associate Lagrange equation for beta. of uh for beta is the the system uh the if this system so we have uj equals j on the uh for each j on the boundary and the sum of u j j is n on omega. It's not very difficult, so you can find this with a standard With a standard method. So if we take E little E of T equal the E is the energy here is the sum of the energy. So if we make the derivative so you this is so if this is in And so this is in so for T1 for test function functions T1, Tn in H10, we take uj is defined as here, is an NKJ, and we make the derivative, we obtain exactly the system, the system. So At the beginning, I say n-component against Bologna problem for the problem for the first problem and for this one, for the problem. So the limit problem, for limit problem, I will call it the end component. I will call it the n-component harmonic maps equation. So the condition u star equals one and the Stolberg case makes its sense makes its zero circular while the condition u this condition u1 square plus u n square equal n and the system and the last system. The last system do not force us to be circular, since it does not necessarily means that's condition, we don't, it's not necessary u1, the modules of u1 equal 1, u n equal 1. We also note that it for the for For the system five, the U1U1 can share the same singularities, if any. We will show that there is no singularities. So our the result which will prove and this is so we can have the conversions of minimizer of the uh minimizer of the for for one u u one epsilon u n epsilon two uh some u one star u n star and c1 alpha of omega bar and of course and locally and sika sik the method is We use the argument of Bethel Presisi and R, and so we can have this result. So now for dj equals zero, so we have we know that H1G J omega and S one is the same. And S1 is not empty. And we can define this amphibian. So here alpha J1GN is the anthemum when UJ is in H1JG value with value in S1. And so this alpha is achieved by N. By n harmonic maps. So this is well known, so it is not difficult to show that we have this. And a natural question is, because in general we have alpha is greater than beta, so alpha is. Greater than beta. So alpha is alpha is anthropomorphum when uj is in h1 jg with value in s1, but for beta it comes from the set key. So we an interested question is whether alpha is equal to beta. Alpha is equal to beta or not. So we can show that we have a necessary condition to this. We have for j equal zero for all j, we have alpha equal beta, and it is a shift by no, if alpha equal beta, then we have a gradient u j equals gradient u k for every j. equal gradient u k for every j and k. I check the proof, just an idea to the. So if you assume that u1, u n is an h1 jg with value ns1. So we if we have alpha equal beta, so beta will be E of E1 EN since u j Since uj is is one, so we can write uj as exponential i e phi g. And if we put this on the equation, we obtain the scalar equation i lapti phi j phi j one one over n minus one gradient phi j square plus phi gx squared plus the the other the others and uh uh so since uh we know that uh phi j is harmonic function uh and uh and and so that we and this we so we have it and this is zero also this quantity will be zero and uh and this give that And this gives that gradient V1 equal to gradient Vg for every for every j and this and consequently we have granted to j equal to grain due k for every j and key. I want to say if for this problem it is possible to have It is possible to have to have because the question is: is alpha is greater, is equal or not. If it is equal, then we have a gradient to j equals gradient to k for every j and key. And k we can also for example. for example if if we take we can have strict this this the this inequality can be strictly for for example if we take take n equal one and n equal two and g1 a constant g2 is not a constant so we we we obtain we have the strict inequality and also Quality and also it is strict if we take if we take and the case when J1 if we can and the case when G1 is not is not a constant, multiply by it is not proportional to G2. not with the if they are not proportional so we can alpha can be greater than two i think that the time is over thank you also
