Okay, so welcome to the final talk of our meeting. Our speaker today, Yohei Sakurai, had some travel difficulties, so he has to speak to us online from Japan, from Satama University. And his title is on the slide. Okay, thank you very much. And I'm so sorry for the online talk. There was a fright trouble, and but I And but I'm so happy to talk in the online. Okay, so today I talk about the recent development of the way to reach capture. And my talk is based on the joint work with Professor Kazuhiu Kuai in Fokker University. Okay, so I begin with overview. So in my talk, I focus So in my talk, I focus on the weighted Riemannian manifold, which is a Riemannian manifold equipped with weighted volume measure. Here, Riemannian volume measure, and we consider a conformity changed volume measure. Yeah, and since we change the volume measure and it is very known that reach cover controls the behavioral measure, we also change. Behavior measure, we also change the reach cavern and the weighted rich capture is defined by this folder. Yeah, here. And I also focus on this parameter and chapter n, which is called effective dimension. And here, yeah, today I focus on the effective dimension. Okay, and Okay, and in my talk, I present several results, comparison, geometric results under this curvature condition. Here, this curvature condition is recently introduced by Liu Binguqi and Ota. Here, and it's in this interval, and there is a parameter, epsilon, epsilon. Ethereum, which satisfies this relation, and she is defined by this constant. Yeah, okay. And maybe this coverage function looks strange, but this interprets some previous studies coverage of bonds. One of them is a curvature dimension condition here. Here, this is this covert condition is discoverable. So, in this condition, the effective dimension is in this interval, and we consider lower bound for the constant, k. And this is studied in more general framework. Actually, this is equivalent to the Equivalent to the so-called CDKN condition introduced by Struma Lot-Pirani, and the CDKN is studied in more general Nosmus framework. Maybe this is well known. And the setting includes this damage condition. Condition and this also includes this cover bond introduced by Wiley and the Erskine. In this curvature bond, this effective dimension is equal to one. And in the raw bond, a function appears, not necessarily constant. And after, as I said below, As I said below, this coverage condition is related to the rich cover band on the projectory equivalent affine connection. And this blooming geontas cover band includes also includes this value or scheme bond. Okay. And in this setting, And in this setting, so actually Luming Jota has derived some comparison inequality in this setting and on manifold without boundary. And I and Professor Kuwait developed their works and also we studied comparison geometry. Geometry of manifolds with boundary under this curvature bonds, and as I said, the row-origin bound is sometimes characterized by convexity of the entropy on the Wasser-Stein space via optimal transport theory. So, and actually we characterize this Looming G-O-T curvature bond. With the Otas covert bond via optimal transport theory. So today I'd like to present these results. Okay, so this is overview. Okay, so first I present some background on the coverage abound in the previous works. Okay, so first Okay, so first we begin with a covert dimension condition. Okay, so curvature dimension is in this form. And as I said, this is studied in a more general framework, weighted remunerative manifold, Finstra manifold, or CDK space or R C D K space. Yeah, and it is very It is well known that weighted manifold satisfying this cover jet damaged condition. Yes? Okay. Behave like an unweighted manifold whose rich curvature is bounded from below by K and whose dimension is bounded from above by N. So, and in the traditional case, in traditional means that the effective damage is in this interval, as well as that n press a role of the upper bound of the damage. Actually, for instance, if the well-known Bishop Grom of type volume conversion can be generalized. Can be generalized in this form. This means that the volume growth of the under this setting, the volume growth is bounded from above by that of the capture and dimensional Euclidean space. But recently, maybe firstly, Ottawa and Takatsu pointed that in the complementary case. In the complementary case, the FF dimension is also meaningful in view of the information theory or PD theory. And actually, Oda has introduced a covert dimension condition for negative n and characterized this condition by a convexity of. Condition by convexity of entropies on the Wasserstein spaces. And also, Correscan Mirma studies the Poincar√© inequality for non-positive N. And Kratak or Mirma studies aspirantic inequality in this range. And also Wiley, this widely result is important in my talk, and they prove a Giga grow mortal. They prove a Chiga-Gromotile splitting theorem for when the effective damage joint is equal to one. Okay, so and next I present while it's splitting theorem. But before I state, I remark the homotonicity of the weighted rich curvature with respect to the effect of the With respect to the effective damage on. So this is an axis on the effective damage, and this is that for the weighted reach capture. And we can draw this picture. Yeah, and this part is a cross-curve part, and this part is recent. Uh, recent comparative case. From this picture, we can see that, for instance, if we consider this kind of couch band, then from this mountainistity, the comprehensive, in the complementary case, this kind of curvature bond is weaker than the crest curve case. Is weaker than the Kreskar case. Okay. And the uberlimentary case includes the cross-curled case. And especially, in particular, in my talk, this case, n is equal to one, is the important. And in this case, this is a very weak condition. And very weak condition. Okay. Okay, so now I record the result spreading theorem by Whitey. And under a non-negativity of the one-way to reach cover, he proved that if M continues a line, Jordish line. A line Jolish line, then MSR metric to work the product and precess more precisely metric and density can be written in this form. And also, Wiley has proved that if n is strict sheet is smaller than one, then the direct product free holds. Always, he proved that in this case, the density function f is constant along each line, gamma z. And if it holds, this part vanishes, and this part is equal to one. And so, actually, this is a direct product. Yeah. Yeah, this is a wireless splitting theorem. And he also showed that in the case of n is equal to one, the direct product splitting doesn't hold in general. So actually he presents this example. This example in this week. In this example, the manifold satisfies the non-negativity of one-way to reach curvature and it configs a line, but it is not direct product. So in this sense, n is equal to one is a sort of critical value in this splitting phenomenon. Phenomenal. Okay, this is a background on the curvature dimension condition. Okay, and next I record a background on the wire skin skills bond. So this is a wiry Erskine's cover bond. And And I recall that the effective damager is equal to one and the raw bond is a function defined by this function. And yeah, so why is why proof why is splitting theorem is actually holding? Holds in this capture bound. Actually, if kappa is equal to zero, then this part is equal to zero. So this is Wary's setting. But he in the work of Wiry and Yershkin, they introduced this covert bond and And they also derive other well-known comparison geometric results, such as the Bond-Meyer-style theorem or chain-maximal diameter theorem for positive kappa and also a Bishop-Gromo-type volume comparison in this setting. I will say. I will state the precise statement below. But before then, I will explain the meaning of interpretation of this cover bond. So it looks strange, but this cover bond can be interpreted as rural richie. Ricci constant bond with respect to this weighted affine connection. Okay, here the NABRA is a Levitivita connection and alpha is a one form. And this is a total-free affine and this satisfies a this is a projection equivalent to the left gvito connection which means that the geologic has the same image and uh Why Urshkin's covert bond can be interpreted by as this notion. And first observation is the power tensor for this weighted affine connection. So we can consider the Rigid tensor with respect to this affine connection. respect to this affine connection and with that if we choose alpha as the d f over n minus one this is a differential f then the rigid tensor coincides with the one weighted rigid curvature this is a weighted rig capture and by that direct computation we can see that this gawty And the second observation is the geodesic. Now we consider a unit speed Jordan shake gamma and v is the initial direction. And we now change the parameterization by using this function sfv and it's And it's inverse function, and we consider a curve, gamma v hat. Then, in a similar manner, in the same manner, if we choose alpha as this quantity, then this curve gamma v hat is geodesic with respect to this affine connection. So combining this observation, this is the wire scheme cover bound along gamma V, geodesic basis G is equivalent to this condition. The rigid answer for the on the weighted affine connection is bounded feron below by connection. It's bounded from below by constant n minus this constant along the gamma v. So we can see that the Y Yershkin's curvature bond can be interpreted as a rich constant bond with respect to this weighted affine connection. Now, okay. Now, okay, so now we'll try to treat this capital condition in a unified way. So and as a first step, Kuwai and Shangun Li introduce this coverage bound. Here, they generalize this part. This part one has more general general n and they generalize the wire schemes result to more general setting and after that lubing geota introduced this bound and And they studied in a more general framework. Actually, if in the case of the classical setting, if we choose epsilon as one, then this recovers the cover dimension condition. And if n is equal to one and if so is equal to zero. And if you equal to zero, then this concept with variations can bound. And also, in this range, if we choose if shown as this quantity, then this is actually the quiet least cover bond. So this includes some previous covert notions. Okay, this is a background. And okay, so now I present some comparison geometric results under this COVID-19. Okay, so the comparison geometry, the key tool is the Laplace in comparison for the distance function from distance function. So this is proved by Lubing Gujoda in this setting. And this is a key tool for our works. So rho x is a distance function from a single point x, and SKAPA is a solution to the Acrobat equation. And they proved And they proved that they proved this Laplace and comparison. This is a key tool. And in our work, we studied rigidity phenomenon. So it is done by analyting the equality case in this La Passion comparison. And this is a This is his statement. We assume that the equality holds in the LaPassian comparison, then this rigidity phenomena occurs. So and the case one and three is actually case one is actually which is the same as the unweighted case and. And the K3 is derived by Wiley and Yorshkin. So this is a new insight. And for instance, in this case, if the equality holds, then epsilon must be equal to zero. And a negative function is constant along each jurisdiction. And Java. And Jagovi field can be written in this form. Here is a prior vector field. And okay, so this is a key observation. So by using this, by using, based on this result, we derive some really d results. Derive some rigid results. And this is the first one, Bond Meier Steve theorem. So we would like to consider a diameter, but we need to change the notion. So we consider a reparative meterized distance defined by this quantity, by this formula. formula and this actually this is not a distance but this is a like function okay and uh under this under our coverage bond if kappa is positive then and the super bound of this reparametric distance is bounded from above by that of the sphere this is a generalization of the classical bond my separate Upon the Maya separate theorem. And I remarked that this reparameterized distance is bound from below by the distance with respect to this conformal rechanged metric. So I can say that we also say that the diameter with respect to Gf is also. Respect to Gf is also bounded from above by that of the sphere. And this is a rigidity, namely the extension of the generalization of the change maximal diameter theorem. So first we have this diameter bound, and if the equity holds, then defaults then uh then this uh rigid penal cards uh and one y is is essentially same as theorem and three is uh obtained by while the urshkin they prove that if uh n is equal to one and then epsilon is equal to zero and uh if it's To zero, and if it's radial, and M is a whole sphere, and the metric is a loved product on the sphere. And if n is not equal to one or n, then we see that epsilon is equal to zero and the density function is constant, and the space is asymmetric to the sphere. Space is asymmetric to a sphere with constant curvature couple times this volume. And this is a variant of the maximum diameter. In addition to this coverage bound, we assume bound on the density function. Density function. And in that case, we can obtain a diameter one for g and if the equality holds then we have the rigidity for the space and we also have a rigidity for the density function. So we can say that this is also a comparison condition in this in this theorem. In this cell. And we also have a volume comparison in this setting. And instead of the Jordan score, we consider a sub-review set for the repair measuring distance. And we also change the volume measure. And by using this. And by using this notion, we first we have the absolute volume conversion, bishop type volume conversion. And we also read the volume conversion. And we also have a rigidity statement in the setting. So So yeah, if this volume bond, if we have this bond, then we have this type of reach phenomena occur. And this is a result for the manifolds without boundary. boundary and uh and we also have we also studied uh uh comparison geometry of mine force width boundary and in in the comparison geometry of mine force width boundary we uh in addition to the raw richie bound on the m we also assume uh mean convexity of the boundary so we consider a weighted mean curvature and Covature and we introduce this raw mean cover or the boundary. And so in the unpleased case, the comparison geometry of manifold with boundary is established by Hans Carlisha or Kasuwe and in unweighted case. And I have And I have generalized their results for the previous culture bounds and by introducing appropriate mean convexity. And in our setting, in the setting of Luming Jotao, we also consider appropriate mean complexity. And in the with the boundary with boundary case, we also have a Laplace comparison. But instead of the distance function from a single point, we consider a distance function from the boundary. And along the geologic emanating from the boundary, we have this Laplace comparison. Here, S-kappa lambda is Here, S kappa lambda is a solution to this Jacob equation. And under our curvature bound, we have this La Pracian comparison. And in the with boundary case, we also have a rigidity statement. If the equality holds in the La Bausian comparison, Comparison. Okay, this is the main part. For instance, if n is not equal to 1 or n, then the density function and Jacobi field satisfy this rigidity property. Okay. I remark that in the in the Without boundary case, and in this case, if some must be zero, and this part doesn't appear. But in the with boundary case, and this part appears, so I think it is interesting, which means that if the reality occurs if not in not in the not necessary the epsilon is equal to zero and uh and based on this la passion comparison we obtain our some rigidity statement this is a sprinting zero which is another of the why it is uh sprinting zero so uh uh in the with boundary case In the with boundary case, with boundary case, the rho of one is not necessarily zero. So we consider a non-positive constant kappa and lambda is defined by this quantity. And instead of the existence of the straight line, we assume existence of the ray emanating from the boundary and From the boundary, and the distance function from the boundary is minimized along the geodesic. And if there exists such an array, then M is diffeomorphic to a product of half interval and the boundary. And along each ray, you might inform. Uh, ray emitting from the boundary, uh, the density function satisfy this rigid property and metric can be written in this form. And uh, and yeah, and this is uh obtained in my previous work this is a sprint tinter, and uh, we also have an analog of the bonemite. An analog of the bonnet mixtap results. But without boundary case, the model space is a sphere, but in this case, the model space is a close geological space form. So, and if there is such kind of model space, we see that kappa constant. Space, we see that kappa, the constant kappa and lambda satisfies a Borel condition. Actually, this can be concretely written in this form. Yeah, and this is a model space here. And the board is written by Pn kappa lambda. And instead of the diameter, we compare the We compare the inscribed radius. Inscribed radius is a supreme, the distal function from the boundary. And we assume that Kappa and the satisfied position, which means that there is a small space. And if we assume our couch abound, then the inscribed values of M with respect to the conformal change metric is bounded from above. is bounded from above by sigma lambda. Sica parallel is the inscribed radius of the model space. And if the equity holds, then image different walk fixed to a closed wall center at x0, this point, and the density a and if n is not equal is not equal to 1 over n, then f is constant. n then f is constant and it equals zero and metric can be written in this form and if n is equal to one it is f is radio and and the metric is a wapped product over a cross wall so and uh this is a variant of Variant of my variant of the statement. In addition to our covert bound, we assume a density bound. And in that case, we can obtain the inscribed this bound with respect to G and we have a corresponding estimate and reg results. Okay, and we also have a volume comparison. In the unweighted case, it is done by Heinz Causia, and they estimate the volume of the neighborhood of the boundary. And in our setting, following the reformator resistance, we introduce. we introduce this function by using the density function and we consider it several research and for this for this neighborhood of the boundary we have under our curvature bond we have this Heinz garage type estimate This is an absolute button, but we also have a reactive version. And we also have rigidity results on this volume comparison. Actually, for instance, in this case, we have the rigidity of the density function and the metric. Okay. Okay. So finally, we finished the comparison geometry part. And finally, I introduce characterization via optimal transport theory. And to do so, we need to introduce appropriate coefficient for the convexity. And to do so, we first introduce this function. This is a generalization of the t times dxy. And in the case of t equal to t is equal to one, This is equal to one, this function is this function coincides with the reparameterized distance and for and records that for this function, the Bond name step theorem holds. And by using this function, we introduce a twisted coefficient, which is suitable for our setting. Setting and by using this coefficient, we introduce this Lott Virani type convexity of entropy on the Wattsian space. And this is a L2 Watts space. And with that, a smooth metric measure space satisfy React's twisted cover to damaging condition if for any. If for any to provide the measure, it certify this convexity. Actually, this is a generalization of the Loft Virani's type C D C D condition and yeah and we also have a Have a stream type convexity. This is a rainy entropy, and by using for the rainy entropy and by using our twisted coefficient, we have we introduce a relaxed twisted cut to dimension condition. What is the epsilon here? So there's a perfect epsilon in the in the red line. In the red line, but I don't think here? Yeah. Yeah, epsilon is in our cover bound, which is a parameter. So if you're included in our cover bound. So in this convexity, we also need to include epsilon in this convexity. But I don't see it. But I don't see it in the definition somehow. Ah, ah, ah, in this. Ah, okay. So, is included in this DC. This is a displacement convex class, and this displacement. This displacement complex plus is dependent on the constant C, and in the definition of C, the epsilon is included. So epsilon is and also this epsilon is also included in this part. So yeah, this is depend on the Ipser. We need to record the definition of C below. Okay. And yeah. And this is our main results, one of our main results. One of our main results. So the cover condition by Luming Guchota is equivalent to our twisted coverage bound. The key point is that is to control the to the key point is to control the Jacobian with the optimal. Jacobian with the optimum transport map and it satisfies the recouching equality. And Luming Mucha introduce recouching quality for the distance function and applying the recouching quality in this setting. We can, this is a brief explanation. Okay. Okay. Okay, so this is a summary of the talk, and I stop here. Thank you very much.
