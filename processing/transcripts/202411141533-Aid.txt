Thanks, Christophe. Thanks the organizer for inviting me to this workshop. Wonderfully organized. In April 2023, I was exactly at the same place here. Okay, and nothing has changed. So just the weather, it's just freezing. Okay, but it could have been worse, I was told. Okay, so I'm going to talk about continuous time persuasion by filtering, and so it's a joint work with my I don't work with my Italian colleagues, and I'm going just to check if it works. If I press the button here, yes. So here they are, and I saw this Professor Georgia Caro Padova, Ophelia Bonesini, now she's in LSE. When the picture was taken in August 2022, she was doing her PhD under the supervision of Georgia. And this is Luciano, and you see by her face that. And you see by our face that who was having fun and who was working on the paper. Okay, and here is the first trial that we did on this topic. Okay, so let's start. So I'm going to provide, this is the agenda, I'm going to provide some motivations, and then I'm going to present oh the paper is already uh available in archive and and the QR code which is there. Normally it works. If you take a picture of that, normally you story. Of that, normally you would see like modern guy. Okay, okay, so and in the paper, there's a general case, okay? But I think it's for a short talk, it's better also to present just an application, and I'm sure that you're going to generalize the approach and understand with this example how the things work. And then I will conclude with a few perspectives. Okay, you're a cool. Okay, so uh some motivations. So uh I I've been working on the electricity demand response uh for a certain time now uh because you know that we need to reduce the carbon emission from power systems. Okay, a lot of emissions from human activity is linked to the production of electricity. I think it is still one third of global emissions are produced by power systems worldwide and with coal fire plants and gas fire plants mostly coal. Fire plants and gas fire plants, mostly coal. Okay, and so you can do many things to reduce those emissions. The first thing is to close down coal-fire plants and to replace them by gas. And there is another and produce renewable energies, of course, you introduce renewables. But when you introduce renewable energy, the problem is that they are intermittent. And so you need a way to compensate this intermittency by having something like storage. So you can add batteries everywhere if you like. It's a very nice thing. But there is another way. Things, but there is another way which was a great revival, which is acting on the demand. So, acting on the consumption side, and this is named demand side management, and you can try to adapt consumption to production, which is a very tricky way. You want to grab your nose by taking your power, but it's got messy. And in fact, there is a large economic literature on that. Even since the 70s and the 60s, and there is a lot of mathematical. And there is a lot of mathematical literature on that. And I'm just citing people who are in this room because we did some work with Dilan and Nizar on demand response and incentives theory on that. So you provide incentives to people, so you give them some money, and so they reduce their consumption. Okay, and with this paper, we did it with one representative agent, and Emar regenerized that with the mean field expansion, so it works. Extension, so it works. And we even developed a patent on that. You can believe that. And it is based only on incentive theory. That's how it works. You pay people and they reduce consumption. And there's a lot of studies which show that it works. There's really a reduction depending on the price and the system that you do. But there is another mechanism which exists also. It is purely information. You just send information to consumers and it triggers a response. And it triggers a response. And there is no incentive mechanism. You don't pay people, you just send them an information. And here are some examples. So I've taken a few examples around the world, but there are a lot. So this one is an example in Massachusetts, I think it's XSR, AMA, Massachusetts. And their program is named Shave the Peak. Shave the Peak. And so there is a website and Green Energy Consumers Alliance. And so it's a screen capture, but It's a screen capture, and here and they publish things like that. So they publish the forecast of electricity from one day to another. This one is very current. Okay, and so this one is the forecast is in blue. It is here. And the actual, the realized consumption, it is this one. And so you see it shaped the peak. And the only thing that they did is that they launched an alert the day before. And this one is a message we said. And this this one is a massage reset or you may say a very uh does it have any kind of a differential cost for this? There is no differential cost. Okay, so this is the thing. There is no so no incentive theory No no incentives, no money. And this one is South Africa power alert program. So they have a lot of problems there. And look at that. So they have an alert program with four levels. Program with four levels, and green it says that, okay, green, it is limited, so we may have some problems. Orange, there are potential problems. Red, there are some problems, and black, we are in trouble tomorrow. There is not going to be light, okay? And each time they say please, please, please, so they are very polite, and there is absolutely no threat, no incentives. Okay, this is the thing. This is the thing. There is no transfer of money from the guy who's sending the information and the people who receive. But they are blackouts. No, a lot. 2,000 hours in 2022. Okay, so yes, there are a lot of problems, but whatever. Okay. And in in France also, we have this and this France EchoWhat program, it is the same. And there is this type and this one is my former boss in UDF. Okay. And and In dev. Okay, and here it is. So there is a website, and people are enrolled and they receive a message in their telephone. Okay, in their app, number. Just a message. And here, they publish some results in an app and they say, okay, look at that. Here is the result: 800 megawatts of consumption reduction at the morning peak, despite a very short warm delay sent during the weekend. Okay, and then people. Okay. Okay, so. Okay, okay, so uh I was doing incentives and if you do incentives, okay, you say that i there is no logic on that, uh but in fact it's possible to find a mathematical framework for these types of events. The mathematical framework that it's signaling games. Signaling games, it's things that exist for a long time, even before Crawford and Sobel. But there is a seminar paper of Crawford and Sobel in the Game Africa in 1982, which develops the setting of signaling games where people, where there is a sender and the center. Where there is a sender, and the sender sends a signal, and the receiver takes an action, and the action has an effect both on the receiver and the sender, but of course, there is asymmetry of information between the two, and the receiver does not observe the true state of nature. And there is, in fact, a more specific framework which has an impact in economics and it is the Beijes persuasion framework of communication. Persuasion framework of communication in American economic review in 2011. This one has a huge impact. Already, I think it was 2000 situations and stuff like that. And this framework and all the things were introduced to me by Professor Angkor Kulcarni in Mumbai in a French-Indian research fund project that we developed together, which was named Signaling for Smart Trans. Okay? And Angkor is this guy. And yes, he was a promise of a Yes, it was a promise of the fun project. Angko is a professor at the system and control department of IIT Mumbai. This is his wife, Anupa Makolli, who also develops things through PowerSystem, and this is the head of the department. And it was Colour Feast in March 2023, and we developed things like that. And he learned everything I know about Persuasion. He told me about it. So if something is wrong, it's because of this. So by using Persusion, there's So Bayesian percolation, there is a huge rato, and I recommend if you want to introduce in that, there is in 2019 a survey on Bayesian persuasion by one of the authors who says what it works. And the scheme of Bayesian persuasion is the following. The time runs very fast. Okay, now, yeah, yes. So, how does it work? First, the thing which is very specific to Bayesian person is. Is very specific to Bayesian person in this one. Is that the sender chooses a signal, and the signal, what they call the signal, is the conditional probability to emit, to send a certain message M when the true nature, the true state of nature is omega. So the signal in Bayesian persuasion is this conditional probability. Okay, the receiver observes which signal is chosen, which means that the receiver observed this conditional probability. He knows this conditional probability. He knows this conditional probability. Then nature chooses omega according to a prior. Nature chooses M according to this conditional probability. The three, the sender does not choose M. It is nature who chooses the message. And then the receiver observes the realized M and receiver takes action A. And of course, action has an impact on both utility. And so the important feature in this thing is that the sender can commit to the conditional. Sender can commit to the conditional probability. Okay, because he has to declare it in advance, and then when the message occurs, he cannot change it. So it needs to be to be sure. So there is, okay, so you have to imagine, and this one is going to be right, that this conditional priority is just like a device which produces messages according to the state of nature. And so the the the the the sender, what it does is that it builds this device and then it lets the device emit boop boop messages. Emit boop boop messages according to the state of nature. Okay? And there is a question in which situations such things happen. And then there is one key example which is drug test approval. Drug test approval fits exactly this feature because in drug test approval you have to write down the experiment that you are going to do before you do it and then you give it to the FDA, Food Drug Administration, and then you realize the experiment. And then the food. And then the Food and Drug Administration is going to take a decision to let the product grow or not on the market. And so, if you're wise enough or smart enough, you made a lot of studies, you design specifically the experiment so that the decision of the food drug administration is in favor of your model. Where is omega? What, what? Where is omega? No ventures here. In this, you have to know Mr. Fasilza. Omega can be the sample of people to who from who you do the experiment. From who you do the experiment, for instance. Okay, but then you have to define improbability and stuff. And the main research question in this thing I modified a little because the main research question recognized in this situation is that can the sender fool the receiver? It's not that it's not for the best interest of the receiver, it's just can he can the sender allow in the receiver's action of the sender's interest? This is only the reason. Yes? Yes, yes. There are two. In the literature, there are. Most the main trend is everybody has the same prior, but you can find papers where they don't have. Okay, when they don't have, it's more complicated. Okay, so the problem is that all the problems. One problem is that, first, it is a static scheme. The scheme is static. So when the paper was published in twenty eleven, the paper. But there are many situations where information from using is dynamic. Okay? So example, influencing voters. For example, influencing voters. Influencing voters, you're going to send messages with a certain rate, you know, to persuade people to vote for you. Or influencers or investors by appropriate signal. We had a talk on that. Monday morning, some people are designing a signal saying you should buy, you should buy, you should buy. It's very trendy. So it's a rate of information. Okay, but it's already done. There is already a huge literature on the extension to dynamic, to dynamic rate of provision of information. To dynamic rate of provision of information, and there is discrete time and there is constant time. Okay, there is already a continuous time version of persuasion. And if you have time to lose the plane, I recommend, there are a lot of them, but I recommend E3, the ELI MRENOU in twenty seventeen, because this one was the first, and the SQD and Serander Enthoretical Economy, because this one is the one where they use viscosity solution for HGB equation for the standard. Okay? Equation for the sender. And VAO is an example exactly of stopping time, where in fact it is exactly a drug approval, and the sender is controlling the volatility of the conditional probability that it is a good thing, and it controls this volatility, and so that the food drug authority becomes. Okay, okay, okay. And the thing is that on all those papers, it's uncontrolled one-dimensional state taking two values and receiver taking a stopping decision. And why is that? It's the first interesting. Is the first interested in theoretical stuff. Okay, there are some applications, we can look at that, there are some applications and stuff, but mostly they are interested in can you fool forever the receiver? Or will at some time the receiver will understand the true state of nature? This is the thing that they are interested in. But then it is very limited and I I don't think we can hold fifty years again with just this canonical model. Canonical model. So, in the work that we did with Ophelia, Georgia, and Uceano, we extended this framework to a specific case, which is the Kalman-Ducy filter. So, on the oldest literature, they never say that it is filtering theory that they are going to do when they do dynamics. There is only one paper that says that it's filtering theory. It is the SQD and it's in order. All the others, they just write the equations. So, in fact, what we do, we So, in fact, what we do, we frame dynamic persuasion in constitution in a LQG, linear follower, stochastic control game with partial information. And with ergodic criterion, we're going to see why. Okay, so this one we know that for sure we can solve the receiver's problem. So, for this one, we know we can solve the receiver's problem. And the receiver's action will affect the dynamics of the unobserved state. The center design a device that's going to produce an information process capital M allowing the Information process capital M, allowing the receiver to estimate capital X, conditional on the observation of M. And the sender optimized the parameters of the device. And I'm going to present just an application so you're going to see exactly how it works. Hopefully, I have five minutes. Okay. I can do it. Okay, so smart meters, first meters. So first, you have to understand the countries, Europe, but Canadian too. But Keller Gen2, you cannot escape that. I've asked ChatGPT, and you're also spending billions on developing smart meters. And there are multiple objectives. They are reducing non-technical losses, which means people who are stealing energy from the green. The second one is reducing billing costs, sending people just to measure what is the amount of energy that you consume. And the last reason is enhancing responsiveness as consumers by information production. So, this one is important because it's So, this one is important because it says and many things: thanks to these devices, we are going to be able to move consumption around so that we're going to be able to feed consumption to renewable energy production. Okay, so this is an important feature. But there are people who say the two first, yes, the third one, very unlikely that it is worth the cost. Okay, because in fact, there is, depends on the way you design your smart. It depends on the way you design your smart meter, but the more information you want to process and to give to consumers, the more costly it's going to be. Look at that. I have a picture here. This is the possible smart metering information. So here it is in French, but it is year, month, and day. Okay, you can provide, for instance, an information. In France, you have before having smart meters, we have the true consumption of a household once a year. Okay, once a year. We get this information. Once a year, we gather this information. Because they need to send someone. Before that, okay, now with this, you could have an information on your consumption every month. Every month. But you could also have your consumption every day at a time step who's going to be one hour or even ten minutes. Okay? And this one, I got this thanks to a plug-in. So there is this smart meter, inky, but on the top of this smart meter, you put something else. So it doubles the cost. You put something else, so it doubles the cost. Okay, it doubled the cost. Okay, so here is the model. Somebody still says you have a regulated electricity producer acting as a monopolist. So in fact, okay, you have a producer who is going to produce electricity and at the same time, so people are going to consume electricity. And the guy is thinking about sending information to the consumer. Sending information to the consumers so that the consumers are going to adjust their consumption in response to fluctuating electricity prices. Consumers have the capacity to process any level of information. So if I am sent the information of my consumption with a time step of 10 minutes, I write that there, yeah, I have to move. Okay, consumers and two possible cases in the paper, and I'm going to present only the representative consumer, but the mean field case is really But the mean field case is really easily done in the following. Okay, so the consumption rate is follows a mean reverting process, which is controlled. And V in T with red, it is the decision of the agent. And you have to figure out that the agent, the consumer, no, you can. Boring. No, okay, okay, okay. So V is the control of the consumer, and we have to figure out that. Of the consumer, and we have to figure out that this one is a conscious time process, and the guy is acting on his consumption or log duce, okay? Because, okay, and but he does not know X in real time. Okay, L is the special level, okay, kappa is the mean invertible. A L is a utility, he wants to stay close to L, but he has cost in moving around. Okay, that's physical cost. And you see that it is a linear quadratic setting, and this, and we know we take Ben Sussan's book, you're going to see, I mean. Take Ben Sussan's book, you're going to see a window that this one, we open the book, path, there are the formulas, back. We can read this. It's very easy. No need to even write an AGP equation. And so, and the consumer does not observe, but here is my smart meter. This one is my smart meter. This one is information process. And when I increase B, B is in the hand of the sender, and the sender is going to design the B, and the B is just one parameter. And the B is just one parameter, and the bigger is going to be B, the faster the consumer is going to be able to estimate its true consumption. Okay? And so it's going to move around. So the objective of the receiver is to maximize expected utility minus the bill, the cost of the bill, knowing only the message, the process of the message. And we take a lercodic criterion, so this one, because we are only interested in the stationary state, which makes sense because the sender. Because the sender, it is Mr. Distribution System Operator, he puts the device in the house of everyone, then he moves out, and 40 years later, they change the device. So they are only tested in the station state. And the price is linear, of course. And so the producer's objective, the producer objective, he wants to minimize the joint cost of the device, H or B. H of B. So this one is the cost of the device. And also, what is this? It is the production cost function, who's going to be linear quadratic, and the bill. And the thing is, hey, it's a model where the producer takes the money from the consumer. The money enters into his pocket. Okay. So, solution. I'm good. Okay, so this one is tractable. Everything has been. It's tractable. Everything has been done, so it is tractable. Okay, so we have the optimal control, it is linear aloe, it is linear, yes, you are. It is linear in. The consumer can only decide what it's going to do with respect to x hat, and x hat is the estimator of the true state, knowing the message. So he knows that. And the dynamics of the true state and the posterior estimation are given here. Given here. So the estimator, it is a mean reverting process and it mean revenge to a long-term value, which depends on L, but also on the price of electricity and also on the adjusted cost and the U0. U0 is the value that the consumer is giving to being close to L. The larger it is, he's going to do a lot of effort. Okay, and the I is the. And in this, there is something that I don't say, I don't talk about that. There is something that I don't say, I don't talk about that, but here it is in red. The sender can only influence the volatility of the estimator. He cannot here in this application, he cannot influence the long-term average. He cannot influence. So the consumption of the guy is not going to be moved in expectation. The only thing that is going to be moved is the volatility or the reduction of that. Okay. Okay, and so you have the stationary distribution. And so you have the stationary distribution of the consumption, right? It's Gaussian, and only the variance of your Gaussian distribution is going to be controlled by the sender. Okay? That's all the nice formula. And in fact, if you look at this formula, you're going to see that if I don't provide information, b equals zero, I don't provide information, so, and there is one over two kappa, it is the largest volatility that's going to occur, and the more I'm going to And the more I'm going to provide information, the more I'm going to cut close to 1 over 2 beta. It's going to be the lowest possible value. And if there was no cost to build this design, what would do the guy? He would simply provide the P equals infinity. And the only thing that retains the sender from taking P infinity is that there is a cost. So, voila, bon, I did things. Okay, okay. Okay, and there is one thing which is interesting, is that the center's problem can be reduced to something like this. And G1, you can't remember what it is, but G1, it is this guy here, G1. So the marginal cost of production of X-ray C is 2G1, and the marginal profit is P. See? It is P. Okay. So in fact, if this quantity is zero, you you don't do anything. You don't do anything. You don't need to put smart meters everywhere. So, this one is something that you can find in Economics Papers saying that if there is information, enough information provided, or if, no, if electricity is priced at its marginal cost and it's perfectly priced, there is no need of all those devices. Okay, so this one is a confirmation. Okay, some people like that. Okay, and you can transform a little the equation, and I'm going to hear the dumb. I'm going to hear the domain. And okay, and in fact, instead of optimizing over P, you can optimize directly on the volatility. Okay, you can directly say, if I want to reduce the volatility, there is a cost, and I take a function like this. And so this function is such that when you do no effort, when you do, okay, you are at the maximum level of volatility, you have zero cost. And when you want to go to the minimum, you have infinite cost, and you can take something like this. And that's good. And you find something which very. Something which is very important, you'll find something that an engineer would find. Okay, so this is an engineer would find, which means that this quantity, what is it? This quantity is the gain. It is this G1 minus P1. So basically, this one is the gain in cost, okay? And this one is the gain in volatility. So if this quantity is too small compared to the annuity of the device, you do nothing. But if this quantity But if this quantity is large enough, you do a smart pitur, and you can even say what is the optimal level of volatility that you can sustain. And this one is just a picture to see that I can make pictures. Okay, and here is just two trajectories to say something, because Rb is constant. Nevertheless, nevertheless, when you, these three trajectories, the blue is the true state and the red is the estimator. Here in the first one, you take P equals. Here in the first one, you take B equals zero. So, in fact, your estimator is purely the expectation. There is no information. But when you increase B, this trajectory has been generated using exactly the same trajectory of noise. So, why I do that? To show that when you change the B, not only you change the trajectory of the estimator, but you change also the trajectory of the true state. Okay? You change also the territory of the true state. And so I think I'm done. And this slide is just to say that there's a bunch of numbers saying that I can make a backover envelope estimation of the information provision for smart routers. And when you take small data like this, you find that for this story of information provision, there is one or two order of magnitudes that it does not fit. The gain in volatility compared to the cost and to the cost of a smart meter. And the cost of a smart meter is not a good reason to install smart meters. Okay, so perspective. Perspective: first, we want to allow B to be random, nevertheless, to be random while maintaining the combatment property and computational tractability. In filtering, you can go dank in infinite dimension control. Okay, I know that people, some people like that a lot, but I prefer to have tractable models where I can provide solutions to people. And also, for To people, and also, of course, dealing with multiple senders, which is the important case if you want to know what is happening when you have two opposite senders who try to manipulate a car. Okay? And for this, I thank everyone. And I would like to say that what happens in Mumbai is unlikely to say in Mumbai. This one is Opcolo Feast in March 24. They got me. Thank you for your attention. We have time for a couple of questions. I think you answered that, but maybe I'll make you say it more slowly. So, if the objective is to synchronize the demand with the supply, then why is the sender not trying to hide the true state? Why shouldn't they just provide the uncle? This is a comment that in our model, the only First, in in our model, the only reason why is not providing it is the cost of the device. It is the cost of the device. He wants to synchronize. So, in fact, in this application, the only thing that the regulator would like to do, or the producer, would be to give full information. And this is one report. In this literature, normally, people want to fool the things. Here, it's a problem where you want to provide information, but it is costly. This is the only reason why it doesn't get synchronized. Okay. And then, if you allow so. And then if you allow, so related to that, so you said at the start that there was no differential price in marketing, but then there was something about the true price of electricity at Marginal Cross. Yes, what is it? This is a nice point. Here, when you do all the computations, what you're going to find is that your function is going to be something like this. So this one is the only thing that matters is the volatility. That was just from the top, not the request we saw. Okay, so the true divolity, and there is these terms which appear, and this term appears because in your objective function you have g minus p. Only the quadratic part matters, because the linear part, you can't control the linear part. So you are left only with the quadratic part. And so now what you observe is that imagine the worst case, it is that the price of electricity, marginal price, is much lower. Marginal price is much larger than G. So, in fact, you make money when people consume at wrong times. So, what you do is that you don't provide them money. You don't provide them information. And the only case where you are going to provide them information is when this term is going to be zero. Because this one, for h non-zero, it is positive. Well, thank you very much. So, if I understand correctly, if you So, if I understand correctly, if the company that produces the electricity does not have enough incentives to provide you with the smart meter, but what if the regulator is paying for it, or the European Union, or the government? So, if this cost is offset by somebody else? Ah! This is a question that we ask ourselves when we design the model. It is the fact that who is going to decide the smart metals. In my simple model, there is only one guy. Simple model, there is only one guy which is the producer. And in fact, the one who decides the development of smart meters are the distribution system operators. In some countries, in the UK, it's different, but whatever. And in this case, it's a little more complicated. Because in this case, the guy who's going to decide if he puts or not is not going to study. It's not one sender, one receiver. There's going to be one sender, but then you are going to have the interaction between. But then you are going to have the interaction between the producer and the consumer. It's doable, it's usable in this context. What I don't get is, you know, in many situations you have to provide enough energy. So if the demand exceeds what you can produce, then you'll be forced on the long run to increase your capacity to produce more energy. And that is extremely costly. So the center of the message I've announced. So the center of the message have an incentive to smooth the demand over the day, right? And so how does company then? Now, in these models, we are only, there is no increase of capacity, there is absolutely nothing. You are installed capacity, demand is installed, and everything is installed, and we are only looking at the benefit from sending information to consumers on the real demand. So this is the only thing. So this is just to see how in this framework you can design models where you're going to be able Where you're going to be able to say what is happening between a sender and a receiver. But the thing that you say is more complicated, but exactly, if the demand increases, then you have to put more capacity and stuff. But this one is not in the model. But you don't have to put more capacity if you smooth the consumption during the day. So you have an incentive as a producer to actually have people make in action something that you yes, yes, yes, yes. You could develop a model where you have also. You could develop a model where you have also this X is going to move, but we didn't. Thank you for the question. Second time, you understand better. Yeah, I mean, very nice talk. So coming back to the beginning, why you say this prescription? And then you said that going to the center is going to design a conditional propaganda kernel. So here the center is only designing the scalar property. So, in a original general framework where it is just a static framework, you say the standard is going to design a conditional probability. Yes. Here, this is only one parameter. Yes. So, what's the link? The link is. There are other things. The link is that this is the thing that we could do in finite time. Because you need to finish the paper at some time. Okay, so the link is the following is that the thing which is important is that when you are doing this persuasion stuff in discrete or conscious time, the receiver is going to estimate this conditional probability. He's going to estimate the conditional probability of the true value of the state knowing the message. And this one is exactly this pi. But then in filtering, if you want to have here in the dynamics of the In the dynamics of the message process, if you want to have something which is more general than this one, you have to take care. For instance, if you say, I just put B with T and I take B T to be a stochastic process, and then people are going to say, who is observing it, in which filtration, and how the sender is going to use, the receiver is going to use this P. So this one becomes more complicated. But we have ideas for the extension. Okay, then I think in the interest of time, so let's uh thank you again. Thank you.
