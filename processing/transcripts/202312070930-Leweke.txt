So, today I will present you results from a recent study that we carried out on the dynamics of the vortex system behind rotors and, in particular, behind asymmetric rotors with an application to wind turbine wakes and wind farms in mind. So, other people involved in the study were Elisa Abraham and Andreas Castellanos, who were postdocs in our institute, as well as Nestor. As well as Master Ramos Garcia and Lil Solensen from the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen. So, a little bit of motivation and context about this study. So, rotors are found in many applications, for example, helicopters, propellers, and wind turbines. And they are characterized by a system of helical vortices that form at the tip of the rotor. The tip of the rotor blades. So, a bit more images on helicopters here, so visualized by condensations. And so, this is a helicopter normal operation where the vortex system is being pushed down. But there are also other regimes, but whenever there's a video, I have to wait a little bit longer. Okay, and other regimes when the helicopter is. Other regimes when the helicopter is descending very fast, it catches up with the vortical wake and a large-scale vortex ring is formed, giving rise to the vortex ring state, which is a very dangerous condition for helicopter flight because the loss of lift. But that's not our topic today. Wait for it. The colours, another few examples. Another few examples here are found on aircraft and also underwater. And in these experiments here by Felly in a water channel, you can see that there are something that's happening. There's an instability and deformation of the vertical wake. And that's what we're going to look at also here. Now moving on to wind turbines. We have typically three days on a wind turbine. Also, two very good examples here in a wind tunnel. Here in a wind tunnel, and the tip vortex system forms again and is carried downstream and shows very complicated dynamics sometimes. Another example here from a numerical simulation in a rotating frame of reference using a special technique where the blades are replaced by lifting lens, and you also see that instability and deformation develops over time. Over time. The lower image here is for a case with higher inflow turbulence where everything happens a bit faster. So, wind energy is, of course, a major source of renewable energy, and installed capacity has increased quite a lot over the last decades. And so has the size of these wind turbines. So this here is a projection from around 2010, but today actually the size exists. Actually, this size exists. The largest wind turbine now is in China, in the south of China, and it has a diameter of 252 meters and 16 megawatt. So it's quite impressive machines that are built today. And wind turbines often appear in wind farms, and so large groups of wind turbines where wind turbines can be Wind turbines can operate sometimes in the wake of other wind turbines. And if you have ever heard a talk about wind turbine wakes, you have seen this picture here, which is always shown, where the wake is visualized by some special atmospheric conditions through condensation. And you can see that the wake is affecting the may affect the wind turbines downstream. And that's what happens. And that's what happens. So, there are two main effects: one is that the first wind turbine has taken out a lot of energy already out of the flow. And if the wind is perfectly aligned with the line between the wind turbines, this can lead to a loss of power of the second turbine up to 40%. It's quite enormous. And the second effect comes from the vortex break here. Wake here. So these correlate structures that can survive to the second wind turbine lead to vibrations and increased fatigue on the downstream turbines here. And that is a measurable effect over time. So, okay, so people have modeled this and calculated, estimated this damage equivalent load for Damage equivalent load for the second turbine here, and you get an increase for the second turbine due to interactions with the vortex wake. The other effect of the vortices is to sort of shield the outer part from the inner part and delay the mixing of the wake to put more energy again into the flow for the next turbine. And some calculations here have shown that as long as the vortices are coherent and exist, those not. Are coherent and exist, there's not much exchange of energy with the inner part. And as soon as they deform and destabilize, what we will see next, then there is an energy exchange that is accelerated. So one would ideally like to get rid of these vortices quickly in the context of a wind farm where wind turbines are one way or the other. And for other And for unfavorable wind conditions when they are aligned with the grid. Okay, so in order to look at the rank of these voters, we simplify our configurations a little bit. So we will be looking at helical vortices here, either a single one or multiple ones. And for reasons of conservation of decoration, we also have to have a central hub vortex here. Hub vortex here. These simple geometries are characterized by geometry parameters: the radius, the pitch of the helix, circulation of the vortex, and also a parameter characterizing the core size of this structure here. And of course, the number of helices n here. This leads to non-dimensional parameters here: the geometric parameters, core size parameters, and the Reynolds number based on the circulation. Number based on the circulation. And behind the wheel turbine, all these parameters may have some variation in the downstream coordinate z here, because the helix is created at the rotor and then evolves downstream. The connection velocity in the frame of reference of the rotor is simply given by the pitch and the frequency here and the product of the two. So phenically, the characteristic scales involved in this problem. Characteristic scales involved in this problem are turns out to be the length scale is h, the distance between the vortices here, and the advection velocity of the system in a situation where at infinity we have flow at rest. The inner flow here has a velocity of lambda over h and the vortices, the helix is transported approximately half that speed, corrected a little bit by the A little bit by the curvature-induced motion. And these two velocity scales here give you these scales of velocity and distance give you this characteristic time scale here based on h and gamma. So these helical vortex systems are generally unstable. There are different types of instabilities that can occur. One set of instabilities is related to the different Set of instabilities is related to the deformation of the whole vortex, and this has been studied in the past by Whitman. So, various deformations can deform the system. There are shortwave instabilities that happen inside the vortex core. Well, this is not from a helical vortex, but a vortex pair, but have also been seen in helical vortices here. And there can be other phenomena related to the swirling, the large-scale swirling flow in the center of the wake. Flow in the center of the wake that can lead to the stabilization of the central vortex. This picture here shows a cross-cut of the upper part of the helix here, where you can see the deformation of the helical pattern here, leading to a pairing of these loops, neighboring loops. We will be looking at this instability here. This instability here, the long-wave instability, related to deformations of the wake. So, this has been studied theoretically, already some time ago. And for a single helical vortex, one finds instability modes that are plotted here. They depend on the geometry, the cross size, and the wave number of the perturbation, which is the number of waves per rotation per loop of the helix. Per loop of the helix. And if you plot the growth rate as a function of this wave number, you get these bands here centered around odd multiples of one half. And if you look at the modes that are associated with this, they look like this for the first three loops here. And what you notice is that they lead to a local pairing of neighboring loops. Pairing of neighboring loops, meaning that the perturbations between neighboring loops are out of phase, so they go towards each other and lead to this local pairing here at the upper part here. For the higher wave numbers, you have pairing here, here, and on the back three times and more complicated. Each time, the pairing mechanism is sort of responsible for this deformation. The same happens. The same happens for two helies here. You have again the local pairing here for a wave number different from zero. But with two heliases, you can also have a global pairing, where you have basically two different helices that approach each other everywhere. And this kind of perturbation here will be the focus of what I will present later here. Present later here. So, a global pairing and the local pairing destabilize multiple helices. We can get a little bit more insight into this by looking at a very fundamental analysis here of the dynamics of point vortices. So, if you cut through the helix and just look at the cross-cut on the upper part of the helix, you end up with a raw, infinite, well, infinite row of point vortices. Of point vortices, and this system has been studied already a very long time ago, showing that deformations or perturbations to this geometry lead to pairing. And it depends on the phase difference of the perturbation between neighboring vortices. And when there are other phase, the growth rate is maximum and leads to this kind of situation here. So, point vortices, of course, would present infinitely long straight vortices in three dimensions. So, in three dimensions, this would look like this. And one can refine this or extend this initial simple study a bit more by considering also a wavelength along this third direction here. And that has been done also in the past by Robinson and Safman. Past by Robinson and Safman. And what this result is that you end up with perturbations that look like this. They have a phase difference between neighboring vortices, but also a wavelength along the vortex here. And the growth rate is influenced by the wave perturbation here. For infrared long wavelengths, we have the 2D problem, and when the wavelength gets short, And when the wavelength gets shorter, the growth rate decreases. You still have pairing at a phase difference of pi, but it's not complicated now. And you have only local pairing that resembles what we saw on the helix. So these results can be treated already very simply, contrary to the helical geometry, which has very complicated equations and And it's not really easy to get a prediction easily from this. We can use these results here to estimate the case for the helical geometry. So what you do from this is you cut your helix open, lay it flat, and then you end up with a picture like this, where the vortices look like a row of straight vortices. And from the parameters of the helix, you can. You can very easily find the parameters of this arrow system of vortices, do analysis for straight vortices, and get the growth rate, and then transform it back to a helical geometry. So it's fairly simple, and it gives surprisingly good results. That's the surprising part. So this is the original study from Woodlawn using the complete helical geometry. Using the complete helical geometry with complicated perturbations in 3D. And on top of this is the result from the simple straight vortex, straight radio vortex analysis that I just showed you. And for the three core size parameters here that were studied before, the prediction is very close. So this is really surprising. So what is missing in the model that I use here is the curvature. Use here is the curvature. So there's no curvature here, and it seems that this curvature has only a small effect on the pairing instability in the helical geometry. Okay, the same thing can be done for two helices here. Again, from the helical parameters, we get the infinite row parameters, do the stability analysis, and then compare it. Then compare it. And this is the result. You have two types of modes here where the perturbations on each blade, so to speak, are in phase or out of phase. And if you compare that to the full theoretical analysis, you see that that basically gives the same result. So this is in particular true. In particular, true when the pitch of the heliasis is small. So, if you have a small distance between the consecutive loops, so if you zoom in, it's more and more like a system of straight vortices that you have locally. And if the pitch gets larger, then this approach will not work that well. But in general, for perforations of wind turbines, the pitch is reasonably small. Reasonably small. Okay, so finally, for three helices, we can do the same thing. We again get different modes of instability for the baseline configuration here. So three is the case that we are going to look at a bit more now because that's the standard configuration for a wind turbine. And we again get perturbations that have zero wave number that are the same all around the azimuth. And lead to this global pairing, which is more complicated for three. And but you also have instability for non-zero wave numbers where the deformations are more complicated. So we will now focus a bit more on this global pairing here, where everything happens in the same way around the arguments of the helical geometry. So So, if you look at the rotor geometry again and think about how you can generate on purpose perturbations like this, you find very quickly that a rotor asymmetry, where one blade is slightly longer than the others, can lead to such a perturbation, as well as for the k larger than zero perturbation. Zero perturbations. You need to have a variation as you go around the helix, and this can be obtained by modulating the speed of the rotor during the rotation or by adding an oscillating flap. And so studies have shown that this works here, but it's quite complicated. The asymmetric rotor is a passive perturbation. And so the idea was to explore the possibility of using this to influence the development. To influence the development of the instability of the vortex system and maybe see if there is some benefit for the operation of a wind turbine in a wind turbine. So we formalized this idea by asking for a patent, well, by submitting a patent, and our employers were sufficiently convinced to pay for this and give us some money to explore this idea. Money to explore this idea. So, this is what I will show next some results from this exploration. So, there are many ways to make a rotor asymmetric. You can make a blade longer, you can pitch it differently, you can bend it in different directions. So, what would be interesting is to have some tool which would sort of scan these different modifications quickly to see which one would. Quickly to see which one would be most promising for them for the study. And for this, we have developed an even more, even simpler model than what I will show you before, based on point vortices. So again, if you look at the developed plane of the helices of the helical wake with three vortices, so this is the azimus here. We have periodic conditions in that direction. But if you unfold it, you have a lot of But if you unfold it, you have a parallel vortices again. And if you cut through it here and look at the plane from the side, then you end up with point vertices. And given that everything happens now at the si i there's no dependence on the azimuth, the point vertices give you a full representation of the of the whole system. Of the whole system. So we have three blades. So the dynamics will repeat after three vortices here. And so you can represent this by a row of vortices, which is periodic, a band of three, which is periodic in space. And the dynamics of this system has been described by RF here. There's a very simple equation for the evolution of these vortices. Equation for the evolution of these vortices in this situation. So, Z is the complex position here of each vortex, and you just have to calculate a sum over three vortices here, or over two vortices, basically, to find the evolution of this. So, for example, if you perturb one vortex slightly up here, then the evolution of the system will look like this. Okay, so this approach here is sort of a simplified simulation of the wake, of the perturbed wake. If you don't perturb it, nothing happens. The solution is equilibrium. But as soon as you perturb one vortex, you can simulate the evolution of the vortex system in this case. So this would represent an infinitely long helix with a periodicity of three. Radio city of three. And you can also then, with some assumptions, construct a spatially evolving wake behind a rotor using the convection speed of the system, which is given by, well, basically it translates by 3h in one rotation. So there are a few technical details for this, but that's the basic idea to construct the To construct the evolution of the rake of an asymmetric rotor using the simple point model, point vortex model here. Okay, one may ask, is this any good? And so we tested it by comparing it with different other results here. One is a filament model where you actually simulate the vortices more correctly using BioSava induction and a core model. Induction and the core model, and using segments of the vortices to iterate the evolution. And so this would look like this for an infinite system of three helices. So this is the non-linear dynamics of such a system where you perturb one helix. You can measure different coordinates as a function of time and compare this. Coordinates as a function of time and compare this to the prediction of the filament model. And the evolution is actually quite good. It represents quite correctly the initial phase of the deformation here, which is the one that would be interesting in the context of wind turbine wakes, representing the downstream distance that we would like to consider. We also did some experiments. Did some experiments using a very simple setup here, for example, with a two-bladed rotor in the water channel. The test section is about 50 centimeters high here, and the rotor has eight centimeters of radius. And we can visualize the evolution of the water system with die and introduce an asymmetry just by offsetting the water a little bit and see what happens. Happens. So, this is the experimental visualization. This is the corresponding prediction from the point-vortex model. And we see that qualitatively it is extremely close. One way to characterize the speed of evolution of this system is to identify a particular point here where the two successive loops change axial position. So, sort of a new Position. So, sort of a leapfrogging position or swapping position. That's where the S comes from. And we can identify that very easily in calculations and in visualizations. So that was our parameter to judge the efficiency of a perturbation. So we varied the amplitude of the perturbation here and the tip speed ratio, which is the operation. Which is the operation parameter for a rotor, the rotation velocity divided by the axial velocity, the incoming velocity, and compared the predictions from the point vortex model with the experimental measurements. And it's not bad at all, given the simplicity of the model. Okay, so the three built rotors, which is our Which is our main topic? We designed a new experiment and had a rotor where we could exchange blades individually in order to create various types of asymmetry. The three images that are superposed here show the base configuration, which is our base case, and it has to be very symmetric for comparison. And this is about the best we could do. There's a very slight There's a very slight remaining asymmetry, but this is good for our good enough for our purpose. Okay, so this was slightly bigger, and again, we use visualizations. And for this one, we have another comparison here between the point-vortex model at the bottom, experimental visualizations at the top, and qualitatively quite good. Quite good. A movie here where we can track positions of the tip vortices in the lower part here, compare that to the point vortex predictions. We also varied quite a bit of parameters. The problem with the point vortex model is there is no core size involved in it, so there's no self-induced velocity from the curvature. But the effect of this seems to be quite. Seems to be quite small. This should not have appeared initially, but okay, so we varied the core size in the filament model, which we used for validation, and compared the effect of the core size variation, which is very small here. In particular, for the parameters relevant for winter-run applications, we are in a range where the agreement with the point-vortex model is quite good. With the point vortex model is quite good. Okay, so now we have our model here. It is very simple, just a simple equation. We can use it to study displacements of the vortex, but also variations of the circulation, which corresponds to pitch variation of the blades, and do some parameter scanning to find which perturbations work. Which perturbations work best. Okay, so well, I'm not sure I'm going to go into the details of this too much, but well, okay, just summing up what we should expect here. The three-vortex system for a perturbation with zero wave numbers has six eigen modes in. In the infinite point vortex row here with a period of three. So there are two unstable modes, two stable modes and two neutral modes. And these can be and any perturbation that you add to this initial situation here can be decomposed into these modes. And usually what you end up with seeing in the end is one of the Was seen in the end is one of the unstable modes. And that's also what happens. If you push one up here, you will end up with the first unstable mode here that you can see. You can't really see the parent lands here. Anyway, and the growth rate, the initial growth rate that you can detect here, it corresponds to what you expect from the theory. Okay, then we. Okay, then we explored perturbations in various directions and with various amplitudes. So this plot here shows the perturbation of one vortex in either the radial direction or the downstream direction. And the color scheme shows the time to the swapping of two consecutive vortices. So this is sort of the time of evolution of the wake. And what we can see here. And what we can see here is that there is one direction here where things go very slowly, and another direction where things go faster if you displace the vortex in this direction. So what happens here is when you displace it in this direction here, we get these two results from experiment and from the point vortex model. And when you displace it in this And when you displace it in this sort of more stable direction, things happen much slower. And you can understand this by looking at the local flow field that the vortex sees in this periodic domain. There is a strain induced by the upper vortices here, and there is an unstable direction and a stable direction, which explains if you displace a vortex here, it will first go back here and then away, whereas if you displace it here, it will... Whereas, if you displace it here, it will go more quickly. And this qualitatively explains the difference between these results. And of course, the more you displace it, the faster the swapping occurs in the wake. Some non-normal effects. So you can create different perturbations from the unstable modes, and they just correspond. Modes and they just correspond to a phase shift between the neighboring perturbations. They all have the same initial growth rate, but on the long run, in the nonlinear phase, if you look at the evolution here, the swapping happens at different times for the three different configurations, which have the same linear growth rate in the beginning. In the beginning. We also vary the circulation of one of the vortices, and the effect is not symmetric. If you decrease the circulation by a certain amount of one of the vortices here, then the others are stronger and will turn around each other and lead to a very quick. To the very quick swapping. And if the circulation is increased, then the increased circulation here will induce a velocity on the neighbors, which will take more time to swap. Okay, so this would represent the effect of a pitch variation of one of the blades. Okay, and again, there's a corresponding experiment. One experiment that shows the evolution, and it's very close to the prediction from the point-vortex model. Okay, and okay, so with this knowledge, we then did a whole series of more experiments to see what this would really look like in a real flow. Again, we have here our rotor with three blades that we could change individually and. Individually and visualize the evolution of the wake with time. Okay, some lines don't really show up here that much, but we had 14 different configurations. An extension of the blade, for example, a bending of the blade, a combination of the two, an azimuto shift of the blade. And we also looked at some modifications of the tip geometry, either with Of the tip geometry, either with a winglet here or a fin, which generates a second tip vortex, and the final one will then also be displaced. The example here shows a configuration where the tip is displaced both in the downstream direction and the radial direction of one of the blades. So you see, two blades are unchanged, and the third one is changed. And yes, the magnitudes that we use are always a few percent of the characteristic length, which is the pitch or the distance between neighboring vortex loops. Okay, then we had this kind of experiment running here. We followed the vortices and we detected the location where the swapping happens from visualization. Happens from visualizations with a laser sheet. And yeah, so this was done for all 14 configurations. And then we could write them in increasing order of effectiveness to accelerate the WIC evolution. So normally the baseline case should be symmetric, but since we still the swapping position should be very far downstream, infinite, but But since we could not get rid of all the asymmetries in our experiment, it was a finite value here, but pretty large. And then there is a whole range of cases that produce more or less effective wake decay. So I'll discuss a few of those. So, for example, this perturbation in either the Perturbation in either the unstable direction or well stable direction or unstable direction here. And it clearly shows that the decay is faster here than in the other case. So this is the comparison between these two cases here. So it makes a difference in which way you perturb the vortex if you want to go destroy the system. Destroy the system more quickly. There are some perturbations that have the same effect. For example, if you perturb the vortex in the downstream direction here or in the asymmetrical direction, you end up with the same result. And this is also shown in the experimental observations here with a downstream bending or an azimuthal shift. Musical shift gives basically the same results here. There's slightly more complicated tip geometries here with a fin and a winglet. For the fin case, well, the resolution here is not sufficient, but it shows we have two vortices generated initially that merge into a bigger one here. And the bigger one is displaced. The bigger one is displaced with respect to the others. So it has a more diffuse dye pattern here because it's bigger and it leads to the deformation of the wake. And the winglet displaces basically the vortex associated to this blade away from the original position and induces the pairing quite quickly. So these modifications. Quickly. So these modifications are quite efficient, in particular, if you use, if you modify two blades, so you have a completely asymmetric rotor. That is the best case here where we have the winglet and the fin, which leads to the fastest destabilization. Okay. So this was an exploratory part from a simple model. Part from a simple model and some accompanying experiments which show good agreement. But the question is: what difference would it make for a wind turbine actually? So for this, we started to do some molecular simulations with geometries that are more close to real applications. And this was done by the group. And this was done by the group in Denmark. So, the configuration that was chosen was one of the benchmark wind turbines in the wind energy community, the MRL5 megawatt turbine, with a ground effect here, which is sitting on the ground. And the idea was to see what effect would a perturbation of the types that we just looked at make. That make on the downstream field where another wind turbine would be placed, and what kind of benefit can we expect from a modification here? So one difficulty with these calculations is that if we want to characterize what we just saw, the dynamics of the flip vortices, these have to be resolved. So in many of Resolved. So, in many of these more applied simulations, the resolution is cause, and the vortices quickly merge before they can do all these interesting phenomena. So, that was a problem initially. I mean, it's not completely solved. This is why this part is still a bit preliminary for the moment. But at the same time, you need a very long downstream distance in order to. Well, look what these conditions would be for another wind turbine. Okay, so I'll show you what we have so far. So these are four cases that we were simulated. Well, this should be somewhere else. So one is the symmetric case here. And we see that the vortex system persists over quite a distance nicely. Sits over quite a distance nicely aligned. And then three asymmetric cases were tested: one with a pitch variation where one vortex has a different circulation, one with a winglet that displaces the vortex in the unstable direction, and one with a simple radial extension where one blade is longer than the other two. And in all cases, the destabilization here happens. Destabilization here happens more quickly. Then later downstream, you can't really see it from these results here what the difference would be. So what we then looked at in more detail was the case with a radial extension, because from a practical point of view, that would be a feasible solution. So in practice, you could imagine that you just have an You could imagine that you just have an add-on on one of your blades, make it a bit longer, and you only need a few percent, actually, two percent in this case, to trigger these dynamics here. It's very low amplitude is needed for this to happen. Yeah, the question is, does this initial evolution here, which is the one we had looked at before, have some effect on the later evolution where everything breaks down? The later evolution where everything breaks down and have a noticeable effect for another wind turbine here. Okay, so these simulations, I would say, are not finalized yet because of the numerical problems. We don't have a long enough time yet for everything to converge nicely. And there are these issues with. And there are these issues with the resolution of the cores. But nevertheless, some first results here concerning the flow field of this wind turbine. So what you can do is to look at the flow field in a cross section downstream and look at the energy of the velocity in the field and the difference between the symmetric. The difference between the symmetric case and the asymmetric case when you add a perturbation. What you can do is you can place a virtual second wind turbine there and see how much flow rate do you get in the second one and also what the available power would be for such a second wind turbine at this point. And then you can vary the position of the lateral position to see your. Of the lateral position to see what this parameter does and study this also as a function of the downstream distance because you have wind turbines that are placed at various distances in different wind farms. So you get a survey like this from this data, and you can also get the available power here, which is related to the velocity here. And what you can see is that. And what you can see is that with a simple increase of the blade length, you can increase the mean velocity to up to 3.5% and the available power, if you're really aligned in the center here, by up to 11%. So, this is sort of similar to what other people have found with different techniques. Where, I mean, there are other ideas how to deal with this problem. Deal with this problem, for example, by deviating the rake, by inclining the first turbine that leads to deviation, or by some sort of time-dependent forcing to excite some other modes that I've talked about before. So, it's the same order of magnitude of effect that you can get. So, this is for a single wind turbine and another one behind it there. Behind it, there. So, we pushed this analysis a little bit further to look actually at a rural wind farm here for which there was some data available, which is very difficult to get if you are not in the community. So, there was one for which measurements were available. So, the geometries here, the efficiency was measured over the period of one year or more, several years, with a company. Several years with accompanying wind data, direction and intensity. And so we try to use the previous data, giving efficiency based on distance and offset, to see what difference this would make of one year for this particular case here. Okay, so how would you do this? So, how would you do this? Well, you have first established a matrix here with the wind direction. So, for example, if the wind comes here, then we have a very unfavorable condition for these downstream ones here. And you extract the efficiency change from our previous results and do that for all these turbines here. That for all these turbines here as a function of the wind direction and the wind force. Okay, so what you see is dependent on some particular wind directions here. You get a very noticeable loss here if the wind is aligned with the directions of this matrix here. And you can do this then for For the case with modification and without modification, and that's a difference here. So the difference is not very large. It is quite noticeable for certain wind directions where these are aligned. And in these cases, you can get a maximum increase for the entire wind farm of about 2.6%, which may seem okay. Which may seem okay, but then you will have to average that with the actual wind conditioner. And if you do that using statistics of the wind direction and wind force, what you end up in the end is a total overall gain, which is quite small. So, as I said, this is sort of a preliminary result based. Preliminary result based on simulations that we can still improve. But it gives you sort of the idea of what you can expect from this kind of thing. I mean, this was the purpose of this whole project, to get an estimate of this thing here, which may be able to be refined because there are certain gaps still in what we've been doing. But anyway, so. But anyway, so it is small, and yeah, I think it's too small to be interesting for the industry so far. So we'll see how it goes. Okay. One can look at other parameters, for example, the turbulence in the wake, how that is modified by the modification of the geometry. Symmetric case, asymmetric case difference, and what you can see is that it increases the turbulence at the edge of the wake, which is not surprising because that's where the vortex dynamics happen. And it reduces it in the center of the wake, which means that you get less load on the second. Load on the second turbine. But okay, making the rotor asymmetric has also a price. It unbalances the whole structure. And from the simulations, we can also estimate this effect. It is actually quite a big effect. So if you look at the forces and moments at the base or at the hub of these things, they increase quite a bit. But I mean, But I mean, this problem could probably be dealt with by putting on a counterweight on the rotor. So it may not be that drastic, but it's certain that if you want to implement such a thing, there will be other technical challenges to offset these effects that you usually don't want. Okay. Okay, well, so this is sort of what I wanted to show you today about this asymmetric rotor wake study. So, well, what can you take away from this? So, well, we know now that we know that helical vortices are subject to instabilities, in particular these displacement instabilities, and that some modes can be triggered by a simple variation of rotation. A central variation of the roto geometry making it asymmetric. The evolution of this system, at least the initial part where the vortices remain visible and coherent, can be quite accurately predicted by a simple point vortex model, which is surprising and useful for that. And there may be some benefit for wind farm operations. Benefit for wind farm operation where you have interaction between wind turbines through their wakes, and where there is a measurable effect from these wakes. And there are quite a few studies that try to address this problem. And so this study fits into this context here. There are a couple of papers that we published on what I just showed you. I mean, there is some more work left. There is still more work left to do, in particular, improving the simulations. So we have some more work in progress to make these simulations more reliable concerning the vortex dynamics in the beginning. And one important additional ingredient that we have to consider is turbulence, free stream turbulence. Free stream turbulence. All these relates to situations where turbulence is very low. So, laminar conditions, everything happens in a very clean way here. If you have atmospheric turbulence on top of that, water just destabilize more quickly, even in the symmetric configuration. And the benefit of making the water asymmetric may not. Of making the water asymmetric may not be that big. So, this still needs to be quantified and then also transposed to real conditions with real measurements of atmospheric turbulence to see how much benefit would actually survive if you add turbulence. Yeah, one may want to look at other modes that are not the global pairing that we looked at here, but local pairing. Looked at here, but local pairing. But as I said, you would need some time-dependent action during the rotation to trigger these modes, which may seem a bit more useful for deep-stabilizing the weight because they're more complex. So, things may be a bit more beneficial for these modes, but there's probably a balance between the technical difficulty and the benefit. It and is there anything else? Yes. And another part that is planned in this project in Denmark also is to have an experiment with two rotors where you modify the first and then do actual measurements on the second rotor concerning the efficiency and the loads when you vary the geometry of the first rotor. So basically to push this whole thing to a To push this whole thing to the final configuration of two rotors, one behind the other. Okay, so this is the end of my presentation. I'm just putting up this image here as a short introduction to the next talk, because I think this is what Yuji will talk about: the long-wave instability of a single. Of the single vortex that we have observed in our channel some time ago. And I think he will tell us what happens here. Thank you very much.
