Summer hi, Claude Kurtzer, James Rickards, and myself. And so this came out of a summer research project. So Summer is a graduate student at CU, James is a postdoc with me at CU, and Clyde is an undergraduate at CU. And I'm going to tell you about Apollonian circle packings. Okay, so an Apollonian circle packing is something that you can make by this iterative process. So you start with three circles, which are all tangent to each other. Are all tangent to each other. And then what you do is you ask, how can I add a circle which is tangent to the original three? And this is named in Apollonian circle piping because Apollonius of Perga in ancient Greece asked a bunch of questions like this, not just for this particular case with three circles, but how many ways can you do this thing tangent to that thing and so on. So the answer in this case is if I have these three circles, then you've got two ways that you can add a tangent circle. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add those in, and then I'm going to keep doing that. And then I'm going to keep doing that. So I have now more triples that give me a new circle that I can add in, and so on. So, what it amounts to doing, right, is just filling in each of these triangles with a circle that touches the three sides. And so you do that forever, and you get this nice fractal, which is called an Apollonian circle pi. Okay, but since we're number theorists, I'm going to cover it in numbers. And what these represent is the curvatures of all of the circles. So the curvature is 1 over the radius. So this guy right here. The curvature is 1 over the radius, so this guy right here has radius 111. And what's weird about it, of course, is that they're all integers. And so the reason for that goes back to a correspondence between Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia and Descartes. And together they proved the following theorem. And this says that if you take four of these circles, which are all mutually tangent, so four every pair of which is tangent, you can call that a Descartes quadruple. So that'll be a useful sort of piece. So, that'll be a useful sort of piece of the packing to think about. Then, if you take the four curvatures, then they satisfy this quadratic equation. And so, in particular, this makes sense with Apollonius' question, because if you fix ABC, you get a quadratic equation in D. So there's two solutions for the two circles geometrically, and there's two curvatures. And the nice thing is that because it's a quadratic equation, there's a linear relationship between the two possible fourth curvatures. And so, in particular, if you start with four, Particular, if you start with four, if you get to the point of having a Descartes quadruple which has four integer curvatures, then because of this thing right here, everything is going to be an integer because the iterative process you're growing up the fractal with, you're just adding integers at each stage. Okay, so now we have a collection of integers, right? And so the question is, the motivating question for today is what curvatures appear in one of these integral appliance or Applines or plants. Okay, so there's a few considerations. So the first is maybe a geometric consideration in the high school sense of geometry, which is that there just isn't room to put enough of these small circles. So small circles, sorry, small curvatures. Small curvatures means big circle, right? And so if I want to put a curvature, if I already have, say, this outer circle and I filled it with an 11, a 14, and a 15, which is going to turn An 11, a 14, and a 15, which is going to determine the whole packing. I have no room to put a circle of curvature 8 in here. There's just no room, right? So some of the small stuff at the beginning just isn't. So you might ask, how much room is there as you get bigger? Bigger and bigger curvatures. And so you can count the number of circles that have curvatures below a bound x. And this is something which you could do whether or not it's an integral pattern. And the growth depends on the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal. Depends on the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal, which is the same for all of these different examples of such things. And so, what you're doing is if you have an integral Apollonian circle packing, you're counting with multiplicity because you're going to see curvatures potentially repeated inside the packing. And in fact, you have to have multiplicity because there aren't enough integers below x to have this many circles, right? So, what you get is that the multiplicities on average have to be growing with x, so they're about x to the 0.3. To the 0.3. Alright, so that says that there's lots of circles, and we have to fill them with integers at a certain pace, and we're going to have to use integers twice in order to be able to do that, or with high multiplicity. So the other thing that you might try to do to try to see what integers there are is you might look mod something. So here's a picture of that same Apple Omega and Circle Packing Mod 5 I've just colored by residue class. So you can see if you count, there's So, you can see if you count, there's five colors in this picture. So, we're seeing all the different residue classes. They seem to be kind of distributed and mixed up. Seems perfectly reasonable. Here's mod 3. So, there's only two colors, right? So, what we've got is it can be 0 mod 3, that's red, or it can be 0 mod 3, that's yellow. And nothing can ever be 1 mod 3 in this pack, at least according to this picture. And that's in fact true. So, what happens is it turns out that you can get a sort of congruence obstruction. Get a sort of congruence obstruction, which is some sort of modular restriction on the curvatures which can appear. So it turns out that mod 24 will do it for you. And so you can get either this set of residues, mod 24, or this one. There's six possible sets of residues. So any particular packing will fall into one of the rows of this table. And we've labeled them with types here. So the first entry here is just how many residues there are in this list, and the second is the first. Are in this list, and the second is the first invertible residue. And so, this just is a way, a relatively arbitrary way of naming them. So, there's six possible, the six rows on the table, there's sort of six possible types of packings as far as the contents restrictions go. So, any questions at this point? All right, so that seems good. Okay, so in order to understand why we would look at Apalonian circle packings and also At Appalongian circle packings, and also how you would go about studying them, the important feature of these is that it's a sort of recursive structure. It has symmetries, right? So there's an underlying group which is controlling what's going on in the picture. And one way to describe this group is to talk about its action on quadruples. So I'm going to talk about its action either on quadruples of circles, or I might even just think about on the quadruples of curvature, since it's the curvatures I'm interested in. And if I think about it on the circles, then this is a data. It on the circles, then this is a Descartes quadruple here. Maybe it should be called an Elizabeth Descartes quadruple. It's four circles that are all mutually tangent. And if I take one of them and color it differently, I could trade it out for the other solution to Apollonius' problem, depending on the first two circles. And so this is called a swap. If you do it twice, you get back where you started. And it turns out that the symmetries can be described as just these four different swaps. It's just a free product of those groups of one or two. Of those groups of one or two. So those are the only relations here. Okay, and you can describe these, you can give a representation as four by four matrices because you can think about how it acts on the four quadruples. So you've got four quadruples, and if you apply this matrix, it's basically doing the algebra that you saw in the Descartes-Elizabeth slide. And swapping out this new curvature in terms of the other ones. And it's linear, so it's a matrix. So it lives in the orthogonal group, and it preserves the quadratic form, the Descartes. And it preserves the quadratic form, the Descartes quadratic form that describes the alpine circle packings. So that's Q here in my notation, and it's a form of signature 3.1. So it basically lives in O31 with integer entries. Okay. But what's interesting about it is, you know, O31 is an algebraic group, right? You can describe this group by giving some polynomial conditions on the entries of the matrix to say what is an element in the group and what's not. The Apollonian group is infinite index inside there. Infinite index inside there, and yet it is not cut out by any further polynomial relations. So it's risky dense, which means that if I want to check if something's in the Apollonian group, I can't do it by a polynomial deficient number entries. It's a little harder to get your hands on the group. And so this Apollonian, the study of Apollonian circle packings is actually just sort of a beautiful case study. It's become the quintessential example for the study of thin groups in general. So this question about whether we can access the arithmetic of these groups. The arithmetic of these groups and whether we can access the arithmetic of their orbits. Because basically, the set of curvatures in the Apalonian circle packing is an orbit of this thin group. All right, so this is the fundamental thing that we're really studying. And the local obstruction is fairly easy to think about because if you just reduce modulo n for whatever n you're interested in, you can draw, using these four generators, what all the quadruples are. Generators, what all the quadruples are in your packing. So if I start with 7, 2, 2, 3, then I apply S3, that flips the third circle for its other solution, and that changes to a 6 over here. So S3 will move me over here or move me down here. And so you can draw out this graph, and it'll be finite when you're working mod N, and you can just look at what are all the curvatures that you get. And this example here, you can see this is mod 8. There's no zero mod 8, for example. And so that's where these. And so that's where these local obstructions seem to come from. It's harder to do the other side and say, well, let's take a look at these graphs as a collection of graphs, mod n. These are basically Cayley graphs. Take a look at these graphs as a family for all the different moduli, and it turns out it's an expander family. And this kind of phenomenon can only happen at the primes 2 and 3. And that's something one can prove. Okay. Alright, so that explains the local. Alright, so that explains the local obstructions to some extent. And so the study of Apollonian circle packing essentially goes back to Grand Ligarius, Maliswiltz, and Jan around 2003. They had a series of papers, and they were interested in the arithmetic and the geometry, lots of different things. And they made a version of this conjecture. And then Fuchs and Sanden in 2011, they ran more data, which I'll talk about. And the conjecture is that the stuff that we've described fully describes what's going on. We've described fully describes what's going on. So there's a sort of geometric push for high multiplicity, there's some like failure of room at the very beginning, and then there's a congruence restriction, which is just sort of that's just there. And otherwise, there shouldn't be any other restrictions or control. Otherwise, it should just, you know, by sort of pure probability, the numbers should just sort of distribute the way one might expect. And so the actual conjecture says that in one of these packings, That in one of these packings, the curvatures will satisfy some Congress condition. And if you look at the stuff satisfying the condition, all the sufficiently large things will appear. So if it's not ruled out by the Congress condition and it's not too small, it will appear. So we'll call a curvature missing if it's allowed by the Congress condition but doesn't actually show up. Okay, so this is the local to global conjecture, and the analogy, the reason it's called local to global conjecture Analogy, the reason it's called local to global is it's an analogy to the study, say, of Diophantine equations. Because, sort of, like at each prime or you know, each modulus, you have maybe some information that restricts what you've got, but otherwise you would expect to see everything. Okay, so there's some theoretical evidence. So, Fuchs proved that the congruence obstruction, she completely classified what it can be, and it can be completely tied up. Be completely tied up in a bow if you just look at mod 24. So, mod 24, check what the residues are, then you know everything about all the condoms restrictions. There's nothing else. Okay, and then, oops, and then there's been a lot of work that sort of works towards proving a local global conjecture. So, Graham Legers, Miles, Wilts, and Yan have written their original papers, Sarnak, Burgaine, Fuchs, and then Burgaine and Kantarovich is sort of the culmination so far. And this counts the number of missing courages. And this counts the number of missing curvatures. Remember, missing means that it's allowed by the climate's condition, but it doesn't show up. So, some of those small ones, there's definitely missing curvatures. But the conjecture says they should peter out entirely. And what we can say is it's at most something that grows less than n, which means that it's density zero in the allowable curvatures. So, density one of here in some sense. Okay? And so, this uses analytic number theory. Analytic number theory, Hardy-Littlewood circle method, things like that. And it uses the theory of expander graphs because we're talking about those mod graphs. The idea is to, I mean, on a very, very high level, it's kind of like a Chinese remainder theorem thing. Like these graphs for most of the crimes are well-behaved, and you expect kind of some sort of independence so that you would build all the integers and so on. So kind of you're wandering around the graphs, mod each of your different crimes, and you would expect to hit all the different combos. Expect to hit all the different combos that you would need to get whatever you want. So there's one theoretical tool that's going to be useful in the talk and is sort of at the very base of all of those results. And that's that you can look at pieces of the equilibrium circle packing. So instead of taking all of the curvatures, we're going to take just the family of curvatures tangent to one particular circle. So I've got this circle with curvature 11 here, and I just want to look at all the things which are tangent. And I just want to look at all the things which are tangent to that, and that's shown in blue. And that's a much easier collection of curvatures to understand. Those actually have the values of a quadratic form. This quadratic form, a is the curvature, so 11 in this case. So it's a quadratic form, and I have to subtract a to get the value. So it's actually that 15 plus 11 is the value of the quadratic form, and 14 plus 11 is the value, and so on. Those are values of the quadratic form. And it has discriminant minus 4 times this curve. Minus four times this curvature here squared. So it's a, you know, this is, this is Gaussian, this is some order in the Gaussians, right? Okay, so we can understand these, and then the analytic methods, you have to try to sort of build a collection of these and show that they don't overlap too much, and therefore, like, build out the existence of many, many curvatures. All right, there's also computational evidence. So, Fuchs and Sanden computed curvatures for two Computed curvatures for two particular packings up to about 10 to the 8. And this graph, so this first one here is called the bug eye packing. This is from their paper. So this graph here is for the bug eye packing, and it is a histogram of the multiplicities. So remember I said the multiplicities of the integers, they have to be increasing. So what this graph says is that in this range here, 10 to the 6th to 10 to the 8th, most of the integers are appearing with multiplicity around like 400. Multiplicity around like 400. Okay, that's what it's saying. And you don't see anything down here. You're not seeing things with low multiplicity at all anymore. And as this range goes out, as you compute larger and larger curvatures, this hump moves off to the right. So this is some evidence for the fact that we know on average the multiplicity has to be growing, but it's actually kind of growing in some sort of statistically reasonable way. They like to be certain mean invariants and whatnot. Invariants and whatnot, right? So, okay. And so they took a look at these two packings. And for this one, there were still a few missing curvatures when we got up to around 10 to the 8, but very few, and only some of the resting processes. Okay, so the story starts this summer for us when we were looking at doing an RU. So James and I were leading this RU. And the idea was to fix a pair. The idea was to fix a pair of curvatures, sort of turn the problem around. Instead of studying what curvatures we're going to pack, we might pick curvatures and ask what packings. So pick two curvatures and study what packings contain that pair. And so the first thing to do is to collect some data. So we wanted to draw a plot. So for an admissible pair of residue classes, mod 24, so something which could occur together, okay, they're together somewhere in one of the Okay, they're together somewhere in one of the rows of that table early on. Then we'll draw a plot, we'll plot the pair and coordinates, and we'll put a black dot if there's no packing that has that pair. And so if they fail to have that pair. And it turns out that if you believe the local global conjecture, then these dots ought to peter out. And so you should see for finitely many black dots, maybe like for small. Finitely many black dots, maybe like for small pairs of curvatures, and then you'd expect them to just peter off as the data gets larger. So here's an example of a typical graph from this data. So this is the actual graph from back then. And you can see this upper corner here. I've zoomed in so that you can see because it's pretty hard on the slide. But there's just these random little dots. It's like a screen grab. That's why they're funny shapes. But anyway, so these, there's just a few, and there's But anyway, so these are just a few, and they're sort of randomly scattered, but they peter out, and you don't see anything down here. And Summer ran hundreds of these on her computer, and they all pretty much looked like this, except for a single graph. One out of those many had this pattern to it. And hopefully over here you can kind of see how there's these lines and they're kind of spreading out gradually like this. And when I looked at this, I felt like this looked kind of quadratic. And it seemed to be saying, And it seemed to be saying that if this pattern continues, there's certain pairs of curvatures, there's a certain sort of infinite collection of pairs of curvatures, which just repel one another. They can't occur in the same pattern. Okay, so we got very curious about this because if the local global conjecture is true, then these black dots ought to peter out, but there's not a single one missing in this whole range from the pattern that your eye picks out. From the pattern that your eye picks up. And another way to see what's happening, well, if it's really quadratic, then one thing you could do to pick that up would be to look at the differences between successiveness and curvatures. So we list out the curvatures, and then you take the differences, the list of differences. If that set of curvatures was, for example, like the values of a quadratic polynomial, then the differences would be linear and so on, right? So you'd expect maybe to pick up a pattern. So this is up to the first four. So, this is up to the first 4,000 curvatures. This is just a graph of those differences. So, around here, the differences are pretty small, but just like varying a lot, right? And over here, they're getting bigger, but still just varying a lot. So, this is the first 4,000 successive differences for one of these packings. And here's what happens when you go to 10,000 successive differences. And so you can see that this randomness you're seeing at the beginning peters out and it becomes very, very patternful. So, there's definitely in the missing. So, there's definitely in the missing curvatures some sort of structure. It's not just sort of randomly missed curvatures. And so, this is an example theorem. So, we were able to prove for all the different types of packings exactly what is missing. But this is a very simple example here. So, the Apollonian circle packing generated by this quadruple here, minus 3588, never has a square in it. Okay, and so that means that the local global conjecture. And so that means that the local global conjecture is false. So I can give you the proof to this essentially. It doesn't take too much work. Once we knew what we were looking for, the proof came fairly quickly, actually. So the idea is that a circle, we can give it a notion of residuosity. So remember that if you look at one circle, you're actually looking at a family of tangent curvatures. There's all this stuff touching it. So that So that family, well, if you remember, it's translated by n and has discriminate minus n squared. So let's look at it mod n. And then this collection of curvatures is going to simplify because this becomes degenerate here. The discriminant becomes zero and the translation becomes irrelevant. And it's actually going to look something like this once you change variables. So it's going to be either all quadratic residues, if A is a quadratic residue, or non-residues. Non-residues. And so the idea is that then we can label this circle with a 1 if it allows quadratic residues or a minus 1 if it doesn't, if it only allows non-residues. So the circle controls the family. It's really information about the family, but I'm going to label the circle as a 1 or a minus. Okay, so that means that next to that circle, you know, I might be ruling out something like squares if I have a minus 1. And what happens is that this propagates through the whole packing. So it's actually the packing that has a residuosity, has a one or minus one kind of value. So suppose you have two tangent circles, co-prime curvatures, say, then it turns out that to ask this question, you're asking, is the curvature touching me, the two A and B are touching each other, is the curvature touching me a residue or from the other perspective, right? Perspective, right? And it turns out in this particular packing, all the curvatures are 0, 1, mod 4, so quadratic reciprocity is particularly nice. And this tells me, by quadratic reciprocity, this comes out to be 1, and so that tells me that the values on those two circles are the same. So one was a 1, the other is a 1. And so then all you need is to convince yourself that you can walk anywhere in the packing like this. And it turns out that any two circles are connected by a path of pairwise copride and curvatures. And so that means that the whole packing is made up of circles that are labeled with one. Is made up of circles that are labeled with ones, or the whole packing is made up of minus ones. And so then you just have to check. So for this guy right here, minus 3588, we just do the Legendre symbol, and it comes out to a minus one. So that means that, you know, picking this circle five in the base quadruple, I cannot have a perfect square touching it. But by the previous slide, I can't have a perfect square touching any of them. So I can't have a perfect square at all. All right. Alright, so that's the idea. The idea is these sort of these new invariants that you can label a circle with a plus or minus one and it ends up constant across the packing. And there's also a cortic reciprocity going on. So for certain types that we saw in that table early on, you can actually apply a fourth root of unity, and that will be constant across the package. So you can actually rule out fourth powers as well using quartic reciprocity, but I won't have time for that in the talk today. Okay. Okay, so those are the things that we see. This is a table that sort of summarizes all of the obstructions that you can see. So these are the types over here, but I've added in the info of chi2 and chi4 if I need the chi4 or if I define it. And so these are an expanded list of certain types of packings. And then for each of them, there's certain quadratic families that cannot appear in the packing, and sometimes certain portic families that cannot appear in the packing. Families that cannot appear in the packing. And these families will sort of intersect only some of the residue classes. So, for example, over here, these families will affect all of the residue classes. And so, for each of those residue classes, you will definitely be missing informally many things. But for a lot of them, it sort of splits half in half. So you get some of the classes are injected, and you know they're going to be missing influencing many things, but some of them will you know the the local global conjecture might still be open for them for that rest of the class. Open for that residue class. And then there's this family here and this one here where there just aren't any. There aren't any of these. So the local global conjecture might still be true for those particular packings. And the bug eye packing happened to be one of those. So it looking at the data we were looking at before, you wouldn't see this phenomenon. Okay, so that means we have a new conjecture. So now we had missing curvatures, which weren't ruled out by the Congrants condition, but were nevertheless missing. Condition, but we're nevertheless missing. Now we have like even more, right? So we'll call them sporadic. So they're absent without leave, right? Because they're not missing because of the Congress condition, and they're not missing because of these new reciprocity obstructions, but they're still missing. And the new conjecture is that that should be a finite set. So we also collected a lot of data. So James, as many of you know now, is incredible at coding stuff up very efficiently. And so he Very efficiently, and so he came up with some very, very fast code to get a lot further computing these curvatures. That's on GitHub if you want to play with it. It also draws the pictures, stuff, the affluent and circle packing pictures, so if you just want to play. And we computed lots of these sporadic sets. And we can get up to 10 to the 10 is pretty easy. So we did, we tried to systematically do all the small packings for 10 to the 10. And you can get up to 10 to the 12. How many do we do? 10 to the 12 changes? Four or five. Four or five. How long did it take? It would take half a week. Half a week. Yeah. Half a week. Half a week. Yeah. So it's possible. Just on a random server, not like a super. Right, yeah. We still haven't figured out how to get on the super week. Okay, so I'll finish with a plot. So this is a plot. This is in log log axes so that you can see what's going on a little bit better. And basically what it is, is it's supposed to capture from the data the apparent probability that a given curvature is sporadic. This is what we're hoping they die out. out. And so what I'm doing is I put the data into bins of size 10,000 and I counted how many were sporadic in the bins. And so once the curvature size is up near here, we're only seeing like one sporadic, you know, maybe about one sporadic thing once we're getting up to curvatures of that size, okay, in a bin. And so this is an estimate of what the probability looks like. And these are three different packings in the three different colors. And so it certainly looks as if they're So it certainly looks as if they're petering out if they, you know, I don't know if you expect nature to follow smooth paths or something. Yeah, so thank you. Let's start off with Mbamp, are there any questions? Is there any hope of like characterizing this set? Writing it down? The sporadic set? Yeah. So I think the philosophy is that the sporadic I think the philosophy is that the sporadic set is just the random leftovers of some sort of process which approximates some like heuristically ought to behave like a random process. And so no, we wouldn't really expect there to be a pattern in those things. And it's finite, I mean, so technically you should be able to. Right, you might be able to list it if we could ever prove the conjecture. Perhaps it would be effective in some way. One thing that you do notice is because of some subtleties to do with the graphs, the Cayley graphs that I talked about. The graphs, the Cayley graphs that I talked about for the local obstruction, you do see sort of different proportions of different residues and stuff. So we noticed that a lot of the sporadic things are 015 eventually. So there's a little bit maybe of structure to it, but again, I think it's just kind of expected to be the leftovers of some sort of probabilistic thing. It's not going to be like a polynomial fail. Other questions? Chloe, does anyone on your end have any questions? Sorry, Peter has questions. Go ahead. Maybe this is a stupid question. It's not quite the same problem, but if you're given like a starting quadruple and you're given one number, is it easy to decide whether that will appear in the circle directly? Well, you can walk the tree and see if you see it. I don't know. Yeah, but I mean if it's root, like, say, large. Yeah. I don't know of a better way to do that. Yeah. I'm looking at James the Shakespeare. Yeah, I'm looking at James to shape his head. You can write down all the quadruples containing that number, and then you can reduce them all. Oh, that's a better way. But I don't think it's actually, it's actually slower in practice. You have to essentially, if your number is n, you have to compute all the quadratic forms of discriminant minus 4n squared, which I think ends up being slower than just walking the tree. Yeah, because you can walk to the root of the tree, like of that, you know, that graph of quadruples. You could always walk a step which takes you to smaller curvatures. So it's fairly easy to figure out what packing you're in if you have a quadruple. That's what he's suggesting. If you have a quadruple, it's easy to figure out what you're in, but you first have to list all the quadruples containing it. I think it's slower. Because that grows quickly. Oh. I have a question for you guys. Oh, I have a question for you guys, which is: can you make a crypto system out of this? Other questions here? Chloe, I think you said you didn't. Do you have any questions? Bye. Okay, and it I don't think the end of time. Don't think the end of that? Well, thanks, Kate, so much for this talk. It was really. I think next we're going to work in groups, but the people in Bristol might take a few minutes to get to their next place, so it's just going to spend it.
