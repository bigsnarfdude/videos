As the title indicates, the main topic of today's My Talk is a relationship between the multiplicities of the industry representations, which is a representation of the theoretic object, and the orbital decomposition on the flat varieties, which is a geometric object. More precisely, I would like to talk about the following main topics. The first one is that the finite multiplicity property of the specific property of the initial representations is related to the orbital decomposition over the year number field and the second one is that the uniformly bounded match specific property of indigence representation is related to the orbital decomposition of the complex number heat. Then I'd like to start with the following topic. Let GBR DR deductible algebraic group H area algebra H, area divergence subgroup of Z, and P, a minimal parallel subgroup of Z. Then, in this setting, Kobayashi and Osima established a criterion for the finite mass physicistic property of the individual representation on Z over H. The criterion says that the following two conditions on the pair J and H are equivalent. The first condition is that the remainder of that phase. The dimension of the space of intergovernmental filters and proven pi to the individual representation on zero by h associated tau is finite for any element of i tau over z hatosmus times h of h. Here, z-hatosmus is a set of equivalence classes of irreducible smooth atomic z representations, and Hatton is that of irreducible finite dimensional H representations. Finite dimensional H representation. Therefore, this first condition means that the induced representation on Z has a finite multiplicity property as a representation of Z. The second condition is a real specificity of G over H, namely the existence of an open P orbit on G over H, which is equivalent to the existence of one H orbit on the paradigm IP. H over on the product variety G over B. Therefore, this criterion says that the function one, which is a representation theoretical property, is characterized by the function two, which is a geometric property on the planet variety, C over B. Moreover, this function 2 is also equivalent to the following, another condition. Another function. Namely, the realisticity of 0 by H is equivalent to the finiteness of the number of P orbits on 0 by H, which is also equivalent to the finiteness of the number of H orbits on the product variety 0 by P. This is a consequence of the result of Matsuki and the Kumer paradox. Here, the result of Matsuki means Yale Land 1 deduction, which states that this states that this equivalence is true is always true if this equivalence true is true in the case that G is of real language one. And the result of Tmer Pedro means that the classification of real-land real specific homogeneous spaces, which shows that this equivalence is true, in the case that G is of real language one. Thus, by these two theorems, The theorems we have this equivalence of these three conditions namely as the function one, which is the representation of the property, is characterized by the function two or the function three, which are geometric properties on the product variety G over P, where P is a minimal parallel subgroup of G. Therefore, by this equivalence in By this equivalence, it inspires us to think that what will happen in this relationship if we replace this P with a general parallel subgroup Q of G. Namely, I would like to define a variant of these three conditions for a general parabolic subgroup Q. And then I want to invest in the relationship among such three conditions. Here, I would like to note that this. I would like to note that this function 2 and the function 3 contains information about P in the statement. Therefore, we can consider an obvious variant of these two conditions by replacing this P with Q. However, it seems that this condition 1 does not contain the information about P in its segment. Thus, we cannot consider a barrier. we cannot consider a variant of this condition one in the similar way to these two conditions. Therefore, in order to formulate a variant of this condition one, I would like to recall the Harish Chandra sub-causient theorem. The statement of the Harishandra sub-causion theorem is that for any element pi of G-hattos smooth, there is an element eta of there exists an element eta of p hat f such that pi is isomorphic to the subquotient of the finished verse's representation on j over b associated to eta. Based on this fact, I would like to consider the following definition. We say that an element of pi over z hat smooth belongs to Q series if there is an element eta over Q at L, such that pi is isometric to isomer. phi isomic to isomber to subquotient of the designate principle's representation on zero by q associated to eta. Moreover, I would like to write the q smooth for the set of pi belonging to q series. In this notation, we can relate the Harisandral subquacium theorem in the following form. Namely, Z hat smooth is equal to Z hat P smooth. This is just the real This is just the rewriting of the Harry-Sandra sub-quauchi theorem in this notation because Harry-Sandratubo-Cauchy theorem says that any element of pi of zero smooth belongs to P series by this definition. Then by using this equality, we can formulate a variant of the condition one. In fact, by this equality, By this equality, we can replace this g-hat smooth with g-hat p smooth without changing the meaning of the function 1. In this form, these three conditions contain the information about p in their statement. Thus, we can consider an obvious variant of these three conditions deplacing p with q. More precisely, I would like to define the following three conditions. The position 1Q is defined by the finiteness of the dimension of this home space for any element pi tau of gauge q similar times h of l. And the constant 2q is defined by the existence of an open q orbit on g over h, which is equivalent to the existence of an open h orbit on g over q. And the function CQ is defined by the finite of the number of q orbits on g over h. number of q orbits on zero by h which is given to the finite of the number of h orbits on geo by q then i'd like to invest the relationship among the d3 conditions in this formulation that is some easy relationship among these three conditions in fact the condition 3q always implies the position 3q namely the finites of the number of orbits Finiteness of the number of orbits implies the existence of an open orbit by the bay particle itself. Moreover, the conversive implication has an easy counter example. Let G be the general linear group of degree C over R. Q, a maximal probability subgroup of Z, corresponding to the partition of 1, 2. And H, a closed subgroup of G. Across the subgroup of G, which is a uniported radical of the positive parabolic sub of Q. Then in this setting, G over Q is isomorphic to the two-dimensional real projective space, Rb2. Moreover, in the calculation shows, that is the open H orbit on G over Q, namely, the point on ZQ is qualified, but the number of H orbits on J over Q is infinite, namely, the point of 3Q is not satisfied. Here is not satisfied. That's this example is a counter example to this implication. Moreover, the same example shows that the implication from the function 2Q to the function 1Q is not always true in general. In fact, we can prove that in this setting, the dimension of the space of intertwining operators belongs to the Any operators from the design of inspiration representation to the induced representation zero by H is infinite by using the fact proved by Obiasi and SPEY, which will be explained later. Moreover, by using the fact that any designate principal C representation has a finite length, we can prove that this infinite dimensionality implies that there exists some element of finite length. that z exists some element of pi tau of z matrix time set of f such that the dimension of this form space is infinite namely this infinite infinite dimensionality implies the negation of the points of 1 q which means that this implication is not always true in general for the composite implication there is a theory proved by kobayashi which says that if there is no that if there is no open edge orbit on 0 by q, then there exists an element pi of the z hat q smooth, such that the dimension of this home space is infinite. Namely, the negation of the function 2q implies the negation of the function 1q, which means that this implication is always true. Thus, we have this diagram, which shows that which shows that the relationship between the function 1Q and the function 3Q is unsettled. Therefore, I want to determine the relationship between these two conditions. The following main theorems of today's my talk are partial answers for this question. The partial main theorem says that the function CQ does not imply the function Does not imply the condition of 1 Q in general. Let G be the special linear group of D2N over R, and Q, a maximal parallel subgroup of G such that 0 by Q is isomorphic to Rb2N minus 1. And suppose that N is equal to or greater than C. Then this theorem states that this real attribute subgroup H over G such that That satisfying these two conditions. The first condition is that the number of orbits is finite. The function CQ is satisfied. And the second condition is that the dimension of this home space is infinite, which implies the negation of the function 1 Q in the same way as before by using the fact that any designated police file is Any designated pre-spicy representation has finite length. Thus, in particular, this theorem states that the function 3Q does not imply the function 1 q in general. Thus, by using this theory 1, we can draw an arrow in this diagram in this way. This is the first mean theory. Then the second of main theorem says that the function 1Q implies the function of 3Q under some additional orientability assumptions. Let G be a real reactive algebraic group, H a real algebraic subgroup of Z, and Q a parabolic subgroup of Z. Then, this theorem states that if the number of orientable D-dimensional edge orbits on 0 by Q is Its orbits on zero Q is infinite. Then the dimension of the space of intertwining of betas from this designated principle C representation to the index representation on 0 by H is infinite. Here, I do not give my explanation of this notation, but I would like to note that this resonate principle representation is isomorphic to the space of differential defaults on 0 by Q as a representation. On 0 by Q as a representation of Z. This remark will be used later in the proof of this theorem 2. Moreover, this assumption of theoretical clearly implies the mediation of the points on CQ, namely, the number of orbits is infinite. Moreover, the conclusion of this remote implies the negation of the position one, two. Of the function one two in the same way as before by using the fact that any density finish by series has a finite length. Thus, this term z in particular means that the point one q implies the point of three q and thus have additional orientability assumption. Thus, by using this theorem too, we can draw an arrow in this diagram in this way. way here this triangle means that the proof of this implication requires some additional orientability assumption thus uh these two main theorems uh in uh by these two main theorems we can determine the relationship with these two conditions uh also uh one of the the proof of this this implication requires some additional assumptions excuse me what is the meaning of orientable this How about reenterable? Yeah. Previously, in the slides, you have the name or the interval. Yes. What is the meaning of that? Obviously it's oriented. Yes, but but H equivalent to orient W. Which means A preserves the oriental. I mean orientable as smooth management. Like some smart home. Yes. Okay. Okay. I see. Then I sorry, I'd like to give the stage of the proof of the main theories from now on. The key fact of the proof of these two main theorems is the characterization of interbin operators by deductible invariant distributions proved by Kobayasi and Dorothy. I would like to state it in the following form for the simplicity, but although they proved more general statement. Let G be a real deductive algebraic group, H are real algebraic subject. H are real as subgroup of Z, and Q a parabolic subgroup of Z. Moreover, suppose that tau and eta are finite-dimensional representations of H and Q, respectively. Then this theorem states that the space of intertwining operas from the resident principle representation on z over q associated eta to the induced representation on j over h associated tau is isomorphic to the the h inverse The edge-invariant subspace of the tensor product of tau and the space of distribution sections of G-equilibrium vector bundle on G over Q associated to some Q representation in Taj Ni Lo. Yeah, I also do not give an explanation of this notation in Taj Ni Law, but I would like to note that this space is isomorphic to the political data of the domain of this homospace. Of the domain of this homo space as a representation of Z. Therefore, in particular, in the case that this tau is the trivial representation of H, then this isomorphism reduces to this isomorphism. By using this isomorphism, the idea of the proof of the second-domain theorem is not difficult, so I would like to give it in the next slide. Give it in the next slide. Recall that Ptolemy says that if the number of ordin WD dimension H orbits is infinite, then the dimension of this form space is infinite. By using this isomorphism, the conclusion of zero limits is equivalent to the infinite dimensionality of the AT-variant subspace of the topological real of the domain. Topological year of the domain of this homospace. Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, this designated principle representation is axomed to the differential divorce as a space of differential divorce on G over Q. Therefore, the conclusion of Z is equivalent to the infinite dimensionality of the AT-variant subspace of the topological. Variant subspace of the topological real of the space of differential decomposes. Then, of the integration of oriented WD dimensional H orbits of differential decomposes, defines an element of this space. And the number of oriented WD dimensional H orbits is infinite from this assumption. So, these integrations define spans are infinite. Spans are infinite-dimensional subspace over this space, which means which implies the conclusion of the second domain theory. This is the idea of the proof of the second domain theory. Then I would like to also give the idea of the proof of theory one. Because that theory one says that in this setting, there is Setting that is the other direct sub h of z. Satisfying is the condition. The proof of this theorem is given by an explicit construction of H such significant conditions. Yeah, I would like to note that the proof of this second condition uses the characterization of intertenal beta. Of inter-tanny obedience by deductible invariant distributions proved by Waiusian spell. For the simplicity, I would like to give the general form H only in the case that H is equal to C. If N is equal to C, then H has this form. Yeah, I directly note that. Yeah, I'd like to note that as an abstract group, this H is the semi-direct product of the special orthogonal group of degree 2 and some four-dimensional potential groups. This is the stage of the proof of this seven mark. Moreover, I would like to add some remarks about. Add some remarks about this third one. Let GC, HC, and QC be complications of G, H, and Q. Then, by using the characterization of interdional filters by relative invariant distributions proved by Cobier and Spey, and the theory of holonomic D modules, one can prove that if the number of HC orbits on GCO by QC is finite, C is finite, then the dimension of this homospace is also finite. Thus, by using this implication, we can conclude that in the setting of this COVID, the number of H orbits on G over Q is finite by this condition, but the number of H C orbits on G C O by Q C is infinite. Because if this ladder is finite, then by Is finite, then by this implication, the dimension of this home space is also finite, which contradiction by this second function. This is the remark about this theory one and the end of the main topic of today's my talk. Now I would like to move to the second main topic, namely the relationship between the uni-home rebound data matrix property and the orbital decomposition. And the orbital decomposition for the complex number field. In the first main topic, the criterion for the finite mass specific property proved by Kobayasi and Osima plays a fundamental role. In fact, they also prove the criterion for the uniformly banded mass specific property, which I would like to give in the next slide. Let G be a Y are reactive at the back group and H Attendee group and H are the other aspect subgroup of G. Moreover, let G C H C be complications of G and H respectively. And finally, let V be a volume subgroup of V C. In this setting, Obi-LC and OCMA service the criterion for the uniformly valid mass specific properties of integer representation on 0 by H. The criterion says that the following The criterion says that the following three conditions are equivalent. The first condition is a supremum of the dimensions of the space of interdional betas from phi to the induced representation on 0 by h associated tau divided by the dimension of tau is finite, where the supreme valence of all elements by tau over 0 times h at f. Therefore, this first condition This first condition means that the induced representation on G over H has a uniformly bounded matrix property as a representation of G. And the second condition is the specificity of GC over HC, namely the existence of an open B orbit on GC over HC, which is equivalent to the existence of an HC orbit on the paradigm GC over B. Moreover, this second condition is also equivalent to the CB. position is also equivalent to the following another position namely and the phi c over g c over c is equivalent to the finiteness of the number of b orbits on g c over c which is also equivalent to the finiteness of the number of h c orbits on g c over b therefore by these uh two several names we have an equivalence of these three conditions therefore as in the real number field case As in the real number field case, this equivalence inspires us that what will happen in this relationship if we replace this B with a general parallel subject. More precisely, as in the real number field case, I'd like to define a variant of these conditions, and then I'd like to invest in the relationship between such conditions. Conditions. But precisely, I just define the following three conditions. The function 1q is defined by the finiteness of the supremum of the dimension of this form space divided by the dimension of tau, where the supremum runs of our element by tau of g hat q similar times h hat a. The function 3 q is defined by the existence of an option qc orbit on g0 by c, which is equivalent to the By C, which is equivalent to the existence of a HC orbit on GC over QC. And the condition CQ is defined by the finiteness of the number of QC orbits on GC over HC, which is equivalent to the finiteness of the number of HC orbits on GC over QC. Then I direct invest the relationship among these three conditions. In this formulation, there is some easy relationship among these three conditions. relationship among these three conditions as in the real number field case namely uh the condition cq is always uh point of cq always implies a position cq uh by the bail category zero however the conversation uh has an easy counter example uh in fact uh the same example as in the real number field case is sufficient uh recall that in such settings these are the linear Such setting, G is a general linear group of degree C over R, and Q is a maximal parallel subvert of G having this form, and H is a closed subverb of G having this form. Then in this setting, G C over Q C is atomic to the 20 meter complex projected space, CP2, and in the calculation shows that that is an open edge orbit on the G over QC. Namely, the point Q is satisfied. Point on 3Q is satisfied, but the number of HCO bits on GCO by QC is infinite. Namely, the point of 3Q is not satisfied, which means that this implication is not always true in general. However, as in the real number field case, the same example is also a counter example to this implication. In fact, as mentioned, In fact, as mentioned earlier, in this setting, there is an element phi of the hatred smooth, such that the dimension of this common space is infinite, which clearly implies the negation of the function 1q, because this infinite dimensionality clearly implies this supremum infinite. However, for the formal simplification, by using the fact proved by By using the fact proved by Boyle Shi, which was introduced in the real number field case, one can prove that this implication is always true. Therefore, as in the real number field case, as we have this diagram, it shows that the relationship between the function 1Q and the point 3Q is unsettled. Then, I like to determine the relationship between these two conditions. Conditions. The third main theorem of this is my talk is a function answer for this question. In order to formulate the third main theorem precisely, I'd like to introduce the following another function. The function 1q prime is defined by the finiteness of the suprema of the dimension of the Of the dimensions of the space of intertwining operators from the designated point space's representation on geophysical Q associated eta to the induced representation on geoph associate tau divided by the dimension of the tensor product of eta and tau. Then the supremum range of our elements eta tau of q hat x times h of f. Therefore, it seems that this function one q prime function one q plane is similar to the function one q but that is two different points the first defined point is the domain of this homospace in the function one q the domain is an element of pi over g half q smooth but in the function one q prime the domain is a definite point by this representation and the second defined point is a value of the denominator the denominator. In the point of 1Q, the denominator is the dimension of tau, but in the point of 1Q time, the denominator is the dimension of the tensor product of eta and tau. Moreover, the relationship between the function 1Q and the function 1q prime is the following. One can prove that the function 1q always implies the function 1q prime by using the fact that the length Using the fact that the lengths of the resonant pinch by shield representations are uniformly valid. Moreover, the conversion implication is not always true in general. In fact, that's a counter example to this implication. By using this weak condition, the statement of the third domain theorem is that the condition CQ implies the condition one cube prime. implies the policy of one cube frame. Namely, the finiteness of the number of orbits implies some uniformly valid multiplicity of the index representation on 08. This is a sort of main theorem that is my talk. Then for the proof of this theorem 3, I only mention about the methods used in the proof of this theorem 3. We call that this homospace is isomer to the space of detectable invariant distribution on G over Q by the part proved by S and space. Then it is sufficient to prove the uniformly uniform validness of the dimension of this space. Then for the proof of such uniformly boundedness, I use a theory of chronometric demodules. Series of phononomic D module by constructing some phononomic D module such that the uniformity uniform boundedness of the dimensions of the solution spaces of such phononomic D modules implies the uniformity boundedness of the dimensions of this space. Then, for the proof of the uniformity boundedness of the dimensions of the solution spaces of such economic D modules, I use I use the filtration by supports of solutions and the theory of multi-species of holonomic demodules. These are the methods used in the proof of this third three. Then finally, I would like to mention about the related research of this third three. First, that's the previous The previous research include Isenbert, Coribid, and the mean senko. They also proved some uniharmony bounded mass specific property of induced representations from the assumption that the number of orbits is finite. In the proof, they use the theory of algebraic PD modules. Therefore, the method of the proof of The method of the proof of the result is different from that of this theorem 3 because I use mainly the theory of analytic G modules in the truth of this theorem 3. Therefore, the conclusions of the result is also different from this theorem 3. Second, that's the result produced by Kitagawa. By Kitagawa. One of the main differences of his result and this is that his result is applicable in the case that the domain of this homospace is a composition factor of the designate bench bias representation. Although this theorem 3 is only applicable in the case that the domain of this home space is a designate bench biases representation itself. Finally, the Finally, that's the result proved by Hobayasi, which obtained a stronger result of this COVID-3 by using a method called QP estimate. These are related researches of this COVID-3. This is the end of the second of main topic, and also the end of this my talk. Thank you for listening. Would you expect the inverse statement for CRM3 to hold implication from IQ prime to 3Q? I yes, I wish that. I wish that the composite implication is also true, but I have no idea of the proof. The difficult point is the same over this implication that this implication requires orientability. Because If we can construct some intertwining beta attached to some orbit, then if the number of orbits over the complex number is, then I can prove that. That the dimension of distribution supported such orbits is infinite. But there is no such distribution, then my proof does not work. That is quite the point that this proof requires some orientability assumption. I see. So maybe just. I see. So maybe just implication from IQ prime to 2Q. I think that such deletion is easy, but I Sorry, I can not answer enough. Thank you. Do you have another question? I have a small question. You have worked with the real setting and the complex setting, and it seems that It seems that the hypothesis of the number of orbit, the finiteness of orbit in the complex setting, is a stronger statement. Is it always a stronger statement than the finiteness of in the real? I mean, you switch you in the complex setting. Does it imply you switch you in the real setting? Yes, in the artifact, this condition implies this condition by using the failure. On this out by using the failure to gun out of C. Okay, thank you.
