I would like to report on this project. It's not yet out, so I'm calling it Work in Progress with these people right here. That's Jacine and Lasus, Paul Helming, Facebook Salsa, and Claudia Ye. And this project is mainly about studying the topology of a certain tropical moduli space. And maybe to get you started on what the moduli space is, let me first give you the algebraic role model. Let me first give you the algebraic role model. So it's Deline and Mumford in their 69 paper gave us the moduli space, which I'm writing as MG, and then I put my favorite group, which is a cyclic group of prime order. And this is supposed to be the modularized space. And this is supposed to be a modernized space parametrizing covers of curves. So there is covers C tilde to C, both C tilde and C being smooth curves. And the map in between them is supposed to be a tau such that the Galois group of the cover is set of P sat and the Oh, and the genus of C is the genus from the index. So this is just saying that I'm looking at a modified space of etal covers of curves such that the covering arises by a set of piecemeal action of the covering upstairs as the quotient point. That's the kind of objects that lithium is modularized based and maybe as a first motivation while this The first motivation: why this moduli space is a nice space to study. Let me give you some basic properties. So, this is a smooth and finite cover, finite etal cover of Mg. So, I guess if you like MG, which I think everybody here does, then that is hopefully already an indication. And that is hopefully already an indication of why this is an interesting space, but there will be more motivation later on. So, what am I going to talk about today is the following agenda. So, as a first step, what I want to do is I want to define a tropical analog for this moduli space. For this moduli space, then it's going to be the guy in the title, right? That segmentation, just the drop of the superscript. Then, after I showed you the star of our show, then I will give you some more motivation and maybe give more ideas of why we're studying that specific modernized space. And maybe spoiler alert, it's going to be about top weight co-models. Top weight cohomology. And step three, I will show you our results on the topology of the tropical modular space. So that's the plan for today. Okay, and because I will certainly not say that all that often anymore, let me just All that often anymore. Let me just put it here on the board once and for all. Whenever there's a lowercase p, that it's a prime number for the record. Okay, so let's get started with part one: a tropical version. So maybe as the first thing, just to get everybody on the same page, let me say a tropical curve is, for me, in the context of this talk and most other talks I give, is a triple consisting of Consisting of some G, some W and some L, where G is a finite graph. W is the so-called vertex genus function, which is a function that assigns the vertices of G a non-negative integer, the vertex genus. And finally, L is a function assigning the edges some positive real length. So this is the edge length function. So in total we see a finite metric graph together with some vertex widths. So shorthand it's the letter gamma. And when I think it already came up in some other talk this week, so when I speak of the genus of a tropical curve gamma, then what I mean is the first Betty number of the graph to capture kind of the genus that you can see by looking at the topology of the curve itself. Plus the additional genus that comes from these vertex genera. So that's the genus. Okay, and again, I hope most people have seen this at least a couple of times. If this is your setup, then you can put all tropical curves of a fixed genus into some sort of genus into some sort of a moduli space. So let me just say this very vaguely. There is a moduli space which I guess you should call Mg tropical that parametrizes all tropical curves of fixed genus and that that space has been constructed by many people in many different categories for many different purposes. For many different purposes. Okay. So that's kind of the base notion. So just like the algebraic space that I was using here for motivation, just like this thing covers Mg, I want to do something on top of this basic notion now, which is covers. So next definition, what is my tropical analog of an etal cover? Well, let me say a tropical cover, or maybe you would also want to call this a tropical purpose cover. Is a well, first of all, it's got to be a morphism of underlying graphs. So I'm just going to write gamma tilde into gamma pi such that now it has to satisfy some properties to qualify as a cover. And the two properties that it has to satisfy is first pipe is harmonic. Harmonic and second it satisfies the local Riemann-Hobitz condition. Okay, so maybe some. So, maybe some people in the room know what these two things mean. For those who don't, let me just explain this in a bit, in a few more words. Harmonicity already came up in Renssela's talk. So let me just say harmonic means that the following function, d, that takes edges of the covering, gambler tilde, and assigns them a An integer by doing the following thing, namely you take e tilde, an edge, and you look at the quotient of the length of its image under pi divided by the length of e tilde. That function has to be useful in some sense, but let me state that already here explicitly the first condition is applied by requiring the quotient to be an integer. This is not automatic, this is first condition. First condition rather implicitly. But if that is satisfied, then that function should give a well-defined notion of degree at every vertex. So, Renzo already explained this to us as some sort of a balancing thing. So, if you have a vertex in gamma tilde that maps down to a vertex in gamma, and now you have possible directions from which you can enter that vertex, then what you can do is over each of those directions, you can look at all the edges coming into the upstairs vertex. Vertex. Each of those edges up here has a d-value, a dilation factor, that's what it's called. And basically, the sum of the dilation factors coming from one direction or from the other has to be the same. So let's say the dilation factors here are 1, 1, 1 everywhere. Then on the other side, you also have these 1, 2, 3 in some way or another. So maybe it's like 2 and 1. And for me, what is maybe a bit different from what Rensselaer explained? Maybe a bit different from what Rensselaer explained. I think for Rensselaer, there were only two directions in which you can enter the vertex. For me, this is a vertex in some metric graph, so there can be many directions in which you can enter it. So more than two. So that is harmonicity. And the second part over here was this local Imam-Puritz condition. Just put this up here. What that means is that What that means is that at so for a vertex V tilde in, well, I guess the vertices of the upstairs curve, the local Riemann-Hovitz equation at that vertex reads as, well, pretty much what you expect: the Riemann-Hovitz equation with vertex genus. With vertex genus as a proxy for genus times the genus of the image minus two plus, and now comes something that's supposed to mimic the ramification divisor. So that would be some overall edges that contain the vertex m tilde. And you do And you do quite small path. That is translating Riemann Hogan's equation into this tropical setting. And yeah, just if you have harmonicity, that is not yet automatically satisfying in my bubbles. It's something that you have to impose additionally. And that's something I want to be included in the notion of The vertices cannot be vertices. Yes. Vertices match to vertices and edges to edges. Right. So harmonic means finite, also? Yes. Yes. Finite. Yeah, I guess you can take this again as an implicit statement when I write this quotient, the batch lengths you suppose. So this is basically my tropical analog of an unramified cover. And maybe let me state here again as a fact. Now if you fix all the discrete parameters, then again the tropical objects fit into a modernized space. Fit into a moduli space. There is a moduli space. You know, that's something like age, genus of the target, degree, and of course we want it to be tropical. And that is, well let me just credit Renzo, Hannah, and Ruth here. Alright, so again, you can set up a moduli space to parametrize objects. And what I think about when I want to get towards the moduli space of these cyclic covers is essentially a modification of that by imposing additionally that my cover That my covers are supposed to come from a group action on the source. So let me just write this as a definition, which I guess I should credit Joaf, Martin and Dimitri for this. So 19 is when you put the first problem in arcade. put the first draft in archive. So when I write mgZ mod PZ tropical, what I mean is a space parametrizing covers of tropical curves, calling them pi, such that upstairs on gamma tilde you have a group action, pi set mod p set, and such that the map pi, the covering, is really Covering is really the quotient module piece. So I'm just putting it as a set like this, but I think you can agree that the continuous parameters given by the edge lengths of the target make this into a reasonable topological space. That also comes with a cellular structure given by the discrete data. By the discrete data of the underlying graphs. It's kind of the idea. Suppose we want the pi to have degree p. Yes, yeah, I mean, right. So I guess if I declare this action up here to be action be free? Yes. Well, I mean, no, no, it. No, not every. No, not everywhere. So basically, I want in every fiber you have essentially two options. Either you have a point downstairs with points covering it, or the other option being you have a point downstairs and only a single pre-image, which then has degree P. And so these are supposed to be point-wise or two options. At this point, you could P could not necessarily make this definition for more than these two options, but it's yeah, exactly. I mean, up until now, like, it was not necessary to restrict to this private cyclic group. You could use random finite group, in fact. And I mean, also in this paper, they give the definition and set up some basic terminology for any finite group P, but the primary. Could be, but prime segment will become important later on. But these two condition constructions are, I suppose, compatible with each other, right? I mean, you're going to embed this modelized basis of CP covers into the other one? No, it does not embed. And the reason is rather subtle because, you know, I'm writing this moduli space, but what I mean is, of course, up to isomorphism space parametrize. Isomorphism, space paragraph rising these objects up to isomorphism. And what I want to use as a definition for isomorphism is commutative squares where the horizontal maps are isomorphism. And I want this top map here to be Top and appear to be equivariant, so cell one P cell equivariant. Actually specified. The action is part of the data here. But essentially what you do, if you ask isomorphisms to be equivariant, then you start to see a funny phenomenon. Namely if you imagine you have downstairs a tropical curve that has like a cyclop, like a loop. Like a cyclop, like a loop, like so. And now you do a free cover where you're P to 1 everywhere. And you have different options for how you can do it. For example, you can have kind of a spiral pattern where going around takes you up by one step, or you can have a pattern where going around the spiral once takes you up two steps. Takes you up two steps. And these are two non-isomorphic set modp set covers of the cycle. Even though, as Kuvin's covers, where you do not have a group action, you would identify the two. So again, this space is not a subset of tropical homicides space, it is a kind of similar but not related space. Can I ask about this exactly when it's done? Are the previous somehow legal or what it's prevented probably shouldn't? So the fiber over this vertex is um a p element set. We do not have a canonical identification with z1 p set, but it is a z1 p set force. But it is a Zmod P set torso. Meaning that if you declare this vertex to be your starting point, then the Zmod Pzep torso structure tells you which one is the next one. So you cannot label them, but you can say how many steps do I go up by going around the spiral ones? Maybe they're looking up to a signal. Yes, yeah. Yeah. I'm not what I'm confused about. If they're not labelled say again, if they're not labelled, how do we know those? They're cyclically there. They're cyclically labeled. So you don't know which of them is number one, but if you have one, you know which one is the next. And that's enough to kind of define the ascent of the spiral, like what happens if you go around once. Happens if you go around once, but it doesn't define a canonical starting point for the problem. Actually, this phenomenon already appears in the classical species of missile covers exactly in the same form. Well, since I read that paper, is this Is this all the dot the tropicalization of the space of Z multiplied map, yes, but that tropicalization map is not identified with the retraction from the Berkeley skeleton, not in general for I mean, this is something I will mention in a moment. So, can I ask these two conditions? I mean, the degree of high is P, does this imply that all the edges have way one? Like, all of the. So, if you're in a situation where you have an edge downstairs that is covered by P edges upstairs, then all of them have dilation factor one. So, you don't require that this. So, you don't require that this action is kind of free away from the vertices or anything like that? No, I don't. I mean, I can have this P21 situation over edges and over vertices, and I can have the dilated situation over edges or vertices. Stabilizer isn't zero-dimensional, but there's actually a lot of things. The set that is local. Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah, let's think slow. So yeah, so maybe to give you some idea about this, I brought you a picture of this moduli space for small values of... Well, so I'm going to show you a picture with g equals 2 and p equals 3 to give some life to this. So here we go. So this is an example of a moduli space of this kind. So what we're looking at is well okay, it's it's not it's not the moduli space, it is like the the height one cut through it. The height one cut through it because the moduli space where the genus 2 in the target is like a three-dimensional cone complex. So I'm cutting it at height one, and what I'm left with is kind of a two-dimensional simplicial complex. And what I did here for you is I labeled all the top-dimensional cells with the combinatorial type of the upstairs curve covering. The covering morphism itself is given by projecting it down vertically. By projecting it down vertically, but including the targets as well as kind of overclottering the picture. So, what we see here is certainly definitely some examples. So, for example, here we see a cover, like a 3-to-1 cover of the dumbbell graph that is kind of of a mixed type, right? You have like on the left, you have like a loop in the vertex where you have only a single pre-image, and on the right, you are actually a topological 3-to-1 cover. You can have these sorts of things, these sorts of things. These sorts of things, these sorts of phenomena. Do you label the edges of only one primitive instead of three and how we distinguish them? Well, I mean, if you're given the covering, you can just find that subgraph of the target where you only have a single green mesh. For me, the covering morphism is the data that I'm parameterizing. Morphism is the data that I'm parametrizing. Meaning, is this a picture of the space you told us about, or is it the image in the Harvard space? This is the picture I told you about. Actually, it's always one up, going one up. Yes, yes. So you're asking: is there codes where we see the difference of the different spirals? And the answer is. Spirals and the answer is sadly not because t is too small of a number, like p equals three is too small of a number. So starting from t equals five, you would see it, but then my drawing skills are insufficient. So I will actually return to the picture later on, but for now let me give you a bit more motivation because I promised some perspective to what's top weight. us some perspective towards top weight comology which will also motivate more why we're studying the specific space. So okay, let me be rather brief about this because I am not an expert. I'm not an expert on topweight cohomology or anything of the sorts. There's other people here in this room that know much more about this than me, but let me give you the idea. So if you have X, a smooth separated building Mumford stack then Then what you can do is if you look at a compactification, and let's say this is a toroidal compactification, which means that there is a dual boundary complex. Calling it delta. So there's a dual boundary complex that is essentially a combinatorial object that encodes all the various boundary divisors in this compactification meet. So, in a situation like this, then there is a There is a fact that if you look at the top great piece with respect to the weight filtration of the cohomology of non-compactified space X with respect to rational coefficients, then this is actually the same as the reduced homology of the total complex. The total boundary complex when you think of it as a topological space, as a simplicial topological space. So, again, I'm not an expert to tell you why the weight filtration is an amazing gadget. Maybe if you're as uneducated as me, you might appreciate the statement that this graded piece of this collomology here is something that the actual cohomology Sojects onto. So, maybe as a piece of motivation, if you're able to compute this reduced rational homology of the simplicial topological space, then that gives you at least the lower bound oncohomology of a smooth separated Devin-Mumford stack, which I think can be called a reduction stack. So that is kind of a very nice idea. A very nice idea, but now you can take this nice idea even further. So for let me, okay, this is very weak for now. So for X, a nice moduli space, sometimes, if you're lucky, the dual boundary complex. The dual boundary complex delta of certain compactifications can be thought of as tropical moduli spaces, which is something that I think of as yet another reduction. Think of it as yet another reduction step, right? Because here you're stuck with the problem of computing like a homology of a certain simplicial complex, but maybe that simplical complex is something that is kind of hard to write down or hard to understand the cellular structure of. But if you're like super duper lucky and you can identify all the tropical modules space, then this full boundary complex itself already has very connected. Complex itself already has very concrete geographic meaning because now the points and the strata and the cells can be thought of as tropical objects. So let me just say that this is something that was successfully used to run the entire pipeline and actually derive insight over here in some cases. So as examples, if you take x to Samples, if you take X to be MgN, then we have the work by Melanie Chan, Sylvan Galatius and Sam Pain. And I'm just going to put both the 21 and the 22 paper. And this is also the work that has kind of tied into this approach to. That has kind of pioneered this approach towards deriving insights into cohomology of moduli spaces through this pipeline and effectively, in the end, through doing topology of tropical moduli spaces. But it has also been used by other people to get similar insight into moduli space of a pedian varieties. So that is Brent, Chan. Chan no sorry Bruce Chan Melo Moorland and Wolf and the archive here is 20 but of course this paper was published right it's just that this one is out published here and second one is archived here Okay, so I I guess what I want to say is that for nice moduli spaces, this is an interesting pipeline to run. And now you could ask, okay, so what about Hurbit space? Because Herbert space is a nice moduli space, so why not try and run the same pipeline? But the problem is it does not work because Hobbit space is, at least for that perspective, not Not nice enough because, well, you see, if you well, it's getting even worse because you're putting your name onto it. So you do have a map from the dual boundary complex. Of homes space to the tropical homit space. And that specific map was provided by Renzo-Heinlein Group. So there is a map, but the problem is that this map is neither injective nor surjective, meaning you can't really pass from the homo. From the homology of the total boundary complex to the homology of the tropical modularized space. The math is that this is admissible covers on the admissible cover convectification. And even if the genus of the base is zero? Yeah, even for genus zero. Yeah, even for genus zero it doesn't work. So what is the can you say what is the image of the map? No, I mean that's that's Hovi's existence problem. That's complicated. It's totally elementary. In terms of Hovi's existence problem, like the fact that we don't know the answer. Yeah. But just take a bunch of like convex classes where you Context classes that give you like data that satisfies the Riemann Herbert's conditions, and you could expect software worth of covers with that data. It's not guaranteed that it exists that S4, you take two three cycles and a two-two cycle of normal representation. So, probably, you don't know, you're going to get some kind of object there, but that's not the image. So your point is that I'm really sure that we're covers, but admissible as end covers. And then it would work. Think of that as gun-wise and covers? I mean, and end cover is the same as a SN cover modulo SN minus one, but then you Felix's point is still not injection. But I think if we discuss it, we're going to sidetrack you and start with some chat over here. Yeah. So, okay, I mean, I was actually about to add on to this. So, okay, like with COVID space itself, you cannot run the pipeline in the same way. But the reason why we are studying this space of prime. The space of Prime Cyclic Pulvitz covers is actually that there is some upcoming work by one of my co-authors, Petro Sosa, who shows that for the moduli space of prime cyclic covers, this map up here is injective. up here is injected which is already much better than for the general bullet space but it becomes even better because what remains is to describe the image right if you can describe the image then you're back in business and this is something one can do So let's say plus it continues, we can describe the image which I guess in tropical geometry we call a situation like that, where t the tropicalization map is not subjective. Is not subjective, and we want to have a criterion to describe the image, we typically call this a realizability problem. So what I'm saying here is that the realizability problem for prime six equivalence covers can be solved as follows. Namely, if you have a cover, then what you do is you first extract the graph that Renzo was. First, extract the graph that Renzo was alluding to. So define the dilation subgraph, which I'm going to call gamma subscript fill, which is the subgraph of the target, so it's all points in the target gamma, such that the map has fiber of Has fiber of size one over the point. This is a subgraph, not necessarily connected, it's just a subgraph. So that's a dilation subgraph. And with that definition, we can then say like the tropical hook that's covered high is in the image of Of this net star if and only if there exists a balanced flow on the dilation subgraph taking values. Taking values in set or p set units, whatsoever. Orienting the graphics somehow? Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, like one of my favorite set of reset covers is this guy, right? So the dilation subgraph is Is the loop here on the left with the vertex where it's rooted because that's where you have single pre-image. And now, if you want to study if this guy is realizable, what you have to do is, like you said, you orient every edge in the dilation subgraph, and now you have to see if you can find a flow with values in set mod3 set, but not zero, such that at every vertex the entirety of the incoming quantity is equal to. The incoming quantity is equal to the outflowing quantity. Which in this case is rather easy because it's just a cycle. You can prescribe any flow value. So let's say you put a flow of one, then that flow certifies realizability of its colour. So yeah. Okay, so so what is the upshot? Um we we have some we have some uncertainty here, okay? We have some uncertainty here, okay, but that's kind of where motivation is just motivation and not application. But if we wait a little while and we'll finish the SIL project and combine this with this realizability criterion, then any statements that you can make on the topology of the tropical moduli space that I'm working with, that statement will lift to a statement on topoic homology of an algebraic. Topic homology of an algebraic modulus. Is it easy to see where it is? I'm not sure. So this essentially comes from the like if you go into the work of Amini, Baker, Bogali and Where they study the essentially what they study is the realizability of harmonic maths. And if you go into their work and you trace out how they do it, then you can find that this criterion is more or less a byproduct. But I'm not sure I can give you a conceptual reason of why you could see this without studying that paper. Yeah. So Johan and it's So Johan and its band have this dilated homology construction. What is the uniqueness statement from that point of view? Is it saying that there's basically one class? Because I mean these covers are supposed to be in bijection with like H1 of their homology groups. That's a good question. I guess that's why, yeah, I will speak about that before that. So that's motivation. Now, let me get to the final part: results. Okay, for this part, meaning the actual work, we essentially followed the leading example of chanceratius and centen. So what we did is first we came up with a technical result which I can think of as a reduction step. So this is due to us, which says that the Following locus in the moduli space is contractible. So I'm going to write this now, but the core idea is not so much that this locus is interesting per se, but rather this locus is interesting because every Locus is interesting because everything that's in there can be discarded for the sake of homology computations. So, let me describe what we were able to find. So, it's the locus of all covers such that one of the following properties holds. So, one thing that takes you into this locus is if there exists a loop edge on the target such that Such that the fiber is P many loop patches upstairs. Or another thing that would automatically place you in this locus is if there exists an edge E in the target. E in the target such that the fighter if there exists an edge and a target and a connected component gamma naught in gamma remove the edge E such that Such that the fiber over that component gamma naught is P copies of gamma naught. Where another criterion that could place you into this locus is if there exists a pair of parallel edges E1 and E2 again in the target such that I think you can guess it, such that the pre-image is P pairs of parallel edges. Um yeah like two vertices connected by two edges parallel means they intersect twice exactly. UCU has already been thousand a conference. So to make this even more interesting we can take a cold fire. Can take a cold trial. Felix, this is or, right? Yeah, this is or. Okay, so I guess what I'm trying to say is this locus contains some stuff. So all that stuff that is in that locus can be discarded for all further computations or attempts to compute homology. A single cover with all three of those. A single cover with all three of those, or without any one of those? If any of this happens, then you're inside that local. Yes, I will finish the results and then I'll show you more pictures. But are the individual so if I look at one of these three loci on its own, is that contractible? Or do I really have to take a union to get something contractible? That's something contractible. So that thing in itself is contractible, that thing union, that thing is contractible, and then all three together are contractible. And I mean in our draft we are even doing even finer steps in between. I mean this thing is built inductively in this way. We started with one property and we added on to it. Okay, so that's a reduction step. So that's a reduction step. Now, for an application you can do to us. So for all genus at least 2, which is the range in which our moduli space is defined, for genus L and 2, it's empty. And any P prime the moduli space is simply connected. And let me give you like a couple of words on the idea of how this works. We don't. That our modulus fits and gz not PZ problem idea The idea is to is two things so observation number one pi one of the moduli space Is generated by cycles ported on the long skeleton. So that already is a good reduction step. Is a good reduction step because it tells you that you only have to study things which are supported on a very much reduced set of possible combinatorial types. One skeleton here means one skeleton of the slice. Of the slice, yes. So one skeleton is a set of covers such that the target has at most two edges. That's the slice. That's the first observation and the second observation is our reduction step over here. Namely, if you think, for example, if you have a cover, it's like some graph and it has a loop sticking out. And let's say this guy is covered by some graph with a bunch of loops over that loop. And that thing lives in. And that thing lives inside the contractible locus. Let me call it C for reference. So that thing is in C. Now what you can do is you can continuously contract that loop into a single vertex. So what you end up with is like one vertex here that has genus 1, vertex genus 1, and upstairs it looks similar. You have bunch of vertices. You have one of vertices, all of which have genus 1. I define C to be closed, meaning this guy is in C as well. And where this gets us is that essentially everything where you see a lot of vertex genus in the fiber is automatically irrelevant. Meaning there's no non-trivial cycle supported on anything that has positive vertex genes. Has positive vertex genus. But now, if you combine these two observations, for genus G at least 4, this basically means that there cannot be any non-trivial cycles, just because you don't have enough space to put all that vertex genus. You're going to be in the contractable locus. And below that threshold, there's finitely many cases where you can just eyeball the moduli space and come up with more to piece. Come up with multiple genes. But when you say vertex genus, you mean every in the target. I mean what you have to look at is a vertex and the fiber over that vertex and see how much genus is there. If there is genus at least P in the fiber upstairs, then you can bubble off these loops and that places you into the contracted modus. But it does allow some. But it does allow some ramification over and over. Yeah, yeah, I mean like similar argument applied to a different situation is basically when you have a single dilated vertex where you have up here the genus at least P, then that is also in the contractible locus. I hope this is already a nice illustration of how this reduction step actually works. Of how this reduction step actually reduces things. So let me end with some more computational results. So theorem get due to us. So I will now fix genus to be 2, meaning dimension is 2 and dimension of the slides again, right? And then we can do the following, so we can look at prime being 2, 3, or 5, in which case the space The space for M2 set or P set is contractible, but for P at least seven, it's no longer contractible. Instead, it is homotopy It is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres and more specifically to a wedge of 1 over 12 times p minus 1 times p minus 5 spheres. At least seven. Because it's a result for all P. And sphere he means circle. Sphere means a two-sphere, like an S2. The two-dimensional space. Ah yeah, it's never So one last time, picture time. This is our moduli space in genus equal to 2 and p equals 3. So I hope you can visually identify that the space is just like I put into the theorem, contractible. Okay. So that's basically to identify things, don't you? You still need to identify things, don't you have to send us? No, that space is already showing everything up to isomorphism. So it's more technical images. That's exactly the thing. So some of these cells have symmetries. For example, you've got this cover of the Dumbbell graph that has kind of this reflectional symmetry. Which means the two simplex that parametrizes these past covers is folded due to this symmetry. And that's what you see by having no edge over here. Edge over here. There is no combinatorial type over here because that's the fault. I rethink it as being compatible. I mean it's glued unto itself, right? Oh, it's like a too simplex modulo the reflectioner. So that does not introduce a pocket. What are the posts for the black faces that have two edges that were that are going back higher than the south? Like the black triangles. So it's yeah, it's just that this is like somewhat three-dimensional. I mean, we have like this triangle in the back that connects to the red edge here, but it's not intersecting with this triangle in the front. It's like two sheets. We were shading the ones in the back, the darker. So also there's like a a triangle in the back that's over here, right? I think you were asking about the action. It's an S three action. It's an S three action on the triangle. It's an S3 action on the triangle. Oh, so you're asking about the folding. Yes, this guy has an automorphism group of S3, so it's like a triangle folded along all possible symmetries. So there is no edge up here, there is no edge along this direction. It only has one edge, which is the red one. Yeah, that's right. Okay. So some more pictures. Here's the realizability logo. Here's the realizability locus shaded in red. And you can see it's in this case it's almost everything. There's only one triangle down here with three combinatorial types that are not realizable. Meaning in genus 2, this realizability issue is not a problem at all because the non-realizable stuff literally contracts off to the rest of the moduli space. There is no topology here. That's for all P. That is for all P, which is exactly the thing I wanted to say next, because we discussed earlier that in higher P, you have different options for, if you go around a cyclone, if you like a spiral, you have different combinatorial types for these spirals. But what you notice here is that in this part of the of the moduli space, Of the moduli space, you are looking at things that are heavily dilated. There is no spirals up here, but instead the cycles are all covered by a single dilated edge. Meaning that if I think of the moduli space for hydro P, in that part there is not going to be any additional combinatorial complexity. That part is really fixed. And if you look even a bit more closely, Bit more closely. Let me show this first. So the part that is actually independent when you go up in the prime is kind of this left-hand side of the moduli state. And that part should be the same for all p. And the combinatorial complexity is only really introduced here on the right-hand side. So on this slide, I'm On this slide, I'm showing you our contractible complex, our sub-complex, in that specific space. It is maybe not impressively huge, but it gets bigger as P grows because there is the spiral where you will see more combinatorial types in higher P. And also it will grow bigger as you see higher genus because then there's going to be more of those codes. So, finally, let me give you a So finally, let me give you a heuristic on why is there a wedge of spheres in dimension 2. And that is essentially because, well, that part of the moduli space doesn't matter. That part of the moduli space stays the same for all p and it happens to be contracted of all. So if you remove those two parts, what you find is that in genus 2, as you go up in p, all combinatorial complexity is limited to Is limited to only three kinds of covers. I'm saying kinds, not three covers, because each of them has a spiral somewhere, and that's combinatorial complexity. So for our computational result, all we had to do is to enumerate these things for MEP and figure out the topology that that subcomplex gives you. And that is something you can do, and that's how you find a virtual structure. You can do, and that's how you find a virtual spheres. I think I have to stop now. Questions? So earlier you touched briefly on why Z mod PZ per P time is special. And so I understand that all things may go wrong if you change a P switch stack or something else. Switch that for something else, but I'm curious: can you say if any parts of the calculation or instructions work or is replaced by, say, an abelian group? Even like Cp cross C P maybe? Yeah, so I mean we originally restricted to the prime cyclic groups because of that upcoming work by Petro Sosa. Because this injectivity of the map from the boundary complex to tropical moduli space is something that he got out of his ideas. Of his ideas for these parameters. So, for more general groups, I believe he has ideas, but again, this is work in progress. As in the actual computations that we did, for more general groups, combinatorial complexity is going to be much higher because you have more than two options for the fiber, right? It's more than just one point or P points. You can look at CMIP. points. You can look at C mod p squared. Yeah, surely the logical next place to look at, but I am very worried that that already might be combinatorially so complicated that it's hard to do explicit computations. How about so one traditional reason for studying these species in the first place was the pre-melt for any p. So if you tropicalize uh the pre-mel, you have The pre-mat, you have tropical MgZ mapping, the tropical old amphibian varieties. To what extent can you tropicalize the pre-map itself? So there is a notion of tropical prime variety and a notion of... So this is not going to be principally polarized. Yes, that is true. And the situation there is somewhat unsatisfying. Unsatisfyingly positive because in tropical geometry, prime varieties are much more simple objects than algebraic geometry. So even when you have a non-principally polarized prime variety, you can go into the structure of the thing and manually come up with a principal polarization always, canonically. Something that I guess you cannot do in algebraic geometry. So I have a question. So so in um in the picture you showed that's uh in that small numerical case. The realized but non-realizable stuff. Realizable, the non-realizable stuff is percentage-wise, maybe kind of small. Do you think that persists? Do you think from an experience, like how eventually is my moduli space kind of ground by unrealizable things? So I mean, what what you can So, like, basically the reason why these guys are not realizable is always the same. Is always the same because the dilation subgraph has a bridge. And that prevents you from finding a balanced flow. So as soon as the dilation subgraph has a bridge, then that is an obstruction to realizability. Now it's important to say the dilation subgraph, not the target graph. And that is the reason why uh for higher genus the the non-realizable stuff will permeate much deeper into the body oxides. Deeper into the modules, at least from finding a balanced flow if you have a non-zero flow on the bridge. Yeah, I mean I don't have any other things. Remember, so the injectivity of this map in this skeleton should be more or less equivalent to all the local herbit signals that you see in the coverage 41. And so in that case, even in the Z case, it is a little bit of a minor miracle because when you're not controlling exactly you're not controlling exactly the group element that you're putting at a you're just saying oh it's going to be some one-relevance one piece of star right so um do you know about you know what what happens that makes all this I am afraid I cannot help with that. That's pitless work, yeah. Hello? Hello? Yeah. I might have an answer to this question. Who is this? This is Dimitri. Oh, Dimitri. Yeah, I'm I'm uh I'm uh tuning in on that later. So uh What's your name? Gondy. Gone. Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay. So there exists a non-zero flow as long as the graph is sufficiently connected. I think for each three, eight connected is enough. And so if you take a very, very, very large graph of a very high genus, then chances are High genus, then chances are it's also very high at the necklace. And so therefore, the cover should be realizable. Thanks. So actually, there's also one more addition I can make to that. Namely, so I just told you that bridges in the dilation graph are an obstruction to realizability. And for P at least.
