First, thanks to the organizers to invite me to give the talk here. And my talk is on the discrete decomposable distribution of GK modules. And first, we will start with notations and we will mention which problems we would like to study. And then we introduce two generalizations of symmetric pairs. One is syncretic symmetric pair, and the second one is clinical symmetric pair. Then finally, In my career, then finally, we show some applications and we offer conjecture. So, first, let's record the definition for the magnetically discrete decomposability. We start with notations. Let G be a non-compact connected simple liquid and G prime a reductive closed subgroup in G. Then we write type for the non-trivial reduced for unitary representation of G on our kerbane. representation of G on our Hilbert space because our G is always non-compact here non-G just means infinite dimensional so it is well known that the restriction of pi to G prime is decomposed as a continuous part and the discrete part so if the restriction does not contain the continuous part or equivalently if the restriction of pi to G prime decompose as a different cable they compose as a different space they are a sum of the unitary dual gg prime hat just make the unitary dual of g prime and m for pi is multiplicity of colour in pi then we say that pi is any equally discrete decomposible upon restriction to g prime and moreover if all multiplicities are finite such pi is said to be g prime and admissible uh in this morning In this morning, Professor Kobayashi just showed us the three stages of the branching law, stage A, B, C, among which stage A just started the spectrum and the multiplicities of the restriction. Hence, my topic here just focuses on stage A, that's the spectrum. Then we want to study when the restriction is discretely decomposable. So, in order to study the analytically discrete deconversible, we recall the definition of the algebraically discrete conversable. Now, first, we fix K, which is a maximal compact subgroup in G, such that the intersection of K and G prime is maximal compact in G prime. And we write G for the complication of the algebra of G. And also we write. of G and also we write G prime for the sub-algebra in G corresponding to the subgroup G prime then there is a definition for the discrete decomposer of G T module if suppose that X is a G T module then if there exists a filtration X1 X2 X3 of G prime K prime modules of finite lengths such that X is just a union of this Xn then X is said to be discrete decomposable said to be discrete decomposable as a g prime k prime model or in other words you can say that the restriction of x to g prime near algebra g prime is discrete decomposable okay so let's go back to the representation of group so if pi k is the underlying gk model of pi here pi is just a irreducible representation unit representation of group g then if the underlying gk model And if the underlying GK model is discretely decomposable as a G'K' module, then our pi is said to be algebraically discretely decomposable upon retrieving to G prime. And Professor Kovashi showed that the relation between the two versions of discrete decomposible, that is, algebraically discrete decomposible, implies that any equally discrete decomposible. And also, And also, Professor Koba Ashi described the discrete decomposible for the irreducible GK module. That is, irreducible GK module X is discrete decomposable as a G prime K prime module if and only if we can find a irreducible G prime K prime module Y, which can be embedded into X. Okay, so our initial Our initial problem is that we want to classify the triple g, g prime, pi, where g is always a simple non-compact simple group and g prime is a reductive sum. And the pi is a irreducible unit representation of g. We want to classify such triple such that the pi is any equally discrete decomposible upon restriction to g prime. So because algebraically discrete decomposible implies any equally discrete decomposible, And any typically discrete observable. Instead, we want to classify the triple G G prime type, such as a type algebraically discrete observable upon restriction to G prime. And also instead, we classify the triple G G prime X such that the irreducible G P modu X is discretely composable as a G prime K prime module. So the first step that the first step that in my talk today we want to classify first classify the Lie algebra gg prime or the le pair gg prime such that there exists at least one infinite dimensional irreducible gk module x which is discretely decomposable upon restriction okay as a g prime k prime module okay so for ks we So for case, we do not want to, for time being, we do not study arbitrary case. So we started so-called gamma symmetric pair. So first, let gamma be a finite abelian group, subgroup in the automorphism group of G. It's okay, you can let gamma be any subgroup in the automorphism group of G. But here for convenience, we just focus on the case when gamma is finite or abelian. And we write G with subscript gamma to be the subgroup of fixed points and the gamma action on G. And we fix a gamma stable maximum compact subgroup in G, which we can write K. And let G equal to K plus P with Carton decomposition. And we fix the gamma stable carton sub-algebra in K, which we divided by T. And also we fix. With t and also we fix a positive system for kt. Then we recall the definition for the maximum non-compact root beta. It is defined as follows. If g is not of Hermitian type, then P is an irreducible representation of Q via the usual adjoint action. Then in this case, we write beta for the highest weight of P. And if G is of Hermitian type, then P decompose. Hermitian types then P decomposed as two irreducible pieces. S p representation, then we may write base for the IC weight of P plus. So this is the definition for maximum non-computes. Okay, let's recall the branching problem for the match pairs, but briefly, then if gamma is a group of all the two that generated by sigma, then given the generalization of the general Rated by sigma, then G G gamma, which is also can be written as G G sigma, is nothing but a symmetric pair. Then let's recall that the classification for the symmetric pair G G gamma, such that there exists an irreducible, infinite-dimensional irreducible GP module, which is discrete decomposible amount of restriction, was completely solved by Professor Kobayashi and Oshina. Professor Kobayashi and Oshima. So let's briefly record their results first. So for this, we fix a so-called minus sigma compatible positive system for KT. And they satisfy the following two conditions. First, the T minus sigma, remember T is sigma stable, then T minus sigma is just a minus one eigen space of the action of sigma on T. T minus sigma is of the maximum dimension in K minus. In k minus sigma, okay, k minus sigma has the same meaning. And also, the non-zero or the non-zero restriction of positive loops for kt to t minus sigma forms a positive system of the restricted loot system for kt minus sigma. Okay, such a positive system we just call it minus sigma compatible. Then a result proves A result proved by Professor Koba Ashina Oshima said that if Gg sigma is a symmetropy, and if we fix a minus sigma compatible positive system, sorry, yes, positive system, then there exists an infinite-dimensional irreducible GK module which is discretely decomposable as a G sigma T sigma module if and only if sigma beta is not equal to minus beta. Remember, sigma X on the car. Sigma acts on the card down sub algebra t is induced the action on its q space, and sigma, which also is the same notation sigma. So this all in equivalently, if sigma beta is equal to minus beta, then there does not exist any infinite dimensional irreducible GK module, which is quite decomposable upon restriction. So, in this theorem, a key condition is that your positive. condition is that your positive system is minus sigma compatible. However, if we remove the assumption that the positive system is minus sigma compatible, that is we just fix arbitrary sigma stable carbon sub algebra and the positive system, then the only part of hope, that is in this theorem, if we remove the assumption that the positive system is minor sigma compatible. Is minor sigma compatible, then if there exists an infinite-dimensional irrelevable GPA module which is critically compatible upon restriction, then we can obtain that sigma beta is not equal to minus beta. Or equivalently, if sigma beta is equal to minus beta, then we can obtain that there does not exist any such GK modics. Sorry, could you please remind me what is better? Sorry? What is better? What is better? Maximum non-count package. Maximum not count loot. Thank you. Okay, so the proof, the reason why we, when we remove the assumption that this positive system is minus compiler, because that when, if once we fix a sigma stable colon sub algebra and the positive system, then if there is an infinite dimensional irreducible GK model, which is Infinite dimensional irreducible GK model, which is discretely consequent, then the projection from G to G prime, G to G sigma of the associated variety will not be contained in the nearbot comb of G sigma, but will be included in the near-potential cone of the G sigma. But if your sigma beta is equal to minus beta, one can prove that For any infinite-dimensional irreducible GP model, the projection of its associated variety is not contained in the near-point core of the G-C1. Okay, this is the key point. This is the true general idea. So we want to generalize the only part of the Professor Kobe's and Oshima's results. So we just let now we let gamma to be a single group of all the n. To be a syncretic group of all the n generated by sigma, and then gg sigma or gg gamma is n. We just call this n syncretic sigma to p then we have the similar result, but just only part. So for n single symmetry, if there exists a positive system n such that sigma x on beta n times On beta m times is equal is equal to minus beta, then we can conclude that there does not exist any infinite-dimensional irreducible GT model which is discrete deconversible upon restriction. Okay, the proof we use a similar technique as the as the symmetric pair, just use the associated variety. So sigma is communicated. Sigma is common to these carta evolution? Oh no, sigma, sigma is not a cartoon evolution. Sigma is just an automorphism in the of all the end. Yes, obviously, obviously, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So we show examples to, we give examples to show. We give an example to show that this result gives us a rich family of n-syncretic symmetric pairs, which does not satisfy the discrete decomposable branch law. So let's consider G, which is equal to SL over C, okay, R plus S plus T, wherefore R is T in R positive integers. And we let sigma to be an automorphism. must be the automorphism of G, which is given by the adjoint action of this matrix. This matrix where I is the identity matrix x squared minus one is the dimensional unit. Then very easily compute this automotive has all the four. Hence, g sigma forms a fourth simply the syntactic pair. And then sigma squared is evolutive of. Evolutive automotive or evolution. Then, GG, if you compute the GG sigma squared, then this is the usual symmetric pair of the SL and the SGL cross GL. Then by Professor Kobash and Oshma's classification for symmetric pairs, we know that there does not exist any infinite-dimensional use for GT module, which is discretely observable upon restriction. So, by their results, if we fix If we fix a minus sigma squared compatible positive system, we will get that sigma squared beta is equal to minus beta. Thus, by our result, then we can conclude that sigma, GG sigma, sigma, which is a four singlic symmetric pairs, does not satisfy the brand discrete observation or that is for this. The observed values for this climate are sort of sorry for this, and for single symmetric pair, there does not exist any infinite dimensional irreducible GD model, which is describing a global restriction. Okay. Now let's talk about another generalization of symmetric ps that is called applying for symmetric p. Now we consider gamma, the case when gamma is equal to the case when gamma is equal to the client force subgroup in the automotive sorry in the automotive group of g and which is generated by sigma and tor this is the unique non-cyclic group of all the four right then the g gamma is called the client force in match here and we have remarked here if one of the non-identified Of the non-identity elements in this climate for subgroup is a colon evolution, then G gamma is automatically a compact subgroup, but any GK model is discrete on the G gamma kam gamma model. Okay, so this is a trivial case. Hence, from now on, we always assume that gamma does not contain any carton evolution. Then also we fix the gamma stable carton sub-algebra and the positive system. positive system and there will there will be three cases on the maximum non-competitive beta first sigma beta is equal to minus tau beta but not equal to plus or minus beta but this of course implies that sigma tau beta is equal to minus beta and sigma beta second case sigma beta is equal to tau beta equal to mass beta of course sigma total beta is equal to beta Paul beta is equal to beta and case three sigma neither sigma beta pole beta or sigma pole beta is equal to minus beta so up to permutations on the three elements are in this current force subgroup okay that there are only the three these three cases now we we can follow case one for the first case we prove that for uh for for claim for club two For claim for two, okay. For the first case, for the first case, then we can prove that there does not exist any infinite-dimensional irreducible geometry that is this prediction, that is a G-1 k-commodity. And for the second case, for the second case, that is sigma beta is equal to beta, okay, and equal to minus beta. But in this case, this case implies that sigma top. This case implies that sigma tau beta is equal to beta. Now remember beta is the highest weight of the P of P plus. Either of them is irreducible representation. Hence, the highest weight space P beta is of one dimensional. So sigma torque X on this P beta is either identity or minus identity. So in case two, if the In case two, if the restriction, sorry, if the action of CMA core on this isoid space is identical, then we also can prove that there does not exist any dimensionally irreducible GT model, which is pretty composable. Okay, so these are two results described via the maximum non-compact loot, but these two results are not good enough because you know. Are not good enough because you know that this depends on the cardinal sub-algebra and positive system we choose. For example, if we change another card sub-algebra or another positive system, it may happen that such condition does not hold anyway. So, we want to find the so-called root-free conditions that does not depend on the maximum root of the current file algebraic function system. Sub-algebra prompting system. So, for this, we consider so-called. I know that there is another meaning for the associated symmetric pair. Other for time being, we just call the associated symmetric pairs with the client-force matrix pairs. That is, for a client-force metric pair, GG gamma, we will have it associated with three symmetric pairs, GG sigma, for the three non-identity elements in the gamma. non-identity elements in the gamma. Also, we separate the case, separate it into three cases. First, we can find some, of course, this is not identical sigma, but non-identic element sigma in gamma, such that there exists an infinite dimensionally irreducible cheating model which is discretely unusable as GC market signal model. And also we assume that you can find some. And also, we assume that you can find some toll in gamma such that there does not exist any infinite-dimensional G-GM model, which is critical. And the second case, that is, for each sigma in Paul, in gamma, we can find at least one infinite dimensional GK module, which is pretty conceptible. And the third case is that for any sigma in top, not identical, not identical, in gamma, there does not be. In gamma, there does not exist any infinite dimensional GP module, which is possible. So we have the three cases. So the three cases does not depend on the choices of cardinal sub-algebra massive system. It just depends on the properties of the symbolic pairs. The classification result of the symbolic pairs by Professor Paul Bash and also. Provides also. So, for the first case, we proved that there does not exist any even dimensional infusible GT module, which is discretely conversible upon restriction. And we give, we can find, give an example for E6 minus 14. This is the Harmonision Linear algebra of polyglot. Of all these in the case one, in the case one means we remember in case one means that we can always find at least one sigma satisfying this critical branch law and the top, which does not satisfy this condition. So there are totally five client forcing case of minus 14 case one. And also we find the eight client forcing. Eight and fourth imagine pairs for E7 by C71 in case one. Okay, so we classify the two, the case one for the two exceptional Lie algebra of machine type. Now we want to consider case two. Remember case two means that for each sigma in gamma, you can find always find such discrete gamma simple chipmodism. Now, for case two, let's first request on the Lie group of partition type or Lie algebra of coordination type. Then, if G prime contains the center of K, because G is of condition type, then K has a one-dimensional center. If G prime contains the center of K, then it is well known that any irreducible highest weight representation of G is K prime admissible and as a consequence, any irreducible highest weight. Consequence any irreducible high-throughput G-P module is critical as a G'K' module. So, in particular, in addition, if GG sigma is a symmetric pair and GGG prime continues center, then such a symmetric pair is called a symmetric pair of holomarkic time. Okay, symmetrical holomark time is easier to classify, okay? Maybe you can check the bottom state. compared to the bottom statement there's a complete list of the semantic pairs or semantic pairs of all multipliers now that's first that's directly this case now suppose g now g is a v group of Harvestian type and we demonstrate Z k the one dimensional center of the V algebra of the maximum complex subgroup and let this gamma be the Gamma is a client for subgroup. Okay, now suppose, suppose that sigma because sigma per served k is per served zk, right? Then, so sigma x on zk is either identity or minus identity. If sigma x minus one, to x minus one, then it's for the sigma toll as one. So sigma toll x. one so sigma tau x as one just means that sigma taught defines the sigma entry of polynomial type so it means that if g is a lead group of coordination type then at least one non-identity element in this climate for sub climb for subgroup gives a symmetric pair of horror model hormone type and for symmetrical of horror model type you can always find a irreducible high state model Reduce for a high state module, of course, infinite dimensional, which is discretely convergable upon restriction. So, in this case, we can conclude that for g this claim for single pair g gamma is either in the case one or case two. Okay, for also we give the example for the two exceptionally groups of Hermitian type. So So, and also we want to define so-called the holomorphic client for symmetric pair. Okay, this is just depending the definition just depends on symmetric pairs. Okay, a client for symmetric pair is called holomorphic if any symmetric pair is a form of holomorphic type for R, which is non-identifigma in gamma. Then, first, we classify all the Classify all the symmetric pairs of holomorphic types, classical symmetric pairs of holomorphic types for E6 minus 14. Okay, we'll find there are totally eight such pairs. Of course, there is all of them lies in case two, right? And also we find all the client-focused match pairs of holomorphic type for E7 minus 25 of the contribution. They are totally 10 pairs. So all of these pairs. So all of these pairs lie in case two. But if you compute the mean detail, you will find for E6 minus 14, there remains one pair, client for symmetric pair, E6 minus 14 and SO81. So there remains one client for symmetric pair, this pair. But this pair, you are fine. You will check. It belongs to case two, but it's not. Case two, but it is not holomorphic. In fact, if you compute the three associated symmetric pairs, we will find two of the root automorphisms will give the symmetric sub-algebra F4 minus 20, and one rootable automorphism will give the symmetric sub-algebra SO28 plus SO2. The displays of Holomorphic of Holomorphic type, why this is not. Why this is not. But by the classification results of symmetric pairs, you know that, okay, for these two symmetric pairs, both of the two symmetric pairs satisfy discrete decomposable branching laws, has it allowed in the case two. Now we want to determine whether this pair, client-forcing batch pair, satisfy our discrete branch law. Branch law, but it's critical of the ball restriction. For this, we just write r i for the simple roots for E6 minus 14 with alpha 6 to be non-compact. And we denote by omega 6, the fundamental weight corresponding to alpha 6. And we write L sigma omega 6 for the irreducible loss weight GK module with parameter 3 omega 6. So in one of the rules and also of the rules and oshma's paper this representation is called the minimal holomorphic representation and because this this this this module reaches the smallest gap on the pilot dimension and is this representation unitary uh yes unitary unitary yes so uh so we we we we can prove that this lowest weight gk model is in Weight GK model is indeed discrete deconversible as a G, K, model. So this tells you that the remaining client forcing matrix satisfied discrete deconversible property. Last, we finished the classification for all the Kleinfaulty match for E6 minus 14. These are the Kleinfault symmetric sub-algebras. Klein force in matrix sub-algebra is here. And this column tells you that whether they are holomorphic or not holomorphic. Then this column tells you that they lie in case two or case one. Remember, no case three, okay, because this is a permission type. And this column tells you that whether they satisfy that there exists at least one infinite-dimensional GK module, which is discrete convergent restriction, you can observe that. You can observe that case two, all case two, correspond to yes, or case one corresponds to no. And also we do the same thing for e7 minus 25. Okay, then you can also observe that all case two correspond to yes, all case one corresponds to no. So at least we can can give a covering is that for exception. Is that for exceptional simple reboot of population type that is either E6 minus 14N or E7 minus 25? Then also, we always suppose that this gamma contains no common evolution. Then there exists an infinite-dimensional irreducible GK module which is discretely conceivable upon restriction if and only if this pair belongs to case two. That is, for any irreversible automotive, there exists an infinite. This infinite-dimensional invisible GD model, which is creating observable outcome distribution. So, we want to ask whether this is true, this currently really is true for all the simple groups of formation time, at least for Harmony, for example, for classical groups. So, in order to study this conjecture, we study the SPMR. This is a classical mean group of Harvisian type. Of Harvisian type. Then also we classify all the claim for the natural sub-algebras for SP and 2. Then we give we classify them either in case one or case two. Then also you will notice that K2 corresponds to yes, case one corresponds to no. And no, but there's a notice that these two guys. These two guys, SP, one half of NR, one is yes, one is not. And because they are unlike symmetric pairs, it is not that fourth symmetric pairs are true if root automorphisms are conjugate if and only if their fixed point sub-algebra isomorphic, but this is not true for Krainforce symmetric pair. So for this case, so you have two non-country. You have two non-conjugates claim for subgroups, but they give the same client for symmetric sub-algebra. Okay, so you can see that one is in case two, one is yes, one is in case one, and the other is in case one and no. Okay, okay, so we can finally we conclude that at least conjecture is also true for sp and r, but unfortunately we do not know the other cases. Not know the other cases, so we will continue to work for other cases. So that's all for my talk. Thank you. Thank you very much, participation. Any questions? I'm sorry. Other rules come either order two or four. Yes. How about like order five? So I just consider one example. So for all the five, yes. If you I mean if n is prime number. Yes. If n is prime number, at least we can. prime number at least we can not find uh such m right i i i mean that we i mean for n is equal to five at least it is hardly to find such n but this is only a sufficient computation so if n is equal to five then we cannot compute the value Then we cannot control whether they exist. Yes. So this is knowledge. Just a sufficient knowledge. I was curious if, yeah, so you're including these things. Is it something that, like, is it the Atlas or something, or do you have to go through all the receivers to get these all the actions? These all the actions of gamma in the finite four groups polynomial algebra and the liquid. Is this known, or is this something that you have to create, or you use as? No, I just come to the bottom. Yes, but because Chung Yu and Jin Zongwang, they have a classification for client for subgroups for compacting the algebra. Then you can make use of their results to compute the piecemeal. Doubts to come to the case matrix. We might just come to yes. We have more examples like algorithmic humans. Yeah, yes, yes, by gene. Yeah, but so how about the other three then? So yeah, yes. So when we compute the client for the subgroups for non-compact Lie algebra, so we needed to use the result of the Use the result of the compact D algebra of all the three. All the three. Then, if we can choose the dimension two subgroup of all the three just means all the eight, right? Then another two to the power three, right? Then we need to study of all the four for compatibility, right? So I. So, I have not yet configured obviously. I think configuration will be much more complicated. Um on the board uh people yeah it's all eight for you for the content. Yeah, that's also eight argumenting and then they also I think there's some funny. So I'll listen geometrically motivations for considering form depends on the geometric meaning of. The geometric meaning of but yeah, I know that symmetric pairs have a lot of geometric meaning, good properties. Okay, so I have not considered, I just considered algebraic meaning. Yes, sorry. Then let us send the speaker again.
