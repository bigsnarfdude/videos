So it's just canonical model, power power type triangle equation, and I'm going to focus on B equals three and the the cubic power. So first of all, this equation has some stationary solutions. If I erase these time dependence, I have some stationary solutions. And the least stationary solutions decase exponentially. In particular, In particular, there is a spatial solution which is radial and has a minimum energy among all non-zero solutions. And this solution we call its ground state, and we are going to consider the multi-solitome consist of these ground states. Okay, this ground state, let me do it. Now it's slightly technical, but just I want to illustrate that this solution to the Klein-Golden equation. Solution to the Klein-Golden equation is not stable because the linearity operator has negative eigenvalue under the wave evolution, this will cause its potential growth. And it also has some zero due to the symmetry of the equation. Okay, this is just one technical part. Then let's return to some overview. My interest is to understand the dynamics of this equation. Dynamics of this equation. So, this is some sketch of some historical things. So, if I consider the energy below the ground state, then by payment statinger, they prove a dichotomy. This ground state has a multi-part structure. So, in these two different regions, they have different behavior, either blow up or globally. Either blow up or globally exist, but at that time they only know the solution exists globally. Then, below the ground state, if they use concentration compactness to show if the solution indeed globally exists, then it scatters. In other words, at large time, it behaves like a free equation. This is below the ground state, then going. Ground state. Then going slightly above the ground state, Nakamishi and Shilagle classified some dynamics, the all dynamics around the ground state, in particular, some current hydration and with the energy equals the energy of LeBron state. So here, as I mentioned, LeBron state is not stable. So in this one single solitone, one single solitary. One single solitone set in the ground state plays a role like all the manifolds given by this ground state play a role like center manifold. It has co-dimensional one structure there. Okay, this is a historical things. Our goal is to study these dynamics around multisoliton, and I will tell you what multisolitone is, but I guess you already know this from yesterday's. It's a symmetry. It's a symmetry of, I will make this more precise. It's a superposition of a finite number of relative transform of solitons. I will assume they have different speed. Let me introduce the Laurent boost, the Laurent transform. So Klein-Golden equation is a wave-type equation. So it's invariant under the Laurent transformation. So if I have a useless Lorentz, So, if I have a useless Laurent transform here explicitly right on here, if I have a solution and I apply the Laurent transform, it will be also a solution. In particular, if I have a ground static and I apply the Laurent transform, I get a traveling wave. Okay, then, yes, I applied the translation symmetry of the equation and the Laurent transform to make a To make a ground state travel, this is a traveling wave. The so-called multisolitone, I just consider it's a superposition of this traveling wave. I'm going to assume this beta j they are different. So this multisoliton is not a solution to the kind of solution. But there exists. There exists a solution which now we call pure multi-solitone. This spatial solution converges to the superposition of this solitone as time goes to infinity. The first construction was due to Carl Hill and Court. The later construction, they use stable solitone and here they consider more general troubling width. Our goal is to study some stability of dynamics around this multisolitone and study some property of this pure multisolitone. Okay, so the most important goals for us, the first one is to understand the stability of multisoliton, and the second one to classify the multisoliton. So for these two goals, we So for these two goals, we show for around this multi-solitome, for this multisolitome, we will have some co-dimensional or conditional asymptotic stability. We also give some prepared refined construction around this neighborhood of multisolitome. We can construct some center-stable manifold around multisolitomes. Solitomes. For pure multisolitomes, we derive some refined information about these multisolitomes. In a construction before, well, in a real construction, people can show you should converge to the superposition of solipons exponentially, but here we are going to US later. Here we are going to you will see later on in our work we just assume that is a solution converted to a super pure multiple superposition of multisolitone. Then we use lay widths without any detailed assumption then we start to derive some detail and find all the possible Q multi solutions. So let me also mention some broad history a little bit. It's just very without trying to intensive. I just list a few of names. So the stability, asymptotic stability and the stability of solitons, it has a long history. Weinstein and later study the orbital stability, but my interest is to study asymptotic stability, which I want to show the potential. Which I want to show the perturbation actually scatter and disperse. I list a few names here: sofa, Weinstein, Pergiano, Kokania, Crickle Shlark, Nakanishi Shlark, Keriama, Loni Ashi Shark, Sopher, and etc. Overall, my naive feeling is that around one single solitone has been studied intensively, but for multi-solitone structure, there are not so many results about the asymptotic state. About the asymptotic stability at this moment. In Paramind, the Schlager, Loni√®re-V Schlager software, they use point-wise decay to obtain asymptotic stability. You know, this intersects, LO2 intersects with L1, which is not less natural with respect to the topology of the equation, the property of the equation. Okay, so if we want to go to more natural space, like We want to go to more natural space like energy space and LO2 space or these sober left spaces without weight, or one need to rely on some street cut estimate. For example, in the one soliton case, I mentioned a work by Mario Spadiano and uh Arcani Schlark. Uh on the other hand, uh if there are some uh for sure here the list of land name is not intensive here. Of the name is not intensive here. For PDV type equations, there are some miracle monotonicity formulas. So in this setting, they can use monotonicity formulas to study the stability in the energy space. But these monotonicity formulas could not apply to the wave-type equation, at least in the stability. At least in the stability of solitons. So, our fundamental tool is to derive straight-cut estimator, which can be applied to study multisolitrons, uniquen energy space. So, for the pure multisolitome, the typical construction, there are too many experts here, so please stop me if I say something. Please stop me if I say something crazy. The typical construction is take a capital Tu, just try to find a sequence of Tn and at each Tn we solve the equation with the prescribed data, then pass Tn to infinity, then pass the sequence of the solution and using wave convergence. So here use V. With convergence. So here use uniform estimate and proper fixed point and etc. This allows people to pass to the weak limit and use the weak continuity of the solution flow. They can construct solutions which behave like superposition of multi-solution at infinity. So here because people use a lot of weight convergence, you know we lose the information about the uniqueness or refined property. About the uniqueness or refined properties. So, to derive more refined information about these pure multi-solitons in the setting of GKDB, again use some monotonicity formula, the existence or uniqueness of pure multi-soliton was solved by Matteo and Corvette. In some recent work by Corte and his students, they assume some Assume some solutions converges to the superposition of multisolitons with some algebraic decay weight, then they are able to classify and prove some uniqueness of this pure multisoliton in for various models, for example GKDV and School angle equation. Here they assume algebraic decay rate, which I'm not entirely sure is natural because Natural because in this classical model, the multi-solute soliton decays exponentially and the interaction decays exponentially in time. So last year with YASIC, in 1D, we use a fixed point argument to construct our multi-kink in 1D scalar field model. We use the fixed point And we use the fixed point argument GCAI iteration, then naturally this gives us some uniqueness and the continuous dependence on parameters. But the drawback is that we need to work in the exponentially weighted space. So we assume more, we assume it converges to contextual exponentially than we classified the solution. Okay, this is some brief history. So let me just introduce some. So let me introduce some notation so that I can introduce the result. So the Klein-Golden equation can be written as a dynamical system in this energy space using its Hamiltonian formalism. So we can write it as a Hamiltonian, not a linear Hamiltonian system. And in this setting, the ground traveling wave is given by this vector. Okay, then n now I fix uh natural number L. I fix a natural number n and I consider this set of these Laurent vectors or parameter to be different and give some shift here. And with some sign here, I consider a multi-solid structure here, superposition of traveling wave. So in our current work, we don't consider a collision. So we So, we want to avoid the collision of solitones, so we have separation conditions. Separation condition just means two trajectories will separate from each other linearly. This is very important. It's different from the log distance we saw yesterday. Okay, then for we will consider the multi-solitome waste parameters such that you certified some separation can be. some separation conditions. So our first result is orbital stability implies asymptotic space stability. If I consider the solution, the initial condition which is close to a multisoliton and assuming that the solution exists globally and stays close to the family of Close to the family of multisoleton. Here, I can change this parameter and stay close to this family. Then the solution has a refined behavior, it's scattered to the multi-solitome family in the following sense. Some Runt factor, Runt parameters, and a path such that the solution can be decomposed into, as time goes to infinity, it's To infinity, it can be decomposed into ultrasolitone with time-dependent paths and an electron which is set to free Klein-Gordon flow. This so-called conditional stability. Conditional asymptotic stability. We're assuming the orbital stability then implied the asymptotic stability. Before I talk about many of the Talk about the many before I talk about the manifold, let me talk about the pure multisoliton first because the pure center manifold is a little bit technical. Okay, so for the pure multisoliton, what can I say? So given a different set of round factors and they are different, suppose that solution solution converge to the superposition of The position of solid traveling wave as time goes to infinity. Here we don't assume any convergent rate. Then we can derive actually converge to the superposition of multisoliton exponentially in time. So this makes me feel the multisoliton is quite quite uh i mean pure multisoliton or multisolitone is a quite special feature it resembles some elliptic uh uh elliptic feature but when we try to show the existence of some elliptic equation we always use some compatibility some some kind of argument to uh to show the existence uh uh existence of the solution at the beginning So we first saw the existence of the solution, then we can start to derive the required property of the solution, for example, the smoothness or the decay property of the solution 2050. Here we are doing more or less testing with some. Same thing with any assumption at the beginning, just only existence of the solution, and then we start to derive a very fine property. So, here, in particular, for the cubic equation, we can even put spatial weight into account. So, we can further show this so-called pure multisoliton will have, will decay exponentially in space away from the center. Away from the center of this superposition of multi-solitones. Superposition of solitons. In particular, we run this argument in our multi-tick paper. Okay, then finally, about a pure multi soliton may have the following. May have the following sort of uniqueness statement. So, all the solutions converge to this given superposition of traveling width. It will form a dimension L-manifold. The logic is, I hope to recall that this ground state is not stable. It has stable and unstable direction. It's the sum of The sum of ground traveling wave, the traveling wave produced by ground state. So each of them has one stable direction. So overall, the set of solutions converted to this has an undimensional manifold. We have an undimensional stable manifold. This is now let me introduce more technical things. things. So we also try to construct the center manifold around multisoliton. It takes a couple of steps. The first step in our construction, when you first take the perturbation which is orthogonal to this I forgot to introduce this notation, but the logic is here like means at the in Like this, in our first step, in the construction, we can construct the sentence stable manifold of very high code dimension. Why I need to do this? Because I want to rule out the translation mode. These are zero modes of the linearized operator, and these are unstable modes of the linearized operator. So I just perturb. So I just put up away from this generalized kernel and the unstable mode. Then we can file a map from this linear space to Rn such that if I write the initial perturbation as the superproducer As the superposition, the initial perturbation is the multisolitome plus a term in the linear space in co-dimension 7 space before. And here, the unstable direction is uniquely, the value of the unstable direction is uniquely determined by this perturbation. This perturbation in the linear space. Then take this as initial data, then the corresponding solution will scatter to the multi-soliton family. So here this map in particular map this linear space tools are curve and this gives us a co-dimension seven. Seven center stable manifold. But we expect a codimension own center manifold how to gain more symmetry back. Then we can use exponential map and extend lease construction to a neighborhood of the multi-solitome. Then we have the following. Use a symmetry to do exponential map and then around Around in a small ball around the multi-solitone, we also have this construction. So, those symmetry, we have six n symmetry. So, this allow us to gain six earned dimension back. So, finally, I have locally we have a co-dimensional uncenter-stable manifold. Now this co-dimension is natural because we have unstable, each solitone has one. Each solitone has one unstable direction, then we have an unstable direction we need to restrict to us, we need to stay away from these directions. So this construction is local, then we can then with some work to check the local chart and catch them together. Then we can construct a sentence stable manifold. Run the well-separate multi-sorry family. Well-separate multi-soliton family. Well-separatable multi-soliton just means in this family, each all the parameters satisfy the separation condition I told you before. Finally, let me show you our critical tool, which is street cut estimate. So the street cut estimate is the following. It's related to It's related to if I linearize the equation around a multi-solitome, I will have a linear equation like this. And these potentials are produced by a solitone, it will move like the Laurent vector will change, time dependent, and the shift will be time-dependent. And from the view of modulation equations, it's natural to impose this assumption. Beta prime is. Beta prime is integrable and small. This derivable shift minus the velocity is small and integrable. This from a view of modulation equation and the point streak as estimate. Okay, for this model, I still need some terminology, some stable, unstable model. This is not. Unstable, unstable mode. This is not that important in this movement. So, just I want to show it's in the literature people can find this stable, unstable, and generalized kernel explicitly. Then, with this setting, we have the following street cut estimate. If the solution is orthogonal to the kernel, if the solution is orthogonal to the generalized kernel, The solution is orthogonal to the generalized kernel of the linearized operator of the linearized flow. And asymptotically, the solution is, this is high CS just says, asymptotically, the solution is orthogonal to the unstable mode. Then we have this global straight-cut estimate. And moreover, the solution will get to free wave. So if after we So, after we prove the street cut estimate, I remember people saying if we try to build a car to prove stability or these constructions, they would like to build a car and the streetcar estimate is the engine. So, with this streetcar estimate, we are able to run all this contraction and scattering analysis. Now, I think for now. Now I think for non-experts we can just close eyes and prepare the coffee. So we just in order to show the existence of the solution we do a standard iteration argument using streetcard estimate. Streetcard estimate can give us some a priori estimate and you can with this just take me apart and we also need to use yes we need to do Uh yes, we need to do a prior a priori estimate in street cut now. And then for uh to show the resistance, we also need to show contraction. But the contraction here is slightly more technical because if I have two different pairs of solitons, it's hard to compare them point-wise. Then we need to use some exponential weighted space to do the difference estimate. So we do So we do, at least also appear earlier in the work of Nakanishi Shag and Marius Pachianu, just the logic is to prove a pre-order estimate in a strong topology and prove contraction in a weaker topology. The fixed point will have the property in the strong topology. Yes, let me stop here. Thank you very much. Logarithmic uh it's uh it's p i uh I might claim something too ambitious. My claim is something too ambitious, it's possible to do some analysis, but it will be very technical. Sorry, you will need to study the interaction, to compute the interaction very carefully. We need to need to compute the interaction very carefully. There is a possibility, but I don't want to connect anything at this moment. So you mentioned for the multi-solid you have a special exponential localization. Yes, is it true for any dimension or 3D? Mine are if you at least moment just solo as it does. At least the moment, just so long as the soft left embedding works, then any dimension will work. For example, 1D, the soft left embedding to L infinity, so we can run this for any power. For 3D, the cubic Schrodinger equation is H1 embedded to L6, so we can do this argument for cubic equation. But for other equation, spatial weight, then the straight cut will be. The straight cut will be one. If you use straight cuts, then you will take more efforts to exponential decay. For higher dimension, I think general logic will be the same. Actually, the estimation that you have, you to prove that your result estimation are Lorentz invariant and the Lorentz properties provided. Yes, in some sense, for the change of loss parameters, we can have a very uh precise estimate. That's from follows from modulation equation and uh endpoint street cards. Uh Maybe I missed it in that. Do you have a sort of characterization of the manifold for orbital stability? After constructing a center-stable manifold, the center-stable manifold is the set where we have orbital stability holes. Because the sentence stable manifold it has some invariance or this kind of things. So I think one can prove that if I stay close to the family, each B has to be in the center stable manifold. And conversely, any solution in the center stable manifold for sure is orbital stable. So it's I guess it's so I guess it's sort of characterization. And in that center manifold, you know these famous Eukai and Merle functions that they contracted in adjoined unstable directions. Do they appear or? Oh nothing target. Okay, don't worry. I can ask you directly. Right, I guess you're right. Now we can see that.
