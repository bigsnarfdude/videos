So I'm going to continue with the previous talk and I'm going to give the details or at least the main details for the truth of the following theorem. So suppose that f is a field of at least control and suppose that A, B, C, and D And B are scalars enough, non-zero scalars. So if the massive product ABCD is defined, so this is a subset of H2F CO2, so we're looking at the equals two case. So if this massive probing is defined, then it vanishes. Then it vanishes. So, in other words, if the massive product is non-empty, then it actually contains zero. Okay, so the let's see, maybe I want to, I'm just going to introduce one piece of notation. So, if, suppose that, let's take an arbitrary number of elements in a star. Elements in F star, I want a n, and then I will denote by f a1 a n. I think maybe this was introduced in the first lecture with just one element. So this would be the etal algebra, the etal f algebra, fx1, xn, what would the relations x1 square minus 1 square minus a1, so xn squared minus a n. So this is, of course, if a1 a n are independent model squares, then this is a field extension of the algorithm similar to the n. But in general, it's a Natal algebra. And then, so I'm going to define the square root of Ai as xi. Okay, so this is a in general, this is a gamma zn algebra in an obvious way. The n algebra in an obvious way. So gamma still should still be fine. Gamma ziggo 2 to the n algebra. So the i generator of σ 2 to the n acts by sending the square root to minus itself, the square root of ai to minus itself, and fixes everything else. Fixes all the other square roots. Alright, so I want to, now that we have this notation, I want to. Now that we have this notation, I want to um explain what makes the case uh n equals four uh harder than the case n equals three. So what we have here is now a five by five matrix upper triangular. So we have we're given these chapters, chi A, chi B, chi C, chi D and we know that the Musselberg is defined, that means that we can fill the matrix everywhere except possibly the the upper right corner. possibly the upper right corner. So here it's theta one, theta two, and then mu1, mu2. And of course I also have some new here. And what is the so this would be my this is a rho bar that we're given, a lift to u5 bar. And we would like to lift row bar to new five or maybe another. Finus you we would like to modify rho bar so that we can actually lift it to u5. What is the abstraction? What is the abstraction? So, delta of rho bar is we need to multiply the first row and the last column. So, chi A cup product mu2 plus theta1 cup mu1 plus theta2 cap chi. So, the difference with the n equals 3k is that now we have 3 case is that now we have three terms instead of just two. So in n equals three case, we had a chi A cup something and something cap chi C. And then we were able to do that trick by Minach and Dan, I think Mati, they did the trick where they were able to replace the mu2 by some other character and also the delta 2 here. And they were able to make this obstruction back. And they were able to make this obstruction vanish. But here, this is more complicated because now we also have this new term which appears, which is somehow middle term. And this has nothing to do with the KD anymore. So even if we do change the two and U2 by some characters, we really cannot do anything on this. So our modification will... So we cannot just modify rho bar on these two terms. Just modify robar on these two terms. We will need to modify robar more deeply, right? So, also on the second diagonal. Okay, so this is an element in our group. And so, basically, the strategy to overcome this for n equals 4 was actually already devised by other people. Other people, so by so I know and then Wittenberg around 2017 and the so the they use a different strategy, so a different type of oblique that we're going to see. So let me state the proposition and then we're going to. The proposition, and then I'm going to give the proof, and you will see how it differs from going from this strategy. So, suppose that we have A, B, C, D, our scalars in F star, then the massive product ABCP vanishes. Vanishes or respectively is defined. It's defined. So if and only if there exists some alpha in F A star, delta in F T star with the following properties. So the norm of alpha Of alpha is B. The norm of delta is C, well, maybe up to squares. Okay, maybe not. Maybe not on the nodes, but up to squares. And the the the symbol alpha delta in so In Brower group of FAD vanishes, d is equal to zero. Okay, so this is the condition for ABCD vanishing, and now the condition for being defined is the same, except so this part is the same, but the last, I just changed this condition about alpha delta. So alpha delta comes from the ground field. So there is a the ground field. So there is a two torsion class in the power group of uh of F which restricts to alpha. Okay, so this is a reformulation of the property ABCD vanishes or is defined, which is entirely about the Brouwer group, right? It's entirely about scalars in F or maybe field extensions of F, and it's entirely Field extensions of F, and it is entirely about the Brawler group of these field extensions. Okay, so this is the starting point. So basically, what we're going to do is to, well, no, I'm going to explain the proof of this, but eventually what we're going to do is we're going to take this as our assumption, then we're trying to modify alpha and delta so that we can reach the conclusion. So let me explain the proof for this. So for this, um, I need to um I need to discuss a little bit gamma algebras. So if G is a finite group, so of course H1FG is homomorphisms, continuous homomorphisms from the gamma group of F to G, modulo concrete concern in G. But it's also gamma G out. So gamma G algebras gamma G algebras over F over F as two isomorphism. So we're going to use this interpretation of H1. So in particular, suppose that suppose that AB is 0 in the Brouwer group. In the Rauer group. Then that means that B is a norm from A. So this is a standard emanating aloe cohomology. If the cafeteric AB is zero, that means that B is a norm from A or A is a norm from B. So let's take so let alpha be an element from F A whose norm whose norm is B. Norm is B. There certainly is such an element. I don't even need just the norm to be B. It could be Bx squared, where X is again X star. So I pick such an alpha. And now I can consider this, well I have a Z 2 squared Gala algebra, FAB, and this can actually be extended to a U3 algebra, a Gala U3. U3 algebra, a Galois U3 algebra. So, what is a Galois U3 algebra? It's an etal algebra over F and it has a Galaxy. It has an action of this. So, I need to tell you what the action of U three is. So, let's let me just call sigma A this element of of uh U three and sigma B this other element. And sigma b, this other element. So 0, 0, 0, 0. Okay, so this is an equality. Okay, so what is the action? Well, the action on FAD is the action coming from the fact that this is a zoo, this is another zoo, so this is a zero two square gala algebra. It's a 0 to square gala algebra, so that's we know the action. Just going to tell you what the action on alpha is. So, sigma a of alpha over the square root of alpha is x. Remember, the norm of alpha is bx squared. That means that sigma a of alpha that sigma a of alpha times alpha should be bx squared. So, if I want this relation to be true, I'm forced to I'm forced to impose this. Maybe I could put a minus sign, but in fact, it doesn't matter. I will get the same Gamma algebra. And then, so maybe this is a definition. And then sigma p square root of alpha, I just say that it's the same. So this is, this makes, this is a tad algebra into a Galois U3 algebra. Okay, so why do we care about this? Well, remember, we have a sequence. Sequence, a central short-term sequence like this, which is the case at n equals 2. And so what do we have? We have h1 f u3 bar. So now this is, remember this is σ2 squared. So this, here we have the class of f baby. Of our dial algebra phasing. And then we have the abstraction in H2, so in the Brouwer group. And the obstruction in the Brouwer group is exactly the cap product AB, which we know I took AB to be 0, so AB is 0. And this means that there is a lift to H1F U3. And what is this left? It's exactly this gamma algebra that I described. Well, there's of course many lifts, but they're all of this form. So what I described here are all the Galois algebras, the Galois U3 algebras which induce FAB. So this is somehow, you could think of this as being a proof of the fact that the structure vanishes and you would. structure vanishes and you have one proof for every different value of alpha okay so okay so now that we have this let's let's actually discuss the proof of this proposition so as I said we cannot just work we cannot just try to fill to take a row bar and try to field with square that's going to be complicated because of this middle term so we avoid it In this way. So we consider P to be the subgroup of U5, given by the following. So I basically take the top right 2 by 2 squared. And then everything else is 0. So this is a subgroup of U5. It's actually a normal subgroup of U5. Of u5, and in fact, we have a short exact sequence like this. So I have one pu5, and then I have, well, if I quotient u5 by p, that's like forgetting the square. So what I get is a u3 and another u3. And they're disjoint. They intersect trivially. So I get a u3 cross u3. Okay, this is surjective. And then what do we have? And then what do we have? Well, we also have U5R and we have our sequence like this. And then, well, the center is the top right corner. So it's actually contained in P. And so I can quotient by that, and I get here a P bar. Okay, and then if I portion U5 bar by P bar, I get the same U3 plus. Okay, so that's the diagram that we have. And now, what is the point of this? So, here, remember, we still have sigma 2 to the 4, right? We start from some, we're given this homomorphism, chi A, chi D, and we, right, we know it lifts to U5 bar, we actually want to lift it to U5. But the idea is instead. The idea is instead of going directly from U5 bar to U5, is to first fix a lifting to U3 and then discuss the U5 bar liftings of this U3 plus U3 lifting and also the U5 liftings of this U3 plus U3 lifting. So we add an intermediate step. Okay, what is a U3 cross U3 lifting? This is where the bottom right comes in, because we're trying to lift From C2 to the 4, 2, U3 cross U3. So this lithium will correspond to a pair of GAU3 cross U3 algebra, so a pair of GABA U3 algebra. So let me write it here. So U3 plus U3. Here we have 0 to the 4. Okay, here we have our class, F A B C D where we would. That we would like to lift for now, just here. And the lift, so how do we take the lifting? Well, so let suppose given alpha in FA star delta in F delta such that the norm of alpha is V and the normal And the normal delta is d. So we're going to encounter these equations many, many times. So of course all of this is in modal squares. So in F star over F star squared. Now given this, then in fact the lifting is given by this, by the product of the lift for AB and the lift for C B. For C D C D or you can think of this as really as a pair of Euclidean algebra if you want. So this is a lift. And all the lifts, in fact, arise in this way. I think. There you go. Okay. So that's okay. So now I start. Okay, so so now I described how to lift from here to here. And I want to describe how to lift from here to U5 bar or from here to U5. And now this is where the P comes in. So P, so P is a U3 cross U3 module thanks to this exact sequence. And so now U3 cross U3 receives a homomorphism from the absolute Gallo group corresponding to this algebra. And now I would just describe P. Algebra and now I would just describe P, okay. Perhaps first, let me describe P as a U3 cross U3 module. So as U3 cross U3 module, so there is a, in fact, P is the following. So you have, you can take the following subgroup of, well, let's just say, yeah, you can take the Say, yeah, you can take the subgroup of U3 consisting of elements like this EF. And there's a zero there. That is right. And then you could take, similarly, elements of this form. So this is a subgroup of U3, and this is also a subgroup of U3. They're both a152 c mod two squared. And you can send them to 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. And then here you're going to put EE prime, here FF prime, and now here you get F E prime and E F prime. So this gives you a nice, this gives you the structure of P as a U3 cross U3 module. It's basically 3 cross with 3 module. It's basically this module tends to this other module. Of course, E and F and E prime and prime, they're in Z mode 2. They're the entries of the matrices. And so using this structure as a U3 cross U3 module, then you can get the structure as a gamma module, which is, so as a gamma F module. So since we have a momentum. So since we have homomorphism from gamma F to U3 cross U3 corresponding to this lift, every U3 cross U3 module is also a gamma F a module. And in fact, E is isomorphic to the test of probability of these two. So the first one is an induced module, from a failed graph. And the second one is an induced module from From um well, so the first one is induced module from a paid graph because we're talking about this upper U3, and the second one is lower u3, so D is what it's important here. So, this is the induced for F D. Okay, so this is just the induced module from F A D F A D C one or C okay? Okay? So now what is the h2 of b then? As a gamma module, as a gamma f module, that's just, by which should be of m it's just the drawer group of fad for the tutorial. Okay? So I have my lift in u3 cross u3, for example. Here, let's think about the band. Here, let's think about the vanishing. I have my lift here. I want to see if it lifts to U5. So I have to look at the abstraction in H2FP, which is the Brawler group of FAT, the torsion. So my obstruction will be given by some class in the Bravo group of this for the field expansion. And here's the obstruction. So FAD alpha plus F C D F C D delta lifts to U5. So if and only if okay, yeah, if and only F, so if and only if the obstruction, this H2FP vanishes, and the obstruction turns out it's just alpha del. So and so this obstruction should vanish. In the problem of epic. Okay, so the fact that P is a tensor product of a part that comes from A and a part that comes from D, then if you put a cosycle computation, corresponds to the fact that the obstruction here will be given by the product of the obstruction over A and over D. Okay, so it's a cosine calculation that I skipped here. And now what about the U slide bar? U5 bar. The lifted U5 bar exists if the obstruction vanishes but in P bar now, not in P. So that means that the obstruction in P that I get here should not be zero necessarily, but it should vanish in P bar. That means it should come from the zoo. So it should come from the Bravo group for that. So for u by power, we have if and only if alpha delta is zero. Delta is zero, not in the browser group of FID, tutorial, but actually modulo the image of the browser group of F tutorial. Okay, which is the same as saying that alpha delta comes from the browser group of R. So this is how you prove this proposition. You avoid the middle term by putting it inside the P, basically. And now you have a condition which is. And now you have a condition which is still about the Bravo group, but it's not the Brower group of F, as in the previous case. It's in the Brouwer group of FAB, of this equadratic extension. So that's the proposition. So that is proposition zero, let's say, because it is the starting point. So now that we have a problem entirely about the browser group, then we have to solve this problem. So I can tell you the strategy now. So the strategy is the proof strategy. So, the proof strategy for the theorem, so strategy. So, in view of this proposition, what are we given? We are given alpha delta, or alpha in F A star, delta in F B star, and then the norm of alpha is B, the norm of delta. The norm of delta is C, always in alpha squares. And we know that alpha delta comes from the Brauer group of f to torment. This is what we're given. Now we need to modify. What we want is we want this to be zero. Okay? So what we have to do is we have to modify alpha and delta super. modify alpha and delta suitably so that the norms remain the same, but now alpha and delta is zero. Okay, so we modify alpha and delta. So alpha would go to some, so we're going to consider this type of modification. So alpha, I can replace alpha by alpha x, where x is in epsilon. If I replace alpha by alpha x, then the norm of alpha changes, but it up to squared is still p. Changes, but up to squared is still p. So I'm certainly allowed to do such a transformation. And I'm also allowed to replace delta by sub delta 1. Okay? And now, but now we want so that the new algebra is actually 0 over F A B. Not just comes from F, but it's actually 0. So that's the strategy. We need to find this X and Y. Of course, if you take some random X and Y, X and Y. Of course, if you take some random X and Y, this is not going to work. If you take some random X and Y, maybe the new algebra doesn't even come from F any point. But you need to choose them suitably so that they actually become zero. Okay, and for the strategy, there are two steps. So the first step is to consider the generic case. So, a simpler case where A is equal to D. So, A is equal to D. The first entry is equal to the last one. Okay, and in this case, it turns out that we can keep alpha the same, and we just need to change delta. We only need to do this. And in fact, this Y turns out it's is it's actually forced to be a norm from E. To be a norm from B. So by this and B, I mean this Y is in the image of the norm map from F B star to F star. It's not just a scalar, but it's even a normal. But this is, if you, so this is basically forced, so you, it's a forced choice. But I mention it because it is, it's important to notice that we need to choose a while like this. It helps in the proof. Now, step Now, step two, of course, we prove the degenerate case, then we need to reduce to the degenerate case. So, reduction to step one. So, okay, I'm a little bit blagged by what I mean by reduction. Step one, we want to, but I'm going to different size in a second. So, for now, I will just tell you that this reduction to step one is accomplished by only changing alpha. So, alpha goes to alpha x, but now So alpha goes to alpha x, but now delta goes to itself. So this we need to find x and y with this property so that the class vanishes. But in fact, the surprising thing is that we can actually first find one of them and then find the other one separately. There's no reason why this should be possible a priori, even if you know that they existed. Maybe you cannot find them separately. Because the point is, by replacing this by doing this By doing this, so you need to be careful about this reduction because you're going to get a new alpha x, and maybe you still need the assumptions to hold, right? So, maybe you're getting out of the comes from f area. But anyway, I'm going to give the two precise propositions that we proved, and then I'm going to deduce the theorem from them. So, proposition one here. So, proposition one corresponds to step one, and proposition two corresponds to step two. Proposition 2 corresponds to sub 2. So, proposition 1 is the following. So, suppose that A is a is in F star, and I'll take two elements, I and Mu, and Mu in F A star. So I try to use Greek letters to denote made up notes already with alpha and delta, try to use Greek letters to denote elements for the field extension and uh Latin letters for the for the for F. For F. So suppose we're given these two elements, pi mu, and suppose that we know that the norm is zero. So this is going to be the case, for example, when pi mu is defined over f. If it comes from a two-torn class over f, then the norm is zero in the problem of f. Okay, then we prove that there exists some y, we have star. that there exists some y in f star such that phi um yes phi mu y is equal to zero over fx. So over the fixed function. So we accomplish the degenerate case because suppose you're given suppose you know that ABCA is defined then if ABCA is Then, if ABCA is defined, then you can find alpha and delta with this property, and then you can find a y so that it becomes zero. Okay, so that's the step, the generic case A equals D. And then there is the proposition do, which accomplishes the second step. And this is slightly more complicated. So, suppose that we have three scalars: A, C, D, and F star. C D in F star, we actually don't need B for position. Suppose that alpha is in F A star, but delta is in F B star, and the norm of delta is B. Sorry, C. The norm of delta is C, alpha squares. Okay, so I don't need to say anything about the norm of alpha because B doesn't appear in the statement. The statement. And now suppose, so suppose that C is non-zero, so we need to rule out this case. Sorry, it's not non-zero, it's not a square. Suppose C is not a square. And suppose that alpha delta comes from the torsion of the Brow group over L. Okay, now so this is the situation, these are assumptions for the theorem. Okay, then we can find x as scalar over f and nu as scalar over fa with the following two properties. So the first thing is is alpha x delta is defined over alpha x delta, which a priori is defined over so the sorry alpha x yeah so alpha delta comes from f but alpha x delta a priori doesn't come from f it's only in fa e in fact we say alpha x delta is comes from f a so in the brown group of f a Okay, so this new is in FA. Now, this is my new alpha, and this is a replacement for delta, basically. It's in FA. So now both terms are in FA. Sorry, yeah, in FAD, of course, because this one is in FAD. And the second one is the norm from FA of alpha x nu, this should be zero. This should be 0. Now, this alpha x nu here, we think of it as a class over AD. But of course, this, as I said, is a class over FA also. And in fact, I can take the norm from FA to F of this class, and then it's zero in the power to F. Okay, so these are the two properties that we require. So, okay, let me so okay, there they maybe they there's a lot of notation, that's for sure. There's a lot of notation, that's for sure. But let me show you how to deduce the theorem from these two. So, this is really how we break up the proof of the theorem in these two parts. Okay, so now, so we know that ABC is the final. So, for proof of the theorem, so proof of theorem, ABCD, we ABCD, you know ABCD is defined. I saw by the proposition zero, but the only proposition that I proved so far, the characterization, what we get, if we get this, we get this alpha and delta, right? We get alpha and delta. So the norm of alpha is B, the norm of delta is C, modulus squares. model of squares and then we also know that the alpha delta comes from F comes from the browser of F. Okay, so these are the assumptions. Okay, so the case where C is a square, we do it separately. This is easy, this case. Now, if C is not a square, then we are in the range. C is not a square, then we are in the range of proposition 2. Okay, so what do we get? We get this x and nu. We get x and nu, as in proposition 4. Okay, so I'm not going to rewrite these exactly these two properties that we need. And now let us see. So now we have this x and nu. X and nu, now we apply proposition one. So we know that the norm of alpha x nu is zero, right? So we can take our class here, we can take pi to be alpha x and mu to be nu, right? Because the norm is zero. Okay, so what I get? I get, so by preposition one, by preposition one, I get the y. So I get y. So I get y such that alpha x nu y nu y is 0 over f. Okay? So this is not exactly what I want. I want to put the delta here. I have the new, but I want the delta. But the conclusion is it's easy from here because over FAD, over Over FAB. So what do we have? We have alpha x delta nu. This is just alpha x delta plus alpha x nu. Sorry, what have I said? This should be a y. Sorry. So this is alpha x delta y, alpha x delta plus alpha x y. Okay, just linearity, the cup product. And then this alpha x delta. this alpha x delta is alpha x nu okay and then alpha x y stays the same and then then we can use linearity again alpha x this is alpha x loop y okay so now we know that this is uh zero okay so then this is zero okay so this is how the proof works okay now Okay, now let's see what we can prove. I say at 35 proposition one, let's see if I can also say something about proposition two. Proposition one is the easiest of the two, proposition two. Of the two, proposition two as a very complicated proof, which in fact would be, I think, would be very beneficial for the would be very beneficial for the proof to simplify this as much as possible. For now, it's a very complicated proof. Let's see if I can get to that. So, anyway, let's discuss proposition one. So, proof of proposition one. Okay, I just erased it, so let me just rewrite what it is. So we have A in F star, we have phi and mu in F A star, and we know that the norm is zero. The norm is zero, and so we want to show that there exists y such that, in fact, y such that in fact pi uh mu y is zero, but over f a is this is the what we need to prove. So the so what we need to find is white. So we um I'm going to explain the the proof in the first paper which is which uses uh Albert forms. So let me recall what they are. Recall what they are. So, suppose that A is a big quaternion algebra like this. So, the Ai's and Vi's are scattered in F, all zero. And from this, to this, you can associate an alter form. So, this is a quadratic form over F, which unfortunately quadratic forms have the same notation as the Podatic forms have the same notation as the massive products, but this is a quadratic form. So A1B1 minus A1B1 minus A2 minus B2 and then A2B2. So this is, of course, given the presentation of A in this way, this is a good definition. But the point is A could be written in this way, as a product of two-part algebra in many ways, and then this would change. In many ways, and then this would change the definition of q, but in fact, up to similarity, this is qualifying. So we'll define up to similarity equal to points. And the theorem of Albert is Albert's theorem is the following. So it relates the index of A to the bit index of Q. So let me just phrase it as a table. So index of A, bit index alpha. bit index of Q. So the index of A, it's either 4, 2, or 1. And the bit index here is, when the index is 4, the bit index is 1, it is a 0. When the index is 2, the bit index is 1, and then when the index is 1, so when A is split, Q is actually hyperbolic. Hyperbolic Q hyperbolic. Okay, so this is the part that we are interested in. So when A split, then Q is hyperbolic. Okay, now what are we going to apply this to? Well, yeah, so there is a little bit of notation. So we can take S to be some linear map. S to be some linear map from f a to f, so this is l f linear, and s of 1 is 0. Just choose one such map. For example, you could take the square root of a to 1. And now let's take q to be the quaternion algebra. Quaternion algebra, well, I mu basically. This is over F A. We take Q0 to be the pure covariance. And we have this quadratic form, Q, which is from Q0 to F, to F A. And this is given by square. So you can take a true quaternion and square it. and square it. And in fact, q, well, it's not difficult to write this down, to present it as pi mu and minus pi du. Okay, just very explicit. And then I write the, so we have this form of vertical. We can take the transfer, q, qf. This is the transfer. Okay, this is the transfer. And another theorem of Unberg says that And another theorem of Albert says that, in fact, so you have a quadratic form, well, we have a quaternion algebra, we can take the norm, the constriction to F. The Paternion algebra over F A we can constrict to F. We have a quadratic form, we can take the transfer. In fact, these two things are related exactly by this construction. So the transfer is an albert algebra, alpha form, sorry. I'll perform for the correct striction of Q. Okay? So therefore, since we know that our assumption is that this is split and it is split, so then the transfer is isotropic. Isotropic. Okay? Sorry, sorry, hyperbolic, yes. And then hyper hyperbolic. So here. Okay, then what we have here, then we consider a subform of q and the subq. So q is this, pi mu minus pi mu, and I just take the last two. So I take pi uh mu minus pi mu. minus pi mu. So this is a subform of dimension 4, of a form of dimension 6, which is hyperbolic, so it's isotropic because 4 is bigger than half the dimension. Okay, let's spell this out. So what does it mean? It means that there exists P and Q over F A, right? There is P and Q over F A and then the so this one So, this form should represent an element of f, right? But as a form of fa represents an element in f. So, I can write this as, well, I also need like as a z in f, and I have mu g squared minus pi mu q squared, which should be c. Okay? This is what this is, the form is isotropic, therefore I that's what it means, okay? That's what it means, okay? I have this z. Now, z could be, so I want to say that z is equal to y, but there's a small problem that z could be zero. So if z is zero, then what does it mean? It means that, for this is, this is zero, so phi is a square, phi is a square, and now if pi is a square, then uh I can just take y equals one. Because phi mu is already zero. Okay. So now let's suppose that z is uh is not zero. So then I take I take y to be c and now so we have this is equal to c. Now let's multiply this by mu. So I get, so multiply by mu. What do I get? What do I get? I get a mu p squared minus pi mu q squared is equal to mu y. Okay? Nu y. No, because my z is y. So this means that, well if you look at this equation, it means that mu y is a norm from the extension for phi, right? So mu y norm from From, well, FA, everything is over FA, but then I divide. So it's a normal FA pi. Okay, and this means exactly that i mu y is equal to 0 in the power to the right. Okay, and therefore I prove the proposition. Now we have exactly three minutes, so We have exactly three minutes, so I'm not sure I can say four, but I can summarize two pages in three minutes. Let's see. So maybe I can't one minute to think and then one minute per age. Let's see. So, okay, maybe I'm just going to say, I'm just going to say what's a bit of a good evidence for one for page one and one page two. Okay, now I'm just going to say, so for proposition two, so this is it's a okay, it's a complicated proof that uses a lot of residue calculations and a lot of explicit formulas. So, but the point is the following. But the point um the point is the following. So let's see. So the um gate uh if if you remember when I said proposing prop the state of proposition two I said x should be a null from C. That was the idea. In fact you can if you you can deduce that it's a necessary condition. X should be a null from C. And the idea is that we hope that it's enough to take X to be a norm, a norm from C. So now which norm from C? And the idea is let's just take the generic one and then we hope to specialization and we hope to get to get there. And we don't get to get there. So basically, we take k to be the function february 2. So we take the variables x1, x2, and then we take f to be the generic norm from C, the net node from C, it gets transported, and we admit. So we take the generic node from C, and then I'm going to consider the rational functions f and g over k. So suitable rational functions. So, suitable rational functions over k, so alpha f delta. So, in this view, I will be able to write this. Basically, what I'm going to be able to do is to is alpha delta, which a priori is in, is in KAD, it will be just, it actually just comes from KA by some sort of assumption. Okay? And then by specializing, if you specialize this, you will. If you specialize this, you will get alpha x delta is alpha x nu. So the delta and the f and the g will correspond to the x and the nu. Now there's also the second equation to take care of. We have the fact that the norm should be zero. And this is the hard part. So this is the part that requires residue calculations. And the point is you need to choose a point. You cannot just specialize at any point. You need to choose a unique point that works, basically. Unique pointer works, basically, the way we do it. And it comes out to a system of two linear equations after some work, a system of two linear equations that you can solve assuming that C is not a square. So when C is not a squared, the system is a determinant which is vertical, when C is not a square. So you can find a unique solution, and that works. When C is a square, the proposition is actually false. So this is a statement. Okay, that's what I want to say. Thank you. Any questions? That's proposition one. Proposition one proves the theorem for equality. Now if you put in proposition two, that you reduce it to to to that case. But I was thinking like the strategy and the problem issue is the zero network, but for the cases where A and E are separate. So I was seeing where exactly do you use that A Stock? Yeah, so in proposition one the I mean this proposition wouldn't make sense. Now this is your alpha and this is your delta, right? So they're both in the same effect. So in particular there's only one norm to consider and then you can you have this simplified proposition. And then you can you have this simplified proposition. Now, if you if phi and u are one over f a, one over f t, then uh then this wouldn't really make sense. Even th the formulation doesn't make sense. You can consider different types of norms, but that's more in the spirit of maybe proposition two. Um for proposition one, we are using very specific methods for people, too. Now, suppose you had doubts about the bananas you missed a problem. Would you just look for p equals 3 and try to count someone as well? Well, we try to, we, we, we, we, we, we, we got some condition for p equals 3 when a is equal to p, yes. Which, by the way, doesn't work when p is bigger than this condition. It's a condition again in the parameter suitable for our group, and uh it's uh so you have a condition for defining and a condition for vanishing, but they're so complicated they will just move from one to the other. They should be equivalent, but they're just uh It should be equivalent, but they're just because there exists an element with this, so it's not just the two qualities that you need to say are. No, I'm not sure. I mean, if then that would prove the conjecture for B equals 3 in A equals B K. I believe that when B equals 3. That would be the place to move for calculates. That's probably the simplest unknown case, yes. Okay, yes. So which step do you think may require more than just helper type? Right, so proposition one does not, in fact, from the proof it seems it requires more than Gilbert 90 because we're using quadratic forms. But in fact, as Alexander said in the first talk, we have a proof for the degenerate case only assuming a Bernard. So that's a different. The reason is that we were able to bypass this proof. We're able to bypass this proof by just an argument involving tolerant. Then, if you have an argument only involving tolerite, it's an argument about lattices, and then that you can do that for any confinement, basically. So there's no, only the multiplication is used, not addition. So we can do it in general. And the other part, proposition two, if we know how to do it with impernality only, then we'd be able to do it for all, you know, for arbitrary profonic groups satisfied. Profane groups satisfying formal Bernati, but we cannot do that. So, this proof, yeah, one reason this would be nice to have a simpler proof is to see, okay, maybe it does follow just the Bernati. But so far, the residue calculations, they're only about fields, right? Other questions? Position one, I mean, you can write it in terms of colleges, the other parameters for finite group with F with two coefficients. Yes. The two cohesion is clear how to translate that. Yes. And I think it might be possible to use them only uh formal involved entity in the form that uh they are equivalent of uh of the formal version for a fit habit period affinity, which is that just a cub a equals zero for every a h one h z mod two for everything. That's the the translation for many modern eighty in that particular case. That particular case. For every professor, that might be just. And that is equivalent to 4 million per 90 from Pn to P or just from P squared to 4.2 to 0.4.2 to 4. Okay. Maybe yes. Okay. No further question, and I think to speak again.
