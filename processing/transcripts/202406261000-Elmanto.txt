Good so far. So, hopefully, you've spot some of them. Okay, so I want to talk about K3 and the Brower group. But to do that, I want to kind of motivate these two things and the genesis of this conference by this multi-conjecture that I was talking about. So, recall that what we are trying to say is that if A is a finite type reduced algebra. Algebra over a field which is algebraically close, then we want to say something about this group f n k0. You want to say it's torsion free. So the overall strategy to prove that this is torsion free is to do the following. So first, you want to construct this thing cosmotypic homology. So this has made appearances in TESS and Arnop's talk, but so far I've only talked about it for smooth. So far, I've only talked about it for smooth schemes. But anyway, we're going to construct a map like this, which is some kind of edge map. There's going to be some special sequence from this motivic thing to K-theory, and it factors through, this edge map goes to K0 of A, but it factors through this subgroup. Okay, so that's kind of step one. And step two, we want to show that this HMAP is okay. So, well, step one is really showing that this HMAP is an isomorphism. That this edge map is an isomorphism. The step two is to actually compute this left-hand side, or more specifically, more precisely, precisely show that the map from H to N mode, or minus one, sorry, A Z N into H into h to n minus one mode of a of z m n is rejective and yes uh them a okay so uh and the way that I want to do this okay there are many ways possibly but the way I want to do this is to use et al or syntomic cohomology Comology or methods. You know, there are many ways that maybe you can prove this rejective, but the thing I want to use is to appeal to some results about et al. or this other thing called syntomic homology, which we'll explain in a moment. So I want to say that these two strategies are fundamentally intention. So these strategies, so steps one and two. Our intention. So, this is like, you know, pretty much in the whole genesis of the subject of K-theory. These two things were, well, one, it's saying that, you know, K-theory has something to do with cycles or motiv homology. And number two, that K-theory has something to do with etal cohomology. Like, these two things are always in tension. And when this tension breaks, like something miracle has happened or something awesome. Breaks, like something miracle has happened or something awesome happened. So, let me give you an example of this tension or like an example to demonstrate how arranging one and two can be difficult. So, there's this thing called the K-3 pre-sheet. So, it's a functor that sends a scheme to K of X. This is a spectrum or whatever it is. So, the homotopy groups of this thing are computes K theory and pi zero of it is K0 of X, right? So, this thing has. Right, so this thing has does not satisfy its understand. Let me be precise about what this means. Okay. Suppose I have a field L and I have an extension F, which is G galoa a very simple G Galois extension. Then if KTV does satisfy eighthal descent, it means It means that there is a map from K of L to the following diagram K of F mapping to K of F times L over F tensor and so on. That is the usual descend diagram, okay? And it factors through the limit of this entire diagram. The limit of this entire diagram. And if we had eighth of this n, this would be an equivalence. But we can be even more precise. Whatever k-theory does, it must do the following. So we know what this is, is the product indexed by g of all the s. And whatever k3 does, it must preserve product. So this is just k of f product of g times, product g times. Product G times. And so what you're looking at is some kind of group cohomology with values in this K of F. That's what you're trying to compute. Right? This is like, you know, the complex that kind of computes group cohomology, the check complex. And so there is a spectral sequence that does the following. Its E2 page looks like this: HI. looks like this h i group homology well continuous let's say let's say uh let's say i you know i take the limit across all extensions and it'll go to the closure let's say so there's a there's a special sequence of e2 page is the contiguous group homology of the galois group l bar over l absolute galo group of l with coefficients in the homotopy groups of this object pi j of k theory Of K-theory of L bar. And it converges or attempts to converge to pi of J minus I of the K-theory of the smaller field. So if it has 1-12 descent, then there's a spectral sequence which looks like the hypercomology spectral sequence. So C2PH is group cohomology, continuous group cohomology of this Gala group acting on this. Of this Gala group acting on this object, this an abelian group right now, converging to this K-theory object. And I can also do this with coefficients. So let me put in some coefficients here. So I can look at K-theory with Zmon L coefficients. Green on green, sorry, but I can also do this with Zmon L coefficients to make the answer kind of more comprehensible. Yeah, it doesn't satisfy at all this. Yeah, it doesn't satisfy all the time, but I want to show you why. If it does, then it will do a spectral sequence, but something bad will happen very soon. Correct. Okay. Any other questions? All right. So we have K0 of L with Z mod L coefficients. And what you can check easily is that this is K0 of L. L tensor Z mod L doesn't always happen before zero is low enough that it happens. And can you guess what this is? Can somebody tell me what K0 of L tensor Z mod L is? L is a field. Exactly. But if you contemplate the spectral sequence, what you get is contributions from H0, I 0, which is going to be a Z mod L. But there's one more contribution. But there's one more contribution, which is an H2 pi1. So, what this is, is going to be H2A tau of Gal, of the Gala group, with pi one K theory with mod L coefficients, like L bar, Z mod L. Okay. But what this is, this is just mu L is a pi one. So pi one, I'm telling you right now, it has to do with units of the field. And pi one with the model coefficient is just the L root of unity inside L bar. What is that? Roll credits is a barrel group. The L torgen or the Barrel group. L yeah, L Borough group L is the L torig. So, contradiction in mathematics. Yeah. So, when I was a grad student, this was one of the examples I was very proud of working out. Somehow, people always say, why doesn't it have a fall descend? Because of distinct appearing. Examples are good. Uh-huh. Yeah, pi one of this K-theory object is with mod L coefficient. I'm claiming it's. Coefficient, I'm claiming is the L root of unity inside L bar because K1 has to do with unit, and you chase through some exact sequence, you get this. So that's a problem, right? And so the bar group appears. You might think Barog is not supposed to appear in K-theory. However, as already been alluded to by Danny in his talk, it does appear. So let me tell you how it appears. So, however, so you have F tensor over Z of F cross. So, these are the units thought of as an abelian group now. So, there is a map to the Barrel group of F that sends a pair A, B into this cyclic. Into this cyclic algebra that has been defined. Sorry, yeah. So I let zeta be a root of unity, nth root of unity. This is inside f. I'm just going to fix this. Okay, so you have AOB, zeta AB. This is the cyclic algebra, which was defined by Danny, but I'll tell you again what it is. So it's an associated algebra over F generated by elements x and y. Generated by elements x and y, modulo x to the n is equals to a times 1. y to the n is, it's just a, y to the n equals to b, and xy is equals to zeta yx. This is a central simple algebra that is somewhat more the most elementary kind that you can think of. So there's a map from here to the Brauel group of f given by that central simple algebra. Group of f given by that central simple algebra, you know, Azumai algebra over f. So you can show that this factors true k2 of f, which is given by f cross tensor z over f cross modulo the Steinberg relation. So a tensor one minus a is zero if a makes sense, so not zero, one. Okay, so this is Okay, so this is Matsumoto's theorem that tells you Kp of F has this presentation. Okay, but in fact it's true the n torsion inside the bar group of F. And therefore, in fact is true, K2 of F modulo N F and K2 of F as the Mebelian group. And there's a map like that. So there's not a non-residue. So this was the non-residue map. That's what it's called, like this, yeah. So the nerd map. And this is an isomorphism as by Mercury of Sousten. So if K38 of the sense, the Bar group will have appeared in K0. But it doesn't, so it doesn't appear in K0. But on the other hand, the Bar group appears in K2 via different guys. Too via different guys. And this is like the mystery of K-theory: that things that appear appear kind of in weird degrees. Because this formation of AB to the central simple algebra satisfies the Steinberg relief. Are you saying that you can kind of like publish how you could buy the J3 structure? You combine the J-theory spectrum, you would get the broader things that break. That's really what that, yeah, it does happen, yes. And you just uh kind of spoiled the punchline of this whole talk, which is that I want to it's our homotopy should be fi as a warm-up problem so that at the expense of like having the broader group appearing, which can be like a problem sometimes, uh, kt will be more accessible. Okay, so remember that this, yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's absolutely no coincidence in this. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And it lies to Thomason's theorem. So Thomason tells you that if you take K3 and you invert an element in K2, it has etal descent. Yeah. Yes, exactly. Yeah. And this is a very general phenomenon for any like this module theories. If you invert an element in return. If you invert an element in V2, if you have enough roots of unity, yes, it's all the same. There are myself and Plawner and Tom Bachman. Yeah. It's like, well, it's K2 with mod L coefficient. Sorry, I should have said that. It's the thing that you have this root of unity in K1, and it goes to 0. So there's a box line from K2 with mod M coefficient, and you invert that element. Yeah. Right, there's k2 with mod m coefficients, maybe with k1, multiplication by m to k1, and root, yeah. Yeah, okay. All right, so so there are no coincidences in mathematics, and this is like exactly why the burrow group and k3 are related, but also like kind of related in very subtle ways. So remember, what I want to do is I want to compute some k groups, but I want to use it accessed using et al. methods. So that would be more clever. Like you have to do something. To do something. So, today I want to talk about et al. approximations. So, et al. approximations to the strategy. And which has been more and more popular these days with the advent of like cosmetic homology and so on. So, the way that I want to prove this Martin's conjecture in the etal world, right, let's say I just want to kill some et al. Let's say I just want to kill some et alomology groups. I show that some et alomology groups reject is via this thing called artin vanishing. So let's say dimension of A that I began with is N. So A once that 4 is finite type of algebraic closed fields. And F is a torsion shift. So there's actually no assumption on what torsion there is. There's actually no assumption on what portion there is. Then, R tens vanishing tells you that the et al homology above degree n with coefficients in f is exactly zero. Yes. So yes, exactly, exactly. So if so, hence, if n is greater than or equal to two, then h2n minus one, et al. et al of A with μ m cancel m coefficients, which is the et al analog of motivic homology, is just zero. So the map is always the map u1 is always surjective. This is like a kind of silly thing. So remember, I want to show that h2n minus one mode from of a of z to z mod m is surjective, but the eta version of it is just kind of trivial from eta from art and vanishing. From Art and Vanishing. Okay. So there's like a topological precedence for this. Like we've seen a very nice talk where we talk about analogy between topology and algebraic geometry. The topology there is this Andrea-Frenkel theorem that says an open manifold vanishes above half the dimension of that manifold. And this is like kind of an analog of that. All right, so this is why I use fine as well. I mean, for projective, this is like false. This is like false. Okay, so that's what happens if, so this is a good et al. approximation, good et al approximation in good characteristic. So if M is like invertible inside the base field, but if it's not, then this is not a good at all approximation. This is not what appears. So most of this talk will be about the bad characteristic and tell you how to access the bad. And tell you how to access the bad characteristic. That makes sense. So I wish to tell you kind of some analog of this art and vanishing at the bad characteristic. You have a question? Yeah. So in characteristic P, a tall cohomology UP is not well behaved. Example, it's not A1 invariant, it doesn't have concrete duality, it's just like kind of all sorts of nonsense. Right, but so a possible substitute that people have thought about is replaced with flat cohomology UP and source dot, or maybe just new P. Or maybe just mu P. So instead of like contemplating this group, people have thought about this fat Comology thing as a possible substrate. Okay? So one reason that this might be a good idea is because we have this Kumo sequence. Which is somehow, if you're in the business of ATO, Comology is like your number one weapon, like this is the thing that you kind of use. This is multiplication by P. So this is exact in the flat topology if P is zero in K. But in the ethical topology when P is equal to zero in K, it's not exactly on the right, it's not zero. So because the flat, because the Kumar sequence holds in the flat site, you might guess that this could work as a good. You might guess that this could work as a good substitute for this. It's like the good finance properties that you get might be inherited here. So, this turns out to be quite good. Not be a bad idea for weight one. If I just do no tensor here, then not a bad idea. But people have asked, like, how about mu p tensor j? How about the analogs of? Tensor J. How about the analogs of higher weights with this fat topology business? So Meron kind of suggested that like mu p tensor j with flat with the fat homology is not such a is not the thing you want to do. What you want to do is to use this omega j log sheet. So before I tell you what it is, let me tell you how it appears naturally in this story, right? And it gives you control over this cohomology group via some methods of from coherent comology, just like kind of nice. Be just like kind of nice. So, Andrea told us that you want to compute anything, like any et al. invariance, or invariance of x or whatever. If the stack or the scheme comes to you as a moduli problem or some modern, as a modern presentation, then it's better to compute. You have a chance. But if it comes to you in terms of equations, then you have no chance. It's like kind of very difficult. And one of the metrics. And one of the magical things about this flat Comology, and the thing I'm going to say is that somehow it's like some kind of Goldilocks plot where you can kind of do this. So I'm going to use coherent methods for which you can plug in equations and produce like numbers. Like Korean cohomology is something that if you have presented as an equation, you can attempt to compute. But in the end, the answer will be somehow things like this. It will let you access things like this, which seems very hard to. Things like this, which seems very hard to compute if they just give an equation. So there's this exact sequence in the topology, but we also have the following exact sequence in the et al. topology. So one GM, so the GM is now starting on the left. Now, starting on the left, the GM. Okay, I'll tell you what the map is later. But this has a map to, it's called the D-log map, to omega 1 log comma 1. Yeah, okay, so summation by P, sorry, yeah. Okay, so in the A file topology, there's an exact sequence. Topology, there's an exact sequence which is injective on the left, it turns out, that whose core kernel is this logarithmic form. Okay? So yes, sorry, everything is smooth at the moment. Perfect field. So you have this D-lock map. I'm going to tell you this group officially in a moment, but whatever this does. Group officially in a moment, but whatever this does, it takes a unit into d log of the unit, which is df over f. And as the name suggests, this can be controlled using coherent things. But because of this exact sequence and this exact sequence combine, what you conclude is that the complex computing the flat cohomology of x with mu p coefficients is equivalent to the complex computing the eta cohomology of x. Computing the tau cohomology of x with omega one log coefficient up to minus one shift. Okay, so you can, this is an exercise in sites. Okay, so you have this flat site, you have this atoll site, there's an exact sequence in the flat site, and there's an exact sequence in the atoll site. And the key point is that GM has atol has flat descent, and therefore you conclude that this flat co-module mu p is atoll comoju of omega wedge log. A tolko module of omega when log omega one log shifted by minus. So, one advantage of like trying to interpret the left-hand side into the right-hand side is that the right-hand side just uses a et al. topology, which is like less exotic than the flat topology, let's say. But even better, it will turn out to lead to the correct definition of higher t-twist. And the higher t-twist will involve modifying this number instead of like ta-twisting here. Kind of the idea. Yeah. Yes Absolutely, yes, correct all right so so so Moon, this is like what he suggested is to like instead of elaborating the story on the left hand side, you do it on the right hand side. And there will be one more big advantage. The right hand side will be accessible. It will be accessible via coherent means. Via coherent means. I'll tell you what the right-hand side is by this omega-lock thing. Okay. Yeah, so the point is that this new p tensor j substituted with substitute at bad characteristic with this. With this omega J log object, which I will define right now. So let's say X is a smooth affine scheme over Fp. I'm gonna, in the non-affine case, I'm just gonna extend formally, maybe explain in a moment, but yeah, I'm just gonna define this when X is smooth fine spen omega J log. J log of x. What is it? It's going to be a sheaf of abelian groups in the small etal side of x. So this is going to be a sub sheaf of omega j of x thought of as an etal sheaf, logarithmic forms. I'm sorry, differential forms as an etal sheath. This is the sub abelian sheath. Generated by our df1 over f1, which data dot dfj over fj. So really as an abelian sheet, and not like as a OX module, whatever, really abelian sheaf. So I'm going to look at a sub-abelian sheaf generated by elements here, which is of that form. So if I evaluate on like a strictly handled local So, if I evaluate on like a strictly handsolocal ring, say, then you know what you are looking at. The sub-believing group generated by things like that, where Fi is in your hands-local ring, and strictly hands-on local ring. All right. So, no, absolutely not. No, no, like sub-module. So, Matthew likes to make this joke that, like, uh, yeah, like, do the millennials or like general. Yeah, like due to the millennials out or like Gen Z out there, symptomic homology was defined in the 80s, not due to not really due to them. So here's a 80s definition of symptomic homology. So Z mod pj sin of X is defined to be the complex computing the etaloc homology of X shifted by omega j log, sorry, of with coefficient omega j log shifted by minus j. That's what's in etymology. Yeah, so this shift is motivated by minus one. I mean, so you want to, so because of this, the flat commodity of mu p is just atomic homology in degree one. That's how you remember the shift, at least, right? Okay, so uh, yeah, so let me. Yeah, so let me make a remark. No, not the right, but yeah, sorry, yeah, no, omega, so you take this is not wedge j of omega one log is not, yeah, yeah, yeah. Some people are going to be very happy about this, but the only way you can. Happy about this, but the only way you can write this as omega one log times or something, omega one log times, if you take this as transfer. Completely unnecessary, but yes. Yeah, yes. Oh, it's not true, it's not true. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, sorry, no, I'm not making any claims about that. Okay, yeah, no, no claims, no claims. But yeah, no, no claims, no claims. But why where does this work? So remark. So Milne proved concrete duality. Yes, I wrote this down. Our gamma sends, so just write this. So Z let me not write it out. So when X is It out. So when x is smooth projective, you can also define this. You just extend this formula to smooth projective schemes proper. Poncrete duality for these cohomology theories that resembles concrete duality for et al. cohomology with these coefficients and a good characteristic. So that's one good justification. You also use this to compute zeta functions. And so this turns out to be the right thing. But for the flat homology, I don't really know. I don't know what happened. So that's that's why he suggests using this. So yeah, another nice thing we'll postpone that. So there's an analog of art in vanishing, like maybe weak analog. Maybe weak analog. So, by the way, I'm still currently stuck in this mood situation. I'll tell you how to get away from it in a moment. There's an analog of alpha dimension that looks like this. So, when I am greater than j plus two of z, so I'm so synthetic homology, just a co-modern complexes. J of A is zero. So in fact, this is, yeah, so any A is any smooth FP algebra, because I've only defined it for FP algebras, but there are definitions of this where you have to take care of the Frobenis a little bit when your field is perfect, but not the Frobenis doesn't have to be identity. But any A, any smooth A algebra. The algebra for k is perfect. You also have this vanishing result. So you don't actually need algebraically close. So there's no dependence on dimension. And it vanishes above degree two and very fast two and above. It's kind of weird. Or like some analog, I don't know. Because when you're on a surface, there's a blip. Like, this does not let you prove what I want for a surface. Let you prove what I want for a surface, like some analog of Earth and dimension. Yes. Correct. Yes, correct. Yes, but there's one more way I'm going to compute it, which is what will be this proposition. Yeah. Okay, so proof. Okay, right. So there's a map which I really like. Uh, there's a map which I really like called C inverse, and it goes from A to A that sends F to F to the P. It's also called a Frobenius. There's also a map I like from called C inverse from omega 1 to omega 1, okay, but modeled by D O, by D, that is, it's the Ram differential on O that goes to omega 1. That sends a C inverse of F D G. inverse of f dg f to the p g times p minus one dg okay so this is called a carti operator um and this is a very miraculous object yes no yes yes yes i know yeah it's weird yeah any of the Yeah, and A is affine. Yeah. Fine. What? Yeah, but it's but when you are a surface, it doesn't give me the bound I want, but it will be something else. Okay, so yeah, so you might have seen this. There's some extension of the Frobenius to differential forms. So there's like a GP minus one here. Yeah, so you can, so there's a Cartier operator for omega j mapping to omega j modulo d omega. modulo d omega j minus one there's some formula that you can write down you can imagine the formulas just yeah i'll leave you to it so this gives me another exact sequence that describes omega j or higher j including one so we have a then we get we have exact sequence Sequence in the etal topology given by omega j log one. I don't know, I keep writing one. Is this zero? I don't know, one okay, okay. Zero, yeah, abelian sheet. Okay, omega j and there's one minus c inverse of omega j modulo d. omega j modulo d omega j minus one. Okay. So if there's one takeaway from this talk or this whole series of talks or something is that one, you shouldn't speak at your own conference. Secondly, you should remember this exact sequence. So yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. What? Yeah, if it's only if it's invertible. You're not saying it's fiber or no, no, no. It's really only for invertible. Pretty weird. Yeah. But in some sense, this is more natural, I think. So yes. Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Yes. Okay. So this is like some magical exact sequence. So it tells you that I can express this Janetson relations thing in terms of the kernel of some map. The map is the difference between the canonical, this projection map, is really pi, not really one. And C inverse is like this funny operator I wrote down. And so this is a coherent sheaf. This is taken in the role of a Biden sheaf. This is taken in the role of a beaten sheaf, so it doesn't look quite coherent, but you can imagine it is kind of coherent. So, in fact, this has a filtration whose graded piece are all coherent. So, if I have time, I'll kind of group that in some derived way, in some derived world. But this gives me the following exact sequence. So, you have omega j, so taking take global sections. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. By the provenance. Yeah. Omega J log of A mapping to omega J of A mapping to omega J of A d omega j minus one of A. And there's a co-kernel, which is this H1A tau. I mean, this is just some stupid symbol, omega j log. But this symbol has another stupid symbol. But this symbol has another stupid symbol, and Danny wrote this as HJ plus 1P. Okay. So there's always like a fight in the community. Is it J or J plus 1? I don't know. I think it's actually J plus 1. That's correct. But it's just the H1. But that's coherent, right? So, and I'm on an affine. Yeah. So at all cohomology is the same thing as coherent cohomology, but this is zero. And the same little argument tells you that this is zero, but this is just all exact. But this is just all exact, and everything else vanishes. Okay. And so the Comologia is only 0 and 1. And because I've shifted by J, it translates to a J plus 2 and above disappearing. So what you've leveraged is like some coherent presentation of omega J log. Like kind of amazing. Yeah. So in the next talk, I'll kind of maybe explain how. In the next talk, I'll kind of maybe explain how you can, you know. So, the mod P, the bad characteristic analog of the mandation L1 doesn't quite work when J uh when I'm a surface. So, I have to prove some subjectivity result. That's what actually happens. But for everything else except surfaces, you're okay. Yes, yes. I mean, well, so well, okay, sorry, so this I mean, well, no, so well, okay, sorry. So, this exact sequence works on the etau side of any scheme, any smooth scheme. So, you have some cohomology. Yes. But in the affine, in the non-affine case, you might have H1 of omega j, right? Honey thing like that. Okay, great. So, everything now is smooth. So, in the last 20 minutes, I'll tell you how to extend all of this to the non-smooth setting because, after all, that's what we are after. Yeah, so yeah. Yes. But you have some these are the other directly you're just like going to manage your example. Yes. The bounded is bounded by the dimension or plus one, something it is. Yes, exactly. Okay, so the section is this word called animation. This one called animation, for which we have the students maybe to thank in his great Peter. So, yeah, this animation. So, this is a way to extend things from smooth things to singular scheme. And it turns out there will not be enough, which is the subject of the last lecture. But this is one way to do it. And I want to kind of demystify this idea. Really, not so bad. So you've seen how high categories. Higher categorical methods can have something to say about some old problems. And this is one where it has like had some actual success. Suppose here's my setup. So poly k, so k is maybe some base field or base ring. I don't really care. Poly k is a category of polynomial k algebras. Things of the form k x1 dot dot dot xn. Yeah, final generic polynomial. Okay, so you have a functor like this. Okay, so you have a functor like this. So, the example that you can think of are all the functors I've written on the board, restricted to polynomial k algebra, right? Okay, so there's this category called animated k algebras, which I don't really want to tell you what it is. If you know, you know, then if not, it's fine. But the point is that this contains all classical commutative k algebra or all discrete commutative k algebra. And these are the things I want to focus on. Okay, so let's say. Okay, so let's say I know I like my values on polynomial K algebra. So polynomial is very close to smooth, right? Because smooth is roughly eight of a polynomial. So, and I want to just extend to all affine schemes. I just take an extension. So there's a procedure called left on extension, L F. Okay. So there's a universal object, there's a universal way to extend a functor from here to functor out of this animated K algebras. Out of out of this anyway K algebras and therefore out of all cost OK. And the way you compute this is the following. So first, you pick, you have A, which is a K algebra, and you pick generators. So let's say it's finally generated for simplicity. You take K, adjoin some sequence of generators, so it's object. But there might be relations, so you have to add on things that kill the relations, and there may be relations. And there may be relations between relations, and you go and you go non-stop. So the point is, you can build a collection, you can build a resolution of A using polynomial algebra. So let's call out these p bullets. So L F on A is just the geometricalization. So you have this F of P zero. 0 f of p 1 and so on and this is covariant. I just take the geometricalization, take the co-limit. But there's a way to extend randomly things like so. That's exactly what I'm going to say next, yes. So, right. So, yeah, like I'm going to give you all the examples. So. So, example A. So, these are the class of things for which there's some meaning when you do this. So, example is that if I take f to be the functor that sends a to omega j of a, yes, yes. Ah, yes. Yes. Yes, because co-limits commute with each other. You just write A as an expanding sequence of finite type things and you resolve each step and it picks the colon. No, it's not that pedantic. So there's a functor like this, a to omega j of a. So LF of A, well, when omega 1 is the most interesting example, of course, you send A to what people write as like L1, Lj A over K. One, Lj A over K, and when J equals to one, you get this cotangent complex. Something that one likes. Another thing I might like is F that sends A to omega J omega star of A over K as a DGA, C D G A, the Durham cohomology of A. If I do this, I send A into what has been written before. So this is the derived RAM homology of a button it loses. Okay, and other variants as well. So you can also do A to omega greater than equal to. To omega greater than or equal to JA over k, the steps of the Hodge filtration, and you also get the same. I'm not going to write the symbols, just put an L in front. Okay. Yes. Yes. Of K modules, or like the big area of K complexes. Yes. But it can be any C, really. It can be like any random category C with enough good properties. But you might have seen all of this and you might have gotten frustrated at like. All of this, and you might have gotten frustrated at like, you know, what the hell is going on? Why is it like this? Okay, so let me tell you some funny examples which are underappreciated. Okay, so example D. Okay. So what if you left can extend et al homology? Webcan extend et al. cohomology. In fact, any coefficients. Anyone thought about this? Okay. So here's a thing. If I take P bullet, happy to be in personal resolution, what I can do, I can replace this. This with a resolution where each map Pm plus one to Pm, each of these like base maps are Hanzelian surjections. In other words, it's a surjection of rings whose kernel is a Henzelian ideal. I just pick this stupid resolution, I just handslize at each step. I can do that, you know, why not? And for some functors, if f is equivalent to p is f of a is equivalent to f of a mod i, whenever i is Hanzelian, so this is called rigid. And we even only demand this when A is regular. It's a map of rings whose kernel is a Hanzelian ideal. Then what you will see is that the diagram is constant. What we see is What we see is that L F of A, L F of L F of A is just the original value of F of A. Oh, yeah, sure, it's not so this is due to Gober. But for eth homology, This is Gabbers Fine Analog of proper base change. Sorry, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, my fancy F and normal F is that okay? Sorry, this F is really this whole complex. Sorry, yeah, good point. Okay, so you've not changed the values of some things you like. So this example is for this another example of something like this: is if f. like this is if f my fancy f was uh this h n plus one peak like pre she valid it became more like abelian groups normal f yeah normal f sorry yeah whatever yeah if i do this do it to this thing you can check that this is also rigid and this is like what makes this particular shift special yeah so this is uh i mean this is i think like kind of folklore maybe danny I think like kind of folklore. Maybe Danny can tell me if I'm wrong. So you can find this in Cousin Matthew Morrow, but the argument is like element theoretic, very simple. Just want to prove this rigid result. Okay. So it does some things. And if it doesn't do anything, actually, it also, you know, it doesn't do anything for interesting reasons, not just like random. Okay. So, yes. Yeah, this is not correct. This is not a doesn't doesn't have this property, right? But Comology doesn't have virginity. With mu p coefficients or mu p tends to j coefficients. Yes, I'm going to tell you. In fact, yes, so that's a good question. So I'm going to do it right now. Yes. The new functor. You mean the Stathan extension? Yeah, by design, it will usually. Yes, exactly. Oh, wait, but not always. Like, this is not rigid, for example. Like, if I do this for any random functor, it doesn't have to be rigid. But if it was rigid to begin with, it's just rigid. Yeah. So for functors which has this topological feeling, Sometimes which has this topological feeling, I rigid it's like topological-ish, kind of. Yeah. Is it all the same, more less? Ah, okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, no. Not smooth. You leave the goal of polynomial algebra. So, I'm getting some details, but yes. But smooth is like. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But here's a definition I'm going to make that exactly what Sid suggested. So if X is any affine scheme over Fp, any, including non-Eutherian craziness, then Then I'm going to define syntomic homology of x to be well as a shift to be L Z mod p j sin. I'm just going to do this left hand extension. Just do it. Okay, I'm just going to define this on X as the left fan extension. X as the lifetime extension of this thing evaluated on it. And that's exactly what you just said. Just do this for like path cohomology in degree one, you get something. Any question? Yes, but now we just expand it. So there's a good reason why this is a good idea. Okay, so this is, so this atomic homology that you're looking at is the one that's defined by Bartman and Schultz in this equicharacteristic situation. In this equi-characteristic situation, which is less interesting. I mean, the power of their theory is that it works on Mecharacteristic, but it's like the same thing that they've done. So they've defined this thing via some other formula, and it turns out that you're just doing this, but the other formula gives you more access to computation. And I'm going to tell you how to access this object in the last five minutes by telling you about the following lemma, which is kind of the main tool behind anything that. Main tool behind anything that Matthew and I do. Lemma. And I guess it's possibly known to illusy to block in the smooth setting, at least, but somehow not really recorded. So Z mod P JSON has a finite increasing Increasing filtration of length 2 times J plus 1. So there's like a fail 0, you fail one, you fail two times j plus 1, and then you get back synthomic. Okay, with graded pieces, that feels nice. Yeah, so let me just say if I just cover these things up, just cover these funny things up, all right, just cover this L, that's an etal sheaf. But if I take L, like why is it an etal sheaf, for example? How do you prove anything? Oh, you don't know. You don't know. It's one of the first things you should establish when you left con extend functions. Correct. Correct. Yes. So it's very drastic. So if I take L of K theory on smooth schemes, the K theory on smooth schemes is a Nisnavic shape, but L of it is not. It just fails. Fails so there's something going on, uh, but agreed pieces are given by this. So L the cotangent, the jth power of the cotangent complex Fp minus J minus one, Lj minus one over Fp shifted by minus J, da da dot L zero, Fp shifted by minus one, and then you're just going to sneak around L zero blank Fp. sneak around L 0 blank Fp 0 L J blank over F P shifted by minus J So yes clotus graded pieces are powers of the cotangent complex is L of O yes like funny all right All right. So, okay, so as a corollary of this, for example, ZMOT PJSYN has et al. descent. Quite nice already, because these things are objects, cosique and objects, and therefore it's etal descent. Even better, yes, FPQC descent. Again, because they are quasi-coherent objects. And even better, ESA has the formal functions theorem. So he doesn't take a blow-up square to a pullback square, but it does it with like with all the thickenings, for example, because also it's positive coherent. So this is the key point in Weibel's conjecture that. Weibos conjecture that Tess alluded to. So if I take a pullback, if I have a blow-up square, right, then I apply the ZPJSIN. You can ask, does it take it to a long exact sequence or not on cohomology? It doesn't, but it does it if you take into account all thickenings of the ideals that you blew up at. And write it for you later, maybe. Yeah. Proceedage descent, that's the word. Proceedish descent, that's the word. Yeah. All right. So maybe I won't prove this, but it uses the Cati isomorphism in a very important way. So the key. The key is this isomorphism between C inverse of omega j of A. So you reduce everything to you, you prove that this filtration. everything to you you prove that this fluctuation uh is the fluctuation of this one smooth or polynomials even and then you extend the fluctuation uh c inverse of a is a nice there's an isomorphism between this and you know the drunk homology of a degree j just like the kernel of d modulo the image in the drama complex locally All right, so let me finish off in the last maybe three minutes or so about the relationship with K-theory. So this whole lecture was about telling you that there's an etal version of this strategy that works. It kind of works up to a blip for surfaces at a bad characteristic, but for everything else, But for everything else, there's like a good reason why this syntomic homology things vanish is because of coherent cohomology, basically, because of coherent reasons. So then I have to tell you that this has something to do with K0 at all, K-theory. So this object has already appeared in Noah's talk. So you have this K-theory. And I'm looking at K-theory with mod P coefficients. And a bad characteristic in over on schemes over FP. So we wish to say something about this, but we've only said something about the eta approximation of this K-theory gadget. Okay, so I'm going to tell you what this thing called TC with mod P coefficients are. That's the definition. And it's going to come very well motivated now that you know all the words. Know all the words, maybe. So, first, you take K-theory, you restrict it to smooth schemes, smooth FP algebras. That's the first thing you do. And then you do this L thing. Now, from smooth affine FP algebras to all FP algebras. Not from polynomials. So for polynomials, it doesn't quite work. So, for polynomials, it doesn't quite work. You need a little bit more because K3 doesn't have etal descent. You do this, and then you et al shift this entire gadget. You enforce etal descent, you enforce this long check diagram at the beginning of this talk to actually work out. So, this whole story is valid for an approximation of k-theory called TC, which this is not, this is a bad definition, but there's a definition that Noah gave, which is the good definition, but this is like the simple-minded definition. So, you should at the same time. Simple-minded definition. So you should attribute it to Geisler has a hold and posit my tomorrow. But whatever TC is, is really just etal T theory. It's like whatever that is. And if you do this in a when at the good characteristic, as there was a discussion about in Discussion about what happens with the rubber group. You get Thomason's like K1 local K3, Thomason's bot inverted K3. Very nice. Well, up to some blip, but yes. Okay, that's the end of the Thank you for the talk. Any questions? I actually have a question. I should have asked you this like at minute or something. You said you wrote two things there, and you said you want these two things to be for this, like the very beginning at the top. You said there's a tension between. Yes. Could you explain me what the tension was again? Or just briefly, like, right? So I want to prove something about K-theory. Okay. So I've decided that I want to go down this route. So I've decided that I want to go down this route that says I want to access this part of K theory using some cohomology groups, using some homological methods. Actual cohomology. So first I have to relate this cohomology thing called motivic homology to K-theory. And second, I need to be able to compute this homology thing. So this cohomology thing as a candidate, it could be etal cohomology. That's like what the person you would think of. But it turns out that et al. cohomology does not. Etalcomology does not really live in K-theory in the expected manner. Right. So you have to rearrange the whole gut system, the whole microbiome of K-theory in some way, or a microbiome of like motiv homology maybe. And then solve the problem. But now I'm living in this idealized world, like this crazy world, which is kind of semi-fictional. I mean, I don't know, everything is fictional anyway. But in some fictional world, where like. In some fictional world, but like I'm allowed to have et al. descent. And I can, and I tried to convince you today that this problem is solvable in this eta world. But now I have to pay the tension in the last lecture. What's like the history of this? Yes, in the 80s they were things for FTE. Things over F D. Yes. And then, because I've seen this notation for many. Yes. Yeah, I love it. Can I answer this question? Yeah. So the first definition of symptomic homology is due to Fontana messing. So if x is over fp, smooth over fp. I really love this historical question. Then they define rational symptomatic promotion. So, roughly speaking, what you do is you take Chris and Komoj of X and stick the Frobenius fixed points. Literally, R gamma Chris of X over like Zp, and you take Phi is equals to P to the J, and then you invert P. Like, take one over P first, and then you take P. Okay, so by then this is rational. But then they show that up to bounded denominators, like if X is like low dimensional relative to F P, then Lower dimensional relative to f p, then the dimension of f small relative to p, then you can form the integral structure. I mean, these denominators don't appear. So there's some definition that is like also dependent on j, it's like some rational definition. So this is like the first old school definition. Then I would say like, so Iluzi in his like big Duramwit monograph, he defined omega j log. But Ilosi was also in. But it was also inspired by Block. They were the first people to look at this immigrant J-Log thing. And then Milne interpreted this object as syntomic homology, as some et al. approximation of this putative motivic homology gadget. This was in the 80s, I think. Because there is like this survey called Motivic Homo. What is it called? The Milne survey. Oh, an article, sorry, yeah, Milne's article. Yeah, multiple commodities special bias as data function. So he explains why, you know, why he explains all this story. And then, okay, so then, you know, years went by, and I would say, yeah, and this was already very useful. This rational story with like limited data is very useful. Then, yeah. Yeah. Okay, so another important character is Geyser, Sato, and Schneider. Yes. So these guys had a definition of syntomic homology in mixed characteristic, but for smooth schemes over dedicated domains, which is outside of the scope of this lecture. But basically, the idea is like they glue together a tall homologue of the generic fiber with this syntomic hormonal. It's just a handcrafted definition of synthomic hormonality. Okay. And then. Okay, and then and then DMS. One more question. Yes. Yeah. I mean, you're sort of you're taking yeah, so you take it's the same formula. So you have some random algebra, FP algebra. I write it as a co-limit, as a simple resolution in terms of smooth algebras. Smooth algebras, evaluate the k-theory, and then take the geometricalization. This thing, yeah, it's called connective k-theory. So, this is due to button-lurry that this is the connective part of k-theory.
