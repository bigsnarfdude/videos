So then we will do the talks of the actual and there's a new message here that we're going to use. Specification language with us. So yeah, then we will resume the talks of the afternoon with Cece, who is going to talk about quantum metrological limits in this environment. So yeah, Hannah, I'm going to talk about quantum metrology. I'm going to talk about quantum control. If you have anything always. And so I first start with some background and motivation. So I assume most of you may not be familiar with quantum metrology. So assuming this all quantum metrology is the science of estimation in quantum systems. And here are a few examples. One scenario, well, we need to use quantum metropolitans like optical interferometry. Optical interferometry, where we need to estimate an unknown parameter, which is the difference between two optical passes, like the phase difference here. And so, this is we want to estimate how large the phase is. So, another scenario is like atomic clock. So, basically, in that case, you need to estimate the laser frequency. So, you use a bunch of atoms. You might also entangle them together, and then you try to estimate the laser frequency using these atoms. Of impression using these atoms. And there are also like you try to estimate like magnetic fuels or electrofuels in systems. And one platform that people usually consider is nitrogen frequency centers. So in all those scenarios, you have almost parameters in your conduct system. And you want to use your conduct system to sense these other parameters. And there are, of course, a lot of things. And uh there are of course a lot of things I uh won't go into details here. And uh as a quantum information theorist we would ask uh can quantum metrology be enhanced by any type of quantum controls? So basically I mean there are some kind of quantum operations, some kind of funnest state we can implement in those platforms in order to enhance the sensitivity of these funnel sensors. So here is a model we can consider. Model, we can consider. We can model this type of unknown parameter as some kind of point signal in a system, like a Hamiltonian or some noise. Basically, it means that we want to estimate some unknown parameter which is characterized by the signal in the boundary system. And then there are some noise, which is something we don't want. And what we can control here is how do we design the input of the boundary state and how we manipulate the boundary state. And how we manipulate the quantity state during the time evolution, and what type of measurement do we perform in the end? So, basically, the question is: how do we optimize those components in order to boost the sensitivity of the product sensor? So, that's the main focus of my talk. Oh, I have a question. So, yeah, I guess you have to assume that the noise doesn't act while the control is acting. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, so that's a very very good point. So, in fact, this is actually a defect of those types of theory. Of those types of theory, but it's kind of like, yeah, so we have to start with the non-photographic case in order to move it to the photo. It's kind of like a limit we can get. So if there's no noise, then what is the ultimate limit? Okay, so then I'm just going to start with a very basic example to tell you what is the opportunity and challenges in this field. So the example would be first a single photon First, a single photon paxander interferometry. So basically, you just have one photon pass through the 50-50 bin liter twice, and then there's this phase, additional phase in the output port. So when you try to detect the photon number in the output detector, you would see that the probability of getting a photon in the upper part is like cosine squared phi over 2, and phi is the phase we want to estimate. So this is an unknown parameter. You want to estimate the. On the parameter, you want to estimate in this protocol. And so basically, you just repeat the experiment so many times. You flip a coin, and then the point of getting a head is like cosine square phi over 2. And then you do it so many times. And then you try to estimate 5 from this type of experiment. And so basically, what you are trying to do is first, you just do the experiment so many times so that you get a rough estimate about how large P. About how large P upper is. And then, based on the relation between P upper and phi, which is the face, you can sort of infer the value of phi through the inverse function. And you can also see that the smaller delta p is, the smaller delta phi is. So, they're kind of related to each other, and the steeper the slope is, actually, the higher. Actually, the higher precision you can get. So, this is just one single photon, and then there's nothing fancy here. And the second scenario I'm going to consider is like you have like n uncorrelated photons. So, basically, it's like a tensor product structure of like n photons, or you can write it this way. So, like you have n photons in the upper port and zero photons in the lower port, and then it passes through 50-50 boom silvers again. So, we are going to count like how many. So, we are going to count how many photons we can detect in the upper and low point. And basically, it will be a binomial distribution. It's just like you sort of flip the coin so many times. And then based on the distribution, you can also infer the value of phi. So, basically, you just need to use the classical probability theory. There's a central limit theorem saying that the estimated error, which is the Estimator error, which is this standard deviation of an estimator, is going to be proportional to 1 over the square root of n. So it's like, yeah, so it's just come from the classical probability theory. And it depends on the condition that these photons are occurrelated. So, and this type of scaling is really called standard boundary limit, or like short noise delivery. So it's actually achievable if you have only product state. So, it's not fancy, but it's not always achievable because sometimes you have other imperfections in your experiment. But basically, this is called standard boundary limit. And now I'm just going to talk about a third scenario, which is also the case where we have n-photons. But now, n-photons is not uncorrelated to each other, so it's like they are entangled. So, and the type of state I'm going to consider as an input state is called moon state. Call new state. So I'm not going to talk about how to prepare this state, it can be quite complicated, but basically the state itself is a superposition between N0 and 0N. So basically the photon is either in the upper part or in the lower part. And there's nothing in between them. So you can see that after it passes through the big thin slitter in the end, there is a phase that accumulates here. So the phase difference is like n times phi. N times fine, so can I ask a question? So, a meta question, which is I know about the noon state preparation, but of course it's very complicated to prepare the noon state, right? So, is there an assessment of like the resource capabilities you need to prepare noon states and make a fair comparison of like a non-moon based and a noon-based metrology scheme where you include all the resources, including the preparation of the noon state? Sorry, so yeah, I think some people do that. I'm not familiar with the literature, but I do think there are some type of resource analysis going on there. But yeah, I'm not familiar with this. Yeah. Okay, so thanks for the question. Okay, so basically, like in the end, you are going to see some kind of interference in the upper output. So basically, when the photon number So basically when the photon number is like uh even you have a constructive interference and the photon number is uh odd you have a destructive interference and and in the end when you calculate the statistic you're going to find out that the probability of getting even number of photons is like this cosine squared m phi over 2 and the probability of getting an odd number of photons like sine squared m phi over 2. So it's basically identical to the one full down case but then phi is But then phi is going to be replaced by n times phi in this case. So and then back to this invert function picture. Basically you first estimate what is phi up and then you just infer the value of phi from this invert function. And then you might wonder why can we have a different value of phi that gives you the same p up. And this is actually not the focus. This is actually not the focus of quantum methodology because basically we always assume like phi in a very small region. Like you already know the prior distribution pretty well and the response to push-sensitivity limit. And so for example here we can assume like phi is around zero. So it's a very small signal. And so basically you can see from this distribution that the estimation error is going to be proportional to 1 over n in this case, which is actually quadratically better than the previous case. Quadratically better than the previous case. And this is usually called standard, sorry, Heisenberg limit. So it's a different limit from the previous case. And it is actually the optimal limit you can get. So noon state is the optimal state you can input to this Mach Lender interactor. And okay, so everything seems well now, but I haven't talked about noise in the evolution, so now I'm going to talk about it. So you do consider there's photon loss. You do consider their spot-on loss in the system. So it basically means that you might have some fictitious beam splitter with transmissivity smaller than one. So it basically means that there are some probability that you lose photon during the evolution, which is a very natural assumption about the noise. And you can do the math and uh calculation and and it turns out that the output quantum state is going to have like two parts. The first part is going to be this uh noon state, noiseless noon state part. Noon state, noiseless noon state part, with this n times 5 phase difference. But then the bad thing is that there's this eta to the power of n in front of it. So basically it's going to be exponentially small when you take n e goes to infinity. So it's like as long as you take eta to be a constant and then you take n goes to infinity, then using this type of node state, it's not going to give you anything meaningful because everything is going to blast in the end. So you can no longer achieve You can no longer achieve Heisenberg limit using new state anymore. And so, this is a challenge. There's noise in the quantum system, and you still try to boost the sensitivity. Basically, as long as there is noise, you need to do some quantum controls in order to make sure your sensor behaves better than this type of exponential decay scenario. So, basically, we could ask the question: can bomb controls for Controls, for example, like quantum air pressure help in this case. And okay, so these are the background: like what is the motivation to study quantum metrology and what is the challenge here. And now I'm just going to talk about some theoretical results. So the first part I'm going to follow is called the quantum channel estimation. And I assume you can do arbitrary quantum controls without noise. So quantum control has no noise, but only. So, quantum control has no noise, but only the quantum signal has noise. So, then the scenario basically goes like this. So, you can assume you have an arbitrary quantum channel, so it can be any quantity channel, but then it is a one-parameter quantum channel. So, you have some unknown parameter omega inside this quantum channel. For example, you can write it as the cross-operator representation, and each cross-operator is a function of omega, and it is differentiable along omega, along zero. So, this is the basic assumption. And you can ask the question: if you have many copies of the same quantity channel, what is the type of sensitivity limit you can get? So, for example, in this diagram, I have a sequential structure. It means you have one probe and a very large ancillary system. And then this quantum channel acts on the same probe over and over again. And then you can do arbitrary quantum controls, state prevolution, and measurement. Prevolution and measurement throughout the entire procedure. And I call this sequential strategy, and it is actually the most general strategy I consider here. And you can ask, like, what is the sensitivity you can get in terms of estimating omega in this process? And there are actually two types of estimate limit. I already introduced it before. So one is delta omega proportional to 1 over n, which is the standard point of limit. Sorry, the height. Standard point limit, sorry, the Heisenberg limit, and then there's other thing called standard point limit, which means delta omega is proportional to 1 over square root of omega. So there's this type of two type of limit. And then there's another strategy that people also use a lot, but it's not as general as sequential strategy. It is really called a parallel strategy. So basically, you can have a very large system, you can prepare a very large input state, and then Large input state, and then each of the corner channels acts in parallel on each of the tropes, and then you do an upstream measurement again. So it is not as general as a sequential strategy because, for example, you can put this control operation as a swap operation, and then it reduces back to the sequential strategy. So and then basically, right now I'm going to focus on what are the sensitivities of these two strategies for a very general problem channel. So this is the So, this is the main result. So, basically, we find that there's this kind of dichotomy behavior for this type of channel estimation. So, after you optimize over all the quantum controls, you are only going to get two sensitivity limits. One is the Heisenberg limit and the other one is standard quantum limit. So, it is sort of surprising that there is nothing in between. So, basically, you either get this Heisenberg limit, you get the standard model limit. When you get a standard model. So you cannot get some intermediate region. And in order to determine whether or not you can get a standard mean, you need something called HNKS function, which I'm going to talk about in the later slides. And so this is the result about the scaling of the sensitivity. And then people might also care about the constant. So for example, you you can think about when you take the n goes to infinity, like what ex That n goes to infinity, like what exactly is this symbolic coefficient here? So you have this coefficient with respect to the Heisenberg limit and also coefficient with respect to the standard quantum limit. And luckily, we also find out that you can basically use a bunch of error factor protocol to achieve this optimal coefficient here. So yeah, that's the result. But basically, in this talk, I'm going to only focus on the first part due to the time constraint. The first part due to the time constraint. Okay, so now I'm just going to tell you a little bit about what is this HMKS condition and what's the physical meaning of that. So again, consider a pony channel that is a function of one parameter. And the HNKS condition basically says that if the condition is satisfied, you can achieve the high support limit using some error correction protocol. Regression protocol, but if it is not, you are going to have the standard point limit. So if you have this sketch over here, so cross span is the span of operators, and h is a Hermitian operator that they are both functional of this quantum channel. So basically, give you a quantum channel, you can calculate the latest hypercommand, the wattage across band. And if it is outside the crossband, you can actually have an infinite. So here's the precise definition. It looks a bit complicated. But basically, the Hamiltonian represents the signal in your quantum system. Like, how large is the quantum signal in your system? And cross band represents the structure of the noise in your system. Like, it is a span of operator that looks like ki dagger kj. So this is the crossband. And the Hamiltonian, it is a function of this derivative with respect to omega. Derivative with respect to omega and it looks complicated, but uh here is a simple example. You can consider a unitary channel without models. So for example it is e to the power of minus i g omega. And after you just plug it in here and you can calculate that the Hamiltonian is exactly equal to this g of so basically it's it's just a generator of this unitary rotation. I guess any question I guess any question by now? Okay, so no question. Okay, so now I'm just going to give you a very simple example, which is a single QB channel. So for single QB channel, we can consider this type of noisy system where we have a noisy operator E. And I assume the Hamiltonian is like a Paul Dz operator. So and in this scenario, if And in this scenario, if the error is also positive Z operator, we would have the crossband equal to the span of identity and the Z operator. So basically, the Hamiltonian is going to be inside the crossband in this case, and the Heisman limit is not achievable. And another scenario would be you have a bit-flip noise. So in that case, the cross band is going to be the span of identity and X operator. And the Hamiltonian is clearly not inside the cross. Hamiltonian is clearly not inside the first band. So, in fact, you can find an air fraction model to achieve the Heisenberg limit. So, that's this example. And now, I'm just going to go to the details about how do we achieve those sensitivity limiting, this specific example. So, first, if there's no noise, we just have this Hamiltonian equal to polyz, and it wouldn't happen. So, we just prepare. It wouldn't happen. So we just prepare a single qubit point state and then we let it evolve n steps and then we do the measurement in the n. So we can simply use this plus state between 0 and 1. And you can see that after n steps, the phase difference is going to be omega times n. So clearly you recover the Heisenberg limit in this case. So this is sort of a a natural result. Of a natural result. And another case where you can also achieve the Heisenberg limit is to use this parallel strategy. So basically, you just prepare this GHZ state, and then you apply this unitary evolution on each of the probes. And then in the end, you also have this phase difference, omega times n. So again, then you achieve the isomer limit when there is no modes. And now, what happens if there's like bit flip noise? So, as I said previously, we can actually achieve the Hezenberg limit in this case. And then, how do we actually achieve that? So, basically, we need one probe and one answer. So, then in that case, we just use this: the input state should be the equal superposition between logical zero state and logical one state. And the logical zero and logical one are. And the logical 0 and logical 1 are 0, 0, and 1, 1, respectively. So, and then we can use error correction to correct away all the bit flip noise with this type of reputation code. So, basically, when there's an error occurs, because we assume the ancillary has no noise, so the error only occurs on the S, the probe system, and then you can see that the parity between See that the parity between these two spins changed. And so basically, you can just measure z tens of z operator, and then if you find out the parity change, you just flip the first qubit with operator x, and otherwise you don't do anything. So in the end, you can do a perfect air fraction in this specific setting, and you can get the Heisenberg in the end. So it would be as if you have no noise at all once you have this noiseless ancillary outgoing. Noiseless and silo going on over here. And I guess another case where you can also achieve the high summary limit is to use this parallel strategy. So and in fact you don't need to even change your input state. Input state is still the JH test state. But you do need to do an air pressure step in the end. So basically you just need to do the majority voting. Like if you get more zero than one, 0 than 1, you just flip everything to 0, and then if you've got more 1 than 0, you just flip everything to 1, and then you do the measurement in the end. And as long as this p is not like 1 or 2, you can basically make sure the noise is infinitesimally small, and then you recover as much as the end. So, okay, and then the bad news is that if you have the phasing voice, and then it is basically identical to the Hamiltonian. Identical to the Hamiltonian ecosystem and then they sort of overlap with each other, then there's nothing you can do to achieve the isomer. Basically, you are going to stuck with a standalone kit. And one way to do that is simply to use the product state. Like, you just prepare this. I'm sorry, there's no L here. So you just prepare this plus data and then you make M obvious and then you do the measurement and then using that you recover standard quality unit. So that's the scenario for The scenario for the single qubit Polynesium Hamiltonian case. And I'm going to talk about some proof technique at this, but if there is any question, please ask. Okay, good. So I guess the key technique to prove this result is to use something called primer bound. Something called primarily bound. So it basically states that the estimation precision has a lower bound, which is one hour square root of n times f, where n is the number of experiments and f is called quantum fission information. It is actually a function of only the quantum state. So basically, given a quantum fishing information, you can actually find an optimal measurement that achieves this fission information. So, basically, the measurement part is sort of trivial. You just need to find out what is the output state. And then it has some relation to Boret's distance, if anyone knows that it, but it's not important. So basically, it describes the sensitivity of a quantum state at certain local points. For example, if you want to estimate omega at omega equal to zero, then it is basically the second order derivative of the press state. Second-order derivative of the press distance as at this omelet equal to zero. And the good thing about quantum parameter boundaries is it is saturable sympathetic. Basically, if you assume you do a number of measurements sufficiently many times, you can, in principle, saturate this quantum parameter. So basically, in the end, it boils down to how to calculate this quantum information of a specific quantum state. And like you can actually get two types. You can actually get two types of upper bound on the fission equation in the sequential parallel strategy. And basically, when the HNKS condition is satisfied, the upper bound is going to be like quadratic. And then when the condition is violated, the upper bound is going to be linear. So like and then you just use error pressure protocol to achieve this upper bound. And then that basically summarized the whole proof. And I'm not going to talk about how to do error pressure. Going to talk about how to do error fraction, it's a bit technical and too much details, but I'm going to briefly talk about how to derive these upper bounds. So, to derive these upper bounds, you need to use something called the channel extension method. So, in order to use that, we first need to define what is the quantum fusion information of a quantum channel. So, previously, I said the quantum fusion information is a function of the quantum state, but you can make it a function of the quantum channel by optimizing over. By optimizing over all the input states. So basically, you just write down the feature information of the output state, but then you optimize over all the input, and then you define on the feature information of a bottom channel. And then there are some techniques that allows you to write down the formula of this channel QFI. And it looks like this. So it's a bit complicated, you don't need to remember any details, but basically, you have like two types of optimization to do. The first is To do here, the first is you want to minimize this trace thing over all cross-representation of the same funder channel because there can be different cross-operator representation of the same format channel. And then you want to minimize that over all possible cross-oper representation. And then you also want to maximize that over all the pure state. And uh it is actually something that uh is not easy to to uh not easy to compute, but Easy to compute, but if you allow your channel to be extended to an unbounded and similar system, then everything becomes simpler. So it equivalently means that you just put a tensor product beside entity in your representation of a panel channel. And then when you find out that the supreme before, which is valid to the pure state, becomes a density operator here. Operator here. And in fact, you can simplify that to this formula over here, and then it is efficiently computable as a semi-definite program. So basically, by allowing your channel to be extended to an ancillary system, you usually simplify the calculation of quantification information. And this actually allows you to write down some upper bound on the fishing information when you have the sequential strategy and the parallel strategy. Have the sequential strategy and the parallel strategy. So basically, you can write down the upper bound of the quantum fishing equation that has two terms. One is linear, the other is quadratic. So we recall that there's this dichotomy behavior. Like if the quadratic term is like zero, then the fission emission is like linear. And then if this term is like non-zero, you have room to achieve the heis of limit. And so basically, And uh so basically the the Heisman limit is not achievable if there exists a cross-opperative representation such that this beta operator is zero. So that's basically the rough picture about this truth temperature. So yeah, so basically yeah, sure. I mean you said this like these bounds are like achievable. I mean there's these like users that like you cannot really achieve the gamma route bound like perfect. Achieve the ground or outbound perfectly if you don't, if you're not in the local regime, but if you not perfectly know what the parameter value is. Does this error correction stuff still work if you have maybe like a small Bayesian prior or this kind of things, or is this problematic? So I think in the case where we can achieve the Heisenberg limit, you can actually do that because there is this phase estimation algorithm. Estimation algorithm. So, basically, you can always refer to the phase estimation algorithm in the noiseless case because if there's no noise in the system, you can use that. And then I'm not sure, it might give you a log overhead, but in principle, you can still sort of achieve that. But in the standalone limit case, I'm not entirely sure. Of course, if you have, like, say, like, a product state, then yeah, I think it should be, yeah, it should be. I think it should be, yeah, it should, in principle, you should achieve a problem. But then, if you have a very complicated type of state, I'm not entirely sure what would be the best element to achieve. Yep, so your product basically we assume is like a local SMB. Any other questions? Okay, good. So yeah, so basically all of the Yeah, so basically all the previous discussion is based on you can do like arbitrary quantum controls. You can prepare arbitrary input states, arbitrary quantum controls, and you even have this concept called noise-less answer. And now I'm trying to figure out what happens if I cannot do general panel controls. And basically I can ask the question what happens if you cannot do quant error functions. It's sort of like in the in this error error which you like you cannot do quantities if you You like, you cannot control the aircraft if you don't like mid-circuit measurement and so on. So, okay, so this is the previous picture I mentioned. If you want to do a sequential strategy, you need like two very essential components. One is that you need this noiseless sensor over here, which is basically can be a very expensive resource in practice. And then the other thing is you need to do quantum controls repetitive. Controls repetitive, and then it is not something that is always allowed in the quality system. And then, okay, so what about the parallel strategy? So, in the parallel strategy, you only need to do the preparation and measurement once. So, that's good. But you definitely need to have a very large system size in order to achieve the highest unit. And also, besides a large system size, you need a long-range entanglement, like tree data state. Long-range entanglement, like GHZ state, type of thing. So, this is also quite challenging in practice. So, now I'm just going to ask what happens if you don't have those states. What is the estimation of limit you can get? Oh, sorry, unfortunately. So, just to clarify the previous part of the talk, so when you talk about whether the Heisenberg limit is achievable, there's no difference between these two kinds of limits. Yeah, so yeah, it's kind of surprising, but basically, they are. Surprising, but basically, they are equivalent. So, in terms of whether or not Heisman is such. Basically, this is the most restrictive strategy I'm going to consider. So, it involves the situation where you don't have noiseless answer. So, you just prepare a state and then the channel act on it. And then the quantum control are only like unital controls. Unit or controls. So we're only going to allow like CBTP maps. So this is a restrictive setting I'm going to consider. And the motivation is basically that you don't really have noiseless SL ecosystem. And also, like, for example, in single qubit case, unital controls can be performed with, like, randomness and not just unitary case. But if we are in order to do, like, C B D B controls, we do need to have sign acceleration systems. We do need to have some acceleration instead. So, and then, of course, I'm also going to consider the case where you are allowed to do CBTV controls. And so you might wonder whether or not you can do error correction in this setting. If we don't have SLR, can we do error production? And in a specific example, I'm going to consider which is the single cubic, because you cannot do error production. You will be civic. So you definitely need SL to do that. SL to do that. And there's this other strategy, which is called bounded NCLS sequential strategy. And so basically in this case, I'm allowed you have a constant number of noise less ancillary, but you don't have like an infinite number. So it does not grow with respect to n. And then in this case, I also assume we have only a uniform control. So you also cannot do quantum error contributions in this type of. Cannot do quantities in this type of image because if you want to do CBDB control each step, you do need an infinite amount of SIM. So and my result is only for QB channel. And for QB channel, we can actually classify QB channel into three different types of scenario. You have different estimation limits. And the first scenario is like a unitary channel. So basically, it's just a simple Hampton Liberal Technology. It's just a simple Hampton rotational result point. So, and in that case, you don't need the error pressure to achieve the Hezbollah system. And then, the second type of QB channel is called defacing class channel. So, basically, it means that you can always do some rotation to make it a defacing channel. So, it's like you do some rotation and then you apply the defacing channel, and then you do some other rotation, and then the decomposition of your defacing cluster. Dephasing cluster. And you can also define the rotation generator of the first rotation and the second rotation. I call it like H0 and H1. And then all the other channels should be strictly contractive channels. So what do I mean by that? Basically, if you allow up to input rho and sigma, and then you try to figure out what's going on with this data processing inequality with this. Quality with this trace norm. And we're going to find out that the trace norm always shrinks after the application of the monochannel. So all other channels besides these two are strictly contractive channels. So these are the three classes of channels I'm going to consider here. And now I'm just going to demonstrate the results here. So we have unitary channel and then we have two types of diffusion channels. I'm going to talk about their difference later. About their difference later. And then we also have strictly contracted triangle. And then for the strategy here, we have the previous result, which is sequential or parallel strategy. We can also have this ancillary-free sequential strategy within the control, or with CBDP control, or like this bonded ancillary strategy. So basically, what we are going to find out is like basically for all those type of channels, that is not a unitary channel. Of channel that is not unitary channel, you can no longer achieve the heist improvement. So, even if this condition holds, you still cannot achieve the highest improvement. So, that's one thing. And then the other thing is that there's actually some separation between these channels. So, I'm just going to talk about it in bit detail. So, the first thing we notice that the the first column here is basically the uh Hamiltonian nodding crossband conditions. Hamiltonian nodding crossbank condition. So in order to to derive this, you basically just need to prove that every strictly contractive channel satisfies the uh, violates the HFKS condition. So this part basically evolves from the previous result with some calculation on a strictly contractive channel. And then the other part, which is this part, is a bit non-trickable. Basically involves like proof that we Involves like a proof that we cannot achieve Heisenberg limit without, say, Excella or CPTP controls. And in order to prove this upper bound, we use the modified channel extension method. So basically recall that in the previous sequential and parallel strategy, we have this channel extension upper bound, which is we have a linear term and a quadratic term. And uh the quadratic term is nonzero if the Ha the Hamplane is not equal to constant. So Doing is not equal to cross-print. So basically, it does not directly give you a linear algorithm for all types of online channels. And okay, so now I'm just going to consider this specific channel for illustration. So if you apply this type of upper bound to the CLA-3 case, you actually are going to write down in a bit refined version of this upper bound. Of this upper bond. So it also has like two terms. The first term is like related to some alpha, which depends on k. So k goes from one to n, so it depends on each point of controls in each step. And you also have this additional term. So the additional term here is actually going to be quadratic. So why is that? Because we have this operator gamma here. It's linear. So if you take the sum of some linear terms, it's going to give you like a quadratic scaling. Quadratic scaling. So it does not directly give you our result. But if we take a closer look, we are going to see that there is some kind of algebraic structure going on here. So beta operator is going to be poly z in this case. And then the gamma operator has this type of iteration relation going on here. So basically, every time gamma is going to be To be affected by this bit flip operation. And then you also have this ODZ additive. So without too much calculation, you are going to see gamma is going to be linear, but that doesn't mean this whole thing is going to be quadratic. So actually, you are going to play with this mass a little bit, and you are going to find out that this upper bound is actually. Find out that this upper bound is actually a linear substrate. So, okay, so this is the modified Shino extension method. So, basically, it proves the upper bound in this case. And in order to prove this N3 over 2, you do need to put a bit more technique over here, and I'm not going to talk about it. So, basically, they all involve using the modified channel extension. And then the other thing is, how do we achieve this? How do we achieve this standard model limit? So you might wonder, like our previous sort of said, like standard boundary limit is sort of like trivial thing, so you can attribute misquala state. But it is in fact not that trivial if you consider this sequential strategy, because I don't allow mid-circuit measurement, so I don't allow measurement like n times during the evolution. So basically, I'm asking, like, is there something that I can only do measurement only once that is still Only once that it still achieves the standard of net. And so, basically, in order to achieve this type of boundary searchable, you can basically find out that there exists a unitary control sequence that achieves a standard limit in that case. So, okay, so this is what it looks like. So, I'm not going to talk about it in detail, but basically, every unit are assumed to be the same, and it is a rotation in z direction. Rotation in z direction, but it's an angle that is has a scaling one over the square root of n. So and taking the limit of angles to infinity, you are going to figure out that if you start with some bonus state pointing in the x direction, after n steps, you are going to have a bonus state that is also roughly pointing to the x direction, but then you have some n 1 over square root of n scaling in the y direction. In the y direction. And then this type of thing allows you to have a derivative of a bonus state that has a scaling squared of it. So if you recall that the estimation precision is actually going to be 1 over the scaling of this derivative. So basically, if you achieve a derivative that is squared of 1, you actually achieve the step 1. So that's the measurement strategy through Tigla. I mean this W constant, does it depend on omega? It does not depend on omega. So basically it's like you cannot take it to be zero, but when you take it to be like absolutely close to zero, you get better scale. So kind of a symptom. So yeah, so okay, so so like all those results actually work And all those results actually work only in the case where we have a Hamiltonian not in the crossband. So, if you remember what that is. So, basically, in order to achieve this standard boundary limit, you actually need to assume this unitary rotation is not in the crossband. So, if the unitary rotation is in the crossband, basically, you have a Hamiltonian in the Z direction and noise also in the Z direction. So, in that case, you can. So, in that case, you can. I don't know how to achieve this type of standard alone. So, basically, I only managed to prove that if you can only do unit of controls, then you get at most a constant as the fission in the output. So, and I'm not going to talk about it in detail. And finally, we also need to prove for a strictly contracted channel, the facial emission is also constant. Is also constant. So it is going to be a completely different proof for the third line over here. So basically, it requires you to calculate the contraction coefficient with respect to the ponytail coefficient. So what do I mean by that? So because we all know that data processing in quantity allows you to shrink the distance after the application of a quantity channel. And for any quantity channel, we can define such a thing called a contraction. We can define such a thing called the contraction coefficient with respect to trace distance. And then for any strictly contractive channel, this is smaller than one. So that's basically the definition of a strictly contractive channel. And in order to prove anything useful in terms of the quantum channel estimation, we actually do need to more use a different concept called the contraction coefficient with respect to quantum fission coefficient. And what is that? So basically, So basically, you use the data processing quality for quantum fission. So basically, if you act any quantum state on a one parameter quantum state, sorry, any quantum channel on a one parameter quantum state, the fission emission is going to be smaller or equal to the previous case. And then the ratio between it is going to be the contraction coefficient. And so basically we managed to prove that for QV channel, the The eta2 here is smaller than or equal to eta1. So basically, then that means for any strictly contractive channel, its coefficient with respect to the point of fission region is actually smaller one. So and then use that and QFIS in relation to press distance, we we are able to show that the fission region in the end is going to be a constant. So it basically involves a bunch of triangular inequality and uh uh ratio and SO and Uh, ratio, and as well, I'm not going to talk about anything here. So, uh, that's this. So, so, better to summarize here, um, previously, like what we already know is that there's this like automatic behavior between Heisenberg limit and the standard limit. And it all boils down to whether the H and KS function holds. So, if it holds, you get the quadratic, and if it fails, you get the static moment. And what would And what we managed to prove as a new result is there's actually a separation between unit error channel and all noisy channel in a single cubic case. If we consider this situation where we cannot do quantum error fraction. And there's also a strict separation between the phasing class channel of the first type and the phasing class channel of the second type and the strictly contractive channel. And something we don't know here is whether there are separation between Is whether there are separation between these three strategies. So we don't know whether this strategy behaves similarly or not. So we just prove some bound. They don't look the same, but basically we also don't know is there any separation. And we also don't know if there is any separation between the phasing class channel of the second file and the strictly contracted channel. So in the strictly contracted channel channel channel So in the strictly contractive case, you mentioned that the QFI is constant. I thought actually that this decays exponentially with M. You mean that constant is actually a G o or is this? I'm not sure if that's a true. So this part I only write at this big old table, but here it's a true because if you can do CBDB control you can always do a replacement channel in the end and keep the constant. So if you have CBDB control is achievable, but if that is unit or I I'm not sure. Yeah, because I know we're some work like in context of error mutation, but at the end, looking at the quantum vision information. And precisely, if you have strictly active math, then you can show that the QFI has two degrees explanation. Yeah, yeah, that that could be the case, yeah. Yeah, I see. So, uh yeah. So, uh, yeah, so that's basically the end. Uh so to summarize, I basically discussed how the structure of noise and the Hamiltonian determines the estimation precision limiting metrology. And also, one message is that point air patching is powerful, it can recover the Heisenberg limit and also achieve the symptomic coefficients optimally. And also, if you cannot do polymer air parachuting, the sensing limit are going to be compromised, but then you still have some this. But then you still have some type of separation between different types of channels, and such dichotomy behavior still exists. And some possible future direction to, of course, to consider what happens if there's noise in your control, like state reverse and measuring noise. So I guess another thing is to think about what happens if you have a finite number of channels, because all the discussion will only care about the scaling, the symbolic confusion, and the Know the symbolic of fusion and labels have a real finite number of channels that include the optimal state that's on. And of course, we can also consider other types of noise or signal like correlated noise, like with distributed video sensing and so on. So, yeah, that's good. I am probably also interested in this non-asymptotic stuff. And I mean, what is your intuition? Do the same constructions that you use here also, should it also work in a non-asymptotic setting? Also, when you look at Bayesian approaches or something like this? So I don't know anything rigorously, but my intuition is that this sort of thing might also exist in the symptom setting. Now some dog setting, but I don't know at all how to improve that. Any other astronomy? K dagger del k. If k is unitary, is known as a current, it's uh it's in the Lie algebra of the whatever u r And it's pretty used in like field theory. Or anything, any metric. You calculate metrics from circuits using this thing. And then del K dagger del K is like the trace of that is the energy term in a Hamiltonian or a field theory defined on unit theory or K theory, but more generally, you can do this with general linear matrices, like say the K's or something. Is there Um is there I wonder if there's a field theory connection? Yeah, I I'm not sure. So just to uh so uh so so basically you are saying that uh this operator also has some uh meaning. Both of them have meaning, yeah. And when k is unitary they they both play very important roles in that. Yeah, I'd be very interested to learn it because I don't know how big it is. I don't know. Like, but but oh, even without field theory in math, del k dagger del k when k is unitary is the metric on the group bar cartan or something. I'll be interested in sign off. Tracey, yeah. Now there's no talk about this thing I've made today. I think we are studying the world. There were like seven changes. One of the things that should also like I just say that is all the problem. The rules have a different classes. Also, have a different classes, but I might be able to translate your composition. Or your challenge, whatever that means. Oh, also. Yeah, so there's a way of comments. Many questions. Mike has a string of form, but I've always wondered generalization of these optimized minimizing generalization. So you probably want to do it. I think that works, right? I think it works.
