Okay, so welcome to our second. Welcome to our second afternoon session. I'm pleased to introduce Jason Crand. The title of his talk is Gaussian States over General Quantum Kinematical Systems. Thank you. And let me also start by thanking the organizers, Brian, Keith, and Volgar for putting on this nice meeting. All right, so I'll be speaking on some recent work in collaboration with Cedric Benny. With Cedric Benny, Punhe, Lee, Sangjoon Park, and Sangyoon Yoom. You can see it there if you're interested. Alright, so I was very optimistic in my abstract, so I think I'm only going to present a third of what I claimed. So given a. Oh, yeah, sorry, that way. Right, so let me just start by doing a very quick overview of bosonic Gaussian systems, and then I'll Gaussian systems, and then I'll mention sort of an abstraction of this idea and then start talking about some of our results for Gaussian states. Okay, so for a bosonic quantum system and n degrees of freedom, I mean what that means is, okay, for quantum systems, they're modeled by Hilbert spaces, right? And states, vectors in this Hilbert space, or certain operators, density operators on this Hilbert space sort of describe quantum states. Hilbert space sort of describes quantum states in this system. And in this particular situation, the pertinent Hilbert space is just L2 of Rn. Sorry, it's continuing me too useless. And on this particular space, we have this very nice projective representation of the abelian group R2n as bounded operators on L2 of Rn, given by the following. So Z, for me, Z is always going to be given by sort of two coordinates, X and Y. By sort of two coordinates, x and y. And this is just going to be a scalar multiple of translation and multiplication operators. So my is just the multiplication associated with the character induced by y. And translation, of course, is just a lot of regular representation of Rn. So y and x are both vectors in Rn. And you can combine individually as you vary x and Rn, this is going to be, of course, an actual Rn. This is going to be, of course, an actual bona fide representation of Rn. That says translation operators, same thing here as you vary y and Rn, but you can compose these together to get a nice projective representation. Okay, this is irreducible. And it satisfies sort of a version of the canonical commutation relation. So this is basically an exponentiated version, if you'd like. So t of x, we know these translation operators. This is a one-parameter groove, right? So by Stone's theorem, it has a self-adjoint generator. What is that self-adjoint generator? It's just the What is that self-adjoint generator? It's just the usual momentum operator of differentiation. And same thing here: the generator, the self-adjoint generator of this one-parameter group is going to be this sort of position operator. And so these are really just sort of exponentiated forms of position and momentum, which satisfy the canonical commutation relations. So really, this is really just kind of an exponentiated form of the usual sort of CCR that you might be familiar with. Oops. Okay, and so what is this? Okay, and so what is this delta ZZ prime that appears in this relation? So this is actually just the symplectic form, the canonical symplectic form on R2n, which if you view it as just a linear operator, is just given by this matrix here. And so the idea behind this sort of phase-based formulation of this quantum system is that this abelian group with this symplectic form, it somehow parametrizes the quantum system, L2. The quantum system L2 of Rn via the Waiu representation. And by that I mean you want to sort of parameterize or study states and operations on this Hilbert space via this phase space structure. And so one way to do that, there are multiple ways, but one very useful way is that for quantum states, which are just positive norm1 elements in trace class operators here, so my, so S1 here is denoted by, or S1. Here is denoted by, or S1 denotes the space of trace class operators in the Silvert space. So quantum state is mathematically represented by just a positive trace one operator inside there. Okay, and to such an operator, one associates a so-called characteristic function, which is now just a complex valued function on the phase space. And for just the z, you just take a trace sort of product, if you will, with rho with the vial operator corresponding to z, hold z in. Operator corresponding to z, z inverse, or sorry, minus z, I guess. Okay, and this sort of characteristic function, it actually determines the state completely. So with knowledge of chi rho, you can sort of invert, if you will, sort of chi rho via some kind of twisted Fourier inversion, you can actually recover rho through some weak operator integral representation in this way. So, in this sense, this characteristic function, which is just a complex value function on the phase space, actually can On the phase space, actually can characterize or determine quantum states uniquely. So you can think of this as some kind of non-cumulative analog of characteristic functions of usual probability measures. So quantum states, I mean, you can think of these as some kind of non-cummutative probability distribution, if you'd like, in which case this you can sort of think of as some kind of characteristic function of that non-cumutative distribution. Okay, and through these characteristic functions, a state is determined or is said to be Gaussian if its characteristic function is the characteristic function of a Gaussian distribution on the phase space R2n. Meaning that the characteristic function has the following form. So it's the exponential of some, so there's some linear term and there's some quadratic term. So here it's e to the i mz. That's e to the i mz, where m is just some fixed vector in R2n, and then minus some quadratic component given by some symmetric bilingual form alpha. And these parameters here, they have physical meaning. So m and alpha, these are really just the first and second moments of your quantum state rho relative to position and momentum. So you can actually, through this formula, you can actually calculate and show that this m vector in R2N. And R2n, let's just think of n equals 1 for simplicity. Then you have position, you have momentum, so m is going to be an R2 vector. And what's the x, what the first component of that vector is the mean value of this state, rho, relative to a measurement of position. The second component is the mean value of this state relative to a measurement of momentum. So these m and alphas are actually first and second moments of this quantum state relative to the canonical observed. Relative to the canonical observables. And the idea is that just like in classical probability, something is Gaussian if it's determined solely by its first and second moments. And so that's the idea here. A state, a quantum state, is Gaussian if it's determined by its first and second moments relative to positional momentum. Okay, and some examples, okay, if this means something to you, what are some actual concrete examples of Gaussian? Concrete examples of Gaussian quantum states. And you can take thermal states of quadratic Hamiltonian. So, really, I mean, if you just have a Hamiltonian H in, which is quadratic in the canonical variables of position and momentum, and then you can take something like e to the minus beta. Beta is just some real number, positive real number, and then you can just normalize this state. And that state is going to be Gaussian. So, such states are said to be thermal, and they're going to be Gaussian when this Hamiltonian H is quadratic in the canonical interface. Okay, so that's sort of just a very quick sort of recap of one aspect of the phase-space formulation for bosonic systems. But there are canonical phase-space structures that are important and play an important role in other quantum systems of interest. Important role in other quantum systems of interest. For instance, these Qdit systems, which of course are very important in quantum information, right? I mean, well, yeah, I mean, I guess people usually obsess over d equals 2, but there's nothing special about that. You can have sort of, so this Hilbert space C D to the n-full tensor product, this would be your sort of n qubit system, if you'd like. And on this, on this, or the with respect to this system, there's a conical phase space structure. There's some nice abelian group around, and you can. There's some nice abelian group around, and you have the, of course, you have translation and multiplication operators. You can build your finite Heisman groups and play the same thing. Also, there's a theory of piadic quantum mechanics, which originated actually in the late 80s, and then has also sort of re-emerged in the context of high-energy physics. Where they're again, phase-based, I mean, it's really the phase-space approach that motivated that entire theory. And then there's also angle number systems like quantum rotors. Angled number systems like quantum rotors, where you have where your phase space is given by the circle and the integers. Okay, now in these systems, there are some sort of scattered results that sort of have some kind of Gaussian feature to them. You could say that there's some results on some Gaussian states, whatever that might mean, but there's no general theory of Gaussian states in this context. And in particular, there have been no, to our knowledge, sort of relationship between Gaussian states on these systems. Between Gaussian states on these systems and actually Gaussian probability distributions on groups. So that was one of our motivations. But actually, our main motivation was to consider a unified theory of Gaussian channels, which has not been considered at all. And even for finite dimensions, we believe that our construction of Gaussian channels and related classes of channels can provide a sort of mathematically rich class of examples on which you can examine various. On which you can examine various sort of conjectures of interest in these five-dimensional settings. So that was really the motivation of our work. Okay, so let's then just sort of set up the framework. So in the rest of the talk, G is going to be a second countable, locally called Bactabelian group. Okay, and for simplicity, I'm just going to restrict attention to the case of two regular groups. So such a group is two regular if the doubling map is an automorphism. map is an automorphism on G. In such a case, we'll use 2 inverse to denote the inverse of this automorphism. So, what are some examples on any locally compact field whose characteristic is not equal to 2 in such an example? You find fields with appropriate characteristic, you have the reals, you have the rationals with the discrete topology, or p-adic rationals. Integers mod d is going to be too regular whenever d is odd. Whenever d is odd, because in that case, you can just explicitly write down the multiplicative inverse of 2 in this ring. Okay, and products of two regular groups are two regular, so you can take products of these examples to get more examples. But the integers mod d is not going to be true regular if d is even, of course, and the integers and the circle are not true regular. Well, a group is true regular if and only if it's one-dragon dual is also. Okay, so we're only going to. Okay, so we're only going to focus on a specific class of LCA groups, those of this form here. So G is going to be, this is sort of analogous, a generalization of R2N, which is R times Rn times Rn dual. So here, we're going to take F times F hat, where F is the two regular LCA group, second countable. So G is always going to have this one. And on such a group, there's a canonical Group, there's a canonical two-co-cycle, which you just get by Pointryagon duality. Okay, we normalize it in some way using two regularity, so we throw in this sort of two inverses. I mean, don't worry about this formula. But the point is that there's a canonical co-cycle which determines a bi-character, which is kind of a generalization of the symplectic form, okay, here. So don't worry about this. Well, I mean, so you have your, okay, so you have your pairs, x is an f, gamma is an f hat. An f, gamma is an f hat, and how does this, what is this symplectic pairing? Well, you pair the first, you pair gamma with x hat, and then you sort of pair x with gamma prime with the conjugate, which is just like subtracting it as we had before. Okay, so you get this nice bi-character, and this bi-character induces sort of a nice self-duality, meaning that this map here gives you a topological group isomorphism. So we can say that G admits a symplectic self-duality. G admits a symplectic self-duality. Okay, now given we have this sort of nice, so this G with this symplectic form is going to be the abstraction of your phase space. Okay, and this symplectic form sort of gives rise to version, I mean it's a bilinear, I mean bi-character, and so you can talk about complements with respect to this bicharacter. So given a closed subgroup of G, we'll let H delta be just the set on which Delta be the just the set on which this form evaluates to one for all H and H. Call that the symplectic complement of H. We'll say that the subgroup is isotropic if it's contained in its symplectic complement. So for instance, just a trivial example, if you take any closed subgroup K times zero as a subgroup of G, then that's going to be isotropic. I'm going to say it's maximally isotropic if it's equal to its own synthetic complex. Okay, so once you have this two co-cycle around, you can consider sort of a family of projective representations of your group, right, which are multiplicative up to this co-cycle. We always consider SOT continuous, this talk. So any such representation will satisfy sort of a version of the canonical commutation relations. Okay, and so note from this. Okay, and so note from this: one consequence is that if H is an isotropic subgroup, then these, I mean, for it, if Z and Z prime belong to H, then this is always 1, and so this is actually an abelian, it's actually an abelian group. So the restriction of W, restriction of any sigma representation to an isotropic subgroup is a bona fide representation of that abelian group. And from just general theory, we know that there's actually a unique irrigation. A unique irreducible sigma representation of this group F times F hat into some Hilbert space, and there's a concrete model of it, and it's exactly sort of the generalization of what we had on the first slide. So H, the Hilbert space you can take to be L2 of F, sort of half of G. And the representation is again a composition of translation operators and multiplication operators, also known as modulation operators. Also known as modulation operators from characters. And here, this is just some kind of bi-character which is normalized using the g-regular rules of the group. All right, so just as in this bosonic system, we can study, so we have this phase space, the locally compact abelian group with this structure, with this nice symplectic form. Okay, and then we can study this sort of quantum system on this Hilbert space through this phase space structure. So, in particular, we can define. Space structure. So, in particular, we can define characteristic functions in the exact same way. So, if you have a trace class operator or a quantum state, then you can define a nice bound continuous function in the same way you had before. And just as in the case of the reals, you can recover rho through its characteristic function, again, by a sort of twisted Fourier transform. Okay, so you can define kind of a sigma Fourier transform. You have this where w is the unique, this, well, I wrote down a concrete model of it. We wrote down a concrete model of it. Okay, f goes to f hat w for something in L1, you get a nice analog of the Fourier transform. And there exists a Haar measure on your group so that this is actually, this extends to a unitary map between L2 of G and Hilbert Schmidt operators on L2 of F. And moreover, if you have a trace class operator, then its characteristic function Trace class operator, then its characteristic function is necessarily square integrable. Okay, and then this, and then applying this sort of twisted Fourier transform to this characteristic function gives you back the state rho. So in other words, we have this kind of integral representation for quantum states as we had in the case of Order. Okay, so this is all just very general theory, I mean, going back even to the 60s. Okay, but what hasn't really been done is sort of the connection with Gaussian distributions on LCA groups. So a distribution, which is just going to be synonymous with the probability measure for this talk, is said to be Gaussian if its Fourier transform, standard usual Fourier transform, has this very explicit structure. So it's the product of a character and the exponential of negative phi of gamma. Of negative phi of gamma, where phi is a non-negative continuous function which satisfies a version of the parallelogram identity. So, this was defined long ago. So, for simple examples, any point mass is going to be Gaussian because the Fourier transform is just a character. And this, of course, coincides with Gaussian distributions in the case of Rn. Here's your mean, and phi in that case is going to be your covariance matrix. Matrix, right? Because this parallelogram identity basically means that there's some quadratic form in behind, and that quadratic form is precisely the covariance matrix. But it turns out that Gaussian distributions, in this sense, are always supported on connected subsets. So for totally disconnected groups, I mean, you're Gaussian if and only if you're point mass. So somehow they trivialize in that setting. But there's a more general notion of Gaussian distribution on an LCA group, which is most. On an LCA group, which is motivated from this classical theorem of Bernstein, which says that a distribution is Gaussian if and only if for every, if you take any independent variables x and y, then their sum and difference are independent. So if you have this, if independence is invariant under sum and difference, that actually characterizes Gaussianity. And you can phrase this invariance of independence of sum and minus at the level of Fourier transfer. And minus at the level of Fourier transforms, very simply like this. Okay, so a distribution on R is Gaussian if and only if its Fourier transform satisfies this relation for all x and y. Okay, so this motivated this definition of a Gaussian distribution in the sense of Bernstein, or B-Gaussian distribution for short. So for any distribution on an L C A group, you can define this this notion just by this property of the Fourier transform. For a transform. And it was shown by Feldman, so Feldman shows actually much more. We only really need that. I think the assumption works if the connected component of the identity has at most two elements of order two, something like this. But for two regular groups, it applies. And so I'm just going to state it here for two regular groups. So it's kind of a structural result for Beacon distributions for large class of groups. It says that it's necessarily a convolution product. It says that it's necessarily a convolution product of a Gaussian distribution, as in the previous slide, and the Haar measure on a compact subgroup K of G, which satisfies this chorinicity property, meaning that 2K is equal to itself. Okay, I mean, not really worried about this. Maybe this is just to mention that there's a structure theorem for these types of distributions. Okay, and so just using the standard definition. Just using the standard definition in the bosonic case, I mean, you can define a Gaussian state. We're just going to restrict to B-Gaussian states for this talk. So, a quantum state on this Hilbert space here is going to be B-Gaussian if the characteristic function is the Fourier transform of a B-Gaussian distribution on the Point-Ragnon dual of G. So, remember, G is F times F hat, and this characteristic function is a complex valued function on G. On G. Okay, so if it's to be the Fourier transform, it's going to be the Fourier transform of some measure on G hat. Okay, so just some simple examples here. Maybe just in the interest of time, I won't really spend a lot of time on this. But I mean, it's easy to sort of write down some examples coming from, well, if you'd like, these minimum uncertainty states. So if you take F that contains a compact open two-regular subgroup, then, okay, and then just take the character. Then, okay, then, and then just take the characteristic function of k. Okay, you can translate it a bit by a vial operator, normalize it so that you have norm1 and l2. Then the rank one projection onto this unit vector is B Gaussian, and you can just write its characteristic function like this. So the characteristic function is going to be at z is the symplectic form evaluated at z0, which is coming from the translation operator, and it's the characteristic function of this, in fact, isotropic subgroup K times K curve. Okay, and these such. Okay, and these such states saturate this entropic uncertainty principle of uh that was studied in old paper nearly twenty years ago. All right, so we were able to obtain a characterization for Gaussian states, at least in this two regular setting. Okay, and we first sort of begin by invoking a well-known structure theorem by Van Campen, which says that any LCA group decomposes as. Group decomposes as a copy of Rn times some group which contains a compact open subgroup. Okay, so since the case, since Gaussian stakes on here, I mean, are very well known, we first focused on the case of FC. So let's just now consider the situation where we have a locally compact, so LCA group, two regular, which admits a compact open subgroup, and we take this corresponding phase space. Okay, then in such a situation, Okay, then in such a situation, being Gaussian, B Gaussian, so Gaussian in the sense of Bernstein, is equivalent to having this form here. Okay, so rho, we have an integral representation over the, so there's a unique compact open to regular isotropic subgroup and a unique character on that subgroup for which you can disintegrate rho through the vial operators in this way. Rho through the vial operators in this way, and this is going to be the Haar measure on this G sub C. And moreover, this is a pure state if and only if this isotropic subgroup that you get is maximally isotropic, or in other words, Lagrangian. So, if we go to the general case, then if we have a general sort of LCA group, two regular, we decompose F. Regular. We decompose F via Van Campen structure theorem. Then, of course, the Hilbert space of interest L2 of F decomposes into a canonical tensor product. Okay, and it turns out that, in fact, any, so it somehow, it turns out that by doing this case, we actually know everything now. So every B Gaussian state on here is necessarily a tensor product of B Gaussian states, rho sub n, which is Gaussian with respect to the canonical boson. The canonical bosonic phase space, and rho C, which is Gaussian on this sort of the portion which has a compact open subgroup, which we characterized in the previous slide. So what this is saying is that amongst Gaussian states on this Hilbert space, there can be no entanglement, it's necessarily separable with respect to this factorization of the Hilbert space. So there could be no entanglement amongst Gaussian states, there could be no Amongst Gaussian states, there can be no entanglement between these two pieces. It always factors. So you get that automatically, actually. So it always factors as a tensor product of a Gaussian state on this piece and a Gaussian state on that piece. So some kind of topological obstruction to entanglement. And from there, you can basically, okay, now we have a full characterization of Gaussian states on this piece, and then there's the well-known characterization on this piece, and so you can put sort of our results together to deduce. To deduce many results, one of which is that you have this sort of convex decomposition. So any E-Gaussian state on here is alongside a norm closed convex hull of pure Gaussian states. And that's true in general. Okay, so maybe, yeah, I think I'm out of time, so maybe I'll just sort of say quickly, yeah, so pure, I mean, in the Bosana case, pure Gaussian states we know are sort of coming from Gaussian vectors, meaning that it's a quadratic policy. Meaning that it's sort of a quadratic polynomial. It's the exponential of a quadratic polynomial. Okay, and so we have a version of that for pure, at least in the case of over the, when you have a Copback open subgroup, then we can characterize pure B-Gaussian states in terms of symmetric bicharacters, which is sort of playing the role of kind of your quadratic polynomial. So, in any case, we have sort of a version of this for this setting as well. And like I said, And like I said, our main motivation is actually to. So, Gaussian channels, there's sort of two pieces in the definition of a Gaussian channel, one of which is a Gaussian state. And so now we have a very sort of complete picture of what they look like, real-state groups. And so some ongoing work is to study sort of the corresponding class of Gaussian channels and their information problems. Thank you. Thank you very much. Are there any questions or comments? Any from the Zoom audience? So you said that the assumption of true regularity was mostly to simplify things. So many of these things are in fact true. So we do have results. I mean, the main characterizations that we have are really the two regular settings, but we have. Are really the two regular settings, but we have, but we all actually do have some characterizations, like for instance, where you have like these angle number systems where you have like the circle, like the torus and Zn kind of thing. So we do have some results and characterizations in non-true regular settings, but only for sort of specific examples. What is the special module? So, yeah, yeah, so that's a good question. So, um, for example, the reals and the pianic. Yeah, so the two regularity, it really allows one to normalize. I mean, so you have this canonical co-cycle, but you want to sort of normalize it in a certain way. Um and that and there's a canonical normalization when you're too regular. If you're not too regular, you can normalize it, but then you have yeah, I mean, then you have these choices that are not unique and it's it's a bit messy. Not unique and it's a bit messy. But the vile representation, yeah, there's a vial representation. I mean, you really ideally want something that ideally is involutive. And the two regularity gives you a canonical way to make it involutive. And when you're not. Yeah, so really, yeah, the simple answer, I guess, is for two regularity, you have canonical normalizations, which allow every people to. Normalizations which allow everybody to work. But if you are not too regular, then you have to make a very specific choice for your normalizations. And then, I mean, each choice gives you families of Gaussianity, you know, so yeah. So that's kind of why the restriction. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. If there are more questions, maybe you can ask Jason later or email him because our next talk should start. Our next talk should start in about two minutes. Thanks again.
