I'm gonna go chop talk. Alright, I'm gonna talk about some work that's in these two papers. Like all the hard work was done by Nick Barton, Allison Ezridge, Jerome Keller, and Ahmadi Beber back in 2013. But recently I hijacked some of my own size group to just add on a few little details. And that work was led by Ji Sun Min, who is now a postdoc with Andy. A postdoc with Andy Kern and Peter Ralph at Oregon. Okay, so yeah, hitchhiking. I'm going to focus spatial inference particularly on selection. So hitchhiking in space. Why do I give it that title? Okay, so the kind of question here is, how do we detect selective sweeps? This is our inference problem. We want to know. We want to know how many selective sleeps have happened in our population of interest, where they are in the genome, etc. Okay, so let's recall what a sweep is. I'm going to go quickly because I figure this audience knows this already. But if we look at the frequency Of our beneficial allele over time, our selected sweep is going to look something like this. Frequency rapidly goes up to one, and this time over which it rapidly increases, Is something like the inverse of the selected coefficient dragging the sweep. Oh, and yeah, actually, feel free to ask questions during the talk as well. Okay, so this is what we're looking for, and there's a bunch of different methods to find this, and they all rely on the pattern of hitchhiking that is left by this sweep. What does that mean? This sweep. What does that mean? If we look along the genome at our favorite measure of genetic diversity, so this might be, for example, the pairwise genetic diversity. What we hope for is that there's some baseline level. Is that there's some baseline level, and then whoop, here's where the sweep happened. Way less diversity, because at this site, everybody recently descends from this mutant, or from a small number of individuals who carry the beneficial allele. Okay, so we're looking for this dip in diversity on the genome. Here's the site under selection, and roughly speaking, intuitively, this width This width is saying, okay, in map units, how far away do you have to be to escape from the sweep, to not be hit by the sweep? Well, you have about time 1 over s, so you better recombine at rate s to get away. So this width is about s in Moore Games. And then And then this residual diversity here can come from different sources, but a few different interpretations, depending on the details, depending on what diversity statistic you're using. This might be something like the number of starting haplotypes. Like I said, maybe the sweep didn't start from a single mutant. Maybe there were multiple mutants. There were multiple mutants, or it could be something about the time that's elapsed since the sweep happened. Maybe actually all diversity was erased, but now it's recovered due to new mutations. If you have a sweep starting from a single mutant and you sample right at the end of the sweep, this is going to be almost down there at zero. Okay, so that's our basic pattern, and there's a bunch of different methods. Basic pattern, and there's a bunch of different methods that look for this in your genomic data. Yeah, please. The horizontal axis is position in genome. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. This is genome. Exactly. So we're totally switching, right? This is all taken as snapshot after the sweep is done. Okay, so, but I said this is supposed to be about spatial structure, and I haven't said anything about spatial structure here. Why? Because all the methods ignore spatial structure is that okay? You know, I mean, on the one hand, like, real populations are spatially structured. You know, individuals live in different places, and they don't all meet each other every generation. On the other hand, there's lots of stuff about the population that's left out of this picture. Every population has a million details. Down this picture. Every population has a million details, and you need to ignore most of them if you want to make any progress. So the question is: what bucket does spatial structure fall into? We'd really rather not have to deal with it. Okay, so intuitively, this should be okay if mixing. Spatial mixing is rapid. Like, okay, yes, you know, this individual lives over there, this individual lives over there, but you know, by the time we look at their grandkids, maybe they've switched sides. And so everybody is rapidly mixing around. And hopefully everybody over the, you know, every lineage over the course of a few generations meets every other lineage and it effectively acts like a well-mixed population. Okay, so kind of the classic way to look at this question would be A measure of spatial genetic differentiation like FST. And the idea is if this is small, then that means that makes sense rapid. And we're in a good situation. A little bit more. A little bit more technically, what that means is the time for a lineage to wander around the range is short compared to the time that it takes lineages to coalesce, which would more usually be called the effective population size. So, if you have this hierarchy, mixing is rapid, you hope that structure is weak. Or you say that structure is weak, but there's Structures, but there's a clear problem here. So Aline just gave a talk that was all about local adaptation. Okay? Right? If we believe local adaptation exists, if we believe that we're in that lower triangle where you had color, not in the upper part, that's gray, then what that's saying is, wait a second now. If we look at the selected loci, If we look at the selected load psi, this kind of argument doesn't necessarily hold. In other words, here for this particular question, we don't care about the neutral coalescence time, any. That's not the relevant time scale for our sweep. Instead, it's a much shorter time scale. Maybe I'll call this T-selection. Maybe I'll call this T-selection, which necessarily is much smaller than NE if we're talking about a sweep. I'll just rewrite this in a way that is more familiar. If we're talking about a sweep, NES better be big. In other words, our sweep time better be rapid compared to coalescence time. So maybe by the relevant measure, our mixing time is not rapid. Mixing is not rapid. Even if, at a neutral locus, it is. And like I was saying, every time we talk about local adaptation, we're implicitly assuming that we're in something like the same. That we're in something like this scenario. And in fact, even when we're looking for sweeps, when we look for a different kind of sweep, when we look for ongoing sweeps rather than sweeps that happen in the past, often we use spatial differentiation as one of our signals. So we're exactly assuming this. Yes? But here you're thinking about selective sweep has something to do with the population structure. So local adaptation is related to population structure, not just the beneficial, at least in general. At least in general. I'm sorry, I'm being a little sloppy here. Very sloppy. In this case, I'm talking about complete sweeps. I'm talking about, and I'm assuming that selection is uniform in space. So I'm assuming there's no local adaptation. I just mean that we believe that selection in general can be strong compared to migration. And that allows for local adaptation. Now, you could tell a story where you say local selection is much stronger than global selection. Somehow, but Global selection somehow, but you have to tell a story like that to make it cool. So it's suggestive. The fact that local adaptation exists is suggestive that we're in this regime. Okay, good. All right, so then what does that mean? That means we cannot just assume that it's okay to ignore space and that we'll get decent predictions. So, what do So, what do the sweeps look like? This is the, well, mixed case. What does the spatial case look like? Let me do the simplest example of a one-dimensional habitat. It's much slower and a totally different pattern. Where does this come from? If we look at a snapshot of the sweep now as it proceeds through space, and it's 1D, so I can just draw space as one axis. We get a Fischer wave, a traveling wave conquering the range, and it's moving at a speed that's given by the geometric mean of selection and migration. So now, how fast you spread is no longer just about how strong you're selected on, it's also about how quickly you spread. Also, about how quickly you move. And if the total range size is L, then this time to reach frequency 1 is given by the time it takes to travel distance L, L over root Ms. Okay, but this is a big problem now for our interpretation. For our interpretation, really, this width is about the time it took for the sweep to proceed. And we were using that as a measure of selection. It's not measuring selection. Right? So if we have a spatial suite, but we have Is a much milder gap, a much milder trough. Let me actually draw it like this. And this tiny little width here is given by the inverse of this tile. So selection matters for the width, but mostly it's actually the spatial structure. It's actually the spatial structure that we're measuring. And good, perfect. Then, so the width is different. What about this residual diversity? Yeah, that's just a question about. I just asked a question about the spatial sampling. About the sample, like, are you consuming you're kind of sampling uniformly across space? Because I guess even in the spatial case, if you have enough density that you can sample all the individuals very close to one another, they're essentially all excellent. Would you see the deeper speed than any one local location, but if you sample globally, then you see the spatial effect that you're talking about? That you're talking about. Oh, yeah, great question. So, it's about how are we actually sampling individuals in space? We didn't need to specify for a well-mixed population. So, here, yeah, I'm assuming that you're sampling uniformly, but it actually doesn't matter. Because I'm thinking that we're in this regime, we've got our kind of global neutral spatial structure is pretty uniformly distributed. So, what do we have in this situation? Like, the sweep. Like the sweep rolls through the population pretty rapidly, then we wait a reasonable amount of time and then we go in and sample, right? Usually you aren't lucky enough to sample right after a sweep happens. Okay, what happened in that waiting time? Well now the mixing kicked in because mixing is fairly rapid on the neutral scale. So everything got mixed up. The genetic diversity is basically The genetic diversity is basically uniform. There's no signature spatial structure. You never guess that the spatial structure was actually strong on this short time scale that was relevant for the sweep. So there's no spatial patterns. There's only the echo of the spatial patterns that existed during the suite. It's kind of insidious, right? You think that your well-mixed models are working great, but they're not. Great question. Great question. Okay. Okay, so then there's this question. Okay, what about this remaining diversity? And we should be mindful of the time. Okay, good. Well, let's think about where that diversity might come from. Let's say you have a recombination event that occurs during the sweep, right? It brings in a new allele. That's your kind of class. New allele, that's your kind of classic source of diversity. In the well-mixed case, that all has to happen extremely early. If it happens down here when the sweep is at 1% frequency, when the sweep is at 1% frequency, that means everybody who has the beneficial mutation is going to get to have 1 over 1% equals 100 kids at the end of the sweep. Kids at the end of the school. So even if it happens down here, it's only going to get blown up by a factor of 100. So anything that happens later, anything that happens by the time the frequency, the sweep is at frequency a half, is not going to hitchhike at all. So all the action is early. Now let's do the spatial case. Let's say that at the same time, you're That at the same time, or well, okay, at the same frequency, we had a recombination event come in, it would take over almost the entire thing. If you have something that happens at one, when the sweep is at 1% frequency, it's going to be at 99% frequency at the end of the sweep, if it takes over, the wavefront. Because it's going to come in, it's going to colonize the wavefront, and then it's going to spread to everybody. But on the other hand, if you have a sweep that comes in, when the When the recombination event that comes in when the sweep is at 50% frequency, it'll go to 50% frequency. If you have a recombination event that comes in when the sweep is at 90% frequency, it'll go to 10% frequency. So we have this huge long tail of hitchhiking that can all reach high frequency. So now So now over here, this is probably, this remaining diversity is probably a long tail of recombinants or mutants. I mean, not right at the swept locus, but as soon as you have some non-zero recombination rate or mutation rate. rate or mutation rate okay so i better wrap up so that should decrease the trough even further so this one once one piece is about the width decreasing and the other one is about the depth of the trough decreasing um and it and if you if you recall so in the standard in the standard models standard methods of sweep inference one feature is telling you about the strength of selection and the other is telling you if the sweep is harder And the other is telling you if the sweep is hard or soft, and how old the sweep is. And so, you know, these things are going to show up as biases in these different quantities. So, yeah, let's just write the messages, the take-home messages over here. So, one is that sweeps are Sweeps are much more sensitive to space than the neutral variation is. And then I'm going, I guess this is a math, I mean, so I'll say these are conjectures about the inference biases, because I have not proven them. Proven them. Probably underestimating selection because of the width and probably overestimating. A number of starting half the types. So the softness. All right, and so next step, we need to actually test this. We need to simulate spatial hitchhiking, run inference methods on it, see if we actually get these biases. See if we actually get these biases. Just the problem is there actually isn't any software right now that will do this in decently sized populations. MS-MS can't really get to the nice continuous space regimes we want to. So, kind of step 1A is to implement this in MS Prime, which is what we're working on right now. Oh, I was just going to say, you're overestimating the number of the amount of standards diversity in the suite, the slotness of the suite, but you're also potentially overestimating the time situation. Overestimating the time size of the suite, right? Yeah, also the angels. It looks like a really old suite, but it's really a relatively new suite in the structured population. I feel like there's a way to pull those two apartments. You're exactly right. Yes, yes. By just writing like one thing for diversity here, I'm being very sloppy. By looking at different diversity statistics, you can differentiate those. And what I think the particular mistake you're going to make is really the number of half-types, not the A. Really, the number of half-types, not the age. I think you can get the age pretty well. Maybe two quick questions. Wondering if you've thought about this in the context of cancer driver and passenger mutations. I haven't. There's a lot of structure there, and that could definitely affect how you measure the strength of the driving mutation for a passenger. It's a great point. It's a great point. Maybe you can point some literature on that. Another broadening question that you're not going to be able to answer, but if neutral is not sensitive and sweeps is so sensitive, where does background selection come in? How sensitive is background selection models to space? Background selection should not be too badly affected as long as it's decently strong. Affected as long as it's decently strong. So, background selection is, if that's negative selection, right? That's selection against deleterious alleles. As long as it's decently strong, what you have is the bad mutation comes in. It spreads a little bit, but it never spreads far enough to start to feel, oh, the boundaries of space, like to become like common locally, but rare globally, right? That's the kind of thing. I don't know if sides said that maybe. Of unlinked sites, so that means the unlinked sites are one of the ones that are strong that you can ignore, which are more important about the higher mutation rate. But the highly linked site, that's usually the smallest that matters. So that might still matter. That might still matter. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's a great question. Technical is, you know, it's more important in some spaces than others. Yeah, I think, yeah, you're right. And I think, yeah, but I don't think we know the answer for the For the for the s week weekly, whatever, the week selection Hill Robertson regime. Yeah. All right, thank you.
