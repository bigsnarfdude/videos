I've been on this path for the last couple of days to try and get you to some. This is now almost all modeling. But I'll remind you that experimentally, what I see are seizures. And the way I make the experimental model for seizures is I go in and I shut off some of the inhibitory synapses, the synapses that send out. That sends out negative feedback to the excitatory nerve. And then that lasts for ever. And I get these different kinds of events, seizures, spreading depression events. And yeah, so and the persistent questions are things like Are things like, why are there seizures worse spread of depression? And why aren't there always seizures? They just, they come, they go, the animal runs around, it's fine for a while, and then all happens again. And then it's fine again for a while. It's not like their brain is just completely always in bad shape. And there's been in the literature a persistent idea that, well, maybe there's an imbalance between the excitation and the inhibition, inhibition being kind of a local feedback on the excitatory neurons. And somehow that gets unbalanced, and then you can get runaway excitation. That doesn't explain the sprain depression, but I will. I will, I'll get there. And then I have, just to make life more challenging, I told you earlier that our basic understanding how things work at the single cell level, at the membrane, electrical current level, has to do. Level has to do with these gating functions, right? And the time delays associated with those gating functions. And here's the really large challenge I wanted to set out for myself, which was if you look at now certain human epilepsies that run in families, and so there's some genetic component. One can now, and there are people. Now, and there are people who are doing this, go in and map out for a certain genetic mutation how these gating functions change. And so, can we get some insight that can take us from these gating function changes all the way through to a macroscopic model of at least large scales. At least large-scale networks or brain that tells us why the network sometimes fluctuates into seizures. That sounds like a challenge. All right. So I'm going to, so one of the, Cecilia's not looking up. Nab is looking. Now she's looking. So, this comes from a paper of hers, which was probably the second of the papers that I dealt with, trying to use this. But this is the circuit diagram from some sleep modeling that I was interested a long time ago. And the components in here are supposed to represent mean field responses to mean field. Mean field responses or mean field subgroups of particular cells. It's a modeling approach called neural mass modeling. And that modeling framework dates back to the 1970s, where Walter Friedman introduced this idea of neural masses, eventually wrote his giant enormous book on mass action in the nervous system. In the nervous system, and it was kind of almost forgotten for a while. Walter wanted to go from EEG at one point in brain or field potentials in one point in brain and try and write nice models that would tell you what the response would be in terms of the electrical potentials in another part of BRAID and try and build. And try and build a large-scale model of this. And that modeling approach was then kind of percolated around in the literature and then was taken up by Jansen and Ritt in the mid-90s with this kind of framework that said, again, you have these neural masses. Oh, I can't remember the difference. Oh, I can't remember the difference between the circles and the squares in this. Yeah, you've got the these squares are the neural masses, and the circles are, I believe, the, no, I've got exactly backwards from, all right. So the circles are the neural masses. The squares are the synaptic, the postsynaptic currents associated with it. That's approximately. Associated with it. That's approximately right. They don't, they kept Walter's idea that that should be voltage, and somehow the voltage would be related exactly to the EEG, which is a physical, but they seem to have made lots of progress with this for 20 years, describing EEG in different frameworks. Different frameworks. And basically, the synaptic functions are kind of time delay from. So, if you get a firing in a presynaptic neuron, you get a time delayed response of current through the synapse. And you sum all of that up, and with respect to the total amount of current or potential, you get some sigmoidal firing rate. Firing rate. Say, oh, I don't know where any of that comes from, other than maybe it should go up. But it ignores a whole bunch of stuff that we know about single neurons at the single neuron level, which is that somehow these really look like systems that depend upon details of the Details of the transmembrane ion concentrations. And in other parts of the literature, we know that, for example, if you change the potassium in the extracellular space, and or if we measure the potassium during seizures, or even worse, during spraying depression, what happens is that you change the function of the neuron. And I went through this whole model with you before. Whole model with you before, but basically, there are components of this that say you're going to eventually be driving current through the potassium channels, right, when they're open, and that's related to the ion concentration difference of the potassium across the membrane. So, if you change the amount of potassium in the extracellular space, lots of potassium on the inside, so it doesn't change very much, but very little on the outside. But if you have slightly more. On the outside, but if you have slightly more on the outside, it significantly changes that drive component. Okay, and so then if you look at the function of a neuron, well, so I told you out here, the electrical potential wanders around until the sodium channel is open up, right? So, from an expectation standpoint, if you don't put enough current in, you don't have enough synaptic input, you should just be sitting at constant. You should just be sitting at constant electrical potential. But then, if you hit it with enough current, you start to get this action potential, right? And the sodium flows in. Then the sodium channels close and the potassium channels open. And then I said, hey, wait, if the potassium channel is open, then you get an inward current and the potential goes down. Goes down. All right. If the potassium current is large enough with respect to the input current, it comes back down. But if those two things balance off to be not here, so if the potassium current's not large enough, you get stuck up here and open. So you're in another steady state response. Another steady state response of this neuron if the input current is high enough with respect to the potassium, the maximum potassium current. Make sense? And that state is another phenomenon we call potassium depolarization block. And remember, I said that there's this big electrical potential drop in my neuron, at the end. In my at the end of that seizure that I called spreading depression, or in the way that the new kids call it, is spreading depolarization. And that's because there's this wave where all of the neurons in the local network are in depolarization block and it's spreading. And the way that's spreading is that because the potassium channels are stuck open, potassium is still flowing into the exercise. Potassium is still flowing into the extracellular space. And if potassium is still flowing into the extracellular space, it raises the extracellular potassium and forces the nearby neurons also to go into the polarization block. And it just wanders through the brain very slowly in a reaction diffusion kind of way. Make sense? And this is not a phenomenon that you could get. Get from this kind of model, right? Because the elements don't embody that kind of behavior. So we say, oh, wait, what if we build in from the beginning the function of these elements to have all of that, all of that dynamic? And in a realistic way that we built from single neuron models. We did that, and so let me go to this version of the slide. Here I look at just the bifurcation space of a single neuron as a function of the input current and the transmembrane, Nernst potential, potassium, or and this is the change in Nern's potential, so the change with respect to the baseline. To the baseline. So far, so good. And so out here, the current's not large enough to cause firing. In this region here, you're in this nice range where you get nice action potentials, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And then if you go across the red line, you hit depolarization block. And as you go to increase, increase change in or increase. Increased change in or increased exocellular potassium, this region gets smaller. And I did this for two different models: one for an inhibitory neuron, one for an excitatory neuron. And in between here, if you look between here and here, the firing rate doesn't look like a sigmoid that everyone uses. It looks more like a square root function up to the maximum value. Maximum value. So far, so good. And we parametrized all of this, this whole space, in terms of where these boundaries were for these different models, what the firing rate is in the square root function, and everything comes out nicely. And we can parametrize how much potassium is flowing across the membrane on average for this average group of neurons. And all of the fits look nice. All of the fits look nice. And then, when we build a model that has inhibit just inhibitory and excitatory neurons, let's forget about how much their activity changes the extracellular potassium. I'm just going to impose an input current to the excited tori neurons and impose an average extracellular potassium level. I get these kinds of behaviors as a function of input current. As a function of input current. So I'm just going to drive it with little step functions and see what the response is. And the response at low input current is I get a balanced amount of excitation in the inhibition. And the inhibitory response, I do a little bit more. It doesn't oscillate nearly as much. And we keep going up. And then all of a sudden, we get this spot where the excitement. This spot where the excitatory network fires, but it drives the inhibitory network into depolarization block. Now, thinking about what happens if you drive the excitatory neurons and then they don't have the inhibitory feedback, so the inhibitory neurons are a depolarization block, is that if this is now in a network, it's going to drive the other neuron, you know, the nearby ones. Know the nearby ones in time, high firing, and this is a phenomenon that in the literature people said, Oh, that might happen, and that would be runaway excitation and cause seizures. Oh, that's kind of nice. And then if we keep driving it higher, then eventually both we can drive both of them into depolarization. All right, so that's this system, right? But now, if I do something like I increase the potassium. Mike, I increase the potassium, the extracellular potassium concentration. All of a sudden, all of that's contracted into a lower region. You much quicker get into runaway excitation and much quicker get into depolarization for the network. Or if I go in this direction, I instead change the balance between Between, right, I change this coupling constant from the inhibitory to the excitatory neurons. I get the same phenomena, right? All of a sudden, I can drive the system into runaway excitation at a lower input current, and I get depolarization block at an even also at a lower level. And if I do both, I increase the potassium. Both, I increase the potassium and I decrease the inhibitory feedback, it's even more contracted. And then there's some other nice little features of this. It's hysteratic. So if you go up in one direction, you hit runaway excitation, then you hit depolarization block. But as you come back down, you stay in runaway excitation to a lower. To a lower input level before you drop back down into balanced firing. Mapping that out as a function of transmembrane extracellular potassium, now you get these nice boundaries where if I look at my nominal coupling between the Coupling between the system, I get this whole range here as a function of extracellular potassium that's nice and stable or bistable, right? So I can go all the way out to here before I get anything bad happening. But that whole region is contracted once I decrease some of the excess inhibitory feedback. As soon as I get As soon as I give the system a little bit of tetanus toxic, shut off some of the. Oh, so I already have the first piece, right? Which means that the extracellular potassium fluctuates around all the time. The region over which it fluctuates around is fairly large, couple of micromillimolar potassium, and the system still produces. And the system's still pretty stable until you cut down some of the inhibitory feedback. I'm almost done, right? Yeah, one minute. That result is almost independent of where we choose the baseline inhibitory feedback. This is just the continuum of that. And then, if I look at the genetic mutations, those genetic mutations give this change in. This change in shape of that stable boundary between not firing, firing, and depolarization block. And so it propagates all the way out to the full system. And there are pictures. There's a couple of this, an old picture of some of my students. A lot of this modeling was done by Richa, my postdoc, Rama, did the Doc Rama did the genetic mutation version of that, and I'm done. Measure them. Yeah, I mean, so yes, it's exactly the next thing. Hold on. I'm going to stop recording.
