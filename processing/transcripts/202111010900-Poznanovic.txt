I will talk about a result actually that on a work that started a week, a year ago, at a workshop like this on an open problem posed by Jim Propp. This is joint work with Colin Defon, Tim Hopkins, and Jim. And it's about a notion that I'll define a generalization of remotion called Q remotion. Remotion. And then the two other things that you see in my title, Taglability Statistics and Rooks, are the techniques that we use to prove results about this new action. So here's the setup. In general, what we study, what we're interested in here are occurrences of Homo Messi. Homo Messi is A homomissy is, instead of put a homomic is we have a finite set X in our case, an invertible map T from X to X, and then a statistic F on the set X where that can take values in general in a field of characteristic zero. So the function F is said to be homometic under the action T if the average of F on each T orbit is the same. And if that average And if that average is C, we say that the statistic is C masic. Some examples of homomessy that have been studied before are on relative to actions on order ideals. And this is the setup we'll be generalizing. So I'll give some examples related to that. Say we have a finite post at P. Say, we have a finite postet P and J of P will denote the distributive lattice of order ideals or downset of P. Then there is this action on the order ideals that has been studied before and has been named remotion by Stryker and Williams. That does the following: it sends each ideal to I to an ideal I prime. An ideal I prime that is generated by the minimal elements of the complement of I. So this is clearly invertible, which is the kind of property you want. And here's an example on how it works on the possets of on the odor ideals of a rectangular posset two by two. The picture is in rectilinear form, so instead of In rectilinear form, so instead of HACC diagrams, all our pictures here will be as subsets of Z2, because that's the kind of post-sets we'll be considering. So here the minimal element is the top left corner, and the ideals of 2x2 look like Young diagrams. We see there are two cycles here in the dissection of size 4 and 2. And then one can consider different statistics on order ideals that are natural and think about whether they exhibit homomicy under remotion. Some results that we'll be generalizing are related to the anti-chain cardinality statistic and the order ideal size statistic, which are known to be homomethic under emotion. These are results by Prop and Ruby. For example, if we look at the anti-chain cardinality on the left orbit, by anti-chain cardinality, we mean the size of the maximal maximal elements in the ideal. So in the left orbit, on the top left, we have zero elements, and then going clockwise, we have one, two, one. One to one, so the average on that orbit as one. In the right orbit, we have one maximal element in each ideal, so that's again one. So we see that we have the, in this case, the statistic is one mesic. And in general, for any rectangle, it's known to be a b over a plus b messic under remotion. Another statistic is the order ideal size statistic. So when we count the number of L. So, when we count the number of elements in each ideal in the left orbit, we have 0 plus 1 plus 3 plus 4 is 8. So, the average is 2. And on the right-hand side, again, we get a 2. So, it's 2 messic in this example. And in general, it's A times B over 2 MESIC under remotion. Now, remotion can be expressed in a different way using toggles, and this notion will be And this notion will be important for us. So, a toggle is defined for each element in the postset. It's an action on the ideals. And basically, toggling an element means to add it or take it out of the ideal if that is legal or not do anything otherwise. So, we can add it if P is a minimal element of the complement so that the resulting set I union P is. The resulting set I union p is also an ideal, or we can take it out if p is the maximal element in i, so the difference would also be an ideal, and otherwise, the resulting otherwise we just leave it i as it is. These toggles can be, it's known, so this is resolved by Cameron and von der Floss from 1995, that the row motion can be expressed as the composition of toggles, where we take Where we take the toggles TP1 composed with TP2 and so forth, where P1 and PN are a linear extension of P. When I apply these, I start with TPN and then so from right to left. The linear extension doesn't matter because the toggles that correspond to elements that are not comparable commute. So we get the same composition. So, we get the same composition. Okay, so here's the setup for defining Q remotion. So we'll take two integers, R and S, positive integers. We'll think of the quotient R over S as a Q, a rational number. And even though we'll be writing Q all the time, everything we say actually depends on the choices of R and S. R is the number of different Number of different kinds of ones and say we have S number of different kinds of S of zeros. We'll consider the set of all labelings of the postet P with zeros and ones so that the pre-image of the zeros forms an ideal in P. So that means, right, all of the zeros have to be somehow under the ones in these labelings. This generalizes the previous setup. If you think about setting R equals one and S equals one, then we have just zeros, just one kind of zero, one kind of one. And the labeling, an ideal can be represented by labeling all of its elements by zeros and all of the elements in the complement by one. So there is this direct bijection between J of P and J. Between J of P and J11 of P. In general, an ideal in J of P would result in many possible labelings or will correspond to many possible labelings. Let me say it that way. How many? So for an ideal S, ideal I, I could label any of its elements by zero. So I have S to the size of I, number of choices. Of I, number of choices for that. And then all the elements out of I can be labeled by one. So we have R to the size of P minus I choices for that. And so the number of labelings would be a sum overall ideals of this product. We pull out S and we get S to the size of P times this sum of powers of Q. If the positive is a rectangle, It is a rectangle. The sum is known to be a q binomial sum, for example. So we get that for a rectangle, the number of labelings we're considering is S to A times B times this Q binomial coefficient. Okay, so what's the action we'll be considering on this set? To define the action, we'll fix the cyclic permutation theta on the union of zeros and ones. Union of zeros and ones. Then we define a toggle for toggle actions on the labelings in a similar way to what they were defined on the ideals. So we'll have one toggle for each element P in the postet and the toggle will produce another labeling by changing at most. By changing at most one label. The label that might get changed is the label of the element p and it will change according to the cyclic permutation theta, only if that's legal. Meaning, again, if p is a maximal zero in the labeling, then we can apply theta to that label, or if p is a minimal zero. Or, if P is a minimal one in the labeling, then we can again apply theta and possibly and change the labeling. Otherwise, the labeling is fixed. Now, here's the definition of the QR motion operator that will act on the labelings. It's simply a composition of these toggles that we just defined, where we take Just defined where we take the composition in an order according to a linear extension of p. The toggles do commute if the elements are, if they correspond to elements that are not comparable. So again, it doesn't really matter which linear extension we take. This is the same, this results in the same composition. I'm using the same notation here, rho, for this curve. Same notation here, rho, for this Q remotion operator, even though I think it won't be confusing. It depends on multiple things: the R and S that we chose and the cyclic permutation theta that we fixed to define the toggles. However, the results that we will show will basically hold where all of these, regardless of these choices, are in S and theta. So that's maybe a justification. So that's maybe a justification of not putting too many labels here. So either they will show that whatever we show will show always holds for Q remotion regardless of these choices of R, S, and theta. Here's an example of what the action of a Q remotion looks like for this is the labelings of a root postet of type A. We have We have we're using one one zero and two sorry one one and two zeros and so if I look at the top left element to apply the current motion I start toggling from the maximal element which is the bottom right this one in the bottom right is cannot be is not a minimal one It's not a minimal one, so that toggle just leaves that label fixed, and then we move on to the next anti-diagonal. It doesn't matter which one we think of toggling first. The blue zero is a maximal zero. So according to theta, it will change to a red zero. And then the one, the remaining one is a minimal one. So according to theta, it will change to a blue zero. And so this is the new labeling. And so, this is the new labeling. And so, we continue. So, there are overall here, we see we have three cycles under QR motion: 17 labelings total. Okay, so what kind of statistics will we be looking at when we consider this action on this set of labelings? In fact, the statistics we'll look at are going to all come from statistics. All come from statistics that are defined on ideals. So, whenever you have a statistic F defined on ideals, we can naturally extend it to the statistic on labelings by defining F of a labeling is F of the corresponding ideal, meaning the ideal formed by the pre-images of all the zeros. So, for that reason, I will keep writing F for well, I can continue to abuse notation and keep writing F for this new statistic defined on the labeling as well to keep the notation simple. And so, we'll only consider statistics of this type. And the goal is to prove that various statistics and labelings are homo. And labelings are homomestic for Q remotion. And again, when we show such a result, actually, it will hold for all choices of R and S and all the choices of the cyclic permutation theta, which is interesting. So what was the original Prop's conjecture that initiated this work? His conjecture was that the anti-chain cardinality statistic is homometic under the new action of Q-remotion on the label. New action of current motion on the labelings of a rectangle. After we proved that, we found some techniques and the work went in the different directions. But using the techniques that I'll mention, we can prove similar results about different statistics on this post-set and others. I will list some of them here. I will list some of them here to give you an idea. So, another statistic that is homomethic under QR motion on the same set is the fiber refinement of the anti-chain cardinality. So, counting how many maximal elements of the ideal we have in each row, basically, or similarly, each column. Statement two actually would imply statement one, if you notice. Then we looked at other posets as well. For the shifted staircase, it is true also that the anti-chain cardinality statistic is homo messic under Q remotion. In each case, we do find the constant here that depends on Q and then we have a couple of references. And then we have a couple of refinements that actually imply this first result. The fiber refinement of the anti-chain cardinality is also homomethic. But by fiber here, I mean looking at the L-shaped subsets that have a corner on the main diagonal. So this is what I'm denoting here by L-hook of II. So, for each eye, this statistic is homomethic under the action of QR motion for the shifted staircase. And then another one is the size of the main diagonal anti-chain. So, number of elements in the anti-chain on the maximum elements that are on the main diagonal of the staircase, shifted staircase. The staircase, shifted staircase. We considered other posets as well, but I'm not going to state the results here, just give you an idea of what we looked at. So some post-ets are other minuscule post-ets beyond the rectangle and the shifted staircase. And then also the root post-ets of type A and B, which can also be realized. Which can also be realized as subsets of z squared. And again, this property of our post stats is the thing that makes these techniques work. So we were able to use the similar techniques that I'll be talking about next. Okay, so how do we prove these results? Results. We would use the toggle abilities, the test text. So I'll tell you what they are. And first, in the original case without a Q. So we'll forget about the Q for a moment and then we'll QFI them. For any element P in a postet, we define the togglability statistics of three kinds, one with a plus, one with a minus, and then a combination of them, which we call the sine togglability statistic. So TPP. So Tp plus keeps track of whether an element could be toggled in to the ideal I. So it's one if it can be toggled in and zero otherwise. And T P minus similarly keeps track of whether an element can be toggled out of the set. So it's one if it can be toggled out and zero otherwise. And the design toggled statistics is the difference between these two. So it can take values one, negative one, or zero. One or zero. And notice that a zero can only come from zero minus zero. So we can recover these even knowing Tp of I. Why are these statistics useful? So these are very easy to track under remote. And therefore, it's easy to show that or simple to show that there are zero messages for remote. That they are zero messic for remote acting on JFP. This is a result or result by Stryker, but it's so nice that I wanted to show you here the outline of why sort of it works out easily. So the crucial fact is that Tp plus of phi is equal to Tp minus of the rho of phi, meaning if I can talk. Pi, meaning if I can toggle in an element p into i, then after applying remotion, we can toggle that element out, and it's an if and only if. So basically, if we look at what happens along an orbit of remotion, O, the sum of the Tps by definition is a sum of the difference Tp plus minus T P minus. You can split the sum. split the sum and then the tp minus instead of summing over i i can sum over the row the images of phi because it's a it's a cycle and i get things to cancel out nicely so it becomes a zero so the average of the statistic is zero on every orbit and this is something that is useful and will generalize in the q world The Q world. But I'm not going to show you the proof there because it's a little more involved. But as a corollary of this, and why this is useful, is that now if we have a statistic F on G of P, which we can represent as in this form, C, so a constant plus a linear combination of T P's. Then we conclude automatically that F is C mesic under remotion. F is C mesic under remotion. And so this just follows by from the linearity of expectation. Now you could ask, is the converse true? That's, I think, natural thing to think about right away. And the answer is no. It's not true even for the rectangle posets. So if you can do this, then you have results about homo messy, but Homomestic, but not every homomestic result can be proved by this, and we have some examples listed in the written version of this. But this means that this kind of things can be checked easily on a computer by using solving systems of linear equations. So, here is again our example with the ideals in the rectangle. I have four columns with the values of the two signed togglability statistics. You see, in each column, we have a plus or one, minus one, or zero, depending on which element we are looking at. And then one column that is missing here, then it should be present is also the constant function one. So I should have a column of all ones here because what we're Once here, because what we're trying to do here is possibly write a statistic f as a linear combination of these sine togglibility statistics and the constant function one. And so if I want to look at the statistic, I mentioned two related to the rectangle. See the side order order ideal size. The values here are listed in the fifth column. In the fifth column of numbers, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4. I can consider the anti-chain statistic, write out the values, and then solve the system of equations right on a computer. And it turns out that both of these satisfy this property. So they can be written as a constant plus a linear combination of these togglability statistics. So one could prove this result that was proved by. Prove this result that was proved by Prop and Ruby in this manner. Okay, the question is, how do you prove such a result for a family of post-sets? So this was good for checking a specific post set and maybe forming conjectures of whether the statement like this is true or not. But how do you prove it for a family of post-sets? And the answer is. the answer is um these uh what we what we use here are so-called rooks um rooks this these are um rooks have been defined to you uh to use for for applying this technique in a couple of papers before this uh where um different results were considered by for different posts For different post sets. And in each case, depending on the postset, you will have to define a different kind of rook and then think about how to use that to prove the property you want. So I will show you here an example of a rook for the rectangle posted, just to give you an idea of what a rook would look like. And this is useful for proving those properties in the previous slides, for example. On the previous slides, for example, even though these are not, so these are already existed before we started working on this project. So what is a rook? A rook is a combination typically of the togglability statistics with the plus, the plus and minus ones. And for the rectangle, it's this sum and difference of four. There are these four sums here that show up. And it's a little bit crazy to look at them, but this picture might help. But this picture might help. So, this is a picture that's supposed to tell you what the rook looks like for, say, the rook R33 for the rectangle 5 by 6 looks like. So, in each box where you see a number D in its upper left corner and an element E in its lower right, that indicates that there is a combination of this sort, D times T plus with index I prime J. uh with index i prime j prime plus e t minus i prime j prime and so um when there when there is no number it's assumed to be zero and so these are the rooks sort of these are the this indicates which um togglability statistics show up in the sums and also maybe um shows you why it's called a rook okay and you might ask now okay so if this is so uh complicated how would I compute Complicated. How would I compute this rook? So, this is a statistic on the order of ideals. Can I compute it easily if you give me an ideal? And the answer is yes, you can compute it easily because the rook evaluated at every ideal is one. And why that is the case can again be maybe seen from a picture. So, this is like a sketch to give you an idea why this. idea why this complicated expression from the previous slide just simplifies to one. So the red path is the border of the ideal that we're considering. And if I want to evaluate the rook at an ideal I, most of the toggleability statistics that show up in the sum you notice will not make a difference. They will be zero for this ideal, because the only ones that don't make a difference. Because the only ones that don't make it are not zero are the ones that are next to the boundary of the order ideal. So next to the around this path that is showing up. Then you have to keep track of how many ones and negative ones show up, but they show at the valleys and the peaks. So this is a very rough sketch, but basically almost all of them will cancel out and there will be one one that's left. So the value is one. All right. All right. Now, the question is: if it's one, how does this help? So, the rooks basically are a very clever way of rewriting one. And this helps in the following way. So, I'll show you an example. So, how this could be applied again on a result. So, this is one of the papers where this technique has been used before, where they define these ropes. Before, where they define these ropes, it's due to Chen, Heden, Hopkins, and Mochi in 2017, where they show that the anti-chain cardinality statistic can be written as a linear combination, so it can be written as a constant plus a linear combination of the togglability statistics. I'm using this notation with congruence here just to simplify a little bit the notation. So, F is congruent to G. The notation. So, F is congruent to G if F minus G is a linear combination of the togglability statistics. So, what we care about is the end-to-chain cardinality statistic. And notice that this is actually the sum of the TP minuses, right? So, there is one for each element that can be toggled out. Okay, so I think about the rook. The rook has a bunch of t pluses and t minuses in it, but But the t pluses can be written as in terms of the t minuses and just the tp's. And so then I take mod tp. I can basically rewrite it as something that I can get an expression here that's only in terms of minus t minuses. And then when I sum all the rooks on one hand, I'm All the rooks on one hand, I'm summing a bunch of ones, so we just get for the rectangle we had a times b. On the other hand, that sum is congruent to the sum of these expressions that we simplify the rook to. And then we can split the sum into two sums. And then we can, so I mean, this was already a double sum, right now. So I have two triple sums. And I can reorder the terms. So I can swap the J the J and J prime in the first. j the j and j prime in the first one and i i prime in the second one and then when i look at what happens with a fixed tij a fixed tij will show up in uh in this expression exactly a plus b time so we can pull that out and we get that the sum of tp minuses when we sum over all the elements in the postet is congruent to a b over a plus b so basically i use this So basically, I use this clever rewriting of the number one to get to this expression. Or they use that rather. Okay, so back to the Q world. How does this help us for a Q remotion? What do we do in that case? In this case, we will treat first, it helps to treat Q as a formal indeterminate rather than a rational. Is a formal indeterminate rather than a rational number. And then the statistics, instead of thinking about real-value statistics on the order ideals, I can think of them, they take values and the rational functions over Q in Q. So then we can define Q analogs of the sign to globility statistics as so they're going to be. So, they're going to be defined in terms of the original togglability statistics, but with this minus, so it was T plus minus T P minus originally. Now we're inserting this Q here in front of T P minus. So again, if Q is one, we have the original sign probability statistics. This is a generalization. So what is important is that we have a Q analog of Stryker's lemma. In other words, if we go and specialize Specialize Q to be R over S. So we think of it as a rational number then. Then these assigned probability statistics are zero messic under the QR motion operator on the labelings of P. And this is true for any post at P and any integers R and C choose to define this set of labeling. To define this set of labelings, and in any cyclic permutation of theta, that you choose to define the QR motion operator. So, this is important because then we have, we can think about using this inferring. So, what we want to do is originally if we have f expressed as linear combination. have f expressed as a linear combination of these probabilities statistics we're going to conclude something that it will write the homomissy result about that in this q world uh the expression where we uh look for is that expression of type f is equal to again a constant but that's now going to depend on q plus a linear combination of these q signs togglability statistics which will have again coefficients the coefficients are coming from the field r. The coefficients are coming from the field RQ. Okay, so similar expression. So if I can take my statistic F and write it in general as an expression of this type. Then, first, it's a technical result, but it's true that these coefficients don't have any singularities at any non-negative number, they don't have any non-negative. Uh, they don't have any non-negative singularities, and so we can specialize q to be any positive non-negative integer, and we get an expression. Um, f is you know a constant, so real number plus uh this is going to be a combination of these um signed togglability statistic for particular q with coefficients real numbers. Real numbers. But these, according to the Q analog of Stryker's lemma, they are zero-mesic, right? And for Q-remotion. So that means that the original statistic is going to be C-MESIC. And this C-MESIC, this is going to be, since we're going to specialize Q to be R over S, this is whatever this constant was specialized for at Q for Q equals R over. For Q equals R over S. That's going to be the average of the statistic over the orbits. Okay, so this is the strategy for us. So what we're trying to do here to apply this is in each of the results that I showed you, we actually try to write F as C of Q plus a linear combination of the TPQs. Okay, again, how do we do that? Okay, again, how do we do that? We use rooks again, and I'll show you an example how that works. Again, it's easier to use congruence notation. So I'll write F is congruent, Q congruent to G if the difference F minus G is a combination of the TPQs. And the original props conjecture was about the anti-chain cardinality statistic. So we wanted that that is the sum of the TP minus s, and we want to write it as we show that it's q congruent to this. These are the q integers, qa times qb over qa plus b. What was interesting here, we started thinking that we were. Interesting here, we started thinking that we should also find Q analogs of the rooks. But we ended up actually using the original rooks that I showed you for the rectangle, just different combinations of them. So we're looking at different combinations with now coefficients from the field R of Q. So instead of a sum of R i j. So instead of a sum of Rijs, now I have some powers of Q in front of each Rij. This, on one hand, since the Rij are one, you can see that this is equal to the product of these Q integers, AQ times BQ. So that's not hard. On the other hand, the second equality here is a consequence of a lot of simplifications, regrouping, so it's not a clear. So, it's not clear at all. So, that's why it took us some time to figure out that this kind of approach would work. But this RIJs are, if you remember again, these are combinations of the TP minuses and the TP pluses. And now the TP pluses can be replaced by a combination of T minuses and the TQs. So you do that. You do that, and you get a long expression, then you sort of regroup things, and then you do some algebra with the Q integers that you get, and it simplifies to this nice expression. And I didn't even write here the coefficients. We get the coefficients, but they're a little too long to fit on the slide. They're not important. But what is important is that we get the sum. The first sum has this A plus B Q that can be pulled out again. And the second sum is the linear. And the second sum is the linear sum of the q sine statistics, the q sine sign togglability statistics. So that means that this leads exactly to what wanted to do, right? The first expression is congruent to the here, the a plus b q times the anti-chain kernelity statistic. And then you can divide and get the result. Okay, so this is a sketch of sort of what we did, what kind of results we proved, and what of which process we considered the techniques. But this work led to a lot of other questions. And so I'll mention briefly a few. One thing is that I mentioned that the space of functions that are zero messic under remotion is not equal to the span of the assigned to global statistics. Of the assigned togglability statistics. However, there is an extended state, you can expand the set of togglability statistics to make the statement if and only if. One can define anti-chain togglability statistics. So instead of for each element in P, we consider here each anti-chain. And the togglability statistics indicate whether an anti-chain can be toggled in all at the same time or toggled out all at the same time. Time or toggled out all at the same time, or that's not possible. And then the spin of these anti-chain togglability statistics actually spans the is equal to all the zeromestic functions under remote. However, the caveat is that these interchangeable ability statistics are not linearly independent. And so trying to prove something like this. Trying to prove something like this in general, which requires some maybe clever combinations, finding the coefficients and stuff, becomes a little more difficult because when you look at things on a computer, the results you get are not necessarily generalizable easily. The advantage for the TPs be considered were that they're linearly independent, so that was slightly easier. But it does, this is in theory a technique that could prove some results that couldn't be proved with the That couldn't be proved with a previous technique. In the interest of time, I will not spend much on the rest of the slides, but I will say that the functions we considered here are all related to the anti-chain cardinality and the size cardinality, some refinements and things. And so we also looked at what these, you know, what are the So, what are the intersections of these kinds of spaces that we're considering with the rephrase that? What are all the statistics that we can find of this form that could be proved with this technique? And our preprint has a lot of, has a table with some conjectural where the structure of these spaces is considered in terms of the dimension and possibility. In terms of the dimension and possible bases. These are conjectured in terms of, so when we have a basis element, we can prove that it's in the set, but we don't know that these are all. However, there are some cases even when we cannot find all of the functions. We consider this question for the general, the original remotion on ideals, but also for the Q remotion on the labelings for all these sets that we consider. These sets that we consider the dimension, the rectangle, the staircase, the shifted staircase, and the root post sets, type A and B. Another brief remark is that this technique about proving that F is congruent to C mod the span of the togglability statistics is actually useful because then the results about homomessy can be lifted into the piecewise linear and the birational world. Piecewise linear and the birational world immediately, but that's beyond. So that's all I'll say about it. And lastly, we think that maybe QR motion deserves to be studied a little bit further and questions like: you know, what can we say more precisely about the order of or the orbit structure? Does it make sense for Q equals negative one? Make sense for Q equals negative one? What does it mean? One could think about defining a Q piecewise linear remotion. The question is: does it have any nice properties? So we'd be delighted if you'd be interested to work on this. And with that, I'm done. Thank you for listening.
