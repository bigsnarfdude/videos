And he will be speaking about the integral geometry of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Vigil, please. Thank you. So thank you very much for the opportunity to speak here. I will talk about a joint project with Andreas Bernik and Dimitri Feidman, where we introduce some intrinsic volume for sub-manifolds. Intrinsic volumes for sub-manifolds in sugar-Riemannian spaces, but let me start with a classical case of intrinsic volumes in Riemannian manifolds. So this starts with Piles tube formula, which we have seen already in Joe Fu's talk. So I think everything was in this slide was already in Joe's talk, but let's go through it slowly. Slowly. So to begin, we take some Riemannian manifold M, which we initially realize as a sub-manifold in some Euclidean space. So let's use Mastery, for instance. And then we pick some compact set A inside M, which should be sufficiently nice. So for instance, A could be a compact sub-manifold. A compact submanifold with boundary, a smooth submanifold with boundary, but it could be more general. It could be some set of positive reach or some WDC set or something, who knows more general. But for the purpose of this talk, it is enough to consider smooth sub-manifolds with boundary, but always compact. Okay, so P of M will denote in this talk the set of In this talk, the set of the class of compact submanifolds with boundary inside M and given such a submanifold A, we will look at the tube of radius R around A inside Rn. So that's the set of points in Rn whose distance to A is smaller than some small radius R. And the tube formula says that the volume. And the tube formula says that the volume of this region in Rn is some polynomial depending on R, whose coefficients, of course, depend on the submanifold A. Now, apart from this normalizing constant, which is the volume of the unit ball, these coefficients are called intrinsic volumes, but they also have different names like Lipschitz-Killing curvature intervals or Lipschitz-Kilchitz-Kilskills. Curvicher intervals or Lipschitz killing invariants, I will try to call them intrinsic volumes. So they can be described or they can be computed in the following way. There are two terms here. First, we have some inner term, which is the integral on A of some differential form of top degree. Of top degree, so unless so, this will be non-zero only if A itself has maximal dimension inside M. Otherwise, this will be just zero. And then there's a second term, which is a little bit more interesting. It's the integral of some differential form on the normal cycle. Now, remember, recall that a normal cycle, everything happens inside M. So, if this is A, so this should be. Is A, so this should be smooth. So inside M, we take at boundary points of A, we take the outer unit normal vectors. This defines some subset in the sphere bundle of M, which is the set of unit tangent vectors of M. And there's some some form here such that each interval on the normal cycle plus this inner term gives the intrinsic volumes. Term gives the intrinsic volumes. It turns out that these differential forms can be constructed using only the curvature tensor of M and hence these functionals here, they are intrinsic. So we started with some extrinsic construction, but then we end up with something intrinsic. We end up with something intrinsic, intrinsic of m. Okay, so this is an instance of the Weyl principle. We go from extrinsic to intrinsic. Okay, so I repeat these functionals depend only on the Riemannian structure of the Riemannian manifold M. So given a Riemannian manifold, you can forget about the embedding, you have some canonically defined functionals called intrinsic volumes, and that's why. Called intrinsic volumes, and that's why they are called intrinsic. Okay, so this is not the ultimate vile principle that Joe was looking for on his talk on Monday because he wanted to have something intrinsic of A. This is something weaker, but still it's something very, very interesting and non-trivial, although classical. So let me add here two remarks. add here two two remarks first for k equals zero uh mu k so this thing here is just the euler characteristic of a and hence this thing here is is a gaussman theorem in fact this this was proved uh by by churn exactly this is uh i think the the most general form of the calf-pony theorem that churn proved okay for k bigger than zero For k bigger than zero, we don't actually know who proved this first, although already Joe mentioned this. At least Chigar Muller and Schrader knew it, but we don't know the source. And another remark is that if you take M to be Rn itself, Euclidian space, then it makes sense to take A to be a convex body. And then these things are the classical Cairns integrals. Integrals. Okay, so Kerr's integrals are some canonical examples of valuations, and it was proved by Simon Alesker that in a precise sense, almost every translation invariant and continuous valuation can be presented in this way. Okay, and this led him to develop a theory of valuations inspired by the class. Evaluations inspired by the classical theory of evaluations in RN on abstract manifolds. So I will not say much about this theory. It's a very powerful theory, but I will just state the definition of the fundamental object. So evaluation on a smooth manifold M is a functional on some class of sets, for instance the class of compact manifolds with sub-manifolds with boundary. With sub-manifolds with boundary, which is of the form we have seen before. So of A is some inner term plus some boundary term, where now phi and land are general, arbitrary differential forms. So this is a, by definition, an object like this is evaluation. So Euler characteristic is evaluation and also intrinsic volumes are canonical valuations that one can associate to every Riemannian manifold. Every Riemannian manifold. Now, I should add here some disclaimer, some small remark. Since I'm not assuming here M to be Riemannian, it doesn't make sense to look at the normal cycle using the construction before, so I cannot take the outer unit vectors because I don't have a metric here. But this can be constructed more intensely. Instead of taking the normal vector, you take the tangent. Normal vector, you take the tangent hyperplane, the oriented tangent hyperplane. So, by definition, here the normal cycle is constructed like this. So, here SM is no longer the sphere bundle, but this is the cosphere bundle. So, it's the set of oriented hyperplanes, linear hyperplanes in every tangent space. But this is just a small detail, which is needed because I will not be working with Riemannian manifolds. With Riemannian manifolds, but with pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. So let's consider now the case of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. So first I will introduce some notation. MPQ will denote a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature P, Q. This means the following. M is a smooth manifold and on the tangent space at every point of M, we have a We have a symmetric bilinear form, which is supposed to be non-degenerate. That's the main point to remember. It will be non-degenerate everywhere. That's what pseudo-Riemannian means. And hence it has a signature. We will assume that M is connected and then this signature will be constant. So for such manifolds, there is a well-classical Gauss-Munnier theorem, which was proved. Gauss-Monnier theorem, which was proved by Chern and Affei independently, and it says as follows: given a compact manifold MPQ without boundary, that's important, the Euler characteristic of M is the integral of some polynomial of the coefficients of the curvature tensor. So this polynomial is the Fafian, so everything is just like the classical Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Okay, and for the other extrinsic, intrinsic volume, sorry. Intrinsic volume, sorry. Everything is like in the Riemannian case. So by mimicking the Riemannian construction, by mimicking the differential forms in the Riemannian case, one can construct intrinsic volumes for such a closed pseudo-Riemannian manifold. So everything looks like in the Riemannian case, but remember that for Riemannian manifolds, we have something more. And manifolds, we have something more than a collection of numbers, we have a collection of functionals. So, we would like to have the same here. We would like to have given a sub-manifold A in some pseudo-Riemannian space NPQ, we would like to have some intrinsic volumes, mu I of A. Okay, well there are some fundamental differences, however, between the Riemannian and the pseudo-Riemannian case. First, a small one is that you cannot use cubes here because for instance if you are in Lorentz space and you try to look at the cube of around the curve, then this with this cube, say the space. This with this cube, say the space-like curve, this cube will be will be non-compact. So this approach doesn't work at all here. Look at the volume of the tube because it's just non-compact. But maybe a more fundamental difference between the Riemannian and the Sue-Riemannian settings is the following, something very, very basic. But if you take a sub-manifold in a Riemannian space, then you get the sub-manifold itself. The submanifold itself is something Riemannian, but this is not true in the pseudo-Riemannian case. So, if you take a sub-manifold in MPQ, then in general, there will be degenerate points. When you look at the restriction of the metric, there will be points where it's degenerate, even if the MPND is non-degenerate. Like, for instance, here, if you take a curve in the Lorentz plane, if you have a point where If you have a point where the tangent line is like-like, then the metric degenerates here. And related to this, the signature will change from one point to another point. For instance, here, this is time-like and this is space-like. So, that's a big difference between the Riemannian and the pseudo-Riemannian. And nevertheless, we would like to have. Nevertheless, we would like to have the same we had in the Riemannian case. So that's the first goal, to get some intrinsic volumes for some manifolds in pseudo-Riemannian spaces. And more intrinsically, we would like afterwards to take an intrinsic viewpoint and look at intrinsic volumes of abstract manifolds with this. With this kind of behavior. So we would like to allow changes in the signature and data points for the matrix. Okay. Joe, sorry, there is a question from Zhao Fu. Did Chern know about the IRMI? Again. Did Chern know about it? Yeah, I understood. I understood. But I don't know. I don't know the answer. I don't know if Chern knew about it. I don't know if Chern knew about it. I also don't know who actually I have no reference for that. I don't know if this is well known. It's not difficult. But I'm not quite understanding the question. So, you can, the question is whether or not you can define some curvature integrals because they don't correspond to cube formulas. What are they? not what are they sorry i i think the question is whether this this sentence and sentence here i don't understand this sentence to be to be honest yes so so if if you let to go back here so if you take a to be m then this is no longer there you have to look only There, you have to look only here, right? And so, so these phi case, you can define them in the solder-Riemannian case also. Sure, so the statement is that you can write some integrals, but the geometric variant is no longer there. Exactly. Okay. Okay. So I I don't know if Chern or somebody else know about this. It's just a small remark. Okay, so I will go ahead. So the problem with with these with these with these two goals is the following one. Is the following one is that whenever you have a manifold, say a sub-manifold with degenerate points, or more abstractly, if you have a metric with degenerate points, there are problems here. So if you take a point here, a non-degenerate point, then you have a curvature tensor. But as the point approaches a degenerate point, this curvature tensor typically explodes. Explodes and this causes these intervals to diverge. So, some authors make some strong assumptions on the behavior of the metric near the degeneracy points, which prevent these intervals to diverge. But these hypotheses are usually very strong and they are non-generic. So, instead of that, we will take some different approach which allows us to admit. Which allows us to admit generic sub-manifolds and generic metrics of changing signature. And this approach is based on the classical idea of using distributions, the theory of distributions, to turn these diverging integrals into finite values. And I should mention that this idea, at least in this setting, goes back to Gautier Berg, and also it was already there in the It was already there in the initial work of Dima Feifman and Seminole Leskar. So, let me say a few words about the theory of distributions. This is all, I think, well known, but it will be good for the talk to remind some very basic facts. So, I start with generalized measures. And by definition, a generalized measure is an element of this dual space. Element of this dual space. So it's a functional on the space of compactly supported smooth functions of m. And the classical and illustrative example is this one here. So I start with x plus, that's the positive part of the identity function, and I raise it to some complex exponent s and I take this function multiplied by the Lebesgue measure. Multiplied by the Lebesgue measure. So if S is big, say if the real part of S is bigger than minus 1, then this is a measure in the whole line. But if S is has real part smaller than minus 1, then this cannot be integrated at zero. So it's a measure only on the half, on the positive half line, but it it's not a measure on the whole line. whole line okay however if you consider these these things at least for when they make sense for for the case when the real part of s is bigger than one if you consider these objects not as measures but as generalized measures then you can extend them by analytic continuation to a family a meromorphic family on the Family on the parameter s of objects here. Okay, so we have here a Meromorphic family of generalized measures with some poles at this point, minus one, minus two, etc. But at least away from these poles, we have some object where we have nothing if we insisted on having measures. Okay, now I just want to make this small remark that this. This is more remarkable that these generalized measures can be integrated across zero. For instance, they can be integrated from a negative A to a positive B. This amounts to a pair this generalized measure with this indicator function. And well, a priori, you could not do this because this is not smooth and we We took the test functions to be smooth, but there is no real problem here because this is the discontinuities A and B are away from the singularity of these noise measures. So as long as A and B are non-zero, this is well defined. And this is the idea, to associate a finite value to an otherwise diversion integral by taking generalized measures instead of measures. Generalized measures instead of measures. So that's what we want to do. And following this idea, we will consider just measures, but also small, lower-dimensional, lower-degree differential forms. So we will consider the space of generalized forms of degree k. By definition, this is the dual of the space of compactly supported n minus k. Of compactly supported M minus K forms on M. And yeah, of course, this is the space of currents, but when you think of a current, you are thinking of a generalized, in this case, M minus K sub manifold. But this is not how we want to think of these objects. We don't want to think of this as generalized sub-manifolds, but as generalized forms. So we will view this space as a completion of the space of K. As a completion of the space of k forms, smooth k forms on m okay okay now given a k form on m and a k dimensional submanifold we know that it's of course a we can integrate the k form on a but then the question is whether given a generalized form of degree k K whether it can be integrated on a k-dimensional submanifold. And this can be done only under certain hypotheses. Just like here, I had to avoid some particular cases. So A and B had to be different from zero. So there is also a condition here. The condition is the following. Condition is the following. This interval is defined if the sub-manifold A is transversed to some set of directions. So that's what is written here. This set of directions is the so-called wavefront set. I will not give the definition, but let me just say that a distribution has some set of bad directions, which is Which is attached to the singularities of the distribution, and provided that your submanifold is transverse to this set of directions, then these integrals will be well defined. But more or less the same we had here. So that's our approach. So what we will do now is to look What we will do now is to look go back to the definition of evaluations and where we had differential forms, we will now put generalized differential forms. This notion was already studied by Semyon Alesker and he also developed a theory. This is the notion of a generalized valuation. So, a generalized valuation. There are other ways to introduce to other ways to to introduce to to define them but for today it's it's best to to use this definition a generalized valuation on a smooth manifold is a functional of this form the same as before but now phi and lambda are no longer forms but generalized forms okay now by what i just said in the previous slide these expressions will not make sense for every submanifold Sense for every submanifold, but there are some transversality conditions that need to be imposed. But okay, so you can think of a generalized valuation as a valuation which is only partially defined. The set of sub-manifolds where it's defined will depend on the shared. It's defined will depend on the generalized log version. Okay, so with that, I can already present the main result of our project, which is the following. For a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, MPQ, for every pseudo-Riemannian manifold, there is, so to say, canonical family of generalized evaluations which satisfy. Which satisfy a number of conditions, a number of properties, which are very much analogous to the properties of the Euclidean of the Riemannian intrinsic volumes, and therefore we call these generalized valuations the Sodoriemannian intrinsic volumes. Okay, so let's look at these properties. So the first one is some form of the Weyo principle. Wealth principle. It says that if M is isometrically embedded in some bigger pseudo-Riemannian manifold, so for instance, if M is already a sub-manifold of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, but M is assumed to be pseudo-Riemannian also, then the restriction of the intrinsic volumes of N will give precisely the intrinsic volumes of M. Volumes of M. So to say this differently, if you take a submanifold A here and then you evaluate the intrinsic volumes that we constructed here, it will be the same as if you put A in there and you evaluate the intrinsic volumes in the image. This property in the Riemannian case is something that follows from the tube formula. From the tube formula, but here we have no tube formula, and hence this needs a proof. And actually, the proof was a little bit tricky. We had to compute some non-trivial intervals, but in the end, it worked. Okay, so that's some vial principle. And property two is something that we of course wanted to have, namely that mu zero is the Euler characteristic. characteristic. So this in particular that this means that our result in particular contains as a corollary some Gauss-Wernet theorems for sub-manifolds in Suder-Riemannian spaces. And in the next slide I will show two examples of those Grossbonny theorems. Those Grossbonne theorems. Okay. So the last, so that was the first one. First one is characteristic. Last one is volume, up to some multiple. This multiple is a power of i, and maybe I should now emphasize this. These generalized valuations do not take values on the real numbers, but on they have complex values. And this is And this is related to the fact that we use that canonical, that classical family of valuations, which were some Meromorphic family and hence they have complex values. But in fact, this is something quite natural in this pseudo-Riemannian setting. For instance, if you take mu1, some very basic example, mu1 applied to a curve. mu n applied to a curve in the in the so one-dimensional curve in the Riemannian case this is the length of the curve now in the pseudo-Riemannian case this will be the length of the curve is if the curve is space-like but if the curve is time-like then this will be i times the length of the curve which is quite natural because there's some square root of a negative number there right okay so so it's it's it's quite So it's quite natural to have complex values. Okay. Yeah. So these two properties, this is something easy, which holds in the Riemannian case. So if you scale the metric by some positive factor t, then this is the effect on the k-dimensional intrinsic volume. This is something easy for the Easy for the Riemannian case, and it's also easy here. This is some nice property with respect to products. We have this QNUS type formula, and this also works in this Super-Riemannian case. And this is something I find quite funny. So, we do the following. We take the Sur-Riemannian metric and we change its sign. It's something you can't do in the Riemannian case, but you can do it. Do in the Riemannian case, but you can do it here. So, what's the effect on the intrinsic volumes? So, first, it gets the intrinsic volumes, they get conjugate, and then they get multiplied by this factor. And this factor is something that you would expect because you are multiplying by t equals minus one here, right? But there's also this conjugation, which may be surprising at first, but then you realize that. But then you realize that it has to be there because if you change the sign twice, then you should get the same intrinsic volume. And this would not be the case if you didn't have this conjugation here, right? Okay, so let me next give you two examples of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem that is contained in the previous result. That is contained in the previous result in low dimensions. So, first we look at the case of a surface, a surface in Lorentz three-dimensional space. So, that's R3 endowed with this bilinear form of signature 2,1. And the Gaussmann's theorem says that the Euler characteristic of our surface A is some constant times the integral on our surface of some On our surface of some distribution. Now, to write down the distribution, I will need to use some auxiliary Euclidean structure, namely this one, the standard one, the standard Euclidean structure of R3. So this DAE, this denotes the Euclidean area measure on the surface A. This is the Gauss curvature. This is the Gauss curvature, but the Euclidean Gauss curvature. This vector here is the Euclidean normal vector. And then to this vector, we apply the bilinear form Q. And to this function, we apply the, or we compose it with the distribution x minus. Before I had x plus, now I have x minus to this to this power. Minus to this power. So, okay, this maybe looks a bit strange, but that's because I am using this auxiliary structure. If you move away from visionary points, if you look at this at a point where the surface is space-like, then this is nothing but the Lorentz Gauss curvature multiplied by the graph. Lorentz Gauss curvature multiplied by the Lorentz volume element. And if you place yourself at a space where the surface is time-like, then this is just zero. But at the generic points, I cannot describe the distribution unless I use this Euclidean structure. But at least you see that this is something very, very concrete. That this is something something very, very concrete and it doesn't look so different from the Euclidean Gauss-Wonnie theorems. However, depending on the parity of the dimensions, there are some cases where these Gauss-Wooney theorems are very different from the Euclidean one. For instance, this is something very simple, but to illustrate, if you look at the regular domain in the Lorentz plane, the anti-Euler characteristic is just one-fourth. Is just one-fourth of this intersection number, the intersection number between the normal cycle and the set of flight directions. Yeah, this is some form of the name, Ponkari-Hoff index theorem. But just to show you that, to show you that these functionals can be a bit different from the Euclidean ones. What's behind this... What's behind this intersection number is that the distribution we construct is some direct delta here. Just one remark here is that, of course, this intersection number is only defined if these two objects are transverse, if these two submanifolds are transverse. And I was not And I was not telling you what are the conditions that A must satisfy, but remember that in the previous slide we have generalized valuations and hence they can only be applied if some transversality conditions are satisfied. And I did not tell you about those conditions, but that's what I want to do next. So the condition for condition for that we need to apply our intrinsic volumes to a submanifold is the following a submanifold a in some pseudo-Riemannian ambient MPQ is called LC transversal here LC stands for light cone if the normal cycle is transverse to this To this light cone LC set of directions or this L C bundle. Maybe I just translate what this means for a curve in Lorentz plane. This condition does not forbid the curve to have contact with light lines, but it just Light light lines, but it just means that the contact should not be degenerate. So the contact of this curve with a light, light line should not be two. Or said otherwise, the curvature here should not be zero. So this is a generic condition, and in general, this is always a generic condition. And provided this condition. And provided this condition is satisfied, then we can indeed apply the intrinsic volumes to the submanifold A. So for a generic class of submanifolds, we do have intrinsic volumes. And in particular, that's the class of submanifolds where we have a Kaus-Booney theorem. Now I would like to take a more intrinsic viewpoint and look at the restriction of the ambient metric to one of these submanifolds. So I said already in the beginning that the restriction of the ambient metric to A will in general be a metric of changing signature. But we want to see now what restriction on the restricted metric does follow from this condition. So we're imposing some condition on A. We want to see what this means for the metric that we get on A. A. Okay, so this is the condition that follows from that. So we say that a symmetric two-covariant tensor G on a manifold X, so that's a metric of changing signature because I'm not assuming this symmetric tensor to be non-degenerate. So we say it's L C regular if the following condition is satisfied. Condition is satisfied, the value zero should be a regular value, not a critical value, of this function. Okay, this function is just apply, take some vector and apply g to v, v. This is a smooth function on the tangent bundle. This will always be critical at zero, but we remove the zero section. remove the zero section. So away from the zero section, this function can be, can have zero as a critical value or not. We ask that it is not. Okay, this is some intrinsic condition and the result is the following, given an abstract manifold X endowed with a metric of changing signature. Of changing signature G with this property. So an LC regular manifold X can be realized as a sub-manifold in some pseudo-Riemannian space which has this L C transversality condition. And vice versa, if you take some manifold in MPQ which is L C transversal and then you Which is LC transversal, and then you look at the restriction, then this restriction is precisely an LC regular metric. So we have this correspondence between an extrinsic notion, an intrinsic notion, and it's a one-to-one correspondence. Okay, so what can we do now if we are given If you, if, if we are given such an abstract object, a manifold with an L C Reibolar metric, we can first embed it into some pseudo-Riemannian space, and then we can evaluate these intrinsic volumes on it, and we get some family of invariants attached to this abstract manifold of changing. Manifold of changing signature. Moreover, by the vial principle we had, these invariants are indeed invariant. They will not depend on the embedding. And in particular, for mu zero, this gives us a Gauss-Bony theorem for LC regular manifolds, which I state here. So, given a So, given a compact manifold X endowed with a Nelsi regular metric G, there exists some distribution, some generalized measure lambda, such that the Euler characteristic of the manifold equals the integral of the generalized measure. And this generalized measure we constructed using some embedding, but then we saw that the result does not. Show that the result does not depend on the embedding, so this line is something intrinsic. Okay, now in the remaining five minutes, I would like to do some integral geometry. So we have some results in the spirit of the classical integral geometry into the Riemannian sphere. geometry into Riemannian spheres where these intrinsic volumes are the main characters. So let me first introduce some notation. Actually I've been using this notation already but I think it was clear enough. So RpQ is RP plus Q, so a vector space of this dimension with this standard bilinear form. bilinear form which has signature p, q. Okay, so that's some some pseudo some standard pseudo Riemannian manifold which is flat, but I want now to look at some space forms. So if we look at vectors such as V in RPQ such that Q of V equals 1 over K where K is equals 1 over k, where k is some positive number, I get so-called pseudosphere, which is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature kappa. And if I do the same with a negative k, I also get a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of concept of second-virtual kappa. In this case, this is called the pseudosphere and this is called the The pseudosphere, and this is called a pseudo-Riemannia pseudo-hyperbolic space. So, for instance, if Q is one, then this is called the citrusphere, and this is just the Riemannian hyperbolic space of curvature kappa. Okay, so these are some easy, the easiest pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. They are very symmetric, they have lots of ideas. Very symmetric, they have lots of isometries, and hence it is to be expected that there will be few isometry-invariant generalized valuations on these spaces. But of course, the intrinsic volumes are isometry-invariant. So, the theorem here is not surprising. It says that these intrinsic volumes are the only isometry invariant generalized valuation. Isometry invariant and generalized valuations on these very symmetric spaces. Just one remark is that mu zero is your local activistic, it's real valued, and mu p plus q is some multiple of volume. So it's either real or imaginary valued. But in between the other intrinsic volumes, they can have. The other intrinsic volumes they can have, they in general have real and imaginary parts, so you have to consider also the complex conjugate. Okay, so this is some kind of Heidier theorem. And using this theorem, one can do integral geometry as in the classical case. And the result we have so far is some Grafton formula. Sergeil, there is a question in the chat. Can the lambda of this manifold be related to lambda? Sorry, is it? Can you repeat? Yes, can the lambda of the manifold be related to lambda? I'm not sure that maybe the can the lambda of the manifold be related to lambda? Maybe Leo can ask herself. Yes, you said that for this theorem, you used some kind of embedding and proved that the construction of lambda does not depend on the embedding. So I asked myself if if then if this means that the lambda of a of a submanifold can be can can be related to lambda in a natural way. Can be related to lambda in a natural way, or so I don't know if I understood the question. So it's the question whether we can describe this lambda intrinsically without using an embedding. Or if the lambda of a submanifold can be can be somehow expressed or in terms of the lambda of the of the whole uh the whole manifold. The whole manifold. You mean sub-manifold of X? Yes. We did not look at sub-manifolds of X. But I think he refers to the Lambda in the definition of the smooth valuation. Ah, that's the lambda in the definition of the smooth valuation. No, no. No, no, no, it's not. It's not. Well, depends. Depends. I'm sorry, I think I don't understand the question. So if I'm referring to this lambda here in the theorem. This lambda? Yes. And what's the other lambda then? Well, I mean. Well, I mean, the lambda depends on the manifold X, right? Yes. So if I have a sub-manifold Y of X, then there's also Lambda Y, so to speak. I don't know, because I don't know what's Y then. I mean, we never considered sub-manifolds in LC regular manifolds. This would be the next later. Okay. This would be the next layer. We we did not look into that. But if those were just Rubenian manifolds, then uh you have the Gaussian curvature of the larger manifold, the smaller ones. They're related but in a complicated way. You mean in the Riemannian case? Yes. Yes. I'm sorry, this is very difficult. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, so just very, very, very, very briefly. We have a Krafton formula in RPQ, which looks exactly the same as in the UP. The same as in the Euclidean space, namely μk equals the Euler characteristic, the integral of Euler characteristics of intersections with affine planes, except that this measure here is, of course, not a true measure, but a generalized measure. And in the case of the pseudosphere and pseudo-hyperbolic space, we also have some. We also have some Grafton formulas which again look exactly as in the Riemannian case. Again, except that this is some generalized measure. And I think it's remarkable here that the formula looks exactly as in the Riemannian case. So it does not depend at all, at least formally, it doesn't depend. It doesn't depend on the signature. And in particular, the functionals that appear here, they could be mus and their conjurates. So the conjugates could appear here in principle, but in the end, it turns out that they do not appear. Okay, so there's some kind of holomorphicity here. And maybe I should be honest here. So on the left-hand side, On the left-hand side, we need to make some strong assumptions on A for these integrals to be well defined. But at least we can show that this is well defined if A is some strictly convex set. Okay, so thank you very much. That's all what I wanted to tell you. So uh there are at least the questions. Uh Jan. Yeah, thanks. Hi Jill. So I have the following question. So you said that the tube formula doesn't exist in general in the sodium setting, right? Explain why. And but what if you start like from the And but what if you start like from the right hand side of it? So what what if you just take your intrinsic volumes and just consider some polynomial where the intrinsic volumes are as coefficients, maybe somehow normalized? Is there some meaning of this then or just doesn't make any sense? No, it doesn't. I mean I don't know. It was for the geometric interpretation of that of that. So I mean in some space So, I mean, in some special cases, it's the tube formula, right? Yes, in some special cases, for instance, if you take in R21, say you take a space-like, sorry, a time-like curve, then the tube will be compact in that case. So, whenever the normal space is of a definite type, then you have a compact cube and then. Tube and then the tube formula actually takes the same form as in the Riemannian case in terms of our intrinsic values. But if you have something like this, and then the tube is something non-compact, it would be nice that maybe there is a way to give to assign it some renormalized volume to this non-compact region, and then it's given. It's given by some tube formula, but we don't know. No, but it doesn't have to be a tube formula, it just might have another meaning. Yeah, but I don't know. It's okay. Yeah, yeah, I understand. Your question was to give a meaning to the right-hand side of the tube. Okay, yeah, this would be very nice, but I don't know. Thank you very much. Thank you. In your last theorem, can you say a little bit more what are these measures, generalized measures, DLM, on grassmanions? For example, whether they are unique in some sense, what is so because otherwise, okay, something, yeah, so we don't we don't have um um Classification of the invariant generalized measures on the Rasmanians so far. So these are, we think, quite natural. At least they have some nice property that they behave well under restrictions to lower dimensional linear spaces, which is not the case of every, I mean, it does not. It's not so easy to get this property. But we don't have a classification. We cannot say this is the unique because there's no uniqueness here. But for example, if you take complex connugation of both sides, then I guess these measures are not real variants. This is how we construct them, actually, by means of some analytic continuation procedure. Continuation procedure. I said something trivial. If you take complex conjugation of your form, sorry, complex conjugation. So complex conjugation of this measure del M is different. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so we have some construction we think is more or less natural and it leads to this. leads to this this within a nice formula, but we don't have uniqueness. Also, I think we can suspect at least that they have maximally large supports and we didn't prove it but it's probably true that this is the measure with the largest possible support among the invariant measures. Once again, that's not proof. So there is So there is a question by Daniel possesses the same question as Simeon. So, but maybe Daniel, are you satisfied with the answer that Simon got? So there was not really an answer in some sense. Yes, there was an answer. The answer was no. But so, can you describe it somehow more explicitly? Okay, so maybe I can say something trivial. So these measures on the open orbit, so away from degenerate planes, there is uniqueness there. And so the problem is that you have several regions and you have uniqueness on each region. So the freedom you have is first you can choose different normalizations on different regions and you have to do it properly to have something that fits together to a distribution. And there's an extra degree of freedom which is which is there can be distribution supported on the desienate locus. So that's where the I wonder whether there's a natural I wonder whether there's a natural group operation on the afflank Rasmanian and whether you get some harm effect with respect to this operation or is this not the right approach? There is a group, it's this group, but this group is non-compact. That's the source of the problem. The usual statement that there is a unique abnormalization measure, they do not apply here. But the Lebesgue measure is also unique. The unique translation variant measure, and it's non-connectable. But you don't have such uniqueness here. It's like, I mean, it's like this very classic. Sorry. So here we have this given a degree. You have this distribution and you have this other one. So you have two distributions and so you have two degrees of freedom. And this kind of phenomenon happens also in the Rasmanian. So whenever you have a... Okay. We kind of need to. We kind of need to stop because the next talk starts in a minute. So sorry, we can continue after the session. Thank you again, Jill. Thank you. So I stopped sharing. And the next talk starts in a minute.
