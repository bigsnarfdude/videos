Uh there have been a slight break of two or three years when there have been limited uh meetings, so there are a lot of places I don't know and I would like to encourage people to actually wear their name tags so that we can identify them. So, our first speaker who is wearing your name tag even though I think I do almost everybody here. So, Zoe Fatijak from University of Microsoft Kathy Dakis from University of ICITE will talk on nothing different the laws of the answer. Okay, so the question came originally from well, it was caused by a By a it was poemed by a differential algebraist, Michael Singer, and it had to do with the fact that well, they usually draw parallel between differential fields and difference fields. So a difference field is a field with an automorphism, or actually with an endomorphism. But when you require that, we usually require that it is an automorphism. Okay. Okay, so usually the two have parallel treatments, especially when the algebraic study started in the 60s. So they were pretty behaving in the same way. And it is well known, I mean well known. Right. Well, I guess here you have the definition. Everybody knows that, right? A differential field is a field. Well, it's usually. Okay. It's a field with an operator which is linear. Which is linear, so d of A plus B is DA plus D, but which satisfies Cauchy's rule, D of AB is ADB plus B D A. You can have several of them, they can commute or not. Anyway, so well, all my things are commutative. They are actually of characteristic zero, because in characteristic P everything becomes messy, even in the case of differentiable fields. And well, I guess here down there I have an example of I have an example of difference field, but I'll give you more examples later than on the board. Okay, so the theory of differential fields of characteristic zero admits a model companion, the theory of differentially closed fields. So it has a series of axioms, which are nice. Their model theory is complete. You don't have to say anything, I mean, except for the characteristic being zero, and they eliminate quantifiers, and they admit elimination of imaginaries, and they are omegastable. Omegastability means that over any differential field, you have a prime model, and this prime model is unique up to isomorphism. Unique optimisomorphism rather than the control flow. Okay? Right. So I guess I should mention that in positive characteristic, the model companion exists. It's very much linked to the theory of separably closed fields. It's a bit stronger. I mean, you cannot interpret the derivation of non-separably closed fields. But, you know, apart from that, it's very It behaves like a a separate equation. Okay. So, yes, I should say that, you know, the fact that this uniqueness of the prime model, I don't know if you ever went to see the proof. In the countable case, it's easy. In the uncountable case, it's a bit more challenging, let's put that way. I think one of the proofs I saw was by induction of the Bolivar. It's acceptable. But so, all that to say that the algebraist could figure out that differential closure of a countable differential field is unique up to the isomorphism, but in the uncountable case, it requires a bit more work. Okay? Right. So, anyway, the question, the natural question, is since differential fields and difference fields Differential fields and difference fields are so similar, do they have? Does there exist a concept of difference quotient? Okay. No. Wrong direction. Is the prime order minimum? In the case of differential fields, no. It's not minimal. I mean, this was actually proved later, I think, by Schiller, an argument of Schillard, and at the same time of Rosen. Rosenlich and Colchins. All three of them wrote separate papers at the same time. Okay, right. So basically you have these equations, okay, these differential equations, which need a solution, okay? But they are they have a trivial, so they have rank one and they have a trivial geometry, okay? Meaning that if you add one, well you have only added one. One, well, you have only added one. So you need to add a second one, etc., etc., etc. So you see that you have to need to add countably many, which means that if you take out one from that set and still build a prime model over this, and it will not contain the element that you removed, you see? Okay, so that's right. So this is really done by exhibiting these very By exhibiting these very strongly trivial types. Okay, now what about difference fields? So I said that they are very much like differential fields, but not quite. So they also have met the model companion, both in characteristic zero and characteristic P. They don't have elimination of quantifier, the problem being that if you have an automorphism on the film, On the field, you don't know how it extends to the algebraic closure. There might be several non-isomorphic ways of extending it. One example, Q. Q with a trivial automorphism. There are 2 to the LF0 way of extending this to the algebraic closure of Q. And anything is possible. Definable sets are well understood since it's model complete and it's actually not only model complete, but you can choose the existential quantity. Can choose the existential quantifier to have finite fibers. So, in other words, any definable subset will be the projection of a quantifier-free definable set, the projection having finite values. Okay, so that's quite nice. And actually, this comes from another result which says that if you have, you are, let's say you are working in a big model, or well, if you have an algebraically closed If you have an algebraically closed difference field, okay, algebraically closed as a field, then the theory ACFA union, the diagram, the quantifier-free diagram of that is complete. So it's really just going to be algebraic closure which causes problems. Good. So even though it's not nice, I mean it's a bit complicated, it eliminates imaginaries. It eliminates imaginaries. I mean, any completion eliminates imaginaries. It is not stable, but it is super simple. The the SU rank behaves well. I mean, it's either, I mean, if you take a single term, it's either infinite, I mean, it's either omega or finite. Okay. And right. And the fixed subfield, which is the set of points of the model. The set of points of the model which are fixed by sigma is not algebraically closed. Actually, Anon proved that you cannot have the model companion of a theory which says that the fixed field is algebraically closed, just as in Breck. But it is pseudo-finite, which is almost an ex-best thing. I'm joking. Okay, so. Okay, so in other words, we also understand it well, and it turns out that it's stably embedded. You know, even though it's highly unstable, it has the independence property, but it's stably embedded. So in a sense, things which happen in there are not so important. Okay, so the question is, is there a notion I mean, do differential difference closure exist and are they unique? And are they unique? And the answer is unfortunately no. So, first of all, there was the problem that knowing the automorphism on a non-algebraically closed field is not enough. But then there is the problem of the prime field, of the fixed field, right? It has to be pseudo-finite. So certainly and you know, if it is not pseudo-finite, then certainly you don't have a prime model, okay? Because pseudo-finite, right? Because I sort of find some of them. So, you need to assume two conditions. Right, so I just said it, right? So, but even if you assume all these, so algebraically closed, pseudo-finite field, pseudo-finite fixed field, that then it's not enough. Okay, there are examples where it doesn't work. Examples where it doesn't work. But if you think about it a bit, I mean, actually, it's not so surprising because you see, first of all, our theory is only super simple. So for instance, you have stable, I mean, you have definite groups which are stable, but which are actually only super stable, right? They are not omega-stable. Which means that, well, if you have a super stable theory, usually. If you have a superstable theory, usually you don't always have time. So the idea was to start doing it, to start looking at another concept which was introduced by Chenel, which is, well, I suppose you all know the concept of capacitor in the project. So every type over a subset of size cardinality less than kappa has Cardinality less than kappa is realized. Okay? Are you in characteristic zero or arbitrary characteristic at one? So far? Or you need to? Yeah, I guess yes, I should say it. Right. So yes, it turns out that in characteristic P, I will explain it later, things are complicated. Okay, so from now on we are in characteristic C. However, the definition of kappa saturation doesn't need to be in characteristic. Maybe for the previous question. Okay, so, right, kappa saturated everybody knows, right? Even the youngsters who don't know, right? Yes? LF epsilon saturated. Every strong type over a finite set is realized, okay? In our case, because we have elimination of imaginary, every type over the algebraic closure of a finite set is real. Good. Right. So, in the case of a superstable theory, okay. It's it's very disconcerting to see this person looking at you. That's a good trick. It's good food. Yeah, covert and swallow. Okay, so the trick is, yes, you have the notion of kappa-saturated model, right? And then you have the notion of kappa prime model. So meaning a model is kappa prime over set A, right? Kappa prime overset A, right? If it is kappa saturated and whenever and it embeds in every kappa saturated model of table A, all right? Elementary? Elementary, of course. Of course. Okay. So he showed that not only they exist, so if theory is super stable, they exist in all unfamiliar coordinates, and they are unique up to isomorphism. Okay? In the case of scalar theories, there are a bit of restrictions on the possible cardinals, just but because you know spa theories are a bit more complicated. But anyway, that's what you want to do. All right? Okay, right. So, of course, there is an obvious thing that you need to. Excuse me, sorry. So, what is all epsilon? LF epsilon and its strong type of a finite set. A model is LF epsilon saturated if every strong type of a finite set is realized, which means in our case every type of the algebraic closure of a finite set is realized. So it's stronger than just LFC or saturation. And in our case, for instance, they will have epsilon saturation plus trendy. Epsilon saturation implies tritonality to do this. Okay. Alright. Okay. So this is what we want to prove, which is that, okay, so we are in characteristic zero. As I said, the fixed field has to be pseudofinax, right? So since it's definable, it not only has to be pseudofinax has to be kata saturated, okay? And the field K, so it needs to be algebraically closed. So the fixed field F of K is kappa saturated and K is algebraically closed. And then the result is that K has a kappa prime model and it is unique as a constant. Okay, I will discuss it a bit, you know, why is it that positive characteristic is really... Positive characteristic is really messy. Yes, and I should say that one of the really important remarks, I mean, this is how I put the theorem, is that you use the characterization of kappa prime models. So it's somewhere in Schiller's book. I will say that I'm not never completely sure of the reference. M is kappa prime over K if and only if it's kappa atomic over K and any sequence of K indiscernibles has length less than or equal to kappa. Length less than or equal to kappa. Okay? Kappa atomic. Kappa isolated means that a type is kappa isolated if its restriction to a subset of the domain of the size smaller than kappa implies the whole time. Analogy to isolated. All right. So you see that, for instance, in the case of epsilon, right, it says a bit more than just it is isolated. More than just it is isolated. Okay, isolated type will be LF epsilon isolated, but of course it's false because it will say exactly what you know. Alright, and then a set is kappa atomic over k, that means that every finite topo is inside by a kappa atomic by a Every finite topo realizes you kept an isolated type of camera. Maybe anything else? Well, it's the same that with the other things. Okay, so every couple realizes a an LF epsilon uh isolated type over k. Over the algebraic closure of a finite set. Alright. So you see, this is what makes things work. I mean, this gives exactly the characterization. Okay, so what do you do? Well, you try to construct one. So the concept of construction is well known in stability. So it's termed the generalization in the setting of kappa observations. observations, right? And so you try to construct a model, you try to show that it has this property, and then well, hopefully show that it has this property, and then, okay, of course it embeds into, it's going to be prime, so it's going to embed into every prime model and so on and so on. But then you so you take two models with this property. So you take two models with this property and you start doing the backup first. I'm not saying it's easy, because you know it took me a while, but it's not that. Okay, so why would it? Okay, so I should say do you use super simplicity? Yes, I use much more. I'll discuss it. Okay, so I mean, so what one of the things we use in there is that encourages. In there is that in characteristic zero, the only source of instability is the fixed field. Every rank one type which is not locally modular and which is not stably embedded is non-orthogonal to the fixed field. Okay? So if you kill the physics field, you have a bulk. Alright? Encounteristic P. First of all, you have lots of physics fields. Okay? You have, because X boost. Because x goes to x to the p is a definable automorphism. So you can compose powers of this with your sigma out of sigma to the n as well. So you have millions of fixed fields. The other thing is that you don't have this nice dichotomy for types of rank 1, either stable, stably embedded, or fixed field. You have things which are locally modular, okay, rank 1, and still, who is making? And still, who is making tinting? And still, which are definitely not stable because you have the bilinear maps which are definable. So my conjecture is that it will, you know, unless you are already a model of ACFMP. ACFMP, there is no prime mode, okay? At least over an algebraically closed field. Okay. Okay, so let me do a bit more in detail. So the first step of the proof, and I think I guess, well, I'll discuss this a bit later, but I should say that there was a notion of stability of a predicate. Of a predicate. I don't remember exactly who introduced it. I think it was Schiller. And then it was pursued by Anon Pillai. And then recently, recently like 10 years ago, Schiller and Yuskietsov had a paper, The Stability of a Predicate. Okay, so I mean from just the name of it, right, you imagine that maybe my different closed fields of characteristic zero are stable of this. Of characters at zero are stable over the fixed field, by the name of it, from what I told you. And so they do develop a strategy to prove a certain number of things. And right, so the first step of the proof is to show that if you satisfy the hypothesis of the theorem, okay, then there is a kappa saturated model U. A saturated model U, which contains your K and which does not increase the fixed U. Okay? And this is actually implied by this concept of stability over P. Right? Stability over a predicate. Okay. Sorry, it's all zero. Characteristic zero. Characteristic zero. Yes, I've gotten rid of characteristic B, right? Because, you know, these bilinear forms and so on and so on. Okay, so you. Okay, so you right. So, first of all, you have a unique generic one type. It is actually stationary, which is quite, I mean, it's nice, let's put it that way. Right, there is a notion of transformal transcendent spaces, which behaves like a normal transcendent space. Okay, so transcendent space means the elements of your set, they don't The elements of your set, they don't satisfy any non-trivial difference equation. And everybody in the model satisfies some sigma algebraic equivalent, some difference equation about those things. So of course, kappa-saturated bottom has to have transformed trans kappa, has to have kappa-independent realization of the generic type and therefore. Generic type, and therefore either it already has the transformal transcendent base of cardinality greater than or equal to kappa, or it doesn't, in which case you need to add people. Doesn't matter. It's not difficult to do. These three lies, I mean, it's clear that when you add them and you take the algebraic closure, I mean it's clear, almost clear, that the thing that you obtain is actually capatomic and has no infinite, I mean, has no. Has no too big sequence of indices, okay? So that's his. I mean, well, wait, what did I miss something? I don't know. Yeah, so then we need to look at the other types. The other types they have finite rank, as I said. So therefore, they have what is called a semi-minimal analysis. So they have analysis. Analysis. So they have an analysis which consists of either types of rank one, which are man-based, stable, locally, or bits which are internal to the fixed fields. Okay? So you get the... So of course the idea is to do them one at a time since you have the chance of dealing with things of finite rank. Being dealing with things of finite rank, I mean, inductions are easy to do. And so, yeah, that's right. So, you have, maybe I should give some examples. I mean, you will see how they differ. I mean, so first of all, the equation sigma of x equals x, well, that's really defined if I fix sigma, okay, which is bad. Sigma of x equals x plus one. x equals x plus 1, well, you see that two distinct realizations of the things, if you take that difference, it's in the fixed together. So this is bad as well. C1 of x equals x squared and x different from 0. So this defines a subgroup of the multiplicative group, and it is actually local. Right? And it is actually locally modular and super stable with structures. And finally, but its group, sigma of x equals x squared plus 1 plus 1 is also locally modular, but with trivial geometry. I mean, trivial, it's a trivial thing. In this case, it's not strongly trivial in the sense that if you have a solution of it and you apply sigma, you still get a solution. You still get a solution, alright? So you have, you see, the set of solutions is sort of fixed by translates. But if you, instead of one, you take something which is highly generic, then you get something which is which has a true geometry. I mean, really true. Good. Now what? So, you see, we have okay, types of rank one just stable. One knows how to deal with them, or at least you know there's the guy who does super stability know how to deal with them. Actually, they are the ones that gave me the most trouble, but it's just because I don't know much stability theory. And then there are the types which are almost internal to the fixed field. Almost internal to everybody knows what this means? Knows what this means? Okay. No, I will give you the definition. Why doesn't it work? Did it go too far? Yes, no. Okay, so we do a get my construction. So the thing, yeah, yeah, the two types which are internal to F. which are internal to F and which are realized in are not stable, of course. Okay, so the first step is to replace the notion of internality by quantifier-free internality. Okay, well, almost internality by the way. Okay, so let me say that type of A over C is inter is uh almost internal to right? Is almost internal to right if there is some D, which is independent from A over C such that A belongs to the algebraic closure of D and the fore. F is the notation for F. Is the notation for our question? Alright, so in other words, so let's say C is algebraically closed as a difference field, right? Which coincides, by the way, with the model's theoretic algebraic closure, so that's fine. And so it says that there is, you can enlarge C, so you have C, you have D. So you have C, you have D, you have A, you have the difference field generated by A over D. So this stands for the field generated by A sigma, B sigma squared, so trust, sigma inverse of A sigma, huh? And then you have it such a very closure. Okay? And what it says is that this guy is Because this guy is actually, so D of A sigma, it belongs to, so I have my F which is somewhere, right? So I'm going to have DF and it belongs to DFL. Okay? Alright? Now, belonging to DFL, this means I mean, this means what? I mean, then there is a notion of internal. Internal means that it's definable. It belongs to even invertible? I'm sorry? It's invertible, right? If it's sufficiently saturated. Yeah, I mean, the type has already satisfied it. Yes, okay. I mean, it's not that it's equal. I mean, this is equal to that. Uh, containers actually. Containers actually. It's actually, it's it could be algebraic with a tuple which is in fixed sigma, and therefore you actually know what it's going to look like. In particular, the difference field generated by A will be finitely generated as a field. So, is algebra in the sense of field fields? Okay. But the ACL and the statement of the definition is it's also, yeah, it's the algebraic. It's also, yeah, it's the algebraic closure of the difference field generated by. Okay. Okay. So an algebraically closed difference field is algebraically closed in the sense of model theory. Okay. Thank you. Right. So the notion of 2F internality is that instead of saying it has to be there, you are saying that d of A sigma is A sigma is contained in DF. D of A sigma is contained in DF. So it's not only definable, but it's definable using a quantifier-free formula. In other words, I'm not trying to describe what's happening on the algebraic closure of T of A sigma. I'm just looking at the quantifier-free type. Alright? And it turns out that it's really. And it turns out that it's really a notion that only depends on the quantifier field type. And you have a good notion of Galois theory. Okay? So this is the definition of QF internality. So, well, as you see, it's, well, the point is that, given an A, you will find in C over C, right, given A over C, which you know it's almost internal to S, okay, then you will be able to find an A power. Then you will be able to find an A prime, which is even, I think, in C of in the difference field generated by A, equi-algebraic with A over C, and whose type is QF internal to the fixed field. Okay? So it should be 2F here. QF internal to F, yes. In the last slide. Yeah, that would be F is. Oh yeah, 2F internal to F, absolutely. You will always need additional parameters or for some for witnessing the interaction. Yes, yes, yes. Always or are there in some of the sigma of x equals x plus 1? You need one analyzation to give the analysis, okay? So, this is really what makes Galma theory, and different Galma theory. All right. Okay, and actually, it turns out that they're not as bad as you might think because, okay, so first of all, so you want, okay, what do you want to do? You have a QF internal type over your K. You want to realize it and to take all its realization, I mean to make it so that in a kappa-saturated model containing it, Containing it, you won't need it to increase it. So, there is actually, so just from internality and the usual super simplicity argument, you know that you cannot have too many, you cannot have a too long sequence of indiscernible without increasing the fixed pier. You see? And actually, this is exactly what happens. So, you have a type, it's almost internal to fixed sigma, it's a type of a small Over a small subset of K, right? You want to realize it. It's not realized in K, you want to realize it. And, well, okay, you don't increase the fixed field since otherwise it's realized inside F. You don't have anything to do. And so there is a very small, very small, that means algebraic closure of finite, a tuple B of realization of that type, such that. Such that actually, once you add those B, this total B, well, you get all the solutions of your. Alright? Okay, so here, F A of B contains all realization of the codifier-free type of A over A and even to its L reduct. So I guess I need to Okay, I need to assume that sigma v is in K over. Alright? So the lambda, the L reduct. So if you have a field which with this difference automorphism sigma, you can also view it with the automorphism sigma to the L. Okay? So you are saying less things. It's a reduction. It's also the model of this ECFA. And so this And so this is saying that I'm forgetting, I'm only keeping the sigma to the L equations which hold of little A over A. And F of A of V will realize them all. It's a bit stronger than just what you would imagine. I mean, it's not only that, but you get them all. And not only that, but if you realize But if you realize the quantifier free I mean it works for any B prime which realizes the quantifier free type of B over A or even a reduct of the quantifier type of B. And of course then you get that you have this implication. M is there is an M which is picks or the M is a lot which. And greater than one. Okay. Okay, so this is what makes things work. But you see, that sort of we have, you know, we have sort of reduced this instability problem to a finite tuple. And, you know, finite tuple, as soon as you realize that finite tuple, then you get all the saturation you want for this type, okay? For the realization of this type. You get all the realizations of the you don't no, you don't. All right? Good. All right, good. Okay, right. So, what's the time now? Aha, I only have five minutes. Okay, so I should. Yeah, right. So, I'm going to say a few words about the stability over a predicate. Okay, so it's introduced for theories which satisfy. Used for theories which satisfy certain conditions. So P is a subset of the model, of the Monster model, if you prefer, a definable subset. And you want that zero-definable subsets of P to the N, they are actually defined with parameters in P. Okay, there there are certain conditions which certainly are are satisfied Potomac are satisfied by fix of sigma. And then there is a notion which I sort of haven't quite mastered yet, which is the notion of a complete set and definition of the set of complete types over a set A. And you say that A is stable over P if that set of types. If that set of type is small, it's less than, and of course it has to be preserved by automorphism of the models and so on and so on. Okay, so it turns out that in our case, well, since I did not quite master what a star A is, right, I'm not sure that I can prove directly that it's stable over fixed sigma. However, the fact is that as soon as you have a constructible As soon as you have a constructible model, okay, kata constructible model, then it's going to be stable over the predicates. And in our case, you know, because we have kappa-constructed, kappa-saturated modules. Okay, kappa-constructed, it means that you have a chain, you know, it's a union of a chain where each of the elements of the, so first of all, at limit ordinal, so it's the union, right? And that successor ordinal. And that successor ordinal, you have that A lambda is the algebraic closure, sorry, A lambda plus one is the algebraic closure of A lambda and the topo D lambda, where the type of D lambda over A lambda is kappa atomic, kappa isolated. All right? Not by a formula, so not isolated, but kappa isolated. Kappa isolated! Kappa isolate. There is no isolated types in our series. I mean, how do you want to? There are no isolated types. It's not omega-stable. At best, it's superstable. And all right. And I guess I'm almost done. Right, I guess I have an application question in the three minutes that left to me. So the application was with Thomas Lossier, Guishana. Guciard Ardouin and Mr. Amador Martin Pizzano here present. We were studying automorphism of kappa-saturated models or actually automorphism of saturated uncountable models, right? And trying to determine, you know, there are a number of results that say that this automorphism group Group, provided they don't do something stupid, they are simple. Okay, so let me give you the first example, which is really a striking example, which is that if you look at the gamma group, the automorphism group of the complex number, not over Q, because then obviously it has quotient for quotient, you know, all the fixed editorial. The fixed state pair of finite algebraic extension. But if you take the automorphism group over of C over QR, then it is simple. And this is a result of Daniel Lascar, and he was extremely surprised that it hadn't been noticed before. So then this result was extended to sorry, it might take a while to other various groups of automorphisms or of the right notion of automorphisms. For instance, there is a paper by Catherine Tent and Martin Siegler on isometries of the Eurozone space. Then there was the work of Connerth, who looked at differentially closed fields, and there again the condition for non-trivial reasons, for similarly trivial reasons, is that you have to replace I'm sorry. Then you look at odd of u over closer empty set. This is simple. Okay. Okay, so what is closure mean, the set? Well, you have a result which tells you that if you are differentially closed, and if you take all the elements which satisfy a non-trivial differential equation over Q, then that field is an elementary such structure of your model. Well in a sense you have to take care of that. So you have to fix that. Because if you don't fix it, then you have lots of normal sounds. Okay? So we tried to figure out what were the ingredients of the blue for that scar and whether they could be made to work. And I guess in the case of ICF cartoon. In the case of ICFA of characteristic zero, what was useful is that, so since there are not many saturated models countable, right, what was useful was the notion of kappa I. And there, you know, you were able to do just a similar result. Okay. Okay. Second question. Can we do the same with DCFA? DCFA is differentially equal to field with the general to March. So there the fixed field. That's right, Commigia. So it's going to be complicated. I'm going to stop. Thank you. I mean, did you know if you will have not just internality but finally generation, that is that there exists a state? That is, that there exists a set instead of having to choose for every realization an independent set, that you can choose a set from the beginning which would work for all the realizations? Or in statement case? In the SCC case, yes. Because as soon as you take sufficiently many independent realizations, it goes down to the 45 free level. Okay, that's the point. Do you think, I mean, I guess the same problem that works for this is going to be, are there any chances of doing similar things, but you have two generic automorphisms which are free, which are, they don't commute. Yeah, they don't commute. So then you tell, you know that. The theory is simple, but it's not simple. I mean, it's going to be just. No, it's going to be just. No, it's going to be terrible. But you see, you have lots of fixed films there. Sigma, I mean, you know, you take any words in the sigma and tau, and you look at the fixed film. Okay. Quick question. So, characteristic P, which is a mass because of the bilinear forms. Do these bilinear forms cause that it's not. Do these binear forms cause that it's not stable over the fixed field, or it just makes it much harder to even think of? Yeah, no, they are unstable. They are unstable over the fixed field. And they have nothing to do with the fixed field, because they are modular in the sense that the geometry is modular. Okay, if there are no other questions, let's thank the speaker again. Five minutes, guys, and I'm not working.
