Thanks for inviting me. I'm sorry that we are not all together in Mexico. Hopefully, we can do that next time. And thanks for letting talk about this new stuff that actually is the imprinting of COVID-19. It was a work that involved Amy, Nadia, Chiara Giverso, and Girolucci during the Urulus during this period and somewhat different from, say, self-magnetic that we will hear in most of the talks. So what is the setup? The setup is the following. There is a substratum, usually 2D, but it can also be 3D, but I'm focusing on the 2D situation. And then cells are seated on. Then cells are seated on this substratum, and the substratum is pulled. So, pulled in a cyclic way. So, what's happening when this goes on is that cells orient themselves either perpendicularly, and this occurs a lot in the situation in which we have a clamped side. Which you have a clamped sides here, the top and the bottom ones, they orient more almost perpendicularly. If you leave this boundary free, then the orientation instead follows some very more or less defined action. So I will cover in this talk, say, the modeling from the deterministic point of view. Instead, Nadia will do it from the Nadia, we do it from the same kinetic and statistic point of view. Okay, so let me just mention a bit about the experiments a bit more in order to understand what's going on and to see why this is very interesting, in some sense, ubiquitous. Because you see that the same thing is observed also when cells are in confluence, okay, in confluence situations, and you see that. And you see that they orient either perpendicularly, like the one on the left, or say at a certain angle. And this resembles the fact that can be an explanation of the fact that cells of the endothelial wall on the baseline especially in the aorta, have a preferred direction that is not longitudinal and transversal. In that case, the wall of the artery. The wall of the artery is subject to circumferential stress because of the heartbeat and also to shear. Okay, and instead in the capillary, the orientation is different. And some people think that a better orientation or organization of the cell might be the cause of some aneurysm going on, for instance, in the arc of the author. It's a possible explanation. It's a possible explanation. Okay. So, why I'm saying that this is ubiquitous? It's very, I mean, you find it very often in a lot of cells. You're seeing a lot of cells like this. This is a list of cells that have been used in the experiments. You see endothelial cells, epithelial fibroblasts, and so on, osteoblasts. But there is one paper that tried to use mass. They try to use macrophages. So, this is a negative paper, and they find that macrophages don't undergo the same phenomena. This is important, in my opinion, because it tells you that there is a huge difference between those on the top, the cells on the top, and the cells on the bottom. You can realize that the cells on the top are cells that exert a lot of traction. Traction on the extracellular matrix on the substratum. They attach a lot. They are, say, muscle cells and so on. So the cytoskeleton in these cells is particularly developed, strong. Instead, macrophages have another role. They are immune cells, and so they have to squeeze everywhere. Their way of migrating is completely different, probably more amyboard. Different, probably more ameboid, and they don't have such a strong, say, cytoskeleton. So, the cytoskeleton is an important player here. I don't need to tell a lot about that. I think that most of the audience knows more than I do on the features of the pyroskeleton. I will just mention a couple of things that are interesting, which is the fact that. Which is the fact that the actin filaments are connected by two kinds of molecules. One are molecules that are, say, linking, cross-linking at a certain angle, the acting filaments, like filamine, for instance, here. The other one is also RP23, which is regulating, in some sense, is governing the angle that a daughter. angle that a daughter filament forms with a with a mother filament about 70 degrees and why this is important is is the following the reason the reason is that when you try to pull of course this angle depart from the rest angle say 90 or 70 and they would like to return to go back to the original say rest pre-angle Stress-free angle. The other leading role is played by some other molecules that bundle up acting filaments forming stress fiber. And this, say, alpha-actinine, faccin, fimbrine. Probably, to my understanding, the main difference between these kinds of molecules is the packing of the sarconic, or if you want, the stress. You want the stress, the strength of the bundle as a whole. Okay, so this means that instead of having a homogeneous distribution of acting filament and isotropic in some sense, you have a main direction, a polarization, a main orientation. And in fact, this is what you see in the when you When you pull the cell in the horizontal direction, and the act this stress fiber here more or less orient perpendicularly, and they build up with time. So, the first thing that happens when you pull the cell in a cyclic way is that stress fibers form, they become stronger and stronger, and the reurine according to the Orient according to a certain angle, and the cells move accordingly. There is no motion here to be clear. There is just remodeling of the cell and say repolarization of the cell. The other thing that is interesting is the fact that this result is robust with respect to a lot of things. First of all, to a kind of substratum that you use. Of substratum that you use, you see the orientation if the stiffness is larger than 10 kilopascals. In many experiments, something like one megapascal substratum are used, but they can be softened up to 10 kilopascals. The stream amplitude has to be large enough, and the stretching frequency has to be large enough. Frequency has to be large enough. Okay, so the space of the subspace of parameters in which you can see this phenomenon is this tube here. You can go from 1% to 30%, after 30%, more many cells time, and then the stiffness has to be large enough, and so on. The fact that the frequency The frequency must be large enough, by the way, rules out the fact that you impose a given deformation to the specimen. That is, you just excess subtraction and you keep it. This is some frequency what's zero, if you want, right? So you don't see this going on when you don't say except the periodic deformation. So now let's go to So now let's go to the continuous mechanic models that I'm covering. Assuming that the deformation gradient is just uniaxial, actually B axial, an extension, a pure extension deformation. Okay, so this is the deformation gradient, it's diagonal. So the square becomes a rectangle, or if you want the cube, becomes a cuboid. Okay? to boil. Okay? And this epsilon x epsilon yy in the literature is related to epsilon xx by defining this number r, which is the biaxiality ratio. This minus here takes into account of the fact that when you are pulling in the x direction, the specimen is compressing in the y direction. Naturally, it will take r equals zero, as you will see, corresponds to the fact that you are Correspond to the fact that we are clamping the upper and lower size of this square. So there is no deformation along y. And this is the most, I would say, detailed experiment done by Leibnec that controlled the biaxiality of this deformation. And they noticed that the That the experimental point says align along a straight line in this very strange parameter space. This is the square of the cosine of the equilibrium angle. And this is this combination one over r plus one and r is the actuality ratio. So in principle, it's very strict. And then I will explain the meaning. I will explain the meaning of this full line with respect to the dotted line here. This line was previously imagined, assumed under, say, the idea that the cells try to minimize strain, which is not coherent with the experiment. Now, to explain a bit more, this bit more this epsilon yy was zero clamped experiments correspond to this value one over r plus one equal to one so we are here this instead is the case in which epsilon yy is equal to minus x plus xx and this value two-thirds uh is the incompressible case so in fact Simple case. So, in fact, you see that most of the data are here. Well, actually, many here. No data are below, say, one over r plus one equal to zero, equal to zero, equal to 0.5. Some data are here in which both, say, one, we are extending a log x and a log y. X and then on Y, actually, what we are doing, what Liu did, only one paper, actually, a couple of papers by the same guy, is to put the cells on a disk and then stretch in the disk. So the cell are experiencing stretch both in the radial direction and the azimuthal direction. Instead, no experiments are in this range here, which correspond to the, say, compressing mode. Say compressing more than extending, and this is not done. The experiments are done in extension. Okay, so the outcome more or less is that in this range, cells are perpendicular, in this range they have an angle that is close to 60 degrees, and here they are at 45 degrees. I mean, this is already already every. Already evident from this cosine square equal to 0.5, I'm not saying anything strange. Okay, another thing that I have to introduce is the Cauchy-Green strain tensor, that is the product of this F transpose F and this thick diagonal. And the quantity on the diagonal, therefore, on the diagonal are called lambda x, lambda y, and lambda z. And you will see that. And you will see that in the following. Okay. So, what is the idea? The idea is that we have a material in which we have cells and each cell is oriented along a direction n, this one, forming angle theta. And we have to understand what the behavior of the cell. The behavior of the cell when the stress is along X, but actually, when the cell is elongating along the main orientation axis, this N here, and this is given by this combination of parameters called N dot C N, is the fourth invariant, it's called fourth invariant in continuum mechanics, and so our elastic energy at the end will be. Our elastic energy at the end will depend on the response to stretch, to strain along this direction. And then we have all other quantities. For instance, this quantity here, I6, depends on the response to stretch along the perpendicular direction, which in some sense involves if all banders, all fiber banders are oriented along n to the response or to Say response to separating the elements of the variable bundles. And this one, which is also important, is the response to shear. That is when we try to close the angle between, say, the main direction and the perpendicular direction and perpendicular. That's why. And what is known from the continuum mechanics is that for this kind of material. That for this kind of materials, the elastic energy depends on the some invariance, which are the classical invariants that do not involve the angle theta and this other quantity that are I4 up to I8. So it's a general function. I will we will take first. We will take first an energy that is quadratic, is quadratic in this invariance plus an isotropic part. This is not, I mean, this is a wide class of energy. One can also achieve the same results by using a Funct energy, which looks like that, a generalized Fung energy. So, most of the Energy. So, most of the materials responds to this kind of energy. One thing that I want to notice is the following. If you look here, this quantity, this invariance, this quantity that are in this energy depends on cosine square. The only thing that does not depend on cosine square is IA. Now, cosine square. Now, cosine squared, it's important that we have this dependence here because we have some symmetries, and this symmetry is reflected here. In the sense that, of course, we cannot distinguish between an orientation along theta, like this one, and along minus theta, like this one. And since there is no head and tail, I mean the cell that is oriented along theta and pi plus theta is just the same. Okay, so. Okay, so the energy this function has to have some symmetry required, and this will see is also important in the statistical description of this phenomenon. One say consequence of that is that the coupling parameters between Between say I4 and I8, for instance, that are this present in this quadratic form need to vanish, as well as the fact that this form here has to be even in I8 so that I have sine square, cosine squared, and that's okay. Otherwise, if I don't have this, I have an asymmetric, say, energy. So and I will have then equilibrium that do not do. Equilibrium that do not respect, say, this symmetry requirement. So, this is a simple, say, symmetry reasoning that we will use. Now, in order to get some simpler formula, let me just forget a bit about this dependence on C squared here, on the square of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor. Okay, just let's focus on. Let's focus on I4, I6, and I8. We will see that they are the most important part. So we have a general energy. We can compute just the derivative of the energy to find the equilibrium orientation. And okay, this is nasty if you want, but it's not so nasty because you print you can find that there is an equilibrium that is given by t equals zero, which is equals zero, which is say nullifying this sine theta here. And this corresponds to the cells that are oriented along the stretching direction. Okay. Then I have cosine theta equals zero corresponding to the fact that cells aligned perpendicularly to the stretching direction. And I have something that is non-defined, the square bracket. If I look at that, This is the form that you get. I mean, you see that there is only cosine square, and so this can be written as cosine squared equals something. And that's why it is convenient to plot your equilibrium having on the y-axis cosine square. It comes naturally from this energy. The second thing that comes out is that, you know, all the mechanical coefficients, the mechanical terms, merge into one coefficient, this one here. This one here that we call one over alpha. And all the data that we are imposing from the outside, the stretching, merge into this agadar coefficient, lambda. So this relation tells you that cosine square is one half plus the coefficient one half minus lambda. Okay? And in the linear the gene, this lambda is one over one plus half. is one over one plus r. So you see that this strange relation is very easy, it's natural, it comes natural for this very general form of the energy. Okay, like this one. Another important thing that I want to explicitly notice is that this one, this R, or if you want this lambda. Or, if you want this lambda, okay, but especially this R, depends on the ratio of the imposed stretch. If we double the stretch in the X direction and we double the stretch in the Y direction, R is the same. I'm saying that because I told you that the result is independent of the imposed stretch as long as this is large enough. Is large enough. So, this already tells you that. It tells you that if you look at the equilibrium, the equilibrium depends on the biaxial ratio, but not how much you are searching epsilon. So, this is the first result. So, let's now look at some bifurcation diagram that is look at the stability. And what we have is that. We have is that okay, the oblique equilibrium is always stable when it exists. This blue, pale blue region is the one that is tested in experiments. So this is stable. If this number alpha is between zero and one, we have the red curve. If it is larger than one, we have the black curve. Curve, then we have some supercritical bifurcation points here. And instead, the trivial equilibrium, say perpendicular and parallel, this is perpendicular and this parallel are stable only in a certain region. So again, I have, for instance, perpendicular orientation if this lambda here, or if you want, one over one plus r is above this number. This number, this bifurcation value, is oblique here. And actually, in the experiments, you don't see cells running parallel to the main stretching direction. However, from the mathematical point of view, I can also look at the case in which r is negative. This will turn to be relevant in the case in which I can. In the case in which I consider also the stiffness of the substratum. And in this case, when R is negative, this supercritical bifurcation becomes subcritical. The oblique configuration is always unstable. And we only have, say, parallel orientation and perpendicular. Okay, good. Let me also mention something Something else which comes out from this formulation. The first thing is that the bifurcation parameter is a combination of all the mechanical characteristics of our material, if you want. So, of course, you have a lot of materials that respond to the same alpha, give rise to the same alpha. If alpha If alpha, if you say you forget about all this number here, kappa six, six, I mean, all the dependence on, say, the stretching perpendicularly to the main orientation axis, you know, all the coupling coefficient, and so this lambda, this alpha is equal to one. If you keep, for instance, kappa six six, then this. Then this alpha is equal to larger than one. Why am I saying that? Because if you look at the experiments by Leibney, this alpha is more or less 0.8. So this means that, you know, kappa 4, 4 must be there. Kappa 6, 6, I mean, can be there. But the important thing is that we have this relationship between the coefficients. Now, usually the mixed coefficient. The mixed coefficient, this coefficient in which you have the coupling between, say, what is obtained when you are pulling along the main axis and perpendicular to the main axis. These are neglected in most constitutive law. But this tells you that even if I forget about this kappa 4,6, kappa 8, 8 is important, it has to be large enough. So the response to shear is important in order to get the experiments by deep depth. The experiments by deep net. Okay, however, there is another way to get this alpha less than one, which is to consider, to forget about kappa eight, but to consider, say, a linear term in the elastic energy. And so a coupling term between I1 and I4, I mean the one that is again describing the response to the Stretching along the mean polarization act. And we can also evaluate that this coefficient, kappa one, four, need to be, say, more or less six percent kappa four four. Okay, I will just skip a bit about that, about the effect of C square, but just to mention that, you know, here we have the data of the experiments by Of the experiments by Liebner and by Faust, actually, in other paper, and they align perfectly to the straight line. We already seen that it was guessed by Leibney. What happens if we add I5? Well, you can have better fitting. Well, so and so. I mean, you need a better fit. You have a better fitting if kappa five five is more or less say much smaller, 0.01 than kappa 44, which is 0.4. So I've been adding, say, also that those terms that I was neglecting, I5 and I7, don't add much to the picture. Actually, adding I7 gives you something that is not what is seen in the experiment. And also, if you Experiment and also, if you just use a transversely centropic material, you don't get a very nice response. Now, in turning back to the fact that to the question whether this number 0.8 or so is universal. So, let's go back to this other experiment by Wang, in which they in word write They in Word Bright, they sense a line perpendicularly to the main stretch direction. And if you look at it, I mean, it doesn't look like very perpendicular to me. Okay. And in fact, in their representation, the statistic representation of the orientation, say the most probable orientation is not 90 degrees. Is not 90 degrees, it's 85 degrees or something like that. So it means that rather than being on the, I mean, this experiment is obtained on this clam situation in which this lambda is equal to one. So it's here rather than on the on the red code. So it might be that for this endothelial cells, alpha is not 3.8. 0.8, but it is some other value. And in fact, leafness data are, say, obtained on fibroblast. So there might be some variability according to the cells, though the main picture is the same. I mean, distinguishing between 85 and 90 degrees is very minor. But careful experiments can. But careful experiments can be done. So, summarizing the importance of the terms, we have one bifurcation parameter, which is summing up all the mechanical characteristics. I4 is fundamental, that is the response on the main polarization axis. I8 is probably fundamental as well, it can be substituted by coupling between the stretching. The stretching in on the polarization direction, the orientation direction in I1, say the trace of our Cauchy-Green strain tensor. I6, the response to perpendicularly, the response perpendicular to the main polarization is not really important. C-squared terms are not really important. So, this is what can be What can be inferred from the experiment? Okay, but this has to do with only with, say, the equilibrium calculation. Can we guess something more from the temporal evolution that are given by some experiment? Or how, or vice versa, how does our model behave when we consider the evolution? Consider the evolution. And how can we do that? I mean, the equation that gives the evolution of theta of the angle theta with respect to time can be guessed or can be assumed to follow a sort of Lagrangian mechanics in which the anger tends to achieve, say, the minimum of some potential energy, which is the energy that I was. Energy that I was mentioning before according to some parameter which takes into account, if you want, of the reorganization time. These are the data according to say the initial orientation angle of the cell or according to the accelerator. According to the accelerator, that goes more or less exponentially to their equilibrium value, and this is what is obtained using our energy. I mean, and the trend is very similar. I mean, if you look at it, and you compare the blue curve here, the purple curve here with the red curve over there. With the red curve over there and so on. And they are more or less the same. And now let's go to the dependence on the other things, on say the stretch amplitude. I already mentioned that the stretch amplitude is not really important for the equilibrium, but what can be said about the timing of, say, of the evolution? How fast they go. If you look closely at this energy, If you look closely at this energy, this can be written. Oh, sorry, mention something here. This can be written in the following form. I mean, this is there is a term, the distance only on theta and on this capital lambda, and another coefficient in front of it that goes like epsilon xx squared. Okay, so from that, you could already guess that your characteristic time. Characteristic time should decrease when epsilon increases. I mean, you have actually time that goes like tau over epsilon xx squared. This instead is what you find experimentally by you Bauer. You see that the time of the organization decreases with the stretching amplitude. Okay, and this is also This is also obtained by the same thing by Rosader. And you see, for instance, that if you focus on the, say, ratio of the timing of the orientation when you have a 50% strain and 10% of strain, which means two-thirds, this two-thirds of the strain means that two-thirds square is four-nine, which is more or less. Which is more or less that the realization time is doubling. Sorry, it's half doubling, okay? Because you are decreasing the strain, you are doubling in the time. In fact, they find that from 10.5, they find a organizational time of 22 minutes. Theoretically, we have 23.6. And this, I don't know if you can see it here. You can see it here, more or less is what we have here according to the green curve. So we have a time of 2.5, actually 2500, according to Jung Bauer, and that increases up to say 5,000, which is okay. And which is okay. But for small amplitude, this does not occur. Okay, so if you go from 10 to 5, this is the theoretical curve, the dot curve here, and also the data don't fit. So this very easy, say, prediction is not good enough. What about the stretching frequency? Well, this is in some sense more cumbersome in the sense that an elastic model cannot catch that, cannot catch, say, a dependence of the orientation time according to the frequency. Why? Because elastic model, by definition, Definition adjusts instantaneously to the deformation. So we need another model that introduces another time, an intrinsic time into the model. What is found instead in the experiment is that above a stretching frequency, more or less the time is constant. Below, say, this one second to the minus one. Second to the minus one then hertz. Uh we have an increase in time, and below say 0.1 or even 0.05 or so, we don't get anything. So this model is not good enough. We need to include some viscelasticity, for instance, and there are a lot of causes of viscolasticity in the cell. In the cell. The first is the cytoskeleton cell that is viscoelastic. The second thing is that the acting cytoskeleton behaves viscoelastically. And the third one is that there is a continuous turnover of the addition bonds that have an intrinsic viscoelastic time. Now, intriguingly, if you look at the characteristic times of, say, interin turnover or say Turnover, or say, even the acting turnover, it turns out that they are in the range of one minute or so, several minutes. Okay. And if you look at the experiment, you have that the minimum period is above these few minutes. So if your period of oscillation is above Is above one minute or say few minutes, you are giving the cell enough time to reorganize itself. So it seems that from this heuristic argument is that reorganization is important to compare the timing of the period of oscillation to the period of reorganization of the cell. Of the cell. Okay, so from the modeling point of view, what we are doing instead is that is to replace our elastic model of the stress with a viscous model that rises in the following way. We are comparing, say, the strain tensor at MT with the previous, the past strain tensors according to some relaxation curve. According to some relaxation kernel, exponential, we take it exponential, according to say some tensor, which is the past elasticity tensor. This is the fourth order tensor. And as usual in visco elasticity, when you have this exponential kernel, you can write this integral form into a differential form that takes. Differential form that takes the form of a Maxwell curve, Maxwell fluid, the Maxwell-like fluid. And so the set of equations is the one that gives the reorientation of theta according to the variation, say, of energy, t dot e, and t is evolving according to this Maxwell model. Now, let's look to understand the thing. Let's look to understand the thing. Let's look closely at what happens when you have a phenomenon in which the frequency is very high and a phenomenon in which the frequency is very low. Okay, at the high frequencies, what you have is that the stress tensor can be written in a part that goes in phase with the strain, while the other part, the integral part, can be dropped. Part can be dropped. So it means that at high frequencies, the material behaves elastically. And that's why the elastic models does such a good job. Because in most of the experiments, frequencies are very high with respect to, say, the typical one over the relaxation time, say, of the of the model. Of the model. Instead, in the low-frequency regime, the material behaves viscously, meaning that it's like a fluid. We are losing, we are losing both the memory and some sense of what is happening in the past. Okay, so let's forget about the temporal evolution, which is just the same as before. But if we go to the dependence of the say train. say strength to the say to the equilibrium value, mean how long does it take to go to the equilibrium value. We get this comparison between the experimental value by Jung Bauer, the triangle here, and the model prediction which is here. And if we And if we plot the velocity of orientation, we have this transition. And I just draw in this strange way because the last square, the last triangle here in which Jung Bauer experienced this the rotation is the one in which we are reaching more or less this plateau. Below, say, omega equal to 0.1 radians per second, we don't get We don't get anything. I mean, it takes so long that you don't see anything in the time scale of the experiment. Okay. Okay, now let me mention another thing. What happens if we add the substratum? Okay, or that is what is seen is that if the substratum is too soft, then Too soft, then either nothing happens or cells orient perpendicularly or parallel to the main stretching direction. They do not orient obliquely. So what happens is the following: that if you do the same thing adding the substratum, you get a similar formula, but you have this. But you have this extra parameter s. I mean, this alpha infinity 1 plus 2s takes the role of the previous alpha. And this s here has say K substratum in it. If K substratum is very large, say P D M S, silicon rubber, one megapascal, so One megapascal. So, this s is equal to zero. If this substrate is soft, you know, this goes like the square, and so this becomes very important. But the most important thing, sorry, is that it can become negative because there is a minus here, and the leading role is taken by this part here. So, we can have a jump from, say, From say this positive alpha situation to this negative alpha situation. And so it jumps from, say, a supercritical bifurcation to a supercritical bifurcation. This is called cast catastrophe in dynamical systems. I forgot to mention something that is important. I hear changed a bit. Here, change in a bit the notation just to be more clear on the role played by this K44K6. Before I needed this number because I have a summation and so it was easier to write the formula. But this K44 takes into account of the say the stiffness of the stretching arrow in the parallel direction, these are all in the perpendicular direction, and this. The perpendicular direction, and this with respect to shear, okay. And so, uh, this is the same alpha that I was using before. So, the picture okay, to make things clearer, if k perpendicular is equal to zero, this s is negative. You see here that it's negative, is k parallel, the response to K parallel, the response to stretch, the response to shear. And here at the denominator, I have the response, the stiffness of the substratum. So this becomes very important when the substratum is very soft. Okay, and so this is, in some sense, you're shifting from a situation like before, in which you have a sub super critical one. This is the jump from, say, This is the jump from, say, a perpendicular situation to a say oblique situation in which we have only stable perpendicular orientation and parallel orientation back down there. Okay, and so this is the plot of what happens when you change K substratum and KX. I mean, you have, say, only the two parallel and perpendicular. The two parallel and perpendicular where the substratum is soft, substratum is soft, and KS the response to shear is say in this range. If you increase the substratum, this becomes important when Kx is large and so on. So this ends up this deterministic part. And of course, everything is important from the statistical point of view. From the statistical point of view. So I don't know whether to stop a bit here and answer questions if there are questions on this part here, or just go on with the other one and with Nadia's part. Chairman, what do you suggest? I think it might be better to have the questions here because there's a lot of detail and I might have to go back. Detail and might have to go back to it later. So, people have questions. You can just open your mic and go ahead. In the absence of any, let me start off. Can you explain why I think it's for low alpha, you have a horizontal? Horizontal steady state, and for high alpha, you had the vertical one. How do you explain that? Yeah, go back a few. Let's see. Or is it this one? Well, this one, yeah, this one works enough. Oh, sorry, it was lambda. So at small lambda. So, at small lambda, you have a horizontal orientation for a brief interval. Then, intermediate is basically a transition from that to this. But how do you explain the force distribution, et cetera, that the cell is feeling that leads to these very different orientations? I mean, I see it in the mechanics. in the mechanics or the formal mechanics but and can you give a give you give an explanation in layman's terms yeah um the i mean this issue is in some sense related to the fact that cells try to minimize the elastic energy that's it uh so they they try to They they try to put themselves in a situation that when they stretch, they don't the elastic energy that is due to the deformation, that imposed the deformation by the deformation is minimized. Can you remind me exactly what this lambda reflects in terms? What this lambda reflects in terms of the mechanics? Lambda reflects how much. Let's see, let me go back to the definition, which should be here. It's this one. Yeah. So if you want, take lambda y equals zero. Lambda equal one. Sorry. No, it's not a good example. Okay, so this is how much. Example. Okay, so this is how much you are stretching along x with respect to how, well, lambda x minus lambda y is how much is stretching with respect to compression. So if let's see, now probably it's better to look at. No, probably I have to go back here. Okay. Lambda is in the axis. So lambda is just the way we are deforming when it's deforming the specimen. Okay, so it's the direction of deformation that. Yeah, lambda large in some sense, it means that it's not deforming enough a long while a lot. Yeah. While this is stretching. Yeah, while this is stretching along X instead going back here, it is shrinking a bit along Y. Yeah. So the key is that they're upright in a certain stretch and horizontal in a different stretch, but in each case, they're minimizing the energy. Yeah, if you want in this case here, they are putting perpendicularly because you are stretching along X, but the signs along Y. The size L on Y is the same. And the stress fiber is L on Y. So is this R something like a Poisson ratio? Yeah. It's something like the Poisson ratio. It is not really the Poisson. I mean, they mention it like the Poisson ratio. Mention it like the Poisson ratio, but the Poisson ratio is more like a material behavior, a material property, right? Instead, here, because of the fact that let's see, that you that in the in the experiments, what they do is to pull these sides here and then they assume that this rectangle here. Rectangle here is subject to a biaxial stretch. So the Biaxality ratio does not correspond really to the Poisson ratio, but is more or less from the nominal point of view the same. Yeah, it's not a material property. It's not a material property. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Sorry for dominating. Do other people have questions? Well, if not, if you like, we could take a five-minute break and come back and start with the second half. Is that okay? Fine. Yeah. So let's, I have nine. I have planned to survive. I have planned to survive. I have nothing to survive. I am able to survive. Now make it a muscle. Yes, but I don't hear. Yes, but I don't hear. And do you hear me? Because I don't hear you. Yes, we can hear you. Okay, okay. I can hear you. Okay, thank you. Perfect. So okay. So now we shall uh move to this new one. Sorry, Paul. So you tell me when to start, right? I think in four minutes. Okay, four minutes. Ciao, I had a question, but I was too slow. I wrote you in the chat, but maybe the question is very stupid. I don't know. I don't know if you want to wait the other coming back from the bathroom. No, it's okay. I was just curious if Ks, no, yeah, if Ks can be larger than it was opposite, that you're having the denominator because. That you have in the denominator because then you would switch the sign of S again. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. I mean, Kns can be can go everything. There is a question about Ks, I mean the shear rate about, say, strong ellipticity that we have to investigate. And there are some ones. Okay. Okay. It means that you can I didn't check what happens when we impose this big this this constraint on KS okay yeah okay my audio was not very good right no it was okay okay okay no for me was everything very clear yeah okay because we didn't hear very well when We didn't hear very well when. Yeah, in fact, this is where we are switching computer. Ah, okay, yeah, yeah. No, for me, at least, was very good, everything, yeah. Maybe I can switch also camera just to say hello. Nice to meet you. Unfortunately, I will have to leave your talks earlier because I have teaching. Oh, yeah. We have semester already started, and I got a lot of teaching this semester. Teaching this semester or things that, but I'm looking, I started to read the paper and I'm really curious in your result. At least I think I don't know if you're speaking out the same as in the paper with Luigi you had in this special issue, the ones that I found? No, no, no, no, no. Okay, you're speaking something else. Okay. Okay. But then I will miss. But I think they're doing recording. Maybe I can catch up then. Maybe they're recorded. Yeah, I think that they yeah recorded you and then in case they're going to erase it if you don't agree then enjoy and see you around. Thanks. Thanks. Okay, I think we can. Okay, I think we can start again. I seem to be frozen, but. Yes, you're frozen actually. Okay. So, shall I start? Yes. Okay. So now we move to the second part of the talk, and we want to include. The talk, and we want to include the contribution of randomness to this phenomenon of reorientation on a substratum. In particular, we observe that cells, they do not, of course, assume all the same exact orientation. And we want them to determine the mode and or the average orientation of cells. And therefore, the final aim is to determine. The final aim is to determine the probability density function of describing the statistical distribution of the orientations of the cell. So, when we look at experiments, this is for example a set of experimental results of Mao, we see that the distributions of the orientations of the cells that are stretched cyclically, they are represented in general over zero pi or over zero pi half. Over zero pi/hal. And we can observe that there are mainly two parameters that affect the peak of distribution. And in particular, we have that the strain amplitude epsilon affects this the tightness of distribution. In particular, if we increase epsilon, so the strain parameter, then we have more peaked distribution around the mode. Around the mode. While if we consider increasing frequencies of the cycling stretch, then we also have more peaked distributions, as we can, for example, observe in the horizontal lines. And in particular, if the stretch is not cycling, then if the frequency omega of the stretch is zero, then we have no reorientation and then we remain on a We remain on a uniform distribution of the orientations of the cells. What we can observe, this is another experimental results by Wang, is that in general, in particular, when experimental results are reported over zero pi-half, then the mode and the average direction are different. And then the question is, which is the relation between the mode and the average? Relation between the mode and the average, and which is the relation with the equilibrium distribution that we can compute from the elastic energy that Luigi introduced before. So when we go to the mathematical modeling of this reorientation process, there are various attempts in order to model this phenomenon. And in particular, we have microscopic deterministic modeling, like, for example, Deterministic modeling, like, for example, the Lagrangian behavior that Luigi illustrated before, that was also used, for example, by Livne. And in this case, we observe that there is no stochasticity at all, and the equilibria that are obtained in these frameworks are often compared to the average orientations that is obtained from the experiments. There are some attempts. There are some attempts of adding some noise to microscopic models. For example, an attempt was done by Wang. But then, this kind of microscopic modeling did not allow to recover a probability density function for describing the statistical distributions of the orientations of the cell. Some attempts were made with stochastic differential equations, for example by Kem Kemmer, that succeeded in determining. Succeeded in determining a probability density function, but he only imposed the suited symmetry to the system, and he did not really use all the parameters that were, for example, introduced before by Luigi. So one of the most successful attempts is the one in which the time evolution of the orientation is related to an elastic energy that is obtained. Energy that is obtained by modeling the external forces that act on the cells. And in this way, if we call a calligraphic E a generic elastic energy, then we can state, and this is a classical result of statistical mechanics, that the probability density function describing the cell orientations is proportional to this exponential of minus the energy over. Over some, this should be the Boltzmann constant and an effective temperature. This is, of course, given in a very classical framework like the one of ideal gases, but of course, it's not so generally applicable to all kind of phenomena. However, this has been applied in order to, let's say, fit some experimental results. These are, for example, histograms proposed by Faust. Histograms proposed by Faust. And we see that he uses this probability density function here, the one in the dotted line. And so this line quite well fits the results, but there are no, for example, strain and stretch parameters as the one introduced to Luigi by before in this probability density function. So we wanted to do something more rigorous and Rigorous, and so we start from our framework in which the cells are stretched by axally. So on the x-axis, we have lambda x, that's the larger strain tensor, and on the y direction we have lambda y. And theta is the direction of the cell with respect to the x-axis. And then we assume, so in a Lagrangian framework, that the time evolution of the That the time evolution of the orientation of the cell is ruled by this equation, where U is the elastic energy and η is the viscoelastic coefficients that measures the resistance to alignment. Now we have that, so we should work over 0 to pi, but as cells are not polarized and so they have no head and tail, then we can restrict from 0 to pi to 0 pi. Moreover, as we have the symmetry. Moreover, as we have the symmetry that Luigi introduced before, then we have that we have an even function with respect to the y-axis. And therefore, we assume that our elastic energy must satisfy the property U1. So U must be periodic over zero pi and it must be even around the y-axis. Moreover, we consider a linear Moreover, we consider a linear elastic regime, so our parameters lambda x and lambda y are written in this way. So where epsilon is the infinitesimal strain parameter and r is the biaxality ratio. And we have that in this notation, u may be rewritten in this way. So we can pull out this k parallel and epsilon to the square. And here in the expression of the elastic energy, the k. Of the elastic energy, the k perpendicular tilde and ks tilde, and only there are the non-dimensionalized parameters k perpendicular and ks. So as now we have this form of the elastic energy, then if we plug this in our evolution equation, then we have that we may rewrite it in this way, where we take into account the fact that epsilon may depend on t. Epsilon may depend on t because the stretch is cyclic. And here, lambda theta, that's defined by eta over k parallel, is the classical reorientation time. So if we go back to the parameter, the bifurcation parameter alpha that introduced that Luigi introduced before, and we define rho alpha in this way, so it is a function of alpha. We have that we have different. We have different configurations for the stable equilibria. In particular, we have two cases in which we have four stable equilibria. So in this first range of parameters, we have a unique equilibrium orientation that belongs to zero pi-half. And so this is the only equilibrium in the first quadrant. And because of Quadrant and because of U1, so because of the symmetry properties, then we can also determine the equilibria in the other quadrants. So, for example, the equilibrium orientation in the second quadrant is pi minus theta equilibrium, in the other is pi plus theta equilibrium, and in the last quadrant is 2 pi minus theta equilibrium. In these other sets of parameters r and alpha, we have that in the first quadrant, the In the first quadrant, the equilibrium orientation is exactly zero. And therefore, we can also determine, because of the symmetry considerations, the three other equilibria that are pi half, pi, and three pi half. And these are the graphic representations of case one here on the left. So we have four equilibria inside, so strictly inside the So, strictly inside the polder. And in the second figure, we have case two. That means that we have the minima are exactly on zero pi half, pi, three pi half, and two pi, of course. Then we have two other scenarios in which we have only two equilibria. So, for example, in this first parameter setting, we have that the first two equilibria are exactly pi-half. So, if Pi half, so it is the figure on the left here, while the other two equilibria are three pi-half. In the last scenario, we have always two, only two different equilibria that are given by zero here and zero, sorry, and pi half and five. So now we introduce our probability density function. probability density function. So as we said before, as the cell has no head and tail, we assume that theta can vary only on zero pi and therefore f can be pi periodic. Moreover, we assume that it must be a probability density function, that means that this must be positive, so f1, and it is normalized to 1 over 0 pi, so this is property f2. Then we impose the symmetry property. Then we impose the symmetry properties. So F3 is only again the periodicity over zero pi. And F4 implies that F must satisfy the same symmetry property as U1. That means that it is not only periodic over 0π, but it is also even around the Y-axis. So it must satisfy F4. So now So now we go back to our ordinary differential equation for theta here. And we have that we can classically obtain an evolution equation for F that's given by this continuity or let's say blasov equation with no external force in term. Here we observe that in most experiments, so epsilon t depends on time because its stretch is cyclic. And epsilon here in red is the mean strain over an oscillation period. And as we are already modeling at a microscopic level, so here we are assuming that there is reorientation of the cell, then we consider here only the mean strain epsilon over an oscillation period. So in this way, we can determine the stationary distribution that's only obtained by setting the right-hand side. Obtained by setting the right-hand side to zero. And the stationary distribution function is given by this delta function, if we considered it only, for example, on zero pi half. And this is, of course, a quite unbiological and non-physical result because it implies that each, almost every cell is oriented along the same, exactly the same direction. So this led us to say, okay, there must be some stochasticity that is included in our equation. That is included in our equation. So we go back to our equation and we add some noise. And so we obtain a stochastic differential equation for theta. So here we have this noise where ψ is a white noise. So it is a normal distribution with zero average and unitary variance. And σ is a non-dimensional parameter that takes into account for the stochasticity of the system. Of the system. We may rewrite this stochastic differential equation as an Ito process. So we're here Wt is a Wiener process and this allows to classically obtain as a backward equation, the Fokker-Planck equation for F. So what kind of information can we get from this Fokker-Planck equation here? So first of all we can So first of all we can non-dimensionalize the time scale by using the reorientation time lambda theta and the epsilon square. And in this way we obtain equation one, where here in the first term in the left and the right hand side we have the drift term and in the second term in the right hand side we have the diffusion term and here the diffusion coefficient is sigma bar that and sigma bar to the bar that and sigma bar to the square is equal to sigma to the square that takes into account as we said the stochasticity of the system divided by two epsilon square so here we already see that increasing epsilon leads to a small diffusion coefficient while a large sorry increasing leads to a small diffusion coefficient while small epsilon While small epsilon leads to a large diffusion coefficient. If we also include viscoelastic effects, then we have that, as Luigi said before, in the high frequency regime, then the elastic energy writes exactly in this way. While in the low frequency regime, then formally epsilon to the square is replaced by epsilon to the square lambda omega. square lambda omega and therefore in this case sorry uh sigma bar to the square writes in this way and so we we see here already the effect of the frequency on the diffusion coefficient because increasing values of the frequency lead to a small diffusion coefficient and then to a more peaked response in the probability density function so what we want So, what we want to determine mainly is the probability density function at the equilibrium. And therefore, we want to study the equilibria of this Fokker-Planck equation. And therefore, we rewrite our Fokker-Planck equation in a flux form, where F calligraphic F here is given by this formula. Here, the boundary conditions are very easy to impose, they are periodic thanks to the Periodic thanks to the pi periodicity of par U and of F. Therefore, we have fortunately conservation of mass in zero pi, and we can determine very easily also thanks to the regularity of calligraphic U the stationary state by imposing this condition. So, F calligraphic F must vanish. So, under these lucky conditions, we can adapt very classical results. Can adapt very classical results on equilibria of the Fokker-Planck equation. So, for example, results by Toscani. And so, we can study the monotonicity of some functionals like the Shannon entropy defined here. And in particular, thanks to our boundary conditions, we can prove that this functional is decreasing in time, and in particular, the time derivative of h. derivative of H vanishes if and only if F is equal to the stationary state F infinity. So this implies that F infinity is actually a global asymptotic stable equilibrium state and so it is suitable for describing the probability density function of the orientations of the cell for large times at the asymptotic state. In particular, In particular, so if we set calligraphic F to zero, so the right-hand side of our Fokker-Planck equation to zero, we obtain our stationary state that's given by two. Here, C is only a normalization constant, and actually we see that it kind of resembles our Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, so the one that we mentioned before that's typical in statistical mechanics. But here, so Mechanics. But here, so we have our non-dimensionalized elastic energy and the diffusion coefficient that we introduced before, and that depends on epsilon and in case of low frequency, also on the frequency. So we can observe that in the first quadrant, so in zero pi half, we have only one model. Have only one mode that's given by theta one equilibrium, and that we have over zero to pi we have four modes in the case one, two when bar u has four minima, while in cases three, four, we only have two modes, that's the case that corresponds to the two minima of the elastic energy. So now we want to compare this probability density function to some experience. function to some experimental results and so we make some considerations about parameters. So in particular we have that as also Luigi showed you before, epsilon and R are given from the experiments, so from data. Alpha is speaks to the value alpha L, so almost 0.8 that was given by Iven. And then from the formula for From the formula for alpha, we derive this formula for k tilde perpendicular, and we see that the positivity of this k tilde perpendicular prescribes the compatibility condition for which k tilde s must be larger than 1 minus alpha l. And therefore, we have only have two free parameters. So, we have k tilde s that, in any way, has this lower bound, and sigma. bound and sigma. In particular we observed that tilde ks affects the shape of the probability density function but it does not affect of course the mode but in particular the average. That's what we are interested in. So now let's talk a bit about statistics. So what kind of average should we consider? So this So, this question was a bit delicate because, actually, as we are dealing with angle, we should not consider the linear, the classic linear average, but the circular average. So, as f is defined over zero pi, we should consider as circular average this first trigonometric moment that's defined as the arc tangent of beta over alpha, where alpha and beta are defined as the integrals of the. The integrals of the cosine times f and the sine time f. Now, the problem is that as we mainly consider the cases one and two, then we have that we have the symmetry around the y-axis, and therefore we have that alpha is always zero. And this is, I mean, it actually makes sense because when we have a bimodal distribution over A bimodal distribution over zero pi, then the notion of average actually loses its deep meaning. But experiments actually give us some averages over zero pi half, so that's why we restricted the definition of the circular average over zero pi half. But then we also wanted to investigate the relationship of this circular average with the linear average, even because it With the linear average, even because it seems that experiments maybe give the linear average. And therefore, we also introduce a linear average of f over 0 pi half, where 2 takes into account for the renormalization over 0 pi half, because f is defined over 0 pi. And we also introduce the variance. So, as the first thing, we observe that here in this figure, we plot in the straight line. Figure: We plot in the straight lines the linear average and with the circles the circular average. And here, the black diamonds are the theta equilibria for different values of R and by varying sigma bar. So, here we observe that for large values of this diffusion coefficient, the average tends to be 45 degrees here, and therefore it means that we are going towards a uniform distribution. While if we decrease sigma bar, then the average converges to the value of the th equilibrium. But this, of course, makes sense because here we observe that if we let sigma to zero, then we actually obtain a delta function. That's also what we obtained before. That's also what we obtained before adding the stochasticity to our ordinary differential equation. We also observe that here the circular and the linear average coincide. So here we plot our probability density function over 0, 2π. So in the first line we have r equal to 0 and r equal to To zero and r equal to this value that's rho alpha rho valued in alpha l that's equal to almost 0.1. So we observe that it is the case, so case three and four that was the case in which we only have two equilibria over zero to pi. And we observe that if we increase bar sigma, then the probability density function is broader and the average is more far. Average is more far from the equilibrium orientation. And this also happens in this other case when theta equilibrium in both cases is equal to 90 degrees. In the second line, we have r equal to 0.5 and r equal to 1. They correspond to cases in which the tit equilibrium is respectively 60 degrees and 45 degrees. And so it corresponds to the cases in which we have In which we have four minima of the elastic energy over zero two pi. And here again, we observe that if we increase the stochastic coefficient, then the distribution is broader and the average is more far from the equilibrium. Only in the last case, when the distribution is completely symmetric in zero pi-half and the average is pi-fourth, so 45 degrees, then we have 45 degrees, then we have that the average and the mode and the theta equilibrium coincide. Then we try to compare our probability density function with some experimental results. So here we consider the histograms that I showed before by Faust. So here R is equal to 0.15 and Ks is 0.7 as before. And as we said, it does not affect. And as we said, it does not affect very much the average. And here we plot in the black diamond, this is again the teeth equilibrium. And here the red dot is average. Now it's the average as we have seen that they mean side. And we vary sigma here in order to have the same linear average of the histogram and of the probability density function F infinity. We observe. We observe that the curves fit quite well, qualitatively at least, and we have quite similar comparable values for the variance here in the third and fifth line. Even though in cases A3 and A4, sorry, I forgot to mention the four cases correspond to different epsilons. So we have increasing epsilons. Increasing epsilons in these four plots. And so we see that the variances are a bit smaller than the variances that correspond to the histograms. Then if we also consider the frequency, then we consider these data from Mau and we observe that if we have large frequencies, then we have this stochastic coefficient, then we have in the first line. Then we have in the first line here, we observe that setting sigma equal to 0.2, that's almost the same range that we use for the histograms of Faust. Then we have that the black line fits these histograms. While if we have low frequency, then we must rewrite our stochastic coefficient in this way. And we obtain these black lines that actually fit quite well the histograms by Mao. Mao. We also tried to investigate the time evolution. So, in particular, here we consider data reported by Hayakawa, where epsilon is peaks to 20% and R is 0.4. So, bars refer to experimental data at 0, 1, and 3 hours, respectively. And so, we simulated through Monte Carlo simulations the Ito process, and we obtained these curves. And we obtain these curves that quite well fit these three subsequent sets of histograms. And this is only the time orientation evolution of the orientation of the cells. So now the aim was to describe more intrinsically the microscopic mechanism of the cells, so not in terms of the elastic energy. And therefore, we take Therefore, we take, we use classical tools of kinetic theory. In particular, we introduce this random variable theta t that belongs to 0π, and that it is distributed, of course, as f, that is the probability density function describing the statistical distribution of the orientation theta. Then we describe the variation of the random variable big theta as a discrete in-time random process. And so we assume that after a time interval delta p, A time interval delta phi, theta may vary or not. In particular, t lambda theta is a Bernoulli random variable that is equal to zero here if the orientation does not vary, while it is equal to one if it varies into theta t prime. In particular, the parameter of this Bernoulli random variable is delta t over lambda theta, that must be smaller than one, and it models the fact that the larger the time, That the larger the time with respect to lambda theta, the higher the probability of having a reorientation. And here, theta t prime is given by this generic formula where h takes into account the parameters of the system, so lambda x and the k's, and it depends to the current orientation, and it is the drift part, and then we have the diffusion part. So, in order to define the kinetic equation, we define phi and observable over this. And observable over this, so the time variation of the observable. So, here the bracket is the average of the random variable. And applying the rules that we introduced before for the discrete in-time random process, we obtain that this time ratio is equal to this quantity. And if we let delta t to zero, we obtain this evolution equation. This evolution equation here may be, of course, rewritten by Maybe, of course, rewritten by considering the average of the random variable that is distributed like f. And so we obtain this Boltzmann equation that is an integral integral-differential equation. And here, of course, theta prime is given by this microscopic rule. Here, of course, we can observe that if we can obtain the evolution, so we can obtain equations for the evolution of phi. Of phi. So, for example, if we set phi equal to one, we get the evolution of the mass. That's of course equal to zero because the right-hand side erases. While if phi is equal to theta, then we can obtain the evolution equation of the linear average. Now, the aim is to recover the asymptotic limits. So, we use quite So we use a quite popular procedure that's called causing variant limit that corresponds to consider a causing variant regime. That means a regime in which the orientation does not change much. Therefore, we introduce this gamma, that is a small parameter, and we rewrite our microscopic rule in this way. So we observe that if gamma is equal to one, then we recover the former regime, the former microscopic rule, while if gamma tends to zero, then we have that theta prime. Then we have that theta prime does not change much and this it is approximately theta. Then, in order to take into account for the smallness of these variations, as we want to observe on always the same evolution for the average, we introduce this new time scale and the rescale probability density function. And if we plug it in the Boltzmann equation, then we obtain this form. And here, the idea is to take into advantage. The idea is to take into advantage of this form of the microscopic equation and to the smallness of gamma. So we Taylor expand phi around theta. And what we obtain is this equation. So when gamma tends to zero, we can formally prove under reasonable assumptions that this equation tends to this one where we got rid of the reminder. And here, if we assume enough regularity for phi, Enough regularity for phi, that must be again a periodic function over a zero pi. Then we can integrate by parts and we can get the strong form of our evolution equation. So we moved from an integral differential equation that's quite hard to treat again to a Fokker-Planck equation. Here I only observed that if we manipulate our former ordinary differential equation by Taylor expanding it, By tailored expanding it, then we can write this local rule, and here we obtain this Foucault-Le Planck equation that's the same as before. Now, what we wanted to do is to describe more intrinsically the microscopic dynamics. And therefore, we want to describe which is the angle that is spanned by a cell during a reorientation. And therefore, we use, we treat this. Use we treat this problem as an optimal control problem. In particular, we express our microscopic rule in this way: so it is equal to theta plus null psi optimum, where psi optimum is the minimum argument of this j functional. And this J functional is given by the contribution of this kinetic energy plus the average of this cost functional G that we will specify later on. Then, in order to determine some Then in order to determine psi opt, we introduce this Lagrangian where mu is the Lagrangian multiplier and we gain our optimality conditions and by solving them we have that psi optimum is given by this relation. Again we can observe that. If we set g equal to epsilon squared times bar u, then we have this relation for psi optimum. For psi optimum, and we also observe that so we can rewrite our microscopic rule and we can add this in red stochastic noise because the average of the noise is zero, because xi is again has zero average. And here we observe that we are taking the average of the cost functional. So we could also put our diffusion here in the former rule, and nothing would change. Nothing would change. So now in this case, if we apply all the machinery that I illustrated before, if we let nu that plays the role of gamma to zero, we obtain the same Fokker-Planck equation as before, so equation one, and the same stationary distribution. So now we take a more into account a more classical cost functional. So it is this kind of, let's say, internal energy, where theta hat is given by this. Theta hat is given by this convex linear combination of theta equilibrium one and theta equilibrium two. And here t is a continuous positive function defined on zero pi. It is comprised by zero and one, of course, and it is defined in such a way it is one in theta equilibrium one and it is zero in theta equilibrium two. Moreover, it is equal to one half in the zero pi half and pi, so it means that if we are in zero, Pi, so it means that if we are in zero, pi half or pi, we have the same equal probability of falling in the first and in the second quadrant. And we also impose this condition on the derivative of pi, so it means that theta equilibrium one and theta equilibrium two are critical points. So this p allows us to say that theta hat in theta equilibrium prime, so the first equilibrium in the first quadrant, is exactly equal to theta equilibrium one. Equilibrium one and theta equilibrium in theta equilibrium two is equal to theta equilibrium two. So if we already are in the equilibrium, then we don't move from there. That's what we want. So in this case, we can obtain again with the Lagrangian multiplier the psi optimum. We add it to our microscopic rule and we add the stochastic diffusion. Where here now gamma is given by Now, gamma is given by nu over 1 plus nu epsilon to the square. So, if nu is small, then gamma is small, it tends to zero. And thanks to the cause invariant limit, so the procedure I showed you before, we can obtain this Fokker-Planck equation. So again, this is well posed. It has an equilibrium, a stable equilibrium probability density function that is obtained by setting the right-hand side to zero. Hand side to zero. And this probability density equilibrium probability density function is given by equation three, where here again we observe that stochastic coefficient bar sigma c, that's at the denominator, is inverse to epsilon to the square. So again, when epsilon is big, then the stochastic coefficient bar sigma c is small. Then we tried to fit again the files to To fit again the Faust histograms, and we observed that we have a slightly better result because here 3 is the green line, so our new probability density function, and it is more peaked around the equilibrium orientation that is the mode of the probability density function, also in this case. So it was the mode on the purple line, even though it's not so clear. And we observed And we observe that it fits at least qualitatively better the histograms by Faust. And we also observe here, so this is the same table as before, so we have the different values of epsilon for the four different plots. We vary sigma c in order to obtain the same linear average for the histograms. And we observe that we have a slightly better variance. Variance or standard deviation that compares with the experimental results. As last, we also wanted to investigate if our new model that was obtained as an optimal control problem could fit with the time evolution. And in particular, here we propose again the experiment of Aylivne that Luigi illustrated before. Illustrated before, and we see that in the same parameter setting by setting lambda theta equal to 6.6, that's the value that's determined experimentally by Livne, we obtain a quite good comparable results. Then we also did the same with a set of experimental results given by Jung Bauer here in reference form. In particular, Reference for. In particular, in the experiment led by Jung Bauer, they stretched the cells up to 3,000 seconds, and then after 3,000 seconds, the stretching stops. So here in green, we have their experimental results. So here he reports the average of cosine to theta over time. And we observed that by imposing this. That by imposing this reorientation time, microscopic reorientation time that was the one found by Leibne, we have quite a good agreement, at least in the first part. Of course, in the second part, we are assuming that cells, even if they are not stretched by axole anymore, we are assuming the same reorientation time. So, I would like to thank you for your attention, and I leave you with some. Attention, and I leave you with some references. Okay, thank you very much. We now have plenty of time for questions. And I would say, again, individuals can just go ahead and directly ask a question. So again, let me start. In the first part, you found that the mode did not exactly agree with the mean. Do you have an explanation in terms of the underlying physics for that disparity? No. Okay, sorry, I didn't hear. Your video is frozen. Your video is frozen, it's also your voice. Okay, yes, it is because I mean the distribution is over zero pi and it is, I mean, it is bimodal. So actually considering the mode over zero pi half corresponds to considering the average of a non-symmetric distribution function. And then I mean it's And then, I mean, it's as the closer you get to 90 degrees, the closer you, I mean, you have more cells that are oriented along that mode, but then you also have many, many cells. That's the boundary of the interval that you are considering and on which you are computing your average, but you also have many, many cells inside the domain. So, that this is why the average does not coincide with the mode. Okay. Okay, it's clear. If I may say more, this is a problem in the papers. In a sense, they always refer to the mean. So paradoxically, if you do the mean of cells in the range 0 pi half, 090 degree, uniform, the mean is 45 degrees, right? By definition. A uniform distribution in 090, the mean is 45. 90 the mean is 45. If you do the mean between 0 and 180, you get 90. In this distribution, making the mean on 0 pi half is in some sense disorienting because the most important thing is the mode, the most probable orientation. And instead, in some papers, you find the mean, which doesn't tell you much. In the sense that you can get 45 degrees, look at the picture on the bottom here, this one. This is the mean in the mode, this 45 degrees. For the uniform distribution, again, the mean is 45 degrees, but they are completely different.
