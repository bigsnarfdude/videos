Thanks Javier, Soron and Jorg for inviting me again to attend this I guess small but very dynamic meeting. So like for Akina I have actually changed my slide so many times and the point is not necessarily just showing what we have published, or at least in my case, what we have published or what we can do, but how I can get your help. But how I can get your help to understand how the brain works. That's really my purpose. So, what I really like to do is kind of go slowly, not necessarily kind of finish what I wanted to do, but I wanted to make kind of dynamic kind of interaction. If there's something you wanted to know, just please stop me and we can go. Anyway, we have a coffee time, so we have a lot of time to discuss. Alright, Jor? One hour? No, I don't think it will work. Okay. So here are the funding that are helping us to do the research. Just wanted to let you know that more than half of almost half of my lab are now doing industrial work, so kind of building things and kind of things that are going to be used for other researchers. The other half are just doing basic science, and these are the ones that. Science, and these are the ones that I want to present today. These are the list of collaborators, and here is the major collaborators, the picture of a king, Sutherland, who was inducted in Royal Society of Canada. But when it comes to the basic science, one of my long-term goals is to understand the physiology. Understand the physiology of the patient-based cognition. And because of the focus at lab page on memory, so that has been also my focus for the past several years or so. And so we do that in just normal brain, in aging, but also we look at the memory disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Just wanted to give you a bit of kind of snap. Kind of snapshots of what kind of memory system I'm talking about. So I'm very much interested to study episodic memories. And episodic memory in a nutshell is events that contain where, where, and when. So just imagine that it's my birthday party at a certain location at a certain time. And there are a room, which is a contender. Which is a contender. Someone friends come who come first, who come later, what are the foods, what are the friends that we have in the argument. So, this basically form an episode, which basically contains where, then, what. So, you can have different episodes that have some of those elements, but not exactly the same thing. So, I'm attending another birthday party, but it's a different place, different time, and different. Different place, different time, and different country. So, but then the brain kind of makes an abstract, and that abstract becomes a semantic knowledge. The birthday itself becomes completely removed of the where and when. They become by itself, and that face is stored in the brain. So, what I'm really interested to understand about the semantic knowledge, but anyway, it's very difficult to say semantic knowledge if you focus on episodic memories because you can control that. Because you can control that. So, this is a quick brain basically store the information. Usually, the memory arrives by feeling of different sensations come to the primary cortex, from primary cortex. Cortex, from primary cortex goes to association cortex, and then from association cortex goes to the hippocampus. Then it becomes taught back to the other region of the cortex. And that's why in patients who have a damaging hippocampus, the memory gets so much disturbed. Because this, you know, this hippocampus, which is in the top of hierarchy, is not being able to connect different bits of information within the cortex. The knowledge is still in the cortex, but they cannot be connected. But they cannot be connected to one another. So, in the 80s, this gentleman, Taylor, with his student Sena, came with a theoretical model to explain episodic memory and how that formed. And this is a time that we didn't really have that much of experimental data. It was all beautiful hypothesis-driven things. So, what they argue is that. So, what they argue is that we have the neocortex and we have hippocampus. During the formation of episodes, different elements of a cortex get activated that create an index within the hippocampus, which can basically reactivate it during sleep and all this thing. During retrieval, when basically something, you remember an event, some of that element, a piece of that element, which we call it partial key. That element, which we call it partial Q, get activated. Say that I remember my birthday, I come to this place, and then I say, Oh, I have also other things that happen in this room. So those elements could basically activate that index within the hippocampus. And what does hippocampus make is combine all the pieces together and send those pieces all together into the cortex. Now you have all the memory coming to your brain, right? So that's basically as simple as that. So that's basically as simple as that. This is proposed in 1980, okay, and it really generated so many questions and so many things that we can test. So in a nutshell, Hippocampus is like this angry librarian. She doesn't know the content of all these books, but she knows where you can find that information. So in a way, it just provided. So, in a way, it just provides an index. So, go and find that information. The cortex is containing the information. If you can't do this basically, I have to submit it. So, another thing about interesting about hippocampus is that it is a kind of, when you basically recall from hippocampus and look at the population activity, it provides two oscillations. One of them is theta oscillation. One of them is teta oscillation, another one called irregular brain activity. During the teta oscillation, when the animal is walking or is engaged in a task, the hippocampus are cortex floor to encode the performance. During sleep, or when the animal is inactive, the brain generate or hippocamus generate this irregular activity, in particular sharper ripples. Sharper ripples are oscillations that happen. That happen at the range of 100 to 250. And this is the strongest oscillation in the record. Most stronger oscillation in the record. It's being believed, and there are some data supporting that. This is the oscillation that contains index. So it sends the index back to the cortex, and that's, and it's basically a carrier signal. So you put the signal in it, and then you send that to the cortex. So going So going and trying to make a summary, I mean that index code theory generated so many different questions. I'm not going to go through all of those. I'm just going to consider this. So if it's indexing, that means that the information from hippocampus should really broadcast widely to the neurocortex. That's the idea. But the problem is, HPCAMUS has a limited connectivity. It cannot really send information everywhere into the cortex. Really, send information everywhere into the cortex. So, how is that then going to happen? And we know, even within the neocortex, the neurons have a very sparse connectivity. It's almost one to one million. So, it's very difficult and challenging things when it comes to formation of memory indexing. The second one is in order to consolidate this memory formation, the index code needs to be spontaneously reactivated in the brain. Reactivated in the brain when the brain is in offline. So we have got much more evidence, starting with Bruce McNaughton, showing that when you are in sleep, the brain gets reactivated, the same pattern of activity generated, in a way, is a kind of rehearsal during the sleep. And that basically constantly is the memory of the bed. But what we are going to show you is these two questions, if I have enough time. So the question one, right? So the question one, right? So what's the content of epicampo index within the neural cortex? And again, this is we are making a hypothesis. If epicamp was really indexing, that means that different areas of the cortex are going to receive different pieces of information. Because the different uh the the the information is being distributed among the neural cortex. Is that true? Well, there has been several attempts There have been several attempts since 2004, starting with Francesco Batania, trying to record rats brain activity with many, many electrodes. Which unfortunately didn't come too much of information because it created a lot of damage and it was impossible to get much of information out. But also, because of sampling problems, it was not enough to be able to understand what's going on. Then later on came Then later on came a group of logoclases in which I took the advantage of fMRI, put the MACAC into the monkey anesthetized, and had an electrode to record from hippocampus. And they said, if sharp reports are carrier signal, which is basically generating all this index volt, you have to map it out. Where is it happening? So what they did, they basically did a vault recording at the time of shopping. Cording at the time of shop openings. And what they found was that most of the cortisol get activated with varying degrees, but often the case, all of them are getting activated. And most of the subcortical regions are getting inactivated. So this was a paper that was published in nature, but it brought up a lot of kind of excitement, but at the same time, criticism knew, they knew that different areas of the brain. They knew that different areas of the brain get activated, not to this level. We know that they don't get this kind of desynchronization. We have now enough data to show that some of these are not correct. So is that an FMR archetype? Who knows? That's the kind of question that we're talking about. So what we do in the lab is to use the maps as an experimental model. An experimental model and image the brain activity at two different resolutions either at the population level so either at the population levels in which each pixel represents thousands of cells. So you can look at the bigger scale in space, but also parasitic prime. Or we can basically focus in the small region of the brain. In a small region of the brain and look at individual neurons. You know, with this, you can get a lot of easy analysis, you can, you know, because it is an easy signal, it's kind of spike, and you can say, you know, on or off is what you are talking about. But this is continuous signal. It's relatively difficult. But it's actually somehow is kind of embedded in my heart because it also kind of brings into a lot of things that is also common in physics. So this is, I think. So this is, I think, we are imaging illustrate here, which is a kind of excitory signals. And with optical imaging, we can do now record different type of inputs. You can look at GABAGO, which is inhibitory signals. You can look at the excitement once. You can look at the memory potential, which is the dynamic of the individual neuron. But you can look at also calcium, which is the output of the neuron. In an ideal world, you want to have them all together. So you have the input, you have the input input. So, you have the input, you have the memory dynamics, and then you have the output. But you know, the things, as we know, is much more complicated than that because there's all these neuromodulators that are also changing the gain of the system moment by moment. So, the story is even more complicated. We are now doing also all those neuromodulator imaging, but I guess I'm not going to be able to show them. And so, the animals are either in sleep or engaged in a task. The task is Task. The task is, you know, we create a treadmill because the scope is really huge, the layers are huge, as I think other people have shown. And then you can look at individual neurons, you can look at photoshop image, you can show them different environments, or you can have a simple kind of belt. The animal is basically guided with certain tactile cues which. Tactical cues, which is in the different locations. And then based on those tactical cues, anyone understands where is it and they can estimate when he or she is going to get away. I think I want to just bring this up because it was in this meeting four years ago where I was introduced to Zara, at the time I was working with Europe, and she came along and really kind of moved a lot and become And really kind of moved a lot and become a very good experiment. So, all those experiments I was showing is the head fixed animal, but as you know, those are not necessarily natural things for the animal behavior. The natural behavior is foot forging. Things like the food forging, something that we do. We go outside, we search for the things that we need to do, and then we come back. And based on the environment, we make a decision. So, this guy comes out here. So it's the same thing, same environment, grab it, that one take it immediately home, this one stopped eating it. So the animals making decisions based on the content, based on the time, based on the space. You can change a lot of things. You can extend this, you can do that. So, and then you can, of course, look at the hippocampal activity, you can look at the cortex using minuscule, and you can get all those information, you can ask the question: is it time? Asking a question: Is it time? Is it the space? Is it decision making? What is it? But I just brought this up. I'm not going to talk about her work, but I just want to acknowledge the fact that this was not something that we were intending. I didn't know that she's going to come home work in Manukau. That's something that happened because of this conference. Alright, so just kind of trying to replicate logo therapist's paper using RMG. Jivad, Kish is in the lab. Look at the cortical activity, this is almost half the whole cortex. And then also recorded hippocampal activity, and then you can see shopper ripples. And now you can just kind of map it out the content of chopper ripple within the cortex. This is voltage imaging, this is glutamate imaging. And what you can see is that certain regions of the brain get activated earlier, but then other region follows. Other region follows, and then there are several regions that never get activated. At least with one shop for reasons. Something similar with glutamate imaging, then what you can do, you can add all the animal and kind of quantify the extent of activation, either the time or the amplitude of activation. And what that's what you see. You can basically put them together in a in a cartoon. In a cartoon, the color shows activation level. So the warmer colour means higher activation, colder column means lower activation. So what you can see there is this area that is getting highest activation. And this area that is getting negative activation. And this is a kind of surprising thing about the brain. So other people are doing fMRI, and there's this concept of default mode networking. There's an area that gets active. Mode network. It's an area that gets accurate, whether patients or animals are not doing any particular things, it's kind of wondering what. And when they do this bold fMRI, they see this area in a mouse, and they call it the follow-up atom. And if you look at the continental hippocampus, you see exactly the same thing. Right? So I mean I mean I I should we have confident, but it's just the same areas that are basically involved in DePotmod Network, exactly in the shopping networks. Exactly at the shockwave. So we record from hippocampus at different levels. We can look at different oscillation gamma, slow gamma, high gamma, interplay between tractor ripples and gammas. So I'm not going to talk about that papers only, but you can see it. The nutshell is, we came with this idea. And the idea is, epicampus is not really connected to entire corpus. Connected to entire horizons. Each app has a particular connectivity, and that connectivity is default mode network. So the information first passes to default mode network. And from default mode network, it basically broadcasts to Kerala's cortex, but also perhaps some other region of your right. So we are writing a big review on that. I'm hoping we'll come out soon. Anyhow, this is the concept. I'm going to cast this. As I said, we are looking at different neuromodulators: cholinergic, neurophenergic, serotoninergic, and dopaminergic. We have different techniques. Perhaps I should just show you, because it's just kind of unlike this. Often, cholinergic, or as they call it, believe to be scholar system. So it goes off for that. Very kind of basic, easy, simple system. But when you now look at their dynamic, you see that instead of being stalled, That instead of being stalled, it's actually a vector. It's really changing moment by moment at different areas, at different states. So we have done the same thing with dopamine, nerepinephrine, acetonine, and in the cancer of disease, which in our case is Alzheimer's disease. I'll just pass out, but I just want to show you, even if you map out the arconia activity, it goes back again to that default area, default mode network, the memory network that I'm talking about. One that I'm talking. And what it is, is interesting: is that if you look at the concept of shock of ripples and look at either acyconi or nerve nerfing, they have a totally different dynamics. During a center of shuffle ripples, the level of acyconi really goes to the minimum, and during the ignorant effect, it goes to the maximum. So, I mean, why the So, I mean, why the brain basically uses different things? And this is kind of something that we really didn't know until now. We didn't really have a tool to study this. As I said, we look at the brain activity during sleep. So we were mainly interested to look at the activity during nerve, which most of the cortex are synchronized and receiving information from mechanical. But you know, we had. Campus, but you know, we had the annual and the annual basic transition from non-REM to REM state. So, Mustava, who was very interested to look at REM estate, discovered something very interesting, which actually came out yesterday in several talks, a phenomenon that I didn't know until a few years ago, a chimera. Still, I don't know what it is and what does it mean, but I want to show it again. So, what Mushtao found that, you know, during non-rem activity, most of the Activity: most of the cortex are synchronous. We see that, you know, if you look at the lip area, high limb area, pal cortex area, everywhere, you see this synchronous activity. When the brain goes to REM skill, things become a little bit different. Most of the neocortex becomes desynchronous. However, island of activity or area remain in synchronous space. I guess this is exactly typical for me. Typical, I mean, if Chimera is like having two states at the same time synchronized and dissynchronized, this is the state that you are seeing. You can basically do some analysis. It's not that difficult the number of pixels. And you basically can see this eye map. So all the pixels are disynchronous, except those are. Those remain asynchronous. And you can replicate that in electrophysiology. So this is not an artifact of headfix recording. Headfix recording or imaging is actually, you can see it also in the results of the recording. But what is really interesting, and still, I don't really know what does it mean. I've been sketching my head and asking other people, and this is something that at least I can provide and I can ask you to help me to understand. So, this is non-RAM, so the mouse frame goes to RAM. Halfway through, that area that was desynchronized goes to synchronized space. Synchronized phase. Okay, so if you break down and look at the image, as I showed you yesterday, so the ion was here, and then a second later is changing its position and it's dynamic. So this chimera phenomenon actually is not even stable within the cortex. It's actually moving around. What does it mean? Who knows? I have no idea. It's a phenomenon, but it's something that I guess we can talk about in the future. But interesting thing is, But interesting thing is, if you look at, if you map out those synchronized within desynchronized state, it actually goes again to those areas that are orthogonal to the default mode network. So this chimera phenomena is only happening in the network that is not part of the default mode network. What does it mean? No idea. Anyway, so five minutes. So, five minutes. Can I make it 20 minutes? Anyhow, so I showed you this population activity, unfortunately, I didn't go too fast, but at the same time, we look at also individual cells, right? So, in hippocampus, when you look at the neuroscientists, it's been known that hippocampus has these cells called clay cells, which encode space. Called play cells, which encode space. So when the animal moves around the room, there are cells that are fired at certain locations. You can do the same thing in the mouse. Instead of 2D dimension, you can have the animal run in one dimension, and you can see cells that are getting activated at certain distance or certain locations. This is zero, this is 150, something treadmill, and some cells get activated at the beginning, and some cells get activated at the end. So Sam is basically looking at the effect of time, space. He's looking at the effect of time, space, conjuncture cells. So, there's all the kinds of things that he's doing. I wish he could present some of his beautiful data, but it's collectively setting. Anyhow, another post I shared with Bruce McNaughton, you know, instead of looking at the small region of the cortex, look at the big area of the cortex and basically look at individual cells with two photon imaging. But you cannot do it all at the same time. You basically use this area, then this area, this area, this area, different data. This area and this area and this area are different things. We can very nicely see that we can almost see this place of spatially tuned cells almost everywhere in the cortex, providing what we have already shown in our population activities. These are place cells that are getting activated at different locations. However, if you lesion hippocampus, if you remove the hippocampus, you damage hippocampus, those places are mostly gone. However, there are still some However, there are still some remaining cells that are still showing some spatial tuning. And those, now we know, are Q cells. Q cells, these are cells that are getting activated when there's a kind of Q here. So, I mean, there are no cells anymore here in coding space, but when the animals get here, basically those Q cells remain there. Okay? And this is another example. This is another example how map changes. So you have now index cells or spatially tuned cells and you have a Q cells. Now what How Rand did, another patient in the lab, was to understand this partial, you know, this pattern completion theory. So you provide a little bit of information and then Hippocampus needs to generate the entire events, right? So what he did. Events, right? So, what he did, he basically taken advantage of the same task, but he did record the brain activity at rest one, just before the task, let the animal do the task, record all the special tuned cells, and then looked at the rest too when the animal was just in dress, was not doing that much of activity. And what he found was when the animal after When the animal, after the task, he finds what he finds was, he could basically find the cells that are getting activated at different locations. And what he could do, he can basically put them together and he can recreate the entire basic trajectory. So this is kind of strong, but not in this level. And what was interesting was we could find the cells that are basically either Either having a Q information or they have a trajectory information. So the Q information are really fixed, they are very narrow field. In the trajectory one, they basically kind of have a very different trajectory. But interestingly, I think this is the most interesting thing, the Q cells are the ones that are basically activating the trajectory cells. Meaning that if you basically look at If you basically look at the single reactivation versus the shuffle reports, which basically carry the index codes from hippocampus, you have first the trajectory cells coming first, which basically activate the hippocampal traffic ripples, which trigger this, I would say, trajectory cells. So for the very first time, we could basically separate cortex from hippocampus without doing any lesion. From even canopos without doing a lesion and trying to show this disease condition. So I think I'm out of time, right? There's a lot of statistical analysis and something that we can talk about. But one thing that I just wanted to bring for the last thing is not here. So maybe it's here actually, but using a different thing. A different thing. So you can do many different types of experiments. This is, you know, the mouse. You can do this flickering experiment, very simple task with different frequency. And what you can do, you can see this So, what what we found was, first of all, there's this spatially tuned cells within visual cortex. So, when you go with different frequency, you have different areas of the visual cortex that are responding to this stimulation, which is again a very new thing. So, we still don't know what it is. There's a resonant frequency, meaning that the cortical response. The cortical response becomes stronger when the frequency goes to a certain range, you know, 4 Hz, 15 Hz, and 35 Hz. These are the frequencies, the brain genetic oscillation we hear about that. But one thing that was very interesting is about this harmonic. So this is a stimulus frequency input. This is a response. Of course, you see the very resonant any outputs. You can see this harmonic, the higher harmonic. But what was very interesting, you can see this sub harmonic. What was very interesting, you can see this subharmonic frequency. I mean, again, in the brain science, I mean, as far as I know, there's no one has shown this subharmonic. I mean, what does it mean in a physical property or a physical system? There's a question for you, but I'm hoping to get some feedback on that. Thank you. Thank you, Matthew. We have time for a few questions. So how much is known about the functions of these slow wave oscillations in the memories? For example, does this contribute to anything like receiving speed learning? Well, I mean, we know now quite a lot about Shuffle Ripples. So what they have done, you could erase Shuffletripples and you can somehow impair the memory. Or what you can do, you can actually extend the Sharford report. Extend the shutter record size. And what is being shown that the memory, you know, the annual bases perform the behavior much better than the control angle, which just have a normal shockwave. So we know that there are certainly involved with the memory function, but it's beyond memory system because if you look at shockwave ripples and measure the glucose in your skin, it's actually the level of glucose also goes up. So it's really much larger. So, it's really much larger perspective. It's not just a memory. Memory is one of the things that is being associated with me. But there are many other functions that are also important. Maybe you just know a tip of an iceberg. The knowledge that we have is really small compared to what you need to know on the biology. But of course, I mean, there's gamma oscillation, and we tried some of the papers in BioArcha, we can see that, you know, perhaps lower gamma is important for some part of some part of episodic memory. Some part of episodic memory, a sharper look, is more important for other parts of the memory. And they have actually different areas of the cortex that are getting activated. But the problem was so far, we were not able to measure the whole cortex with that level of kind of precision. Now, with this optical imaging, we can image the brain activity at different frequencies. We can look, we can have actually gamma oscillation. So you can measure gamma oscillation with optical imaging. We measure gamma oscillation with optical imaging. And the advantage of optical imaging to electrophysiological recording is that it doesn't have volume conductance. It's really what is really happening there. It's not some signal that's coming from somewhere else. Yes? There's a lot of evidence that hippocampal hyperactivity is associated with tau spreading. Have you thought? Or have you ever tried some of these techniques, mouse models, or those models when they inject tau into the brain? Thanks for bringing it up because I have a project in which we inject either amino plaque or tau to internal cortex and we wanted to basically see how they basically spread within the cortex or within the brain. And in order to basically faster that we do some stimulation. We don't really do stimulation of the hippocampus, but we do stimulation of media people. And what we have seen, yes, when you increase the activity, Yes, when you increase the activity, you can basically change the speed of the propagation. More with the tau, but less with the amyloid flag. It seems that amyloid flag is uses inflammation and basically, you know, it's not necessarily, I mean, it has some level of activity dependent, but it's mostly inflammation. It just goes boom. It just goes everywhere in the background. Do we have any online questions? Yes, we have a couple of questions here, so let me just go quickly. From with them, is there any evidence for reproduction logging in the cortex? Well, I just need to have more detail. I mean, now we know that the cortex also could generate ripples, which can be also independent. Which can be also independent from hippocampus. So far, Ripple has this really high oscillation, and with our imaging, we are not able still to see that high-level oscillation in the portfolio. So I cannot add this question, at least in my own day. And here Burton is adding, yeah, when sho uh showwave repos occur in the hippocampus, epidemiological cells are usually localized in specific cases of the original. On the original. That's the same thing happening in the codex. Oh, well, that's, I mean, in order to address that question, you need to be able to record from multiple locations within HIPAA campus. That means that you will be able to segregate HIPAA reports to different bundles and then try to see whether those bundles are getting activated in different parts of the cortex. I mean, we haven't done that. There is a paper. We haven't done that. There is a paper that was recently published from Buzakilab in which they could show using the same recording even the cortical activation at the level of single cells is tuned to different shocking models. It's really reproducible. Yes, it's very lucky. I mean, just to finish, Michael has also a comment that they also see harmonics in their microsites with their statue. Harmonic in very harmonics in the microc with humans have. But with the culture. But with a culture. The the harmonic is but subharmonic is the one that I'm really interested in. Uh it why subharmonic? I mean again you see harmonic in higher frequency, you see in telecommunication, in engineering, I mean it's very well known. But what does it mean to have subharmonic with the brain circuit? That's a question. Next time I hear again so you might want to chat with the comment at some point. Point. So thanks all the speakers of this short session. We're going to have a short coffee break, but let's come back in 20 minutes. 15. 15. 15 minutes. Because I think some of you want to do the testing to get home. We could be a 15-minute walk there. Yeah, I can really find that.
