Yeah, so uh I'm going to continue talking about stochastic quantizations. That's going to be a companion of the talk by Howe yesterday, where Hao showed you yesterday that how you can use SPDE stock Markov processes to approach quantum field theory that is to construct measures. And that's in general called stochastic quantization. And today I'm Quantization, and today I'm going to tell you about another approach from this viewpoint. It's called variational approach, and it's not my work, but it's based on a paper by Barash, Kofi, and Gubernali and Gubernali. I think it's published in 2020. And then there are several follow-up papers with this approach to With this approach to going to the study further. So, what's this about? And we remember, so I will use 542 as a primary example to illustrate what's this approach about. And then towards the end of the talk, I'll mention how you do 543. So, we remember from Haus lecture yesterday, 5,4 measure is of the form mutify. mu d phi equals 1 over that e to the minus, say, you integrate over torus d, phi to the 4 dx, and of mu d phi, where mu is the Gaussian free field on the two and three dimensional torus. And we remember from both Hao and Hai Cheni. From both Hao and Hai 10 yesterday, that the Gaussian free field in two and three dimensions, they are not function-valued, they are distribution-valued. So, under this measure, GFF measure phi to the fourth doesn't really make sense. So, what you really do is that you want to introduce the cutoff, saying that so in so under this measure mu, so instead of studying phi to the Instead of studying phi to the force directly, you regularize this phi and raise to the power for this regularized phi. And then, as you turn off the regularization, things will blow up. And then you sort of do certain renormalization. So, what you really want to do, or what you are really doing, is that, so let's just say pi m phi is the Fourier. Phi is the Fourier truncation of phi up to frequency n. And so instead of studying phi to the fourth, so you look at pi n to the phi, pi n phi to the fourth, and now as n goes to infinity, this will actually diverge. So you subtract Cn1 times pi n phi squared, and you plus something called Cn2. The whole thing over dx and mu Over dx and mu d phi. And the main theorem in this direction is saying that mu n, and this also depends on n. And the main theorem along this direction is basically saying that, so in dimension 2 and 3, as n goes to infinity, there is a choice of constants cn1 and cn2 in such a way, which also diverges as n goes to infinity, and in such a way that mu and phi will converge weakly. Phi will converge weakly to a limiting measure, and that limit is called 542 or 543, depending on the dimension. And in dimension 2, so Cn1, so in dimension 2, CN1 is about log n. And CN2 is about log n squared. And in dimension 3, we'll say CN1 is about n. The leading order is about n. The leading order is about n. And so yesterday, Howell presented an approach using stochastic PDEs. Basically, that if you want to construct this measure, then you write down a long-term dynamics, which is a Markov process. This formally has this measure as an invariant measure. Then you sort of study this SPDE very hard and you have a good understanding of this PDE and its long-term behaviors. Then you use your knowledge of the SPDE. Then you use your knowledge of the SPDs and Markov processes to understand its invariant measure. So basically, that the original problem is a measure, and now you introduce an additional time parameter, which also brings in the Markov process. And you can study, try to study or understand this measure by this Markov process you create. And here, so today the variational approach I'm going to present by biological. Approach: I'm going to present by Baroshikov-Gubernali is that also that you are looking at this measure. You study this measure by introducing a time parameter. But now, this time, so what this time parameter brings you is not a Markov process, but it brings you a filtration and a martingale. Then you use this filtration and martingale to study this measure. So and uh, let's see. So, what we are going to do, so this is actually Actually, yeah, so that will be of the form like of the form, say mu d phi, mu n d phi equals 1 over n times e to the minus v n phi of mu d phi. Right, so mu n is actually of that form, so we call this whole thing. We call this whole thing on the exponential, we call it Vn of Phi. It's some functional of phi. And we are going to study the measures of this form under some Gaussian under some base Gaussian measure and put and tilt it by this e to the minus Vn, another functional Vn. So a key ingredient in showing that μn converges or ensuring that there is any limit is that you want N limit is that you want to get a uniform bond in Zn, which is independent of n. So key ingredient is to show that Zn is bounded away from zero by two. Uh by two numbers, by two sort of finite numbers, which are independent of n. So if you can show that, the convergence doesn't follow automatically, but uh believe me that's that's sort of uh usually the most important ingredient in showing that these things should converge. And uh so it involves an upper bound and and lower bound. So usually the lower bound Lower bound. So usually the lower bound is easier, and it is indeed the case here because the lower bound you can basically use Jensen's inequality. So the reason the lower bound is easier is really because that the exponential is a convex function. And the Vn itself might be a nice function, but the things get very bad if you exponentiate it. So Vn itself might be easier to analyze under this measure mu, but e to the minus Vn is much harder to analyze. VN is much harder to analyze. So, so in this retrospect, so lower bound is usually easier in the sense that if you apply Jensen's inequality once, you will get Cn is bigger than equal to, or Cn is actually under the measure mu, e to the minus Vn of phi. And if you apply Jensen's inequality once, it's Jensen's inequality ones is usually like e to the e mu V n over V n of phi. And at least in the case of phi 4, this expectation is 0. Or at least in the case of 5, 4, 2, this expectation is 0. In the case of 5, 4, 3, it's not really, but uh the lower bound is actually much easier than the upper bound. So normally this guy is going to be bounded away from minus infinity. So that's sort of a uniformly That's sort of a uniformly positive, so uniformly away from zero. So the real hard thing is to show that the upper bound uniformly in n. And this is what this approach is is about. And we formulate it in a sort of slightly more general way. The goal is that to have upper bound to get effective upper bound. Upper bound. For, let's call this number Z, let's say e to the minus VX, where V is some functions, some functions, and X is a high-dimensional Gaussian. The dimension X can be very high. So, for example, in the case of Phi 4, So for example, in the case of 5, 4, so the dimension of this guy is actually n to the d'th powers, and n to the d's. So, and in the case of the free field, the sigma here is square root of the inverse Laplacian. So, and in j and we see that this problem fits in the case of 542 and 543 because we want to get a uniform bound in. Bound in the Cn, then the Cn is really of the form that the expectation of the exponential of some function of a high-dimensional Gaussian. And that's what you want. So the first step to do is to introduce the time parameter. To introduce the time parameter. And we see that this sigma is the covariance matrix. So it's symmetric and positive definite. Symmetric and positive definite, then you can find a matrix A such that sigma equals A times A transpose sigma equals A times A transpose. And then let's suppose it's n dimensions. Then you can find an n-dimensional Brownian motion. So let's just call B to be an n-dimensional Brownian motion. Then we can deduce that A times the Brownian Black Brown. A times the Brunian motion evaluated at time one really has the same law as normal zero sigma. So B is n-dimensional Brownian motion where B is standard Brownian motion. Now we see, so we have introduced the time parameter and together with some filtrations. Together with some filtrations. So we give it a probability space. We call it omega FP. And Brownian motion is the canonical process under this omega FP. Okay, now we go back to this Z. So Z is the expectation. So, z is the expectation of e to the minus v of x. So, by the same thing, so z is also the expectation under t of e to the minus v of a b1. So, here, everything looks like very straightforward. Of course, these things are true, and we haven't done anything yet. But we have introduced a time parameter and the field tracing, and that's what. And the filtration, and that's what we are going to use. So now remember, what's our goal? Our goal is not to study this Brunier motion, or not only to study this Z. So the reason we want to study this Z is that we want to look at this tilted measure, which is normalized by Z. So in this sense, though, if you want to study μ from μ, it's of course very natural that you have Very natural that you have this measure P and you do a change on measure according to this density. It's just that you place you replace Gaussian free field mu by the measure on the Brownian motion P. So it's very very natural to define a new measure, let's call it Q by dQ over dp to be 1 over z times e to the minus v of AD1. And so, different from previously, so mu is a Gaussian free field, and mu is a measure on the space of functions, on the space of two-dimensional or three-dimensional functions. And here, P is a measure on this part space omega f and q is also a measure on this omega and f. It also comes with the filtration of f where t is between zero and one. Between 0 and 1. So since you have a filtration and you have a change on measure, then it's very natural to think about martingales, right? If you restrict the two measures to any subfiltration, then it's actually gonna be a martingale according to this filtration. So the first thing we know from that is that if from that is that if you restrict to a small for any if you restrict to any t between so if you restrict to any t between 0 and 1 this guy is actually a positive martingale a positive p martingale with respect to the filtration f of t. And now you know something is a positive martingale. If it's a positive martingale, then under some nice conditions, which are usually the case, you can write it in terms of the exponential of another martingale subtracted by the quadratic variation. So because dq over dp restricts to ft is a ma is a positive martingale. Is a positive martingale, so you can actually say that there is a martingale, not necessarily positive, martingale LT. There exists a Q martingale L T such that dq over dp. So this positive martingale can be written as the exponential of L T subtracted to its quadratic value. Subtracted to its quadratic evaluation. And now the third step: we have a martingale with respect to the filtration generated by the Brownian motion. So there is a martingale representation theorem saying that L T can be written as a stochastic integral with its Brunier motion. So number three, what we can deduce is that because L T is a martingale, That because Lt is a martingale for Ft, so there exists adapted US U such that L T equals 0 to T and say US D D S. It can be written as a stochastic integral. Here I wrote an inner product here because B is n-dimensional and U is also n-dimensional. So it's really an inner product. So it's really an inner product. But later, if you go to infinite dimensional, so this inner product also makes sense. So okay. And uh now let's combine these three things. What can we say? So our one can. So on one hand, this dp combining these three things, 1 plus 2 plus 3, it says that on one hand, z is defined as the normalizing measure, say 1 over z times e to the minus v AP1 equals dq over dp, and dq over dp restrict to f1, right? Because the time stops at 1. So dq over dp is the sort of density on the whole time interval 0, 1. So in particular, it's restrict to F1 basically means that restrict to nothing. Okay, so on one hand, so that's the definition of what dq dp is. And on the other hand, by these three things, if we combine these three things together, we say that we can say that dq over dp restricted to f1 can be written as the One can be written as the exponential of that guy at time one. So, meaning that there exists adapted u such that uh equals the exponential of 0, 1 US d ds minus 1 half. You can compute the quadratic variation of this L and Of this L and it turns out to be US squared ds. And you if if it's n dimensions, it so if it's finite dimensions then this norm is the usual Euclidean norm. But if it's infinite dimensions then this norm is L true norm because it's the sum of squares of all the components and these components are basically Fourier directions. And so now And so now at this stage we can completely forget about the middle. What it says is that one over z times e to the minus something equals something else. Yeah. Uh that's D B S. Uh wait wait wait. I feel like here you want anyone. Oh that's D B S now. So so TBS now. So so for now it's TBS. A is only inside V. Yeah, for now it's TBS. Right, so if it's N dimensions, then B is N dimensional Brownian motion, but if N equals infinity, B is cylindrical, L2 cylindrical Wiener process, right? You're right. It's independent from your motion on every component. On every component. And we are thinking about in n dimensions, and we want to get uniform bouncing n. So up to this stage, we can tentatively forget about the middle thing. It just says that there exists a u such that the left equals the right. And now, if you move the exponential to the right and take a logarithm, what you really get is that minus logarithm. get is that minus log z equals v of a b one plus a stochastic integral minus the quadratic evaluation. Okay, now we look at these things. There's no measure Q anymore. So there is a measure P with a Brunian motion, and there is an adaptive drift U such that minus log Z equals that guy. And if we look at this identity, the left-hand side minus log Z is completely deterministic. Z is just a deterministic number. And the right-hand side are three random things. But the middle thing is a multiple. But the middle thing is the martingale under p evaluated at time one. So especially if you take expectation under p on both sides, the left-hand side doesn't change, and the middle term on the right-hand side just vanishes. It just vanishes. So things are simplified. But there is a problem here because we need to remember our goal. Our goal is to get an upper bound on z. Upper bound on Z, which is an upper bound on log Z, which is a lower bound on minus log Z. Right? So we want to get an upper bound on Z, which means that we want to get a lower bound on minus log Z. We don't want minus log Z to be minus a lot. We want it to be uniformly bounded away from minus infinity. So uniformly sort of finite. So on the right-hand side, Right-hand side, we are actually favor, so positive things rather than negative things. So, if we just take expectation under P now, the middle guy disappears, and we know Brownian motion very well, and we know this operator A very well, and we know this V very well. So, as Hao said yesterday, that's just a polynomial of Gaussian. That's a power of Gaussian. So, even though it may diverge, but you can re-normalize. May diverge, but you can re-normalize in such a way that the expectation and the p of this guy is uniformly controlled. So now it remains to have the expectation of this guy, but the disadvantage is that you have a minus sign in front of it, which is not helping us. And so far, the only thing we know is that there exists such a U such that this formula holds. And we don't have any information on U. So we don't have any control on U. So the only thing we know is that we Don't have any control on you. So, the only thing we know is that they are restructuring you. But we don't have quantitative information on you. So, if we take excitation and LPC now, things are not gonna move forward because we can't really control this negative term. So, what saves us here is something called Jasana formula. So, you remember So you rem uh we see that now we come back to our original problem. We define this measure Q as a Tilton measure on P, which is have the form of the exponential transform by the adaptive drift U. So you can sort of that you can sort of think of this Q, that part, to be the definition of this Q. So there exists such a U such that if you Exists such a u, such that if you define qu in that way, then you have a new measure qu. And the what Jesanov transform says that theorem is Jesanov, Jesanov, saying that you can define a new process B, B U defined as B T minus zero T U S D S. T USDS is a standard running motion and the QU is quinstead of running motion. That's what Jasonov transform says. So now what you do is that if you replace b by this b u plus the integral of u, you'll find that you will turn this minus sign into a plus. So if you just plug that in, you will find minus of log z will equals v of a b one is just a of A of BUH1 plus A of USDS plus 01, but now we are USDBU and plus, and magically it turns the negative sign into a plus. But now we But now we see that BU under P, B U is no longer a Brownian motion, but BU is a Brownian motion under Q. So that the second guy is actually a martingale under QU, evaluated at one. So now it's very natural to expectation, to take expectation on the QU on both sides. And the martingale on the QU just vanishes. So what you have is that minus 1. have is that minus log z equals E expectation under Q U of V A B one U plus A of zero one U S D S plus one half Yeah, 2 squared. So, is this just a best way of saying things? Sorry? Huh? Saying things to what? Completing the square. Uh where's the square here? So it's sort of a you turn the square. So it's sort of you do many things, you do a series of things to say that there exists a u such that minus log z can be expressed in terms of the u and the Brownian motion and the qu. But now if we look at this formula, we will see that we are actually, we actually gain something compared to the original problem. So the original problem says that The original problem says that z minus log z equals the expectation of e to the minus z. Right? That's what the original problem says. And as we remarked at the beginning, so under p, v itself might be easier to deal with, but the exponential or minus v is very hard to understand. And y and if we look at this expression, we see that Expression, we see that we get rid of the exponential now. So if we look, the original problem basically plus blah blah blah blah says that minus log c equals minus log of that thing. And in certain sense, this formula basically swap the expectation and the log or swap. Expectation and the log, or swap the expectation and the exponential in the other way, in the other direction of Jensen's inequality. But of course, the other direction of Jensen's inequality can't be true, so you have to sacrifice something. So the thing you lose is that inside V, it's not just AB1U, it's AB1U plus something else. But the thing you gain is that you get rid of the exponential now. And in fact, there is a theorem saying that so what so what we have derived so far says that there exists a u, there so there exists an adapted u such that this thing holds uh minus log z equals blah blah blah. And there is a theorem saying that whatever if you change u to anything else v, it will be bigger than that. So It will be bigger than that. So the theorem actually says that minus log z is the in-fimum over all the adapted things you can choose, such that EQV of V A B one V plus V S V S plus one half I'm going to come back to this theorem 10 minutes later, but I'm going to claim now that in the case of 5, 4, 2, this formula itself is already sufficient for us to get uniform bounds on Cn. And in 543, it's not sufficient. And in 543, it's not sufficient to tell you what more we need. Let's remember what's 542 here. So 542, what's this A? In the 542 case, A is, let's say, one minus Laplacian. Let's say one minus Laplacian to the minus a half. So you remember Haiti's lecture yesterday that so for every Fourier mode n, what's the GFF? You divide by n for the Fourier mode n. So you divide by n basically means that you take one antiderivative. It's like that. And so and so what's Vn? V n Vn phi just equals pi n phi, let's call it to the wick of order four, dx. And let's forget about what this wick is, but we'll come back later. But it's something like coming from the normalization constant in the sense that pi n phi to the fourth you diverges, but you subtract Cn times one. But you subtract Cn times 1, Cm of 1 times 5 squared, and you add back Cn2. Basically, it says that there is a choice of Cn1 and CN2 such that this expression converges under Gaussian measure. So if phi is GFF, then there is a choice of these constants such that this expression converges, and let's just call this expression to be we call 4. And it's sort of a normalized. It's sort of a normalized power of Gaussian. So now we see that, so we are starting from this formula and we see what's minus log zn. Minus log zn is basically, it says that there is, there exists such a u, there exists a u such that it equals EQU of Vn. Let's call A times B1U. call A times B1U, let's just call it Wn. Let's just call it Wn because B depends on N. B is an N square dimensional Brownian motion now. So let's just call it W n. W n U, let's call it W N U because W N U is a GFF, so it has covariance sigma under QU. And plus, let's call this thing Let's call this thing, call it capital U. Let's just call capital U to be A acting on 0, 1, US, DS. Let's call it a capital U plus 1 half US square ds. So it says that there exists a U such that minus log Zn equals that guy equals that guy, where capital U. equals that guy, where capital U is defined as the integral of little u in time and you take one antiderivative. So now we can expand W n or we can expand V n. So if Vn has Wn alone, then you take expectation, then by definition it's zero. But Vn is not W n alone, it's W n plus some U. So you basically you expand it so inside is that So, inside is that, well, so what you get is that it's the fourth weak power. So, basically, what you get is that WNU to the weak power 4 plus 4 times WNU to the weak power 3 times U plus 6 times WNU to the weak power 2 times capital U squared plus 4 times W N U times capital U U U U U U U U U W n u times capital U cubed and plus a u to the fourth and plus one half this little U L2 norm integrated. And we take expectation of QU for all these guys. So if we take expectation under QU, we know that WNU is just like GFF under QU. So you take expectation of this week 4. Expectation of this week four, that guy just vanishes. That guy just all right, that's a good. So week power four basically says that if you take power four, things will diverge as n goes to infinity. So you normalize by those constants CN1 and CN2 in such a way that it converges, it still behaves like a power four, but not quite. But let's believe that this is a purely stochastic object. Stochastic object, it just disappears. And again, we remember our goal is to have a lower bound on this expression. And the things that are going to help us are the two terms on the bottom line, because they are both positive. The thing here is purely stochastic. No matter whether it vanishes or not, it doesn't matter. You can just control it because it's powers of Gaussian. But the other three things on the first line is dangerous because it contains you and we don't know how to contain, we don't really know how to control you, right? We don't know their signs. They are not guaranteed to be positive. They can be very negative. And we don't know how to control them, right? But the idea is that to use these two positive things to control all the Things to control all those dangerous terms. And like how said yesterday, that all these terms can be controlled by, say, one over 100 times the second line plus something purely stochastic, which can be controlled a priori. And the reason you can do that in 542 is basically that you see, so in 542, no matter whether it's W n or W n width squared or W n width. W n width squared or W n width cubed is just slightly below L infinity. So all these things, all these W terms are C minus kappa for arbitrarily small kappa. So these three integrals, in order to make sense of them, you just need a little bit derivative of u. So you only need almost the L infinite normal of u, but just slightly, slightly more than L infinite. Slightly more than L infinity norm of U, right? So you just need a slightly a little bit derivative of U in order to control these three terms. And also we see that the highest power is Q. But now here, we have capital U to the power 4. So in terms of powers, so this guy dominates. In terms of powers, this capital U to the 4th dominates. This capital U to the fourth dominates. And in terms of derivatives, this little u dominates. Because we remember what's capital U? Capital U is basically little U, you take one antiderivative, right? Basically means that little U is the derivative of the capital U. So that on the bottom line, we have capital U to the fourth. So we have the L4 norm of capital U. We actually also have H1 norm of capital U. Because this little U is basically. Because this little u is basically one derivative of capital U. So that, and then to control the other three dangerous terms, we only need absolute derivative of u, and the highest power is three, is still a little bit away from four. So that's why in 542, you can basically control them very routinely in that case. So that's how the 542 works. But things are different from 543. Things are different from 543, it's basically because for 543, Wn is no longer C minus kappa, but Wn is so this guy is C slightly below minus a half, and this guy is slightly below minus 1, and this guy is slightly below minus 3 over 2. And the only thing you know about this little U is that it's in L2. This little U is that it's in L2. So that the only thing you know about capital U is that it's in H1. So capital U, the only thing you know is that capital U has one derivative, but you don't know anything more. But if capital U only has one derivative, you can't make sense of this expression, and you can't make sense of this expression either. So that's why it's not working in terms of Working in terms of 543. And also, well, but we can sort of go proceed further, but it's kind of slightly more inconvenient if problems like 543 gets more complicated. Because what it says is that there is such a U, and the expectation depends on U. So if you change U, you are changing the measure which you are taking expectation. So it's kind of slightly inconvenient. Kind of slightly inconvenient. And then there was a famous theorem saying that, well, yeah, if we look at the original formula downstairs, it says that this u you get is actually de minimizer. It's actually deminimizer. So, but the inconvenient thing about the formula downstairs is that if you change this drift to V, you are changing the measure. So it's not really very convenient. So, it's not really very convenient. But then there's a famous theorem by Fourier DuPois, which tells you that a similar thing holds, but in a much more convenient form. So, theorem by Bouille Duport. I think the original paper is the 1990s, either 7 or 8, but then there are, later, there are generalizations. Later, there are generalizations and nicer proofs of this formula. One is by Us Chuno in 2014. And the other, there is a nice proof by Shi Chen Zhang in 2009. So Shi Cheng was here yesterday, but he left today. So what this formula basically says is that you can change this Q V into the original measure P. To the original measure P, saying that minus log z equals int over all u, but the expectation is taken under t. And now what's inside v is not, it's the original Brownian motion plus a times 0, 1 USDS plus 1 half 0, 1 square. 0, 1 square US square TS. And that's what it says. It basically says that you can change this QV into the fixed T, and you change the corresponding BV into the original Brunier motion B. What's important is that B is Brunier motion under T, corresponding to this B V is Brunier motion under this QV. And there is a slight. And there is a slight difference because as what we explained just now, we see that this minimizer U can be attained, right? We derive that there is such a U that this formula holds. Then this means this minimizer U can be attained. But here in general, it's an infinite number, but you can't find the minimizer. So you can only find an approaching sequence. But anyway, so this thing gives us much more concern. This thing gives us a much more convenient situation. In that, let's just go back to the 5.4 case. Or adapted, or L2 adapted U. Right. So everything is adapted and L2. Adapted to the original filtration. So Original filtration. So now, according to this theorem, we are trying to do 5, 4, 3 again. And what the difference is that we remove this U dependence here. They no longer depend on U, but they are just Gaussian-free fields or whatever under the measure C. But they are not Gaussian-free fields under the measure QU, but these things don't depend on U, but they are Gaussian-free fields under the measure P. So we want to take expectation of EPC. Expectation of E P over all these things. And again, the first one doesn't matter, it just vanishes. The first one is defined to have expectation zero. And now, since there are only three minutes left, I just explain how to treat the second one because it's easier, it's linear in U. It's linear in U. So a priori, we explain that you can't control it because the only thing you know about this capital U is that it has one derivative. Of course, you can't integrate against something which has minus three half derivatives. You can't. But the idea is that you can choose U in such a way that this guy blows up, but a positive guy also blows up. Up. And these two divergence cancel out each other. So, more precisely, what you do here Oh, you see, so in order to use the drift, so in order to use the drift to cancel the potential divergence here, we see that it's not of the very convenient form here because. Very convenient form here because this drift is little u, and this linear term here is capital U. So we first need to change capital U into little u. And what I so what does it have to do? So remember, what's w and width squared and what's u. These are adaptive process evaluated at time one. So this guy is actually right is actually WM. It's actually W n width squared evaluated at time one, and the process U also evaluated at time one, and you take inner product over L2T3 over L2T3. Okay, so it's actually you can write it as a time derivative of that guy, right? Because this capital U is the integration of little u from 0 to t. So if it's evaluated at time 0, it's 0. So that the guy evaluated time 1 is basically the integration of the derivative from time 0 to 1. Okay, so now you so you have to do that. Okay, so now you so you have a derivative on the product of two things. So there is a choice uh so by Lebanese ru by product rule you either put the derivative here or you put the derivative on capital U. If you put the derivative on the first guy it turns out that this thing is going to be a martingale. It's going to be a martingale. It's going to be a P martingale with respect to this filtration evaluate at time one. And you take expectations. 1 and you take expectation, it vanishes. So it's really gonna be that 0, 1, wn. So the real thing you want to have is that you put the derivative on the second guy plus the martingale. So what's the derivative, time the derivative of capital U? Time derivative of capital U is basically u is basically a times little u at t, right? By definition. And we know a itself adjoint, so that you can basically move this a to here plus Martingale. And now it's kind of we have better clue on what we should Clue on what we should choose on this capital U. For example, what we have is that we actually have a four times here, so it's actually a four times here. So if we choose capital U to be something Vt minus four times A of W n width squared. Then what you have is that let's Is that let's allow me for like two or three more minutes. So, what you really have is that here, the expectation of this four times W n wick one of this U one This u1 will really be four times the integral of A W n width squared t. And this little ut will become Vt minus 4 times AW n width squared T dt. Right? And now you write it down. And now you write it down, it's actually four times an inner product between a stochastic term with an L2 term Vt, which you don't know how to control, minus something which is very large but only only stochastic. Only stochastic. So you can control. So even though it's very large and only stochastic, you can always turn it, you can always re-normalize it in such a way that this thing doesn't matter. So the only That this thing doesn't matter. So the only thing that's dangerous is something contains either U or V, which you don't know how to control. But for purely stochastic things, even if they are bad, you can handle them. So that's the dangerous thing you don't know how to control because this guy also doesn't have sufficient derivative. But right, this guy still has minus a half derivative. But now this little V is just in L2, so you still don't don't know how to control. But it doesn't matter because matter because we have a coercive term u squared here u squared here. If you plug you into that thing, you will find that there is a purely stochastic term, which you don't really care about, and then there is a cross term between V and A, A W. And the cross term just cancels out. Terms just cancels out that guy. It's actually between minus 4 times 0, 1 AWN with cube t vt dt and plus 1 half vt squared dt and plus something stochastic, which might be very bad, but it doesn't really matter because it doesn't contain the unknown V. So what you have is that these So, what you have is that these two dangerous terms containing V, which you don't know how to control, but you choose the drift U in a smart way that you don't need to control, they cancelled out completely. And there is another quadratic term in V. Another positive square term in V left. So, basically, that's how you treat the linear term in U. And then there's another quadratic term in U. So, what you want to have is that you further separate something from this V to cancel out the dot. From this V to cancel out the divergence from the quadratic thing in U. But since it's quadratic in U, so that's gonna have a more complicated answer than this. But sort of the idea is similar. So one and so once I attended to a lecture by Marcel Miliano and he was explaining this and what his original words is that the main idea in that is just that one one half a plus b squared minus a times a plus b b b b b b b b b b b minus a times a plus b equals one half b squared minus a squared. And so what he really means is that you separate u into a plus b and you choose a plus b in a smart way such that the cross term a b cancels out and the minus a square you don't care about. It's purely stochastic. And then there is still another positive And then there is still another positive square term, B square left, which allow you to do the further similar things. So that's sort of uh I hope uh I'm out of time, but I hope I sort of uh share some of my understanding of this approach and uh thank you very much.
