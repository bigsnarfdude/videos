And so we shall discuss the compiler of two methods for the modularized nature 5. And this is fashion point for my famous joint work to be talking about some of the five. Some contrast now contrasts with big fun. And then we feel And the wheel and rank A Register picture the wheel, just to cover the weevil from picture forms. And upon your teaching, there is this bosom space which is called fit music. I think that one of the I think the one of the very objective is set, and we can recall a more precise description of this method vector. And there also exists this module space to some affine space. And basically the programmer foundation is just to create an actual image. And we call the number of heating fibrashi. I'm 80 vacuums with units. So this is totally page 10 and each file is algorithmic orange algorithm ID and this heat instruction. So in this station of biogenic story, there exists a hypercarpet. And in this talk, we shall compare this person to this music. And we recall what exactly features the same factory created. And he clearly obtained how you abstract how it surrendered. So, and it's a very nice object, but it's not so easy to standardize from the definition of the so for instance, because the modularized station hits boundary, non-confact, so we are it is simply asymptotic behavior of this high factor, it's hitting to incur and behavior. High button what he currently is in any way, but it was waiting to start and compared with the hitching drink. The central project is compared to geodesic property in the motion space. So, we can not this guy is probably much easier than eating them. So, we try to conquer and design this guy. And And Andrea Drew and Neitsky proposed a very attractive contextual description of the heat single. So you can do in terms of PTF ratio and some data on just look for expanding. As we work with us, it's planned. And as a consequence, there's made a prediction about the future rate. So we take a look at each ban. And then so maybe constant so starting from integral of the curve in this major space. And then take this number shown. So that the two piles over the heat chain the you put a V T and the And the selection case and exponential weight and the complete identified exponential and massive features as T by this is like consequences of a contextual description that it's in better and there are several There are several attacks. So some people study this prediction by differential geometric methods. And so it was pioneered by Mark Andrew. And the case of heating sections from the spike file. From this period by our demand and by the star and eventually there are plenty of distomb of the song and the sisi also study higher higher and okay. And the summer sum shown on the radio state term over X. And the work of Periso was generized. My opponent is And the button roll and the device, a slow holder, and the vice. And there's also original approach proposed by Guy Nguyen, you know, Nightsky. And then it was a study by all. And so these are the guessworks about the issue. And then the main tale of this part is so the prediction is okay. For anyone without being a discharge, explaining this talk. So, in the following past teacher record, more precisely about teacher. I'm going to think about it. I'll let you straight colour in the simple case as I will again explain. I'll have to explain the term proof in some case. Then let me summarize for generations. Then what is it? We constantly have to pick some of the things. So we consider one of fixed barbarians and x is actually proper and for simplicity we assume container length of e which created and the trace of data and because of the case I need I mean course of the case, but it takes off the three days on the regular button, he did five inches. Under the one, two tests to the center of health and heat spot will be singles. Under this control, according to the fundamental theorem of Pi Jiaq, they exist unique colours in the book of the colours. Satisfied retirement, which is one under this identification. And so, the comic before we get here talked about Professor Han yesterday to correct me by he thinks. Here, I've already delivered the coverage of transportation. Which is the user connection unit to determine by the following structure and the H. And the same title H denotes the adjoint of P is H and let me remark so the how to get H I using I found what you of the just take one thing one equals to each other so the H it the calculator for H over Elta is used in the calculator and V. In this is a half-different or NV, uh the bundle in NB is a categorized. And it is also due to bands. So what is how many methods? So how many method means this function satisfied. Ah, I can satisfy. Yeah, so and so so we use the same method on the on this in this file. Okay, so Okay, so I mean because you are the definition of context of this each value, which is given by NBE. And the enemy turns up to and the device are you doing that and this is what the read fill and then you know the title is fairly scary I think that's I don't think I told you not to fit first algorithm of this context, the functional context. It is naturally asphalt to the space of how many planes or how many planes. I'm reading one and date. Yeah, let me say everybody wants me to come in. If the sigma is quoted, it's a colouring of view, but as an indicator, I mean, it is also coming into triangle, which I'm going to do very roughly. The rival demotions are holofic structure, the back homofita because they are joint with respect to the coach, I mean some co-care and co-ex. I think it's pretty wise to assume what is called in China as Nigerian to take that. Varying H equals one over the child connections. So in particular, this control is language chosen. They cannot be called a history. Completely space. So, so we can't identify these. And there's very easily coming just because we'll come along the code coming from the middle of the city. Because the natural every culture over space for me and where you find your background. So this is start finally to construct the electric prototype of disk and then we obtain I think we like So, the last thing we like to record the what is the single energy. So, because the control shown, it is called family. I think the rubber fabrication with respect to the natural photo simple soft sound is much of this and final We are gained files with the majority of the right bundle of appropriate degree from the sphere class. Well, in particular, the file has a 45 million paragraphs. And the very history of conception depending on the choice of the square root of the triangle one. But anyway, it is actually. So in this situation, there are good things. On this global equation, a transparent cycle. For example, hitting section is horizontal. And then finally to speak. You take that, you can. Into space. You put that into the batch compression and the holy condition and conflict. And in this case, the And in this case, the partic fibers the fibers are component of fibers. So particularly identified as H1, sigma, tensor, or signal. And the side essay is horizontal. So the horizontal pressure is identified with the ER of the virtualization is this text, natural properties of that structure. It's identified as paint. Five minutes. Eight one, sigma ka, one sigma, and two other pieces of space. And we give it, of course, identical greens. Eight two, sigma prototype, k sigma. But same job. So by these identifications, the cartel space at the data identifies how performance Then, so we can also So, for data because they include production of one home by Tell me okay the physical project at the table as it is free strong or if it could be functional but to the state of all the buttons. Stable on the button on CMA. And this is called this is called the compare isn't doing and the item drink. What's our thoughts on the spectral curve? Are you taking the intake of the X or the spectral curve? So for simplicity of the explanation, we consider the case value they can be from a non-degenerative product. Catalyt. Okay, come down. C equals here, no designate product over C serum ten E which is no designate and simple. I will accept that. For any program section with and then this this thing, this part you see in this thing. This one you see in this week. I'm asking for which one and which jeweler. Yes, we can. Thank you very much. So, this is the competition visa. Are the heating sections on the entire MHPRAN? So, I consider just the visual component, but maybe you can cost all the components. But I didn't consider the other components. And so we are not going to say that he could run the compact event service and which special problem solution may be so you can give you how to communicate. And it is so and it is non-declared TV. It is Which means CCP until CP is and do up. So if you take a husband, take uh no data, many information will be something. But let me explain uh outline this case. Outline in this case. So, for instance, if you do mention and take on the given y for some automatic definition, then in this case, C in this button. But you are going to move it by this natural pen. And I'm just going to respond. And so we so we can post that the some companies and the I'm sorry, this gives them the composer the formation of the content.  And in the 60 stage, you see the recomportion of the transient space of positive space of hip span, right vertical direction and horizontal direction. I mean I mean so so let me imagine this yeah this for that die power so just the joint part of the fact that you just want to read this I mean I don't want to put it so So this guy decreased to me as a hit sphere in this by the totological ramp, you know, UV4 of the pipelines. So this is an isomorphism function. And the action of also this is mechanism. Mechanism of the pushboard over, which is going to take out to the end just before measurement. And this thing is the fashion motion or the push forward. So this form and so this is So this we use is here in the injections H1 sigma paper four sigma paper T R k sorry to H1 and this is equal to the bad transition and yeah There also exists a travel view from a weighted object to four hours since you are there. And we can use it to include it for this context and proceed to store case marks. Call the case in one case. So if you use these and text one, so we're eight and zero, sigma, two, sigma two, two, updates one, eight, sigma, two, the bottom, which will be. And the TV made it with the hotel list. If you know, so you know each one special or the major space I think is zero single it's not possible we can eat and Let's see if I can share this of you. We see what can be easy. Eight, H1, E D. And we have a photo of the E. C Especial count one E. Exploring both to take up and instead and we try to find the terror these some black holes and these buffers up to Up to the parents mode is kind of and we have to show this is the collision or spice fiction for some coins I similarly for eight for eight and one. For A and 1 sigma theta for sigma theta theta ln space and E2 data. So we have also bundle. I'm sick of seeing those leaders. Let me move in the suit, suitable please the photo store. These are called plausible. And so it is for the same. So we here we have already studied the estimated with these counts. If you count Andrew, I think it's a little bit of a But then we detail your setup. On top of eight on the details right, there you go. The details are there, right? Well, I may not cue. Ah, sorry, sorry. Yeah, sorry, ah. See, right now we be a constant h higher higher like case button. Yeah, so ah. So, for single six, I'll say that. I think my source has a sense of the beginning. So And it is also a machine. And uh so because of the proportion of the animal we were seeing. Of the animal field. And so you see the diagonal curve for the end of the bar. And of course, this thing also makes sense, globally makes sense to each other. So in particular, for any local state song, any one of you planned for H plus T theta, but we have a the We have a little slope dynamo part, and we have to pop a dynamo and we also have uniquely designed metal detail. Sorry. Update fifteen. 1818. In the face of 1882, I discovered that I'll tell you about your picture. CP2 Then we see the flat and the coverage of the channel. That's the time point of the flat and the And then you talk to some eat now. And then In the simplest case, it will need to show for all this detail. It's two and twenty. This donated by special or files of and this kind of property is study what we want to do. So we want to engineer case and simple casework study by human character. So engineering case, the case was studying. I'm not saying that. Anyway, so we have this time. So we're like so the movement. So we did this phase. And then you got the corresponding colouring problem. Okay, so we'd like to uh study the pairing of the pairing of we know the usually uh in the Hammock theory, we know uh the this kind of how much. So the UC starts the coming coming forms, but the UV will be able to have a great. So it's not so easy to study the more detailed property than the coming graphics. So we'd like to construct a approximation of these colouring plants. Of these how it works to study. And so this one, this one formula from AP method which uses uh nothing for eating for kinetics. Uh carried eggs. But on eggs man should be homophobic and starting information new by we modify everything in our argument around the point of data and then we'll just constant scam approach change. So So, standard XP movement. Then there is chromatic function on the business over P2 and the spectral part. So So keeping this so we can consider such a button or v or d button into x to this new button is this show. So you can construct this kind of function and you also assume alpha zero up to one. I think Then alpha t induces L C or X P. Which is promoting and then it is once you have the one form, any valuable any value plus form H T plus T. I told you about MSD. So we both at this last property. One 20 kilo and this key and HT and then diagonal part equal to equal view and then open diagonal partners. But explain to the construction. Yeah, the boundary. So this is obtained from the compound structures, and we can check the details by using the format algorithm. Then Conceptive, uh, this uh approximation by touching. If you are following section over the unbelievable photos of any format, For the first one massive HP is going to be far to T4 and it is against US board. It's private teams. Starship Onacid Simon Agency Dar classic Tal T V So this one first here. The calculi is just a function for point of X and the point for point P. And continue outside actually and then we can check PPV actually, uh more cycle. Not one cycle. I need to go home with the correctly imported. I'm doing. The third one part is the octave part in this mark or complementary. I will believe H T plus taken along H D H. To U also is mode of X. And from these properties, we can show common graph before I start common graphics. I know it's more and more picky for the spread.  Okay, so this the device is very small. So uh the pairing and this button's waffle is very small, close to the pyramid, or just at the bathroom. Um I think you buy it, but I'm cut back. But I need coffee and demonstrate. I think it's going to be very small. Trust Indonesia or HP. And then this is and this is Prophecy Stokes formula. This is deleted by the intervention for the sound and explains. In this way. And then value gain is final. Estimate again. Just give us into cost part so. Well, you should have got the bar. So this is again by news. There's some stokes from here again. Just leave it over this. Okay, let me remark uh so give us a nice deep uh Human surmise for this subject. I mean, it is for this kind of a problem, it is not easy to study the integral over xt directly. I mean, it's difficult to so for the start, estimate is equal to part of part for the part is far from the e k tau. So it could be two. So it probably needs to fail this diagram. But by using the source formula, the only file form part of the file format. And so, but they used to require different forms. So by using this kind of algorithm, we only need to use the standard stokes for that. So that's a matrix. So that's I mean, much different. But anyway, so by it by the sign, you talk about it. So, okay, so I'll stop here. Thank you very much.
