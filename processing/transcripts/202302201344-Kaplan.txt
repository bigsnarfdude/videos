Alright, so welcome back to the elementary session. So I guess this is going to be the So I guess this is going to be the most talks in the sessions that we're going to have. No. We have four other substitutes, but we have available themes. But a couple of announcements, part of the goals that we had for this workshop was to have junior people of postdocs sort of get acquainted with other people in the community and talk to them. Talk to them. We are going to make sure that something happens regardless of how shy you are or how. So we're going to have some pairings. But they're not going to be dense. But but regardless of whether you're paired with someone or not, we're going to ask some senior people to reach out and make sure that you talk to some of the junior people. And but regardless if you don't this Regardless if you are assigned someone or not, reach out and talk to people and see what they're doing and have anything to advise mathematics or just job-related things. Make sure that you challenge us. Alright, so we're going to start this session with me. So do we get You you in particular will get some point that you will have to reach out to. So we don't have to like any of those points. Whatever you choose to pair. We already paired We already did profile for you. So you already did select you had a match. Alright, so we're going to start with Ali Dapha that's going to talk. So we're going to serve in a link upload that's going to talk about dismiss factions of this mirrors. Yeah, thank you to the organizers for organizing this great meeting and also for giving the work. Yeah, so thanks to the organizers. Right, so I want to talk about distal expansions of dense pairs. So to introduce the question, let me first briefly recall what distality is. So we have a complete theory T, and I'm going to take an indiscernible C plus. And I'm going to take an indestructible sequence indexed by the rationals. The index that doesn't matter too much, although I do sort of want to have a distinguished point in the middle, in this case, zero. And I want that my sequence sort of has no greatest element below this point or at least index above this point. Right? Okay, so we have this indiscernible sequence in some monster model. We have a set of parameters B and E. And we're asking that outside of our distinguished point, our indiscernible sequence is actually P indiscernible. Then what we want to conclude. Certain point. Then what we want to conclude is that the entire sequence is given to. So basically, the behavior right at that point in the middle is sort of controlled by the limiting behavior of the sequence around this point. So this is sort of saying in some sense that things are kind of governed by orders. The indiscernibility of the sequence, or at least the sort of upgrade ability of the parameters, is controlled by the order of the sequence. Right, so some observations, not easy observations, but also not terribly difficult observations. Terribly difficult observations. Any of minimal theory is distal? Okay, this is pretty easy to believe, right? You have like all these sets, they look kind of convex. So if your sequence is following into one of these sets, then of course the middle point works well. Any distal theory is NIP. And of course, stable theories are not distal, right? So if my indiscernible sequence is actually totally indiscernible, then I could just take B to be this middle point, right? And then the middle point will say one equal to B, and then every other point will not equate that. Plenty of not equipment. Right, so thus distality is not preserved under redux, right? Basically, any theory has the infinite set as a redux, but there are also some non-distal redux that are a little bit more interesting than that. But it's still worth sort of studying these non-distal reducts of distal theories, because there are some combinatorial properties of distal theories, some nice combinatorial properties isolated by Sergei and Ardem, that are preserved under redux. Are gender redux. So, you know, in some sense, the question to ask about a theory isn't just whether it's distal, it's also whether it has a distal expansion. Right, so for the remainder of this talk, T is going to be a complete o-minimal L-theory, L some appropriate language. We'll extend the theory of ordered abelian groups, and we can just basically enrich our language by definitions to arrange that T is quantified elimination in the universal exposition. This to be totally true, I have to assume that I have some constant other than zero, but that's not really what happened. zero, but that's not really too much to ask. Okay, and then P is going to be a new unary predicate, and I'll extend my language just by adding this predicate. Right, so a dense pair, introduced by Dana Jews, is a model of T, M, along with the predicate P, picking out a dense elementary, a dense proper elementary substructure of M. It turns out that this predicate always also, if it's dense, it's also going to be codense. So it's picking out a dense. Also, going to be codense. So it's picking out a dense, codense elementary substructure. Natural examples, of course, in the case of just groups, we have the reals with the predicate for the rationals. In the case of fields, we have the real field with the predicate for the real algebraic numbers, right? The real closure of the rationals. And this theory is very nice model theoretically. So it's complete, first of all. It's strongly dependent. It has a minimum of open core. Basically, any sort of defined Open core, basically, any sort of definable set in any model of this theory, if it's open, then it's already definable in the underlying o-minimal structure. And it doesn't have quantifier elimination, but it does have a sort of quantifier reduction. All formulas are equivalent to a Boolean combination of existential formulas, and these existential quantifiers, they just quantify over the protein. So everything's pretty well behaved. However, this theory is not distal. And this is maybe somewhat surprising, although I think the proof of Surprising, although I think the proof of why it's not just pretty illuminating. So, how do you do this? Let's take some indiscernible sequence and some B. These are all just going to be singleton elements. These don't have to be duplicated. I'm going to require that each of these elements is really big compared to all of the elements that come before it, and also compared to this parameter B. So, this DCL of B along with the AJ's, this is an elementary substructure of that. I guess I'm taking DCL with respect to. I guess I'm taking DCL with respect to the underlying language L of the L-minimal theory, although the DCL doesn't change, but that's parasoid of the momentic. Right, I'm going to ask that all of these elements be DCL independent over the predicate. And I'm going to ask that all of these elements except for the one with index zero are DCL independent over the predicate along with this new element. Right? Yeah, so here for the second two points, I say that Two points, I say that Henson discernible. This is a sort of non-trivial fact about types and dense pairs. If you have the same L-type and you're DCL-dependent over the predicate, then you have the same LP type. And then same thing if I add in this parameter B. Right, and then for this middle thing, I'm going to mess up this B indiscernibility of the whole sequence by asking that A0 minus my point B is in the predicate. Minus my point B is in the predicate, right? So, of course, this entire sequence is not the indiscernible. So, this explains why this is not distal. And then, of course, the question, does this have a distal expansion? And if so, what is it? Right, so first I want to make an observation. In the proof of distality, I require that A0 minus B is in this predicate. So, these things have the same image in the quotient M module P of M. Right? So, P of M is, you know, in particular, a. Is, you know, in particular, a dense subgroup. So, yeah, in this quotient, we have the same image. And in the case that T is just the theory of ordered abelian groups, or maybe more generally, the theory of ordered F vector spaces, where I can take F to be any ordered field, Travis knows sort of that the induced structure on this quotient is a pure unordered F vector space. So in particular, this quotient right here is stable. So this is really sort of explaining. So, this is really sort of explaining why distality goes wrong here. Okay, so if we know that this is sort of the reason why distality goes wrong, how can we fix it? Well, here's what Nell did. He just added an ordering to this sort. So first of all, you just throw the sword into your language, and then you throw an ordering on the sword so that the quotient is an ordered face. And then this is just one. Okay, so that's one thing to do, but this doesn't work for arbitrary density. To do, but this doesn't work for arbitrary dense pairs. I mean, maybe you can do something similar for arbitrary dense pairs, but it seems that this only works for these particular case of F vector spaces. Okay, what about a case of fields? Well, back in 1978, Michael Singer showed that the theory of ordered fields with a derivation, a possibly discontinuous derivation, right, with respect to the order, has a model completion. And this is the theory of closed-order differential fields. Of closed-order differential fields. I'm not going to discuss the axioms because I'm going to talk about a generalization on the next slide, and then I'll talk more about the axioms there. These CODFs have quantifier elimination, and Ardem observed that they're distal, right? Once you have quantifier elimination and the definition of distality that I gave on the first slide, it's pretty easy to see that these are distal. And in particular, if you take any one of these things, you take the algebraic closure, the derivation of course extends uniquely, and that's a differentially closed field. And that's a differentially closed field of characteristic CR. So, this is a way of developing distal expansions of DCF-CRL. And then Kubese-Kovacsics and Point observed that these are also a distal expansion of dense pairs, of real closed fields. The constant field, that is, all of the points with derivative zero, this is a dense real-closed subfield proper, of course. So this gives you a distal expansion of dense pairs in the case of just pure real-closed. In the case of just pure real closed ordered fields. And Kubernetes, Covoxics, and Quant, they sort of give a more sort of general framework for other topological fields. For example, you can do this with geodetically closed fields, talk about derivations on those, get some sort of model completion, and then this will be a distal expansion of dense pairs of geodynamically closed fields. So there's other settings in which this works. Right. And so I would. Right, and so I was sort of wondering after seeing this: you know, is there a way that you could do this to handle dense pairs of not just pure real close fields, but minimal expansions? And so with Anton Giulio for Naciero, we generalize this framework. Right, so I'm going to assume that T extends the theory of ordered fields. I'll let M be a model of T. I'm going to introduce a new unary function symbol, delta, and I'll let L delta be. And I'll let L delta be my language extended by this function symbol. And then I'll introduce the theory of t-derivation. So this is the L delta theory, which states that this function delta is a t-derivation. What does it mean? I take any zero-definable function f, which is c1 at some point a, and I'm going to ask that this delta satisfies the chain rule. So that it satisfies the derivative of f of a, it's just the gradient of f at a. It's just the gradient of f at a times the derivative of a, where I'm taking the derivative of a, component rectifies. So in particular, if you apply this definition to, say, the function x plus y or the function x times y, it's very easy to see that these are all derivations. Right? And then let's call one of these t derivations generic. If for any definable map s, now with parameters from my model, Now, with parameters for my model, I define on some open set U. So U is a subset of M to the N, S goes to M to the N. I can always find some A such that delta A is equal to S of A. Right, so this is very similar to the sort of D variety axiomatization for differential closed fields. You assume T is a minimal? I'm assuming that T is a non-minimal theory, yeah. So T is o-minal. Now, in this slide, T is given a non-minimal theory. I know minimal theory extending theory for it, but you could do it with anything closed, right? Sorry? Do it with any theory of topological structures I guess so far? So, yeah, Anton Julia does have a few sort of generalizations for topological structures. The key thing that makes a lot of things work here is that in no minimal structures, everything is very much controlled by the definable functions. Everything's very much controlled by the definable closure. Closure. For arbitrary topological structures, you do, I think, have to do a little bit more work. You have to sort of talk about various C1 manifolds, things like that. And yeah, I think that you have to have a lot of sort of additional assumptions for the next theorem going to state to be true. That the theory T delta plus the axiom stating that delta is generic is the model completion of T delta, right? So that these generic derivations completely axiomatize the model completion. The model completion. Yeah, so you can make sense of this in a broader context, although maybe you have to take care. Unless, for example, you have something like definable scrolling functions like you do in the University. I'll show you all of a C-LOM functions, right? Sorry? In plenty of defensible functions. Yeah, right. Yeah, it helps that. Right, and that sort of leads into the next problem I'm going to talk about. Right, so before I talk about that, let me just state precisely. About that, let me just state precisely. Okay, so we have that this is the model completion. In particular, given my assumptions on t, right, universal x mutation and quantifier elimination, this theory will have quantifier elimination. And from this, we can conclude that it's distal. And before I go into the proof, let me just say that since the kernel is again a dense elementary substructure, right, the kernel is not just a dense real closed field. You can show that the kernel is actually definably closed, so it's an elementary substructure. This gives us. Dimensional substructure, this gives us a distal expansion of the theory T. For T, any unminimal theory in the theory. So, right, here's the proof sketch as to why this is distal. I'm going to take some L delta discernible sequence, and I'm going to assume that I can upgrade everything in the sequence to L delta B and discernibility outside of the middle plane. Sorry, this P is the tenant of delta? Sorry? This T up P, so the predicate. Oh yeah, so Tp is the theory of dense pairs of models of Tp. Right. The kernel of delta is related to P or not? Right, so if I wanted to view this as an expansion of T P, I would interpret P as the kernel of delta. Right, this is a definable sign. When you're checking all this validity, do you is it enough to assume that the als are singletons or are they just double staying? Um I think the zero reduction is checking just uh single tools, right? Die simple task. Right, so, but for this proof to work, they can also be tuples. Right, so I'm taking my discernible sequence. I'm assuming that outside of the middle point, it's the indiscernible. I'm going to let AI start, basically AI along with its derivative, along with its second derivative, and so on and so forth. And it doesn't hurt to extend my parameter set B so that it's closed under this derivation. Vision. Then this sequence Ai star is still L delta B indiscernible. In particular, it's L B indiscernible. Or sorry, I should say it's still L delta indiscernible. In particular, it's L indiscernible. And then apart from the middle point, it's L B indiscernible. And then, so the whole sequence is L B indiscernible. And this is just using that my O minimal theory T is distal. Right? And then to finish. Right, and then to finish off, it's very easy. We just use, as a consequence of this quantifier elimination, that every L delta formula C is equivalent, modulibus theory, to some L formula C along with some number of derivatives plugged in there. So as long as I sort of extend my sequence by these derivatives, I really just have to sort of check the L formula. Okay. Right, but of course a key aspect in making this work, not necessarily the proof, but Work, not necessarily the proof, but the sort of definitions involved is that when I have a non-minimal expansion of a field, the partial derivatives of definable functions are themselves definable. So it's really unclear how to proceed when my theory does not extend the theory of fields. Except as I was writing up this talk, I was sort of thinking, is there any sort of way to say something outside of this case? And the sort of, I guess, trivial observation occurred to me that if I consider, once again, just the theory of Consider once again just the theory of ordered vector spaces, take a model of this theory, and then just consider delta to be an F linear now, then this same sort of condition for t derivations is satisfied. The derivative of f of a is the gradient of f at a times the derivative of a, right? This is just because all the definable functions are basically just f-linear functions. So this is pretty just sort of an observation. And then again, you can sort of define this definition of being generic, right? This definition of being generic, right? So, all definable maps, these are basically just F linear maps, except maybe with some additional parameters thrown in. And for all defined on some open set U, I can find some points with delta A equals S of A. And then it's very easy to show, just using basically the same proof as in the Field's case, that the theory of these ordered F vector spaces with a generic F linear map, these form the model completion of ordered F vector spaces. Of ordered F vector spaces with an arbitrary F-linear map, and so it has quantified elimination. It's distal, and then of course the kernel of this thing is the dense proper of subscribers. So this sort of gives a different proof from the proof that Chavez gave that these things have a distal expansion. Somehow reduced the general case now in the more open case. Right, so I was thinking about this. I haven't checked all the details yet. But yeah, it seems possible that you could sort of say, okay, well, if you have enough field structure, you can do the field trick. If somewhere else, Do the field trick. If somewhere else you're just basically a peer group, then you can do a peer vector space that can do that. So, yeah, there might be some way to sort of patch things together to get things to work, and that might be definitely something worth looking into. Right, and exactly, yeah. So, remaining questions, of course, is the intermediate case. Maybe that's a good way to handle it. However, I do think that this approach is in some ways a little bit maybe mysterious or maybe a little bit ad hoc. It would be nice to sort of find a more Sort of find a more clear way to find distal expansions without taking this sort of ad hoc approach. And this approach also has a few deficiencies. One deficiency, okay, this is all at the level of theories, theories having distal expansions. It doesn't really work at the level of models. Not every model of the theory of dense pairs admits an expansion to a model of this T delta G. For example, For example, if I take, say, the rationals iodon, pi, or any other transcendental number, take the real closure, and then consider the dense pair where my predicate is picking out just the real closure of the rationals. This admits no expansion to a model of CODF. For sort of the same reason that Zoe was talking about with the non-minimality of differential closures, right? You have, in any CODF, or any DCF, say, the big field has infinite transcendence degree over the constant field. Infinite transcendence degree over the constant field. And of course, this just has transcendence degree of one. So there's sort of no way to turn this specific structure into a model of T delta G. Now Travis's approach actually does do this, right? You can take any dense pair of F vector spaces and then just add this quotient sorting to be ordering. So that's sort of an advantage of that approach. So does every model of Tp have this sort of mention? Another sort of deficit maybe is that this theory, T delta G is not strong. This theory, T delta G is not strongly dependent. As I said, the theory of dense pairs is. Does T P have a strongly dependent distal expansion? I'm not sure if the expansion that Javis comes up with is strongly dependent or not. He doesn't say in his paper. I wouldn't be surprised if it was, but I'm not sure. Right, and then there's one more sort of related piece of work in this area. Alan Garrett and Travis Nell, in 2020, they found yet another distal expansion. They found yet another distal expansion of dense pairs of F-lector spaces. And the sort of advantage of this expansion is that it also defines a dense DCO-independent set of H. Right? In the case of just set vector spaces, DCO independent is the same as F linearly independent. But you can make this definition for any sort of polyminimal theory. And in fact, Deutsche Mo and Steinhardt did. They consider They consider low-minimal structures where the predicate is picking out a dense DCL-independent subset. Hieronym and Nell showed that these are not distal. And so the question is, do these structures have distal expansions? Garrett and Nell answered this positively, like I said, for the case of F-vector spaces. And there's one sort of interesting feature about these things. Okay, as I said with tense pairs, the sort of lack of distality is hiding in this quotient sort where you quotient by the predicate. By the predicate. This theory T delta G actually eliminates imaginary. So you might sort of naively think, well, okay, once I get rid of these imaginaries, maybe things will go okay. These H structures already eliminate imaginaries. So you can't just use some sort of trick like that, like playing with the imaginary sorts to get rid of this non-vistality. So yeah, do these age structures have these sorts functions? So I think that's another question. And I don't really know of a natural way outside of the way they do, just sort of. They just sort of add some extra structure that's still distal and that has these H structures as a reduction. So if you take an H structure, if you take the definable closure of H, doesn't it give you a dense? Right, yeah. So once you take the definable closure of H, yeah, you get a... You think you get a dense pair? You get a dense pair in this way, right. But then you can't sort of recover this H from the dense pair, I don't believe. From the dense pair, I don't believe. No, no, no, no, no. So, and I mean, it's the same sort of, yeah, so you could say, like, you know, and say T delta G, there's some sort of dense independent set working in there, of course, but I don't know of any formula that can pick that up. I wouldn't be surprised if the sphere T delta G doesn't define a dense independent set. Okay, that's everything I wanted to say. Thank you. Are there any more questions? Can I ask, so is it known whether even every completion of TP 90 or yeah, TP is complete and strongly dependent. Oh, it's complete. Yeah. You'll see. What if you take a group interval? Sorry? Group interval. A group interval? It's like a partial functional interval, just take a group and restrict two interval. And the district integral or its ominous structure, take the L square. It does have a distinct function. Um yeah, I'm not sure. But do you know if the sort of good combat foil properties would be a reduct, do they work in this cube, for example? The structure here, which might not be a reduct of a distal. Not be a reductive, but does still um do some of the nice consequences still work with some of the cover? Um they do, right? Aren't they all just consequences that they make a question? I don't know much about it, but do you have an example of an infinite structure that does not have an abistol expansion? Yeah, so say algebraic closed fields of characteristic P. That seems to be the main example, of course. Example. Of course, anything that's not NIP will not be distal or have a distal expansion at all. And I think there's one more example involving graphs, I think, right? LPs. There's one more example. Right, yeah. But it seems like all of the sort of examples inside of NIP where you don't know if there's a distal expansion involve these combinatorial properties from the fit failure. Do we have a way of comparing? Do we have a way of comparing the distal expansions to say that one is better than another? Of course, we can talk about one's a redux of another one, but is there some sense in which something which comes from a derivation might be versal test mux match or functional? Awesome, minimal or maximum. Right, I mean, you can sort of, I mean, for example, you could add, we have some sort of model completion where you Completion where you have two commuting derivations, or you know, multiple commuting derivations, and these are all distal as well, so that would be the history of the literary distal structure. As far as the minimal distal is matching, not sure there's a. I would somehow be, I mean, I guess this is sort of related to the question of, is there a sort of a less ad hoc way to do this? Maybe there's some very sort of quick way to sort of get rid of the thing that's keeping it from being discovered like that. The thing that's keeping it from doing is to all that. My guess would be that the theory of equality has a compatible minimal distorted function. What do you mean by completely compatible? Neither is definable. I think at this point, we'll be working. So let's thank Elliot again. And we resume in seven minutes. Yeah, so they're somewhere.
