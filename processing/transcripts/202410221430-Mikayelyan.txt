Yesterday, after the first day, I realized that my talk is not really fitting well to the environment. So I made some changes. So I will be a bit quick in what I plan to talk about, and then I will talk about the other problem, which is Problem which is Manfort Shah minimization. So basically, the talk will be about two papers we've done with Jillin. So the classical rearrangement problems, optimal rearrangement problems are formulated as follows. Think about the stationary heat equation. Equation. So you assume that after some time the you have this, like you don't have the dt term. So you have the Poisson problem. And let's take the boundary conditions just constant. And you want to optimize something with respect to your input F. Your input F. So think about F is like your external heat, and U is the distribution of the heat in the room. So you might be interested in minimization of the gradient of U. Like you want the temperature be equally distributed, right? Simple problem. And then where do you take your F from? Like you fix your Like you fix your electricity bill, so you fix the integral of F, and of course, your heating body or your air conditioning has the maximum temperature or minimum temperature. So, this is like your F is bounded. So, then you wanna optimize. The gradient square of so for each f you get an heat distribution uf, and then you want to minimize or maximize the function the gradient u square, for example, right? So this is a old classical problem analyzed by Jeffrey Burton in Bath University and. And yeah, so you in order to be able to solve this problem, you want to relax it first of all. So instead of f so usually your f is a 0, 1 function, but you need to consider the weak star closure of it. So you get all functions f. So we normalize it with maximum is 1 between 0 and 1 with given integral, right? Very simple. Right, very simple, and then this problem has been solved, very classical from the 70s. So it says that you can put your F basically close to the boundary, and your solution will be constant somewhere where f is zero and f will be one. And f will be one in this color neighborhood of the boundary. So this is the minimization problem. And well, so this is just a second, yeah. And then if you consider the function, if you turn this, so this is the maximum value alpha. So if you consider the function capital U equals u minus. capital U equals U minus, sorry, alpha minus U, you basically turn this plate upside down, then you get the solution of the classical obstacle problem, which gives you the tool to solve this problem, right? You consider the obstacle problem and then you play with this value up and down. Value up and down until the ratio of the coincidence set and the whole omega gives you the right value, and this is the solution. Very simple, very classical. And then the maximization problem is also solved. You get the so-called unstable obstacle problem, which says that you should put all your Put all your f somewhere in the middle, and then your solution would look like that. So, yeah, so minus la plus u equal f. So, it's one here and zero here. So, other way around, this gives you the maximizer. Before going forward, because from the point of view of heat equation, this of course does not make much sense. Not make much sense. Who cares? Like everybody knows how to heat a room. So where does this problem come from? This problem comes from originally from like Jeffrey Burton got interested in this was fluid dynamics. Because if you have a two-dimensional ideal fluid, right, then you know. Then you know that the material derivative of the vorticity is zero, right? So you don't create vorticity. So this means vorticity, and because the fluid is incompressible, vorticity has the same distribution function. So then now, okay. Now, okay, now, of course, it's different notation. So if u is the like just a second, so gradient u curved will be the velocity field, right? Velocity field and u will be the potential, right? So then. So then, and La plus of u minus La plus of U will be the vorticity. So the problem boils down to you have the vorticity, distribution of the vorticity, and you need to maximize or minimize the kinetic energy. So, and then it turns out that if you put the vorticity You put the vorticity close to the boundary, you get the minimal kinetic energy, and if you put it in the center, you get the maximum kinetic energy. So, this is like about the history of the problem. Now, what problem we considered? We considered the constraint problem. Now, if you think about Going back to the heat equation, it's very natural to consider. This is like a real picture from some Swedish company which produce furnaces. It makes sense to consider the heaters, like heating elements, which do not depend on the Z variable. So here you see that you have some heating elements. That you have some hitting elements and look like they do not depend on the value of f does not depend on the z variable, right? And you consider the same problem. So you minimize the gradient of f, your input is f, which does not depend on the z variable. So usually if something depends on less variables, things get more. Less variables, things get more easy. So I considered this problem in 2017-18 and it turns out you can solve it. Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, the minimizer is not a zero-one function. You get the analog of the obstacle problem where the obstacle is acting on the integral of u. Okay? So you have this functional. So instead in the classical case, if your minimizer is, I mean in the classical obstacle problem, you have what? You have gradient of u squared. Gradient of u squared plus 2u plus dx over omega, right? Here, your obstacle is acting on the function v, which is the integral of u in the z variable. Okay, so I mean, for some reason, we consider cylindrical domains, doesn't have to be, but makes sense. Have to be, but makes things a bit easy. And as you will see, that even with constant boundary data, there are some open problems yet with this very simple functional. So you have a function u, which is which has constant boundary data, and the function v is the integral of u in z direction, so it gives you a function. Direction. So it gives you a function defined in the domain D. And you minimize this function. So the minimizer, so we can show that similar to the obstacle problem now, the quantity obstacle is acting on is not diving below zero. Not diving below zero, so it's large equals zero, and then you get this PDE for the function u, which I remember when I first show it to Jilin, he said this is a non-everything equation. Because you have right-hand side is discontinuous, this continuity is non-local because it is defined by function v, which is the integral of. Which is the integral of u, and then on the top of that, you have here the Richland Eumann operator. You have the normal derivative of u on the on the top of your cylinder. So, this is the PD we get and uh And but the like I mean it's not a very bad functional because it's convex at the end so it has unique minimizer but then surprisingly the comparison principle failed to hold for functions u. For functions u. So, if you have two minimizers of this functional, so which have constant boundary data and one constant is larger than another constant, so the minimizers are not like one larger than another. And then there was a wrong proof in the original paper that the comparison principle is true for the function. Is true for the functions v for the integral of u but then we found a mistake and we worked very hard with Michel Shipot from Surich, but we couldn't get it done. We got some results in that direction. And then, yeah, so we we have proven that this would be equivalent to some conditions we will still cannot prove. Yeah. Still cannot prove, yeah. So, but then I ask Jillene whether we can try to verify because we got some doubts whether this is true or not, and then whether we can do some numerical simulations, and he kindly agreed. And yeah, this is how the solutions look like. And actually, I must say that now we are working on the Now we are working on the C11 regularity of the solutions. And from the math point of view, it's challenging, but it looks like it should be true. But from this picture, actually, it looks not very much like this should be the case. I mean, so we are not sure. But anyway, so then with Jilin, we tried some methods and it Some methods and it was not working. It didn't work well because you don't have comparison principles, so the algorithm was not converging with all these advanced finite elements. So we were almost hopeless. And then we decided to try just finite difference method, something very simple. And it worked out. And it worked out. So, what we do is we first take initial guess f is one and then we solve, we find u and then we compute the right hand side for u and then we update f and so this gives us convergence. Convergence. So we get good order, and then the comparison principle is verified. So we have the like we compute the minimum of the difference of these for different boundary values, and this is almost like always the half of the iteration error. Half of the iteration error. So, this is a pretty good indication that it's true. Good. So, as like free boundary problem, of course, the main question is free boundary regularity, but this should be not a very hard problem because, in many cases, I mean, the Cases, I mean, the function v satisfies this classical obstacle equation with h being this function. And for constant boundary values, you can prove that h is strictly larger than zero. And then it follows from the classical results by Ivan Blank. And in general, you can cook up boundary data such that Such that h is zero, and in this case, you know that the free boundary might be degenerate. So, this is something we work on. And yeah, again, so there are quite some open problems, the comparison principles for V and then C11 regularity, and the general, like more subtle cases with pre-boundary regularity. Boundary regularity. Okay, so this was the first problem. I'm right on time, so these are like the papers. And then let me talk about the other problem, which I added yesterday. So this is a bit more older research, which is about Mount Forschell function. So this is our first joint work with Jillin, where we started when we were in Sujo. When we were in Sujo. So, I mean, people who work with Mauforsha functional for sure know this picture. I mean, the original picture is a bit bigger. This lady is in a swimming suit, but I was giving this talk in Iran, so I had to customize it for local audience. Okay, so we have Okay, so we have this functional where you have that input age. H is your raw data of your image, and you want to approximate it with function u, which should be smooth. So you have this smoothing term gradient power 2, and then you have this term which takes care of the like boundaries between different objects and interfaces. So, but actually, this phenomena is very old. It's been known from 1921 when Alan Griffith, for the first time, explained how the energies work with cracks. And the problem we consider is: I mean, here in this problem, you don't need to prescribe the boundary values because you have these. Boundary values because you have these terms. So you must approximate H. So we get rid of this term because this is not relevant for the regularity, as one can see. But then we have to introduce boundary condition in order to have non-trivial solutions, otherwise it will be constant. So you have boundary conditions, and then you want to minimize the. Conditions and then you want to minimize the Richlet energy plus the set of discontinuities. So, if you increase this continuity, the Dirichlet energy is, of course, decreasing. So, there is a trade-off between these two terms. So, this is how a minimizer can look like. So, this is a real minimize. So, this is where the function is discontinuous. So, you have the length of this interval and then plus the energy. So, this is a classical problem, has been known. Here's a classical problem, has been known like was intensive research in this direction since 80s. And yeah, so you can find this very nice first variation formula in the book of Ambrosio. And then from this formula, you derive the first order conditions. So what are those? So outside the discontinuity set, the function is harmonic, right? Harmonic, right? On two sides of the discontinuity set, you have the normal derivative zero. Now, if you move the discontinuity set, you will get that the curvature of the discontinuity set equals the jump of the gradient on both sides. And then on the track tip, you have these asymptotic. Have this asymptotic expansion. So that, I mean, this is the function imaginary value of the square root of z in complex functions. So that the asymptotic expansion at the crack tip at the end of this continuity set is a constant times square root of z can be seen relatively easy. And then here the point is that this coefficient must be square root. Coefficient must be square root over pi. Okay. And these were the four known Euler-Lagrange conditions until me and my co-author, John Anderson, we realized that there should be a missing Euler-Lagrange condition. And in the academic community, the reaction was not very friendly. Not very friendly. So people said, you know, it's known since the 80s, and there is no way there is anything like serious missing. So it took some time to do this research. And yeah, so these are the global solutions. So it's either you have two constants on both sides of the two different sides of the plane. Two different sides of the plane, or you have triple junction, which 60 180 degrees and three constants. And this is the, in some sense, this is the most important global solution, the crack tip. Why is that? Because the crack tip, if you take the crack tip, like so you have discontinuity on the negative half axis, and half axis and here you have square root 2 over pi and let me write imaginary part of square root of z so if you if you take a ball br and compute the energies in this ball right the two energies yeah the Dirichlet energy of you and the length of the discontinuity set this is This is the only case when they scale of the same order, r to the power one. In all other cases, the situation is dominated by the discontinuity set. And that's why all the minimal surface methods work to prove the regularity. So before these results, Before these results, the spiraling was not excluded, for example. That the crack tip can look like a spiral was not excluded because you had no nice energy estimates to control the rotation of projections. And so, this is the definition we use for the crack tip. So, if you have a minimizer, we say that it is epsilon. That it is epsilon close to the track tip if you have just this kind of Division energy or like yeah the square of the gradient bounded by epsilon and here we also consider the possible spiral so what we prove is Is that if you have a crack tip, then your minimizer is actually so if you have attractive, you have two parabolas here, which are like it's like more than parabola, right? Power two plus alpha. Right, power two plus alpha, so your crack is between these two, and this means that the curvature is zero at the cracked house. So, this is where we started, because if you go back, so this is your condition, right? This is your condition that the curvature of the discontinuity set equals the jump of the gradients. So, if you are sitting on this discontinuity, So, if you are sitting on this discontinuity set and you are approaching the cracked, then you have here infinity minus infinity discontinuity equation. And then first we have proven asymptotic expansion close to the cracked. And then we have seen that the limit can be either infinity or zero. And And for some reason, we were very suspicious about the possibility of having infinity at the crack tip because you know the minimal surface wants to make curvature zero. The crack tip is where you have complete freedom to move left and right. So why, for God's sake, should it choose to be infinity? So it was very unnatural. So Yeah, so this is our result. For some reason, it's unpublished, but we got recognition. Some famous guys put our name in the title of their paper from Princeton. So then we decided to focus on the 3D case. Yeah, this is. But before we have proven this, when it was still a conjecture, I have a proof. I have approached Jillene to check whether we can verify it. And of course, it's very hard to do numerics close to the crack tip because it has been proven that if you have a circle and then you put the boundary values of this. You put the boundary values of this function, and then you take the half circle, then this is the absolute minimizer. You cannot get it better. Now we perturb these boundary values a little bit, and we want to find the correct position of the craft tip, like where precisely the crack tip should be. And again, because of this equation that the curve. This equation that the curvature is getting this singularity infinity minus infinity, it's very hard to do the numerical simulations. So to solve this problem, we decided to look at the conformal mapping. So you consider the problem, you can you Problem: you shift your origin into this point and you do the conformal mapping square root of z with this discontinuity slit. So you get this picture. And now what do we have? We have that the function was harmonic here. So the image function will be harmonic here. You have the Neumann derivative zero condition here, so you will keep it. So you will keep it. Then you have the you have this condition. This is the most important part. So the condition that the coefficient of square root of z is given here change to the gradient equals 2 over pi. And okay, what is a bit more complicated and kind of user-un-friendly in some User-un-friendly in some sense is the condition that the jump of the gradient gives you the curvature. Now, these one change to this equation. So basically, you have here curvature and some first-order terms. But the good news is that for the computer, these two conditions are just some second-order, first-order terms. So it's something you can do, something you can. You can do something you can compute. So, what we do now is for the perturbation, we take some region here, and for all points in this region, we solve the problem of finding optimal crack with prescribed crack tip. Okay, so we prescribe crack tip here, we solve it, then we prescribe another. It then we prescribe another cracket and then we solve it, right? And so, okay, so how we solve it? We solve all Euler-Lagrange equations which would correspond to the prescribed tractip. And this would be, let me be a bit fast here. So here, so you have like Laplace is zero, you have the Neumann derivative is zero, and then you have. Is zero and then you have this curvature. So the coefficient at the crack tip is something which will get as a result. So we cannot guarantee that it will have the right value. But the first three conditions will determine the optimal track connecting the boundary point where the boundary value has discontinuity with the prescribed tract. Describe practice. And these simulations worked surprisingly, like convergence was surprisingly fast. Now, what we do is now we need to compute. First, we need to compute the Dirichlet energy. And the Dirichlet energy does not change in conformal mapping. You know, if you apply conformal mapping, the Dirichlet energy. The D-Reclaim energy is not changing, and in the image, you don't have any singularity, right? So, you can compute pretty accurate. Then, you need to compute the length of the crack. So, these we can do in the original image. So, we transform back with z equal z square, and then we compute the length of the crack in the original corner. Length of the crack in the original coordinates. And then we want to compute the stress intensity factor, which again we can compute pretty accurately because it's a gradient U in the origin, right? So just a second. Yeah. So this is how the energy looks like. So in the so in the because it's a square like like a parabola like energy so for the mesh size one over 100 we got just two points moved from the origin which is pretty accurate but the important picture is this one so this is the stress intensity factor so this is the okay so this is this was our this is this was our main argument for the for showing that there is a missing oil lagrange condition so if you consider all possible cracks okay so you you prescribe crack here then you find optimal one here and then you another one and another one so it is not hard to see that is uh if you measure is if you measure the coefficient in front of the imaginary part of the square root of z term right at this point then it's going to be decreasing and then we see that here numerically so this is the positive x-axis this is y axis so there is an interface here on which you have this stress Have the stress intensity factor equal exactly two over pi. Here we have the normalized version, so it's the value one. Okay, so this means if you cut longer, then making the crack shorter will be more optimal. And then if you stop here, then it is better to continue, right? This is the variation in the tangential direction and. And then our argument was that on this set, all these cracks satisfy all four previously known Euler-Lagrange conditions. But at least for the one case, we know that only one of them is the absolute minimizer. So there should be a missing first order condition because, you know, at the beginning, they were saying that, you know, maybe there is a second order condition. Maybe there is a second-order condition, but there is no way that there is a first-order condition missing. So, here you see that there is a first-order condition missing, and actually, this is also not surprising because nobody has done variation in the orthogonal direction. So, variation when you cut longer or cut shorter have been done, and this is where you get the stress intensity factor condition. And then we measure now for all these. We measure now for all these tracks. We measure, let's say, that it's actually a coefficient, like C2 is a certain coefficient in the asymptotic expansion, but you can think of it as a curvature of the crack tip. So these are like the location of all possible crack tips. Okay, so on this interface, you have the stress intensity. Stress intensity factor or this coefficient in front of the square root of z. So here's the normalized version, so equal to one. So this is the right. So all these possible choices of crack tips would give the four conditions satisfied. And then we make the curve for the crack tips where the curvature is zero. And we claim that. And we claim that the intersection will give us the minimizer. And then we compare that with the minimal energy and we get it confirmed that it's indeed of order, which is needed. So this was done before we got the proof. But I think this gives us also a pretty accurate tool in. Accurate tool in two dimensions for finding the location. Maybe just a few minutes about the situation in 3D. So, in a joint paper with Antoine Le Menant, we found this family of stationary solutions, which are not minimizers. This is where you add to the crack tip just the linear function in z. But this gives But this gives insight into a possible missing condition, possible missing condition in 3D, which is, so we minimize for, we add this delta on the boundary, we minimize, and we find something like a torsion of the crack front being. Being related to this delta. So if you increase delta, then at a certain moment it breaks in the middle. But for small delta, you see this rotation, which is probably the missing condition in 3D, which we have no idea about what it looks like. Yeah, sorry. So is it? I'm done. Yeah, thank you.
