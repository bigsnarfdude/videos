Okay, so the work that we will present is devoted to a joint collaboration with Lena Alvin from University of Kansas and Richard Smith from University of Lab. So the problem that we study, which is still in progress, is a differential inclusion that arises in the context of founding effective coefficients for effective conditions. Well, effective conductivities for a polycrystalline material. It's mainly a differential inclusion call. Now, this kind of problem, bounding effect coefficients in general, were mainly started in the 80s, 90s, I think. But at that time, all the techniques and tools that are available now for automatic creation were not available this time. So I hope that in steady progress this would be interesting to learn about this possibility to try and address these cancer problems. Okay, so let me start by recording some definitions that I assume, I guess, that most of you, not all of you, are familiar with this, but I do. So Q is unit Q in R D, D will be 3, okay? And sigma is represented on the typical material. And it's a random infinity matrix field, symmetric, by different models. We extend it to the and it's uh uh uniformly analytic, meaning that for almost uh reacts, it's quite fun. This for every C in Can Army. Okay. The effective conductivity is defined in the following way. Sigma star is a constant matrix. Sigma, value, W plus C. C and the X over unit Q, and we minimize overall U that are Q periodic, W12 periodic. The magicity value Q. And we can drive this in a vectorial form by taking two vectors at the same time, and in the vectorial form, this And in the vectorial form this so A is a matrix. You can write the trace of A sigma star A dash post as the infuum of the integral of so now let's derive like this Q number sigma du transposed Q Q over all u, which are maps, valued in RP in W12, periodic, and plus affine of the boundary. So A for me like S to the KX is the affine line. Okay, I guess it will recognize this for us. So sigma star is the effective conductivity and it measures the overall conductivity. And it measures the overall conductivity of the material whose local, whose point-wise conductivity is determined by C. But overall, this composite material behaves like a homogeneous material with conductivity, constant conductivity. Okay. And you will recognize that this is the self-formula associated with the effective limit. Associated with the effective limit of elliptic equations with periodic oscillating coefficients. In fact, this is the G limit of this kind of problem. Emergence C by solar epsilon right into epsilon. We know that for every f plus 0, for every f in h minus 1, we all know that the solution. That the solution, perhaps in this problem, converges quickly to U nodes, in W12, H1, to the solution of a similar problem, where denser is the vertice of sigma star right. Okay, so this happens for where we have in each point one. And in fact, one has also the convergence of sigma module epsilon within the two. My module epsilon within two sigma star projects. Okay, this is just to put together all the things that are related to this object. Okay, so we say that sigma epsilon g controls to sigma star, and this is why we call the g closure the range of all possible sigma star that we obtain by letting sigma vary in Vary in a certain subset of n infinity. So let me find G-closure of sigma is the range of sigma star as sigma varies with a certain subset of any field. And characterizing the And characterizing the range of sigma star is a classical problem, but mostly unsolved. So the complete description of the G plot is no known in very few cases. So that's not a function of sigma, you g of y, right? Well, I will tell you now geo sigma, what it is. I mean, sequence sigma of x, so this is not precise. I will show you some examples, so examples. What do we mean by the range of sigma? So the range of sigma star. Okay, sigma could be, for example, a mixture of isotropic phases. So it could be a magnet sphere of this form, alpha by identity. So say n isotropic phases, multiple of the identity, where the The identity where the volume fractions of the characteristic functions are prescribed. Okay, so the sum of Pi is one, which is the volume of the unit cubic. And what does it mean to understand the range of sigma star? To understand it as sigma varies when key varies. Okay, so we let ki varies among all possible measurable duty functions of measurable substance. functions of measurable substitute PQ and for each choice we have a sigma star. So here G of sigma will be G of alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha n, P1, P2, Pn. Okay? So this is a bit obvious notation. Another example is the case of polycrystals that we are, which is the case that we are interested in. So polycrystal means that the principle Polycrystal means that the principal conductivity of the material are fixed, not vary, as in this case. Well, they vary according to where I am. Well, here they are fixed, but the orientation of the crystal may change from point to point. So the crystals are objects of this parallel, sigma one, sigma D. So this is diagonal, the diagonal part. Diagonal, the diagonal part are the vector, where this is a matrix with valid rotations. This is a rotation amongst the real. And we can also have the union of two-body crystals. So sigma could be this, or could be another matrix like this, but with a different set of eigenvalues. And even more, we can have as many as we wish. Many as we wish. Okay? So this is for equals. Okay, so in this case, what is the G-closure? The G-closure will depend on sigma 1, sigma 2. Okay? And there is no volume fraction described here. And you see that the geoclosure are notation environments. So what we are really interested in are the eigenvalues of sigma star. Values of sigma star. So the G-closure is a subset of Rt. It's a compact subset of Rt. And it's the subset of all possible any values of the sigma star. Okay, now let me give you some reference so the first bound Bound for isotropic mixtures. So, the first case were given to the seminal paper by Ashin and Strickno in 62. Okay. Then significance above. Then significant advancements were made in the eighties by Uri and Partal, always in the context of isotropic extra file, and in particular they set the problem in the framework of compensated compactness. And from the same years there are also works by Julio Scherkau, Maybe I should die first. Okay, this is far from being a complete. I'm just mentioning some relevant details. Okay? Okay, let me tell you when the G-closure is known, it's completely characterized. The re-interclass characterizes the G-closure of two isotropic phases in dimension two. So this is the case of. So this is the case of sigma x equals to alpha 1 p i plus alpha 1 minus identity with a prescribed volume for 2. So the q closure in this case is an object practice where these extremal points have coordinates given by the Coordinates given by the harmonic and arithmetic mean of one. And another case where the G-closure is known is the case of polycrystals, always in dimension two, one polycrystal and two polycrystals. And this results due to G, Frankfort and Zura. So K T S and how does the declosure look like? In the case of one polycrystal, the declosure in direction 2 is very simple. This can be obtained in a very simple way because the determinant of sigma star is equal to the determinant of C. Star is equal to the terminal sigma, which is a number, so it's a portion of an ebb. While for two polycrystals, two polycrystals, two polycrystals are, it means that sigma of x picks values is color values. It could be R T alpha one and for two R or it could be could be B Q P beta one beta two Q and R Q in the English coefficients. Okay? And here, the G clauder, but without prescribing, fixing the volume fraction, is an object like this. Okay, and to my knowledge, these are the only cases where there is a complete characterization of the G plus. In other cases, there might be a partial character. In other cases, there might be a partial. So, the problem that we look at is the case of a three-dimensional polycrystal. So, one polycrystal in dimension 3. Now move to the easiest. Okay, so Okay, so this is the object of this time. R of x, sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3, three positive number, and assume that we are all different, okay? Then I will say something about the case when two of these coincide, okay? Okay, so the first results about polycrystal are a view to All right, Nida, Shetkaev, Juria Ninton 18. Okay, what did they do? They prove a lower bound on sigma star. So they took the following lower bound. lower bound. So the determinant of sigma star minus theta squared, the trace of sigma star minus 2 theta is larger than or equal to 0, where theta is positive and it's the unit positive solution of the following equation. The terminal sigma minus theta squared salt squared. theta squared, sorry squared trace of sigma minus 2 theta equal to 0. Okay so you take theta, the unit positive solution of this equation. So this is an equation of 30 blue, right? Same here. With this Maurice Mattus matrix product, this is the sum. You put it here You put it here, and this gives you a bound. So, what kind of bound is it? So, all sigma 1, 2, 3 star that belongs to the geoglosure, which is a subset of RT, must satisfy this. And It means that you said it, but this isn't necessary. I will tell you. No, no, this is necessary to be in digital closure. And now what we will see is when this bound is obtained. This is the power problem. This is necessary to be in digital closure. We will study the case when the bound is obtained, which corresponds to. Obtained, which corresponds to sigma star being on the boundary of the G-corporate. Okay? Okay, so let's make a picture. Let's do a picture. There are elementary bounds on sigma star which are the following. This can be easily proved by using the ellipticity of sigma. Okay, this is always true. And it's also true that the trace of sigma star is less than or equal to the trace of sigma, okay? To the phase of sigma. So this means that the declosure is inside a cube. Which cube? This cube. This point will be sigma 1, sigma 1, sigma 1. Okay? And the length of the sides is sigma 3 minus sigma 1. Okay, I will not find everything. I will investigate. I will mess it up. And so the geography is inside here. And what is this? This is a plane that cuts the cube in these points. Okay, this is an hexagon. Okay, so this is the plane trace of sigma star equal to sigma 1 plus sigma 2 plus sigma 2. So the G closure is below this hexagon. So lies inside the portion of So lies inside the portion of the cube that is below this hexagon. And what is this cubic expression? What does it say? If I put the equality there, that's the equation of a surface, which is a convex surface lying below this hexagon. Now in order to make a picture, I have to rotate this. So let me do this. So this is here. This hexagon is this style. And what is that surface? It's something like this. It's a convex surface that intersects the hexagon only at the vertices. Okay? It's like this. So the g-closure is between this plane, this hexagon, and this surface. And this surface. Those guys also proved that all these points are attainable, so they belong to the G-closure. But they left open the question of the attainability of the bound. So are there points on this surface that belong, that actually belong to each closure? This question was answered later, but let me tell you first, because it's useful to understand the origin. To understand the origin of our multiffension inclusion, where this bound comes from. So, in order to prove this bound, they considered the following quadratic form. So, the quadratic form that depends on sigma and t, which is the following. It's the phase of f sigma f transpose minus twice t, the second invariant of Second invariant of f. So this part here, you recognize, it's the integrand of our energy, the one that we are minimizing to define sigma star. And we add this quasi-affine function. This is a non-larg function. E to r this is the second invariant of f. You write again? It's hard to see what you've written at the edge of the word. Can I deny it? Yes. So Q of F sigma and T is the trace of F sigma F transpose minus twice T the second invariant of the matrix F. Okay? They prove that this quadratic form, this is a quadratic form, is Strictly positive definite for every t between zero and this theta. Okay? While for t equals theta, this is positive semi-definite. So this is the way that theta is shown. And what does it say? If we look at our variational problem, it says the following thing that we were So we were trying to understand the algebra, right? Maybe star transposed, this is the mean form of du sigma du transposed, okay to be larger than twice theta the second requirement only. Why? Because this is a quasi-affine. Because this is a quasi-affine function, it's an allograph, you can move it inside. And this becomes the second invariant of the dragon. And this is positive semi-defense. And this gives this part, positive star. Okay? Well, now, later, I guess now I can arrange. Then in our work, Mikhail and Macy proved that this bound that we call sigma star is actually a tax. So this is not a little too lazy. Okay, so they prove that the bound star is a. bound star is attained by a certain class of polycrystalline materials. And how do they prove this? So let's look at the equality. This equal to this. This means that this quadratic form, when evaluated by f equal to the gradient of u. That f equals the gradient of u is zero. Okay, so this means that the gradient of u pointwise is an eigenvector of the linear map of the matrix associated to this quadratic form. This is du, right? With m which is 9 by 9 m. So du, in order for the equality to hold, du must Quality to hold, du must be an eigenvector of m corresponding to zero and m. Okay? And this gives a differential inclusion that I like. So this means that sigma gradu minus theta trace of the u. So this is the condition of being an in vector with silver boundary. Identity. Identity plus theta t. It's easy to deduce this because this is the derivative of the quadratic form. So you take the derivative of this and this is the u. And from here, we deduce that the gradient of u must be of this form. Should be the trace of gradient of u times These times R of X, then here I have S one, S two, S three, and I will tell you what they are, R of X, so this comes from here, okay. The slice button from here. but move from here where Si are given by Si is equal to theta divided theta plus sigma i plus 2 modulus 3. So, the gradient of units, a solution of this differential inclusion, must be as a solution of this differential inclusion if this equality holds okay. Quality holds. Okay. If such, so what is the differential inclusion? That the gradient of U should belong to the set K that is defined as rotation, lambda, scalar, can be any real lambda, rotation and then this diagonal matrix rotation with lambda R and R in essence. In a solution. If such a solution exists, then you take A equal the average of the gradient of U and you obtain the corresponding sigma star. And the corresponding sigma star will be on this surface. And the formula for sigma star is the following. Sigma star is the following. It's theta times the identity minus s star, I will tell you what s star is, s star to the minus 1, where s star is equal to the average of u divided by the case of u. Okay? So, summarizing. So summarizing, if there exists a solution of this differential inclusion, then sigma star is a point on the boundary of the G closure. So it's a realizable effective conductivity. Okay? So, and introducing uh these uh these matrices, I call this S. I call this S, okay uh call this S of X, okay. And the S star is very convenient because by the choice of theta, the trace of S is equal to 1. Okay? And same for S star. So this is equal also to the trace of S star. So while our sigma star lives on a curved surface, Leaves on a curved surface, this guy here lives on a plane, which is the plane of the unit trace, trace equal to pi. This is much easier. So instead of working with sigma and sigma star, now we work with S and S star. So S and S star, they leave on this plane, trace equal to 1. And so the differential inclusion now is this, and what we want to characterize is the quality. Characterize is the quasi-complex sale of descent, or more precisely, the projection of the quasi-complex sal, where is it star? You see, the projection of the quasi-complex sal on the plane trace equal to one. So, plane would be a velocity. So, so this is an if and only. This is the condition assessment and the To be an external point of digital project. So you say now you write everything in terms of S and you better have to write the set or whatever you can think. So is there so maybe just is there a way where you go from S star to sigma star? Okay, which one? Sorry. I mean it here. Maybe it's more clear. So sigma star is equal to sigma. This is one to one. So this is one to one. Okay, so the theta minus s star, s star, minus one. Okay? So now we work with s and s star. s and the values s1, s2, and s3, which are positive numbers now. Their sum is one. And s star, of course, we live in this hexagon. Hexagon with vertices S1, S2, S3, and all of its permutations, okay? Because this further is rotation in part, so if the point is there, also all of its rotations. So the set that we would like to characterize lies inside the set of the S star, lies inside this hexagon. These points belong, okay, of course, they are. Okay, of course. They are part of the let me call G of S, so the G closure for S task. Okay, and so what did they do? Me to the music. So now I draw this hexagon here. This need not be a regular exaggeration, of course, but this depends on. Of course, but this depends on the ratio between SI and ST and the metal. Okay, what they show is the following. So they solve the differential inclusion only for diagonal matrices. Okay, so they focus on diagonal matrices and they observe that if we are in a special case where So there are two risks. If S2 squared is equal to S1 is 2, then one can find rank 1 connections between S and a copy of its permutation of itself. If this is S1, S2, S3, this will be rank 1 connected with a multiple of this, a multiple. So this is the projection of a rank. The projection of a rank one line that connects this diagonal matrix with this S3, S1, S2. So the rank one connection is with a multiple of this. But on this plane, we divide by the trace. S1 looks like a very complicated algorithm. S2 squared is equal to the product of S1 and S2. Okay? So I can find this red one connection and then this point will be connected to this you can verify very easily. Refine lambda such that this minus lambda this as red one. It's enough to take lambda equal to squad as one. So all this segment here is the projection of a red one line. So this actually belongs to our To our gig log. Same for this, same for this, and similarly for the other three vertices. So all union of these two triangles belong to the G closure. So you take a point here, you project it back, and you will obtain something from the curved surface. Okay, then in the general case now, where this is not true, what do they do? They exhibit approximate. Approximate solutions of the differential inclusion by constructing infinite rank laminations. So we cannot find connections between the vertices, but what we find is this. So, this is the exploit and these are frequent lines that connect the vector squared. The vertices is one of a strip of copies of this, multiple of this, with points that they call seed materials. And so this is seed material, seed material, these are all seed materials. So this multiple of S is connected with this, so you can laminate the projection of the rank 1 minus this. Then you take this and you split it between another copy of S. Another copy of S, a multiple of S, and another seed material. And then you do again the same. You take this and you just made it like for the Dartmouth square. This is like the Tartar Square construction, except that you do this with three copies at a time. Okay, let's take one parameter, otherwise you cannot see it. Okay. Each time we use copies of this tribute, okay? And after one loop, we are not back in the same place, of course, because this don't close in the diagonal space. This is only the projection, because otherwise we know that for three gradients that are not connected, there is rigidity. Okay, so they have bound, the nickel-basic bound, the inner bound. The middle basic bound, the inner bound for the G-closure is precisely this. It's unique about this to triangles with these arcs. Okay, so what did we do? We improved this bound, and I tell you straight away what we did. Our improved bound with the heads and the meta is something like this. So we show that a much larger set That a much larger set actually belongs to the G-closure. All the sets enclosed by this yellow curve. So, in order to show this, what do we do? First of all, we need to leave the diagonal board. Diagonal matrices are not enough. So, we need to use all of the rotations. And we need to use seed materials that allow to construct the situation thread laminates. Red line in a different way. What is special in this, let me call it T3, T3 construction, is that the direction of laminations are always the same, E1, E2, and E3. So they are the vectors of the canonical things. Moreover, along these rank 1 trajectories, we have two eigenvalue crossings. Eigenvaline crossings. You see this? What do I mean by eigenvalue crossings? It means that the eigenvalue, if I start from here, here there is a uniaxial line where two eigenvalues meet. And then here there is another uniaxial line. So here you see that uh sig uh S1 and S2 are the same. Here and here it's uh S two and S three. So when I start from here, So when I start from here, here means lambda this, okay, and I reach this point, I have one eigenvalue crossing and then another eigenvalue constraint. So the lowest eigenvalue becomes the first. And this is very peculiar of this construction. So in order to depart from this and obtain something larger, we need to work with trajectories, rank one trajectories, that contain only one eigenvalue constant. Only one eigenvalue concept. So our trajectories that allows us to find this new bound are objects of this form. So let me just draw a portion of this of the executive. So our trajectories are something like this. We start from here, we are no longer diagonal now, because diagonal are not enough, and they do this. Can they do this? Okay, so why is it not a straight line? Because all points here are complex combinations of matrices that are not diagonal. So here we are projecting eigenvalues, and the eigenvalues of complex combination are not the convex combination of the eigenvalues. Okay, so when we project line, right-blown lines, projection will be occurring. Okay? Okay, now. Now our seed material must satisfy a condition. Which condition? So this is the projection of rectangular line. Let me write it better. So if this is T, T1, T2, T3, the point on this plane, this is a rank one line if there exists lambda and there exists argation and there exists n, a unit vector. n a unit factor such that r transposed t r is equal to lambda s plus 1 minus lambda f tensor n. Okay, so this means that t, a copy of t, but a projection of this guy is this, okay, uh this matrix is very well connected with Regular connected with to a multiple of S. This is a red one matrix. Okay? But this is not enough. What we need in order to make these infinite languages is that along these trajectories, where there is one angular position, as you can see, only one, not together, it must happen the following. That if I take the mirror point of this T here with respect to this u. Here, with respect to this uniaxial axis, this point must lie on this curve. It should not be outside, as in my picture. If this happens, if this happens, then we can do the following. We can define an infinite rank time unit in the following way. So we start from Some S1. This is T1. Let me call it T1. This is S1. We are able to do this. We start from S1. Then this is connected to some T1, this seed material. If I have also the mirror point of that trajectory, it means that I can split T1 as a convex combinational. Convex combination of a matrix that is also in the target set. So let me call it S2. So this would be another multiple of S with another notation and another seed material that I call T2. And then again, I can split this. And you see I'm not drawing parallel lines, okay? I can split this between some strings. Some S3 and T3, and I can do this, I can define an infinite sequence. Okay? So, all these as in this way I construct a sequence of laminates of finite orders, so combinations of Dirac mass is supported on the target set plus acid material. But the measure where I have the acid material goes to zero. Here goes to zero. And this means that I can construct an approximate solution of the differential equation. And this sequence of laminates has also the right integrability property, which means it's in L2. And so this is possible only in this condition. We characterize all T, all the seeds materials for which this can be used. Materials for which this can be done. And those receipts material must lie on a curve like this. This is not our boundary. If I take t on this curve, I can do this construction. And so in this way, by doing this construction, I can realize all the averages. Because when I do the first lamination, I can fix any model fraction. Any volume fraction, so all these objects lies in the gig logic. I can do this for each t. What is the best bound that I can get? I let t tend to this uniaxial point here. Okay, now this shouldn't be here. The closer t gets to the uniaxial axis, and the better the curve is. So if we take now a curve here, this would be higher. And in the limit, as theta. And in the limit, as t tends to the union axial axis, I will get the best part. Of course, I cannot use directly this point to do all these laminations because I cannot do any splitting here. I need to have a bit of an eigenvalue crossing in order to split. But I can obtain this in blink. Okay, so this is our test bar, and it's this. It's precisely this. Okay. Okay, so I have to have one minute only. Okay. So open questions are, ah, I want to say something. What is the nice feature and a peculiar feature of these nominations? Is that it uses all different rank one lines. All these rank one lines are all different apart from exceptional cases. Exceptional cases. So here we use infinitely many rotations that are all different and they are all powers of a starting rotation. So if the starting rotation is as a rational angle, at some point this is the identity and so we start again with the same set of rotations. Otherwise this will always be a different rotation and the rank one direct One direction, so the laminations are this. This is an initial length, which is length one, and all the other directions of laminations are of this form. So they are not parallel in general. Okay. The open questions now are the optimality of this bound. Is this bound optimal? In the sense that are there other points outside this? We don't know. In order to show the optimality of this boundaries, In order to show the optimality of this boundary, we need a quasi-formatics function that establishes an outer boundary. We haven't done this yet. The determinant does not work. We couldn't even use it because it requires a tree take up. But in any case, it doesn't work. It just gives a trivial bound. So we need to think of it. And on the other hand, if we would like to show that there are other points. Would like to show that there are other points outside. I wouldn't know how to do how to define these laminates for points that are outside this. Maybe using some more abstract approach, like I don't know, the BERCAT one based on the BER category meanput of the complex integration may be there, but I haven't thought of it. And what else? And so, another possible thing to do, which is on the list, is to extend this kind of constructions to the case of two body crystals, as in the Mira case, but in three dimensions, because there is no result. I'm good at that. My time is over. Thank you for your attention. Is your yellow curve really as in your picture? I mean, it's symmetric with respect to the red? Yes, it's symmetric. I mean, it's symmetric, you know why? It's symmetric with respect to this, because you're rectagonist, but no, because you have. No, because you have, you know, when you project if a point is here, all the permutations are there. Permutations means that you take the reflection on the permutations. The mirror images symmetric with respect to the axis. Okay, so yes, they are symmetric with respect to uniaxial axis. Uh i is it true that uh the Is it true that uh the closure cannot be the convex cell? Could it be the whole convex cell? I don't know if it could be the whole convex cell. I have no idea. I don't know. So if we look there to a picture, the one as I drew before, so here what have we done? Is this, then here this, this x and all, okay? So it's something like this that we have proved. We have proved all this now is we know that it's on the boundary of the equation. And here, I don't know. Here there are some little bits where we don't know what happens. I got a bit confused with the projection. Are you calculating the quasi-convex whole set or the projection? You take a matrix which lives in six-dimensional space, three by three symmetric. You take its side. You take its eigenvalues, the variant, you normalize, so you divide by the trace, and you project. Of course, there is not one projection, right? Because you can permute. There are six projections. But the hole you calculate is from which center? This is what I... Calculates. You have some bounds on the quite a convex hole, right? The set is. It's the projected set. It's the projected set that you. It's the projected set, yeah. It's the projected set. Because that is relevant. Yeah, but the digital reconstruction that you get using the projected set, the transformation to aid. For the purposes of characterizing the geology for sigma star, it's enough to look at the projection. I I know I haven't said something. I know I haven't said something. Fifty seconds. So as you saw, we we wrote the problem on a card free, a differential inclusion problem of curving free time. But in fact, one can write also a differential inclusion problem of divergence free time. So we have du in a certain target set, right? But du is the solution of the error divergent equation. So sigma du is divergence frequency. Okay, so if we now take this as a So if we now take this as a variable, B, let's say, the differential inclusion for B is divergence of B0 and B that takes values in sigma applied together. Okay, so one can also see this. We're assuming twenty minutes of course. We're assuming 20 minutes of both of them. This is like not irregular any value of signal signal actually. So this direction pass through the middle point of size. Yeah, this is uniaxial. Ah, so uniaxial axes. And it passes through this point. I didn't understand that. I can show you situations. No, no, no, I trust you. But I didn't understand that the the axis of the design. And this, whatever, are the values of sigma 1, sigma 2, 0. Oh very nice one. So I just want to I'm just a bit confused. So your results are only new in the code or other work like for us. So you have some set phase bar which is in space. So I have some points. So then I have some setup. And now you are doing a slogan, right? So you are getting some points to the point. And is it cloud? Do you want to see the picture? Because this is very flat. And I want to do it. You are a little bit. This is not. I comply now. This is the case by case you want to run, but it's immersed, it's embedded in dimensions, which is 3x3 space. So this is one of the things that we have. This was what happens. Well, at the actual lines, so I started from some mother.
