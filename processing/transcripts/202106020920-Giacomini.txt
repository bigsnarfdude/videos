 So it would be nice if Sugato and Akum could turn on their video so that I can spot read them for everybody. Issue there. Okay. And then we can  Okay, maybe while we wait for Sugato, we can start with the other speakers. So, welcome to this discussion session. So, and thanks to all the speakers who agreed to be part of the panel. So, like with the other discussion sessions, we would like to start by asking you to put your research in a broader context. Put your research in a broader context and to maybe give us what the big challenges are or what the most interesting next steps do you think are in your field. Maybe like just keep to 30 seconds to one minute so that then we have space for discussion. And well, let's start with the order of the speakers. So, Anugam, if you want to go ahead. If you want to go ahead. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot, first of all. So I think we would, I think, as a community, we would like to see the graviton, perhaps we have seen in LSC Higgs particle. Now the question is, can we see graviton in a laboratory? And we can, can we understand some of its properties? So understand the microscopic aspects. But having said so, having such a But having said so, having such a aim, I believe that at the end of the day, I think whatever we are trying to do is to create one of the world's best quantum sensors, and which has a huge application to solve many other problems than physics, maybe to solve earthquake detection sensors, sensors for debris, space debris. So I believe that science and technology go hand in hand, and maybe hopefully. Hand in hand, and maybe hopefully it will have some application for humanity. So that's what my take is actually. Thank you very much. Yeah, so actually there is a strange echo in your sound. So I don't know if you have something else that is turned on, some other application. I don't know. No, no, it's better. Okay. Okay. And And Alessio. Okay, again, thanks also for this section. And I would like to, let's say, connect to a question that Rob was asking to Sulana. Because I guess that is, at least at theoretical level, is a very interesting point. It is how much do we understand about the gravitational field generated by quantum? The gravitational field generated by quantum objects, and that I think is very interesting. There are still things to do there, things to understand. And is this something that has to be, I mean, it's something that was not actually considered by the quantum gravity community up until now? What a small object in a quantum position, which kind of gravitational field produced. I mean, it was considered in the literature, but not to the same extent to which other problems were tackled. Were tackled. So, I guess that from the theoretical point of view is very interesting. And then I subscribe to everything that Anu Pam said. And I think that the other really big challenge is experimental, to be able to really produce this superpositional massive object and to look for the gravitational effects of this kind of system, which is very challenging, but it's becoming more and more possible or realistic. Well, possible or realistic or feasible at least in the near future with the kind of technology that we are having. And again, as Anuka said, there technologies go hand in hand with the fundamental research. So it's a very exciting time to be working on these kinds of topics. Thanks, Celestio. Yvette. Yes. So yeah, I think that there's many very interesting questions in fundamental physics, like what's the nature of dark energy and dark matter. The nature of dark energy and dark matter, you know, physics from the very early universe, and so on. And I think it's very interesting that most of these questions are all underpinned by, you know, the fact that we don't really understand well the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity. So that's where I'm more interested in. Also interested in, you know, tests of dark energy, dark matter, all of the all of these things. All of these things, but at the end of the day, what I would like most is to come that we're able to come up with a device that can test scales where these two theories interplay, because I think that we're in desperate need of that sort of feedback between experiment and theory. So I do this from different approaches. Today I talked about one, but I'm also working on But I'm also working on, for example, how could you use a Bose dinstein condensate to test also massive superpositions? And with Roger, we're doing like he only calculated the self-energy for states of like lumps, so noon states, but we're working on states of Bose-Einstein condensate that are a bit like richer. And also, And also looking at how the curvature of space-time affects experiments with satellites. So it could be entanglement or quantum communications and so on. And I'm also interested in clocks at the interface of quantum mechanics and general relativity. So I guess those are like my attempts to find pieces of the puzzle to this very interesting question. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And Sugato, just to repeat, we are asking all the speakers of this session to give either an overview or put your research in a broader context and tell us what the big challenges are in the next steps in like 30 seconds, one minute. Okay, okay. So essentially, I came into this area from attempts to create superpositions, large superpositions, right? So the gravity was just. Just an add-on we found on the way that the interaction can entangle, and then we found a usage for it to say about the quantum initial gravity. So, I think the most important problem still remains that creating large superpositions, right? So, how you can do it. And it's quite, I'm quite agnostic to whether quantum mechanics has a limit or not. But even if you are agnostic to it, the practical challenges are also quite severe. Practical challenges are also quite severe. So, this how you can reduce all the decoherences, okay? So, from inertial effects like extra masses, as well as the temperature pressure. But that's not just reducing the decoherence, but at the moment, what we are concentrating mostly on is how to create the splitting enough for these gravitational applications to come. You just need a simple force to split the thing enough. And what we thought, as I in the talk, I told about the Strong Garlock force, we have. Told about the star-garlock force. We have had many papers on it till now, but we are learning always on the way. So, because of this unavoidable diamagnetism that is there, which was pointed out by a paper by Gavin and Martin Plenio a few years ago. So, we are trying to overcome these things. And so, essentially, I think I would say the core problem is to really create a large superposition, and then that will be the building block to almost a lot of new physics. A lot of new physics. And the advantage is that it's always very good sensors. These are complementary to Yvette sensors. These are more low frequency effects because, of course, to create a superposition and bring it back, you take some time. But again, these have the chance to be much more sensitive than what is existing just because these are like known states, all the objects here, all the objects there. So there will be benefits at every step on the way. Step on the way. So, so I would think that, yeah, and one perhaps should not restrict themselves to standard like interferometry. Maybe there are other ways, yeah, but just we want to have as large a superposition as possible. Thanks a lot. So we can open now the floor to discussion, and I see that Marius already has a question. Hi, I'm sorry. Hi, I'm sorry, I'm in the car. I have a question for Sugatro. Oh, hi, Mario. Of course, it's sometimes I think it's the same question we're asking, but I wanted to ask, except from pushing for larger superpositions of bigger masses, which is the obvious thing, since it's difficult. Is there any other way we can push, for instance, detecting smaller phases, like having a Like having a other direction that this can be pushed. So, we have already tried to go down the phase to something like 0.01 and 0.001 and get some gain. So, even when we said that when we screen and go to 10 micron distances, which also means like order of 10 micron superpositions, we already were including like. Already were including like taking effects of 0.001, but what you have to understand is that the phase is measured to the efficiency of one by square root of n. So number of runs of the experiment. So it essentially depends on how many runs of the experiment you are willing to do. Now, a bit unlike Yvette's type of setup, where one run is like 10 to the power, could be 10 to the 9 atops or something like that, here it's slightly different. Here, it's slightly different. Here, like all the atoms, whatever the number is end up or 13 or something, are in one place or other, but each run is giving you only one signal, one point. So, so yeah, so 0.001 phase is fine as long as you're happy to do a million runs. So, so we have to know from experimentalist gradually, like how many runs are physically possible. And is there anybody that has heard about having a one over n scaling using quantum? And scaling using quantum that is a very good point. That is a very good point. So, but you would need to then entangle all the so yeah, so you can say, I guess you can presumably get a factor of 10 by entangling 10 spins. People have done in iron traps and things. But then if we want to entangle all our runs, that's tough. Yeah. So you can get Heisenberg scaling according to the number of systems you can entangle beforehand by other, like you. Entangle beforehand by other like electromagnetic means. There isn't a proposal in that direction. I mean, I understand that it's not easy to do that, having many assets now. No, not yet. No, no. So I think the closest thing would be something regarding scale of superpositions, which one of my colleagues, Anish Rauman, has written, who used to be in Gavin's group before that you tried to make the superposition. You try to make the superposition that much larger using the effect of many spins. But there, of course, also again, the issue of coherence, whether it's becoming 10 times bad is subtle. But I should say that is an effect we are already trying to, you know, always when we increase mass, even we are increasing mass to this huge order standard, whatever, we are increasing the decurrence that many times also if we keep the conditions safe. So we are also. Keep the conditions safe, so we are always working under the assumption that we are making the isolation much much better. So, under that assumption, this will help that entangling atoms with each other prior in some way will help. Thank you. Yes, Rob, and then there's Gavin. Yeah, thanks. So, this is a question, I suppose, first for Alessio, but maybe also for Sugato and the other. Sugato and the others can comment. One of the things we have not heard much about experimentally that gravity does quantum mechanically are these experiments by Nez Vyshevsky, where as I understand it, he is able to show that neutrons will in the Earth's gravitational field are in bound states. In bound states, I mean, the effective potential is the V potential because it's just the you know first-year MGX, and he's able to show they have energy levels. So, one thing that comes to my mind as far as Alessio goes is could this be exploited to maybe actually, you know, explore the paradoxes that you were talking about? And I guess maybe either second. Maybe either secondarily is can we actually more generally? It seems to me it should be possible to entangle these various bound states. And can we learn something about entanglement in a gravitational field? I recognize it would still be an external potential, but how much do we really know about that? So maybe I guess Alessio and then Segabu. Thanks. It's a very nice question. Nice question. I start to answer from the end for the second question, and the answer there honestly is that I don't know. It could be that we can learn something interesting from this, also from this kind of experiment, looking at some other implementation of them using more particles. To answer to the first question, I would say that the answer is, in principle, no, for what I got, for example, the paradox or stuff like that, because the crucial point there. Because the crucial point there, and with this, I guess, also for, I mean, also in the experiment of Sugato, is that what you have to look at is the gravitational field generated by a quantum source. While in the Newton experiment case, the Newton are the probe particle, but the gravitational field is coming from a fully classical source that is in that case our planet. So, again, for the second question, I don't know that that is interesting. The second question, I don't know, that is interesting to consider. I didn't talk about that. For the first question, for what regard the paradox at least, that kind of experiment is not useful in the sense that the source of the gravitational field is a classical source there. Okay, yeah, so I think, yeah, so that that's uh I think I'll let you also. That's um, I think Alice, your answer is quite appropriate there. Maybe I can add the fact that, um, so if you are thinking of, say, gravitational states of two, say, two bound objects by one by r potential, for example, right? So a little bit of that we have tried to investigate in a paper on one by R potentials. Okay, the problem is that. The problem is that, yeah, of course, we have done like for the electromagnetic case, like we call it the entanglement in a hydrogenic system. But, and the entanglement is really between the spatial separation, like a spatial entanglement. So, so there are, I mean, of course, in case of gravity, these will be incredibly weak, but a more conceptual point is that, so there are two things: I mean, calculational point and conceptual point. Conceptual point. So, conceptually, if you have such an entanglement, since we have not dynamically generated it, like from zero to something, it would be very difficult to, I mean, you have to consider like zero, a combination of eigenstates to generate the entanglement. Then we can, then it's completely analog to what we did for static eigenstates. If they are entangled, I mean, of course, how do eigenstates arise? They also arise. How do eigenstates arise? They also arise due to some interaction and then steady-state dissipation in the environment. But it may be more difficult to justify from that, something about quantum nature of gravity. And the other aspect is that calculationally, it becomes a bit difficult to do the dynamics here because of all the spherical harmonics involved and the starting state. Involved and the starting state not being spherically symmetric. So, yeah, I mean, we have the calculations which have been done to date are very well separated things with small delta x displacements. Yeah, so that would be kind of my answer to that. But one can look at those systems for sure. Yeah. Thank you. And anybody else wants to say something? And anybody else wants to say something? I don't know if Yvat has something to say, comparing what Rob asked to your proposal, for instance. I can say that you will not be, so one has to see that everything in VC says S matrix. If you can construct an S matrix, you will be able to entangle things in a quantum sense. I'm talking about. If you do not have any S matrix, then there's no way you can entangle. So you need some. So you need some way to quantize both matters, the energy moment of the matter sector, whatever the matter is, photon, electron, or as well as mediator. So I think that experiment is beautiful, but it will never yield anything on quantum gravity unless there is a chance, but unless I'm sensitive to G square effect and H bar effect. So at one loop, maybe I will be able to be, you know. Then maybe set up this calculation in a symmetric formulation where I can check it, but experimentally this will be extremely, extremely hard. So this would be my comment. And Yvat, you should unmute yourself. We cannot hear you. Oh, yes. No, what did you want me to comment on? No, just if you had some further comment on the comment. If you had some further comment on the comparison between these types of experiments that Rob was mentioning and your proposal? Oh gosh, they're very different, I think. They are using very different features. I mean, on one hand, you have superposition in space, and I'm trying to say, well, why don't we try superposition in frequency? And then they're having like a solid, and here you have a B C in which you know things. In which you know things are completely delocalized, and they have a quantum system, I have a relativistic quantum field, so they're different in all aspects. But I think that's a good thing because it just for example, one of the key things that I think they complement each other more because, like Sugato just mentioned, the frequency range. When you're talking about the phonons, the frequency of the phonons go like the speed of sound invited. The phonons go like the speed of sound divided by the length. So you see, those will be high frequencies, whereas, like in the other cases, they go towards low frequencies. So, yeah, I guess I see them more as a complementary. So, if I just comment, all I'm like, I'm not claiming this would necessarily be a new test of quantum gravity, but I am saying that it seems to me the question is there. To me, the question is there: Do we understand entanglement of bound states due to gravity? Do we understand that empirically the way we understand entanglement of bound states due to electromagnetism? And my guess is the answer is no, especially since I see over here on the internet about investigating hydrogenic entanglement that came out last September, and Sugato's name is in this. And Sugato's name is in this article. So it just seems to me that we're trying to jump all the way to quantum gravity, which is great, but we might be missing things along the way. That's all I'm saying. By the way, that's another thing, Rob, that my proposal is about quantum field theory and curved space-time. So there's no back. I mean, so in that sense, they're also different, no? And I agree with Rob with what he said. And I agree with Rob with what he's saying. It's like, of course, we're all very excited about learning about quantum gravity, and that I guess it's the ultimate question. But, you know, in the intermediate step, quantum field theory and curved space-time, I think, has a lot of interesting things to say. And one of the things that it reminds me of is like when people were trying to, you know, get quantum electrodynamics. Well, at the beginning, the interaction between the electromagnetic field and matter was such. Magnetic field and matter was a semi-classical one. So people would quantize the matter, use a two-level atom, but then treat the field classically, and they could explain a lot of stuff like that. Then they added phenomenologically vacuum fluctuations. And I think you catch almost everything by doing that. There's just very few things that you can, like I forgot the names, been like quantum bits or something like that. I forgot the name of it, but I mean, most of it you can explain by. I mean, most of it you can explain by that. So I think quantum field theory in curved spacetime has a lot to contribute in that way. And we don't know if the gravitational field should be quantized or not. And we also don't know if we should keep the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and change relativity or vice versa, or most likely change both, but which, you know, But which should we change and which should we keep? So, that also type of experiments might help answer some of those questions along the lines. Yeah, I agree. Okay. So, if I could I add something to exactly because any of you. Yes, yes. Uh, we have two more questions. So, yeah, okay, go ahead quickly. Now, just to, I mean, because there's something Yvette referred to, which is interesting: is that so historically? Is that so? Historically, people were considering quantized atoms and classical M fields, because Planck was himself hesitant to consider the. And that would work a long way, except when you do these Haroshi's experiments in the cavity, like you fly two atoms to an empty cavity and they get entangled. That would not work with the classical Yam field. And this is exactly the effect. So you have to go to a quantum field there. To a quantum field, there, and this is the jump we are trying to make here. Yeah, thanks, and Gavin. Yeah, thanks. So, I don't know, this question might be a bit unfair, but let me ask it anyway. So, does anyone have anything to say about how these experiments that we're talking about, how it would be useful to think about quantum reference frames and Quantum reference frames and indefinite causal order. So, I don't know much about quantum reference frames and indefinite causal order, but there's a lot of interesting talks here in this meeting. And is there useful stuff to do linking that up? Oh, I don't know. For my case, there's been so much to look at, you know, because they have applications that range from so many things. From so many things that it's just like impossible to look at all interesting aspects. So, I haven't seen in that direction. I have some paper on reference frames and relativity and metrology, but I think it's more of a, in the light of the work I did with Rob, let's say that was more just academic and not so much towards the experiment. If I can add something, I think that at the theoretical level, for sure, in the end, the gravitational switch is something in which you have to have this localized mass in the quantum superposition, so on and so forth. At the experimental level, the question is tougher because there these effects are really, really small. But if we go a bit outside, A bit outside of the kind of experiment that we were discussing this morning, at least the one that Tsugato and Anopan were discussing. I think that there is a very rich interplay to be investigated there. Just an example, there is a work in which Flaminia was one of the authors about testing a quantum version of the Einstein equivalence principle and testing this theoretical result using an actual experiment that then was performed. Actual experiment that then was performed in Florence. So, and the quantum mass time equivalence principle is connected directly with the quantum reference frame. So, there are also experimental possibilities, maybe not with superpositional massive objects, because at the moment, as Sugato said, they are difficult to get and to study in the indefinite task order directly. They are, it's tough because the effects are small, but in other ways, for sure, there are. Other ways for sure, there are very interesting possibilities right now. Thanks, Alessio. Yeah, so just because Alessio called me, yeah, I think there is the possibility to have an interplay between this superposition of massive objects and quantum reference frames. And I think it's actually a very interesting research direction. But yeah, I don't want to take more space in. But yeah, I don't want to take more space in this discussion, so I'll give the one to if I may say something. It's actually very hard to even define what do I mean by quantum reference frame. It's not so trivial in a way that, yeah, but I mean, there's everything in a laboratory, which is purely a classical setup. So if I want to measure whether my spin is up or down, I'm doing it in a classical laboratory. I'm doing it in a classical reference frame. Yes, but there's quite a bunch of literature now on quantum reference frames, which is the possibility to associate a reference frame to a quantum system. And so your observer is also quantum in this context. No, no, no, no, no, not necessarily. That makes so much. Okay. Okay, maybe, I mean, this is a tangential topic to this discussion. We should, I think, move on with the questions. The questions. Sumati? Yeah, so again, I'm trying to understand this idea that somehow we're going to be seeing some aspects of quantum gravity with these experiments. And I guess my question is actually addressed to Adessio's Geranken experiment and the conclusion. So I understand from the electron. From the electromagnetic point of view, you know, from using electromagnetism. And the analogy is, of course, very good when you're looking at the classical case. The classical case, classical analogies between electromagnetism and gravity are obvious. But the minute you begin to now talk about the vacuum or fluctuations in gravity, you're not talking about gravitons, but somehow you've still got. Somehow, you've still got the gravitational field that's conveying information. And I don't understand what that could mean if the space-time is not undergoing some kind of fluctuation. What does it mean for a gravitational field to be even defined as a quantum state? And so, in that case, I would, and that confuses me even more because now I'm looking at your experiment, but you have a definite causal structure. Definite causal structure which you're trying not to violate any causality conditions, and here I have the possibility that that gravitational interaction or whatever that you know, whatever your conclusions are coming to, that somehow you can change that causal structure itself, because you can, you know, if there is a graviton, it's going to fluctuate and it's going to create, you know, a fuzzy light. I don't want to call it a fuzzy light con, but a fluctuating different light con possibly. A different light cone, possibly. So, all of this I'm trying to understand. I know this is very hard to summarize it in a short time. So, anyway, I want to thank you all for even for bringing up these very difficult questions as far as I'm concerned. I'm really trying to grapple with how this is possible. So, thank you. Thank you very much for the question and for thanking us. Let me just try to answer somehow. Maybe the answer will be incomplete, or maybe I will not answer to the point. So please interrupt me if that is the case. At least for what I got, the paradox, the take-atto message again was about entanglement induced by gravitational interaction. And essentially, what I was speaking about was, in a sense, weak gravity or linearized gravity. So what I'm speaking about is that we're going to be able to So, what I'm speaking when I say quantum there, and I think that I guess that also Sugato and Anupan will agree, is not what is really at the non-linear gravity level, but it's something before. It's just the need to somehow quantize gravity in some sense. So, that's why I was referring to some quantum properties like quantized radiation and quantum fluctuations, but the situation. Fluctuations, but the situation is far from the regime in which really the causal structure, the fluctuation in the causal structure are entering into the game as relevant. Can I just interrupt you just for a second? Because that's already where I'm losing you. Because if you're, I mean, this is even linearized gravity, right? I mean, just I'm not talking at all about non-perturbative, just we're talking about perturbation. Just we're talking about perturbation. You're talking about the gravitational field being a quantum object, but what does that possibly mean if I'm not allowed to wiggle my causal structure, if I'm not allowed to do things with my space-time? I can't reconcile it, in other words, with a static or a background space-time. So, this is the part that I'm struggling to understand. Sorry. Okay, I see. I see. Again, I think that. Again, I think that a way to say it is that, as you said, we are looking at essentially linear perturbations, and the fluctuation of the Casa structure will be there, just it is not relevant in itself for the argument itself. What is relevant there is to show this equilibrium between, I mean, the need for some quantum properties, what we would call quantum property of the dynamical degree of freedom. Uh, the dynamical degree of freedom on gravity, but again, without entering into the into really the domain of quantum gravity, in a sense, it's just can we show that there is some kind of need to quantize the gravitational field, so also the structure of space-time, but then we cannot say anything about what this quantization will look like. So, in a sense, it's an intermediate step, if you want. It's not really full quantum gravity, it's just the Is just there are this the fluctuation of the causal structure are definitely there, just they are not relevant for the argument at hand. Like they are not relevant in the experiment of Sugato, I would say. I don't know if Sugato was or Anna. If I may say, I think there's a huge misconception in the community. Now, what do I mean by quantum gravity itself is not a very well-defined question? I do not know whether quantum gravity I do not know whether quantum gravity does become non-perturbative. I don't know. So there are many questions which we don't know theoretically as well as experimentally. But what we are after is to understand the very basic structure of gravity. If graviton is the mediator, is it really massless? How many degrees of freedom does it carry? Can I test some of these things in a laboratory? So, what we are trying to do is very minimal. So, what we are trying to do is very minimal thing. So, essentially, you can say that what we are trying to do is exactly like QED. 100 years ago, people tried to understand the properties of photon, and now we are trying to understand the properties of this hypothetical quanta, which we call graviton. So, we are doing very, very simple thing, but technologically still is extremely, extremely challenging. Then, I would argue that you are doing quantum, if you're doing gravitons, if you're quantizing gravitator. Gravitons for your quantizing gravitons that is linearized gravity, that is in the full regime of quantum gravity. Um, and then I have to ask: why, why do the scales, you know, how do you get to Planck scales where you know the scales? You see, you don't have to go to Planck scales. This is an infrared effect, and that's the beauty that even in the infrared, because In the infrared, because of the long-range interaction, one over our interaction, it leaves its imprint, and the way it leaves its imprint is in the context of an entanglement. So, that's the beauty about any long-range interaction. You can even do the same thing for DVD if I can interject here. I mean, I think so. What Shimad is asking, So, what Shimat is asking, the answer is that the causal structure is defined by the background method in Koski, which is taken fixed. Sorry, if I let's let Marius finish. Actually, not because I'm quantizing my maybe we should let Marius ask his question or comment. I'm very interested to hear what Anubo has to say. But the way I think about it is that there is the eta minu, which is fixed, so that determines the causal structure. That determines the causal structure, and there is a perturbation on it, which is not fluctuating enough to change the causal structure so that we care. And it's the perturbation that is going to be shown that you need to have that as a quantum operator in order to make it work. I agree with Christian. I agree with you. Maybe I quickly add one more thing to this. Yes, that in some sense, when the Some sense, when the gravity is at play, when this exchange of virtual excitations is happening, that time is the vacuum, the vacuum of the gravity is fluctuating, but that is leading to the entanglement. But it's fluctuating very less. It doesn't take you to the Planck scale at all. It's exactly also similar to what Alessio says. So if historically we could not determine We could not detect a single photon, and we had to first entangle two atoms, as in an ion trap done daily, and then conclude that electromagnetic field is quantum. So, in there, actually, it was much easier to detect single photons and things than to control every entangle. In this case, it happens that it's so hard to detect gravitons that it's easier to do the more difficult thing, which is The more difficult thing, which is for electromagnetism, so it's very entangled. So, yeah, so that would be my addition to the thing. Yeah, so there are fluctuations, but we don't find them at the end. In the end, the effect of all those intermediate fluctuations is to entangle. Just as in EM, the fluctuations lead to Cassini forces, which can entangle very similar to that. Thank you, Sugato. And we have another question from Alex. Oh, sorry, Sumati, you wanted to say something? To say something, I was just thanking people for their answers. Thank you. Thank you, Alex. Yeah, it's just a quick question. I understand that there are some models beyond the standard model that predict Yukawa type corrections to the Newtonian gravitational potential. And so I was wondering, is there any hope in placing new bounds on these or seeing this effect in these types of hurdles? I think it's for everyone. Touches on all those things. Yeah, if I may say, absolutely, because you see that when you Say absolutely because you see that when you have a massive, let's take an example of a massive gravity. Now, massive gravity has more degrees of freedom than massless gravity. And so essentially what happens is that it will affect your propagator. So propagator gets immediately modified and that gives rise to your Yukawa kind of potential. And the suppression in the Yukawa potential comes exactly with the whole mass that new physics is entering. Physics is entering. So, here the new physics is essentially the massive graviton. So, suppose, I mean, of course, this is a hypothetical case. We don't know the scale of a massive graviton. And of course, we don't know at very, very short distance what's the nature of gravity. But so it provides us an opportunity that there is an opportunity there is a new physics maybe which is lurking that I may be susceptible to. And not only that, it could also be you can open to the Pandora box to Kaluza client, gravitons, also, you know. Also, you know, other interactions as well. So I think it provides us an opportunity rather than, you know, that we can really. I was just wondering if there's like a new way to put bounds on those parameters that define if there's. Yeah, okay, so like that beat the current stuff. Okay, that's really exciting. Cool. Thank you. So, who somebody else wants to comment on this? Yvette, you're muted. Yeah, sorry, I mute because there's like some constructions going on on the other side, so not to interrupt other people. But yeah, so we are look for with the BC proposal, we're looking at some modifications of gravity, but that's work in progress. And I don't know what the numbers will be, you know, because we just have to do the thing and then see, oh, okay, do we have any chance to see it or not? But I have a PhD student right now that started. Student right now that started in January, and he's looking at that. Cool, cool. Yeah, let's see. Great, thanks. So do anybody else wants to say something, comment? Maybe I would like to ask just something to Anupan because I have, we did with in Vienna with one of my master's students. We wanted to. Students, we wanted to, you know, describe. It sounds really simple, but incredible that we have so much difficulties with that, right? Just one system, like a quantum system, but in the presence of the gravitational field of the Earth. So that's different because here you're looking at more like, well, you're looking at gravity and self-gravity things as well, right? But in this case, it was just like a bead and the earth, but treat that general relativistically. General relativistically. So it's kind of funny because if you look at the Schrödinger equation, it has like a slot for a potential that would be like the quadratic potential where you put your bead if you want. And if you look at the Klein-Gordon equation, it has like the slot for the metric. But we don't have an equation that has like a slot for both things somehow. And well, one obeys Galileani transformations, the other one Lorentz. And so they're very different. So we said, well, well, let's just try to make some theory. Well, let's just try to make some theory and make some predictions and see what happens. So, what we did is we started with the Klein-Gordon equation, which has the metric. We put sort of we made up a metric that describes what the bead does. So, we say, okay, you have on one hand the space-time metric of the Earth. So we model that with the Schwatfield metric. But when we modify the metric to make it also behave like the potential, do you think that makes any sense? I think the best way to treat it would be. I think the best way to treat would be as a I think the best analogy will be that we should teach our young generation QFT and then teach quantum mechanics. Don't teach quantum mechanics first and then teach QFT. So first you should teach QFT. Follow everything in a covariant language. Then take the non-relativistic limit and you will see wonderfully that everything should match. That's the beauty about Einstein's gravity. The beauty about Einstein's gravity is that it didn't throw away Newton's prediction, it preserved all the Newton's predictions. Yes, so I think. Well, I'm with you on that one, yeah. Great. Okay, thank you very much. So I think we are already a bit over time. So maybe we should thank all the panelists and all the people who participated to this discussion session. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for the invitation and for everybody present. Thanks. Nice saying hi to well-known faces. Yes, same here. And I will stop the recording. Okay.
