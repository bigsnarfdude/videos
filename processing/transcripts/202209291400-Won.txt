And if someone's supposed to hit record, I guess I'll remind you to hit record. So, yeah, thanks everybody for coming. Thanks to Chelsea and Jason, especially. I know planning an online conference is hard enough. Planning an in-person conference is even harder. Planning hybrid seems really unpleasant. So, thank you so much for organizing. So, first most important slide: this is joint work with Kenneth Chan. Joint work with Kenneth Chan, Jason Gaddis, and James Zheng. It's mostly on a paper called PI skew polynomial rings, which will be on the archive soon, but also in reference to another paper, ozone groups. They'll be on the archive not that soon. I can't actually see Jason and James's faces, but by soon, I think I mean sometime in the month of October. Speaking of Jason's face, Jason's talking, she was like, Rob always insists on using my official Miami photo. Using my official Miami photo. So I thought I would substitute with this picture that I drew of Jason four years ago. And how maybe in every talk I ever, I know it's photorealistic. It looks like a photo. In every talk I ever give from now on, I might use this picture of you, Jason. All right. Okay, let me also point out that I think the results in this paper, the proofs are not hard. It's not like we've set a hard problem and solved it completely. And solved it completely. It's more like we have set something up and hope that what we proved is like a test case for something that could go more general. So let me start with the basic object that we're going to talk about, which is the skew polynomial ring. We'll fix a field K. And we have maybe my favorite AS regular algebra. You take a multiplicatively anti-symmetric matrix and Anti-symmetric matrix. And then you take the free algebra and n variables, and you say that the xj variable commutes with the xi variable up to this scalar pij. So it's multiplicatively anti-symmetric so that xi xj is pij inverse xj xi. Okay, so this is a well-known class of AS regular algebras, global dimensioning, gk dimension n. It's also well known that they satisfy polynomial identity. That they satisfy a polynomial identity if and only if each of these entries in the matrix is a root of unity. And so that's the setting that we want to consider. Because what we want to understand is what can we say about the properties of the skew polynomial ring, but more specifically, what can we say about its center? So when it's PI, it has a big center. So we'd like to understand that. Okay. So more particularly, More particularly, two questions that we really addressed in our work is: when is the center Gorenstein and when is it regular? And remember, the center is commutative. So I really do mean when is the opolynoma ring and Gorenstein in the commutative sense. The more specific question is: Are there some invariants that we can associate to the skew polynomial ring that controls a property of whether its center is quarantine or regular? Or regular, and then can I get some sort of conditions on the parameters? Like, you hand me the skew polynomial and you hand me the parameters. Can I look at those parameters and tell you, ah, the center is quarantine is the center is regular? Okay, so sort of basic questions. The secret question is: can you do this for a general Netherian PI AS regular algebra? That's a secret question in the background. So, again, this paper is sort of like, well, the first A. Well, the first AS regular algebras that you should consider are these skewed polynomial rings. So let's try to answer this question for the skewed polynomial rings and hope that some of what we've set up or thought about might help the general case by give you an Ethereum PIAS regular algebra. Can you determine properties of the center? Okay, so that's the setup. Let's do, just as a warm-up, just so that we're all on the same page, I'll just say the case n equals two is very easy. In this case, there's basically just In this case, there's basically just a single parameter. It just tells you how x1 and x2 commute with one another. Let's just call that parameter p12 to be consistent with our notation. We're focusing on the pi case, so it's an Lth root of unity. And then it's a very easy computation to see what the center is, because if you take a monomial x1 to the i, x2 to the j, if you try to commute it with x1, you pick up a p12 to the j term. If you try to commute it with x1, If you try to commute it with x2, you pick up a p12 to the negative i term. So in order for these two things to be equal, you need both j to be a multiple of l and i to be a multiple of l. So the central monomials are just the ones where you have a power, sorry, a multiple of l power on x1 and a multiple of l power on x2. In other words, the center is just the polynomial ring in x1 to the l and x2 to the l. So the n equals 2 cases is very easy. So the n equals two case is very easy. Basically, the center is always regular, it's always Gorenstein. It always has this very nice form. Okay, but once you go to n equals three, then it becomes less obvious what's happening with the center. Okay, so in order to address this, we have the ozone group, which is a term coined by either James. Coined by either James or Jason, depending on your idea of history. Ask Jason Gannis about it. Okay, so let's define the automorphisms phi i. These are automorphisms of the skew polynomial ring, just given by conjugation by xi. So phi i applied to a polynomial is xi inverse f xi. And I'll let O be the subgroup of Be the subgroup of the automorphism group, the graded automorphism group, generated by these n phi's. Okay, it's very clear to see that the center is the fixed ring by this group action. To say that you're in the center means that you commute with every xi. It's exactly what it means to be in the fixed ring of these phi i's. And so, in other words, in order to study the center, we can apply non-cumminative invariant theory to the ozone group. Theory to the ozone group or this O action on this u polynomial ring. Right, I sort of give it away. In fact, actually, this group O consisting of these are generated by these conjugation automorphisms is in fact the set of automorphisms of S which actually fix the center Z. It's a set of Z algebra automorphisms of S. I guess one of those containments is obvious. Which one is obvious? It's obvious. Which one is obvious? It's obvious that every automorphism in O actually fixes Z. So the one containment is obvious. The other containment is proved in the second paper. It's not a difficult proof. You use the grading on S. But because this O is actually the Z algebra automorphism group of S, we just define this in general for an Ethereum PIAS regular algebra. PIAS regular algebra, the ozone group is just exactly this object. So in this case, the center of S is the same thing as the fixed ring by the ozone group. Okay, so just some general facts about the ozone group. James mentioned these facts, but that was a long time ago on Monday. So Monday is forever ago at this point. But one fact is that the ozone group. But one fact is that the ozone group, the maximum order of the ozone group, it's a finite group, and the maximum order is the rank of A over the center. And then like a very surprising fact is as long as your field is algebraically closed and A is generating degree one, then you can actually characterize the skew polynomial rings by the property that they have the largest possible size ozone group, which is abelian. Okay, so this is like a Okay, so this is like a very non-obvious way to characterize the skew polynomial ring, I think. Okay. So now let's move up to a bigger example before I state any results. Okay, so now we'll do the case n equals three, in which case we have this three by three multiplicatively anti-symmetric matrix. And again, we're in the PI case, so each of these is actually. Case so each of these is actually some root of unity, uh, and you just sort of take the root of unity generated by them. So you take a minimal L, you take this psi to be this L through unity, and you can write each of the pij's as some power of psi. We call these powers Bij. And so, in a lot of our results, we'll refer to Bijs. The Bij are just the powers of psi on the P. Of psi on the pijs, right? So this now actually additively skewed symmetric matrix, which really lives in Z mod LZ. Whenever we give some result in terms of the parameters, most of the time it'll be in terms of these Bijs, but of course the Bijs and the Pijs are really the same thing. Okay, then I wanted to do an example of what the ozone group is, just to be really concrete. So of course, phi 1 is conjugation by X1. Phi one is conjugation by X1. So phi one fixes X1. If you conjugate X2 by X1, right, you move this X2 past this X1, you pick a P12, right? P12, X2. Same thing happens with X3. And so the matrix representing this automorphism phi1, like on like the degree one piece of A, say, or of S, say, is just a diagonal matrix with P12 and P13. Diagonal matrix with P12 and P13 here. And you can sort of see that this calculation will work for phi 2 and 53, except you pick up an inverse, right, when the I is bigger than the J. So the thing here is that the ozone group of the skew polynomial consists of diagonal automorphisms, which means that it's actually really easy to study like the invariance, or it makes it much easier to study the invariance because it's doing something very nice and predictable to this key policy. Very nice and predictable to the skew polynomial ring. Okay, here's a nice theorem by Ellen, Jim, and James. They studied group automorphisms or groups of automorphisms acting on the skew polynomial ring. And they proved that this analog of the AAA-Shepard-Todd theorem, which is that the fixed ring under any The fixed ring under any group, subgroup of graded automorphisms on the skew polynomial ring is finite global dimension if and only if G is generated by reflections of S. And this is reflections in the trace series sense of reflection. But right, we're interested in just the ozone group, these regular if and only if the ozone group is generated by reflections. Is generated by reflections, and so actually, when we want to apply this theorem, we can use reflections either in the trace series sense or in the classical sense because they end up being the same thing. Oh, my pauses here are done poorly. I guess this still works. So, we'd like to understand what are the reflections in the ozone group? If so, then we can get at this regularity question. Question. Okay, so in order to do that, let me first introduce some invariants. So for each i, let's just let this math frac Fi be the GCD of the powers of Xi that appear in any monomial that's in the center. Okay, so the GCD over all of you look at all the monomials in the center, you take the GCD of the Xi's appearing. Okay, and then I'm going to define these three invariants: the ozone-Jacobian, the ozone arrangement, and the ozone discriminant, right? It's just defined as follows. The ozone-Jacobian, you take xi to the power, this fi minus one, you take the product. The ozone arrangement, you just take all the, you take all the ones that have a fi greater than one, and you take the product. So, of course, So, of course, this ozone discriminant, which has just Xi to the power Fi, is just the product of the ozone-Jacobian and the ozone arrangement. Okay, so now why do we call these things the ozone-Jacobian, ozone arrangement, and ozone discriminant? It's because Ellen and James have a paper where they study reflection-Hop algebras on AS regular algebras. And for those reflection-Hopf actions, they define a Jacobian and a discriminant. And a discriminant. And so, a fact is that when Z is regular, then these three things agree with Ellen and James's definition. But we can make this definition even if the center isn't regular. Actually, Jacobian agrees even when Z is Korenstein, but all three of them agree when Z is regular. Okay, now I call these invariants. It seems the way that I've written them that they would depend upon how you've chosen to generate your skew polynomial array, right? To generate your skew polynomial ring, right? I'm making a choice of generators x1 through xn. But in fact, you can show that these, the set of the fi's or the Jacobian or the arrangement or the discriminant don't depend upon your choice of generating set for your skew polynomial ring. So they actually are invariants. There's another thing that we look at, just the product of generators. And this thing does depend upon your choice of generating except for your skew polynomial. Generating except for your skew polynomial, so it isn't truly an invariant, but it's still a thing that you can consider in this setting. Okay, so these are the invariants that we hope will give you some handle on the behavior of the center of the ring. Okay, so this stuff here is stuff that we've already covered. O is the ozone group. It's generated by these conjugation automorphisms. Fi are the GC. Fi are the GCDs of the power of Xi that appear in any monomial in the center. And I'm using H to be the subgroup generated by reflections. And then we can basically just classify H in this setting. So it turns out that H is just a product of cyclic subgroups. And the order of, right? So like each of these cyclic subgroups, RI, is just sort of the part that just scales the X. Just scales the xi and fixes all of the xj's. And the order of each of these components is just fi. It turns out the fixed ring under this h, remember h is generated by reflections. So by Kirkman, Kuzmanovich, and Zhang, the fixed ring is actually a skew polynomial ring. So the F i's are also the powers on the X i's that give you the fixed ring. And it turns out that another way to define the F i. That another way to define the fi's is instead of taking the GCD of the power on Xi appearing in the center, you can take the minimum if you'd like. That's just like a Euclidean algorithm proof, really. Okay, but a thing to notice here is that O will contain no reflections if and only if each of the FIs is one, right? Because this group of reflections, each of its components has order Fi. So no reflections is the same thing as each Fi being one. As each fi being one, which brings us to this theorem of Auslanders that's been mentioned several times in several talks, which is given any algebra A and any subgroup of automorphisms, you can find this Auslander map from the skew group ring to the endomorphism ring of A as an A G module, where you send H G to this endomorphism. And because we have this characterization of when the Of when the ozone group has no reflections. The Al Seiner map is an isomorphism precisely when the group contains no reflections. Okay, so this Al Seiner map is an isomorphism for the ozone group action on the C polynomial ring, if and only if all the F i's are one, which is the same thing as saying that the ozone Jacobian is one. Right? So this ozone Jacobian is in some, this invariant is controlling whether or not. Is controlling whether or not this Auslender map is an isomorphism for this action. So you can think of this as giving the answer that there's an invariant that controls this property. Okay. But now you might ask, okay, you give me a skew polynomial ring. You ask me, okay, so is the Auslaner map an isomorphism? I can tell you all I want. Oh, just it's if all the fi's are equal to one. But then to figure out the fi's, you need to like look at every monomial. You need to look at every monomial in the center and take the GCD. So that doesn't seem like a very effective computational way to tell. But the point is that you can just tell. So don't worry too much about what these actually say. So again, the n equals two case is easy because we know exactly what the fixed ring is. The n equals two case, it's never an isomorphism. But in the n equals three case, you just take the bij's that appear in that matrix. And if they're all co-prime to L, They're all co-prime to L, in other words, they're all actually primitive roots of unity, primitive L-th roots of unity, then the Alsiner maps in isomorphism. In the N equals four case, a thing that appears sort of naturally in the way that we prove it is the Fafian of B. So the Fafian is this invariant you can associate to a matrix. For a skew symmetric matrix, the Fafian is just. Matrix, the Fafian is just the square root of the determinant. So, like in the n equals three case, because every skew symmetric matrix of odd size has zero determinant, the Fafian is automatically zero. So you could add this condition to one if you'd like as well. But in the n equals four case, you just compute whether the Fafian is zero and you just take a look at each row of your matrix and you see, is there an integer that I can scale so that it kills everything? Can scale so that it kills everything in the row except for one entry. If that doesn't happen, then the Alsander map is an isomorphism. So these are like very, very computationally feasible. If you hand me the parameters, I can tell you immediately whether or not the Alsander map is an isomorphism. Okay, so this first Auslander section illustrates both of the things that we would like. We have this property we're interested in. We can control it with some invariant, and we can actually compute it based on the parameters. Based on the parameters. So, I'd like to do the same thing for: is the center Gorenstein? Is the center regular? Okay. So, again, thanks to Ellen, Jim, and James, determining whether the center, or in general, if a fixed ring of a skewed polynomial ring is Gorenstein is also due to Ellen and James. It happens if and only if when you take. When you take the quotient by this, the subgroup generated by reflections, then the action acts with trivial homological determinant. In other words, C, the center is Gorenstein if and only if O mod H acts with trivial homological determinant. And again, these automorphisms are diagonal. So actually, computationally, it's not so bad. So we can prove that Z is Gorenstein if and only if this element. Only if this element, the ozone and Jacobian times the product of generators, is in the center. So again, the product of generators is not actually an algebra invariant, but you can think of this for a given presentation of the skew polynomial ring, this single element, whether or not it's in the center, controls whether or not Z is Korenstein. So this is kind of like an invariant controlling this property. Okay, but for all these things, I have a twin question, which is: how can you actually tell? You actually tell, and again, there's no need to look at this and actually read it. What it says is that there's some actually testable criterion in the cases that n equals three and n equals four. You can actually do a computation with the parameters, and it will tell you whether or not the center is quarantine. Okay. And again, the n equals two case is easy because the center is always quarantine. That was our little warm-up. Okay. Moving right along. When is the central regular? One is essentially regular. Again, we already mentioned this theorem of Kirkman, Kuzmanovich, and Zhang, which is that it's regular if and only if Z is regular if and only if the ozone group is generated by reflections. In other words, if and only if O is equal to H. And so we can prove that Z is regular. That's the same thing as the size of the ozone group is like the product of the size. I mean, this is just the size of H, right? Because each of the components Ri of H. Components RI of H had size FI. So it's if and only if O is actually equal to H. Turns out that the FI's are also the powers on the XI that give you the polynomialing presentation of the center, if and only if each XI FI is in the center. Okay, so here, like I want to think about the set of F i's as being some kind of invariant that controls whether or not the center is regular, right? Because that's just n numbers, right? The F i's. Numbers, right, the F1 through Fn, and you put those as powers on the XIs, you check if they're central, and then that tells you whether or not the center is regular. Okay. But again, my twin question is, well, how can you actually tell if I give you a presented skew polynomial ring? And again, I'll say the same thing, which is, who cares what the conditions say? What the conditions really say is that you can tell. Really, say is that you can tell just by looking at the parameters. Okay, so I guess I now I'm going to end with questions, but I guess the first question might be, we figured out something about the parameters for n equals two, n equals three, n equals four. We didn't work that hard for higher n. One thing we noticed is that like there might be some sort of even-odd dimension thing where maybe the odd ones, you do one thing, the even ones. Maybe the odd ones you do one thing, the even ones you do another thing. The Fafian seems to be important. But I mean, n equals five, we tried a little bit, but the computations are not that fun to do. So already actually for n equals three and n equals four, I guess the secret is both Ken and Jason are sort of computational wizards. I mean, it's just linear algebra, but still they're computational wizards at linear algebra. Wizards at linear algebra. So, one first question might be: well, can you do a general n? Can you give some condition, maybe odd n, even n, that tells you when the center is regular or quarantine? I think this chain of implications is like maybe one of James's favorite to write down, which is regular implies hypersurface, implies complete intersection, implies quarantine. Um, I mean, often when James or Ellen is writing this down, uh, they mean in the non-commutative case, right? Like, what is a In the non-commutative case, right? Like, what is a non-commutative complete intersection? But for us, we're talking about the center, we actually mean the commutative case. So, we tried to understand what is the center regular or what is the center Gorenstein. You might also ask, when is the center a hypersurface? What is the center a complete inflection? One nice thing that we used all throughout is that you can actually get the center as the invariant ring of a group action, namely the ozone group. So, in general, can you always find a group or a Hof? Can you always find a group or a Hof algebra such that you can find the center as the invariance of that action? And then maybe you could hope to apply some of the same techniques. Again, let me include the secret question, which is really the main question, which is if you have a general Metherian PIAS regular algebra A, are there some invariants maybe that generalize the Ozan-Jacobian arrangement and discriminant that you can define that will control properties of the center? Okay, so as a little bit of a suggestion that maybe it's possible, let me just point out that one thing we prove along the way is that the scupon wearing is clabby out rather than just twisted clabby out if and only if the product of generators is in the center. But then we looked very briefly at the end at some noetherian graded down up algebras. Maybe, you know, maybe your second favorite AS regular. You know, maybe your second favorite AS regular algebras, and we prove that there is an element in A call it math frac B that controls whether or not A is collabi out in the same way. A is collabi out if and only if this element B is in the center. So one question about that example is we just provide the element B, again, sort of computationally, but does it have some sort of homological definition? Yeah, so really the, let me really end on this slide with this. Let me really end on this slide with this secret question: which is: if I have an Ethereum PIAS regular algebra A, can I control the center somehow? And the answer for skew polynomial rings is at least yes-ish, right? Thanks for your time. Yeah, thank you. I was curious. So, both on that last slide, you know, the product of generators is showing up. And then a few slides earlier, I think it was the Gornston case, the product of generators and something showed up. And you said that wasn't an invariant. Is there something that sort of changes in these cases to make it kind of like an invariant? Like, is that the product of Xi to the Fi? Is that an invariant? Oh, oh, you're right, you're right. You're actually right. I guess this, so the Fi is actually an algebra invariant, therefore, wait, but this depends on this depends on your choice of generators. Maybe is James in the room? James, is. Is James in the room? James, is this? I don't think it's an invariant. Okay. Choice of generating. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Like for a particularly generated algebra, you could actually find this element, right? And it gives you some information. So it would be nice to be able to define it somehow, but it won't be invariant under your choice of generating except for this cup polynomial ring. Right. Well. Well, we're short on time, unfortunately, so maybe we can thank Rob once more, and any other questions, you can email him. Yeah, thank you, thank you. Our next talk is in two minutes, I believe.
