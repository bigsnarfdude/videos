I have Professor Grigory Serrogen from Oxford University. Grigory has made very many important contributions to Navier-Stokes equations, and I grew up reading his papers. So I'm very happy to make this introduction. Gregory will give us a lecture on local regularity of axisymmetric solution to Navier-Stokes equations. So, okay, thank you very much. So, okay, thank you very much for your kind of kind of kind introduction. And thank you very much for having me here. This is a great pleasure to participate in this nice conference. And I'm going to talk about a particular result related to axisymmetric solution to the Navier-Stokes. Symmetric solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. So, but I am going to start with some general things which you probably know very well, but I want to fix notation, I want to fix my way of thinking. And so for simplicity, we could consider a Cache problem. This is the Cache problem. And this Cashi problem, we have We have WSTOX system describing the flow of incompressible fluid. And here is one positive parameter, viscosity, which I'm going to put equal to one, because this is another problem, how things depend on viscosity, maybe even more complicated than the problem I'm going to discuss. And it is a Cashi problem, and we have initial data. Have initial data, and about initial data, we assume everything we would like that this initial data are smooth, compactly supported, divergence-free. And the question, particular equation which I'm interested in is about existence and uniqueness, global existence and uniqueness of this Kashy problem. Problem. So there are essentially two methods to solve this problem. One of them is probably coming from the papers of Eisen when you move this non-linear part to the right-hand side, solve Stokes problem, that is Stokes linear problem, and then you will get an integral equation. And using contraction mapping, you can prove the existence of solution. Of solution. This is a very good method because, in this method, you get unique as a byproduct, but unfortunately, you cannot prove global existence. Another method is the method of Liraire and he proved existence of what we call now weak Lira hop solutions. I'm not. I'm not giving a definition of this because I'm not going to use this in the lecture. Weekly rehop solution exists globally and that's the point of this nice solution. But unfortunately we don't know uniqueness of nuclear hope solution. You also can prove existence of Existence of smooth solution, which are which we call now strong solution, and strong solution also you can prove only existence local in time. So it's local in time, strong solubility. And there is a theorem which is nowadays called weak strong uniqueness proof by Lyra, saying that if that strong solution is unique in the Solution is unique in the class of Vickler-Rehop solution. From this, you have a principle and saying that regularity implies uniqueness. So the idea is to study Vuclary-Hop solution, try to prove that solution is smooth, and then you have uniqueness. Because in some sense, uniqueness is an important issue and Issue and it is saying that we have a deterministic description of fluid using using Navier-Stokes equation. So, and this is in this sense, to study regularity makes sense. You have a weak Larry-Hop solution and try to prove that this solution is regular. As usual, in the As usual, in the theory of partial differential equation, you don't need to prove that solution has from C infinity or something like that. You need to prove a kind of intermediate regularity result that solution belongs some space and then linear theory works for you. Theory works for you. This is intermediate space. It's traditionally L infinity, but you can, of course, take another, but this is kind of traditional. And then you having this definition of this intermediate space, you can define the blow-up time. Define the blow-up time. Blow-up time is the time when velocity goes to infinity if small t tends to the capital T. So this is the blow-up type. And in some sense, we are not very much interested in finding blow-up as itself. If you would have a Itself. If you would have a uniqueness, okay, we could survive with this if you have weakly observation unique and having the blow-up time, it's no problem. But in this conception, blow-up is a necessary condition for non-uniqueness. So if you are looking for non-uniqueness, then probably if you find the Probably, if you find the blow-up time, maybe this is the point of non-uniqueness. And again, to study regularity, you can use different methods. For example, you can study regularity of the initial boundary value problem. That is more or less the aim of harmonic analysis. So, you can do So you can do you can use traditional tools of traditional tools of partial traditional tools of the theory of partial differential equation. And in this case, it would be a local regularity theory saying that Howell equation makes solution smoother. If you have some solution with finite energy, then usually Energy, then usually elliptic and parabolic equations make it smoother in smaller domains. And this type of theory was developed by Cavari-Eko-Nirenberg. And the difficulties with respect to the usual regularity theory for partial differential equation is that Navier-Stokes is not completely local. Completely local. But you still can do this. And I want to formulate some result in the theory, which would be a starting point for certain definitions. So in this theory, the right object to study is so-called suitable. Object to study so-called suitable weak solution, solution which are having finite energy, like this. This is finite kinetic energy, this is finite dissipation, and you also need to find some class for the pressure, which has been done by this class is selected by Selected by van Johalin. And this is kind of knowledge about the pressure. It's a kind of prize for the fact that your problem is not completely local. And of course, we and Q suitable weak solutions should satisfy Navier-Stokes equation and in addition they should satisfy local energy inequality. So you cannot You cannot, in contrast to the usual parabolic equation, you cannot produce three items three from one, from the item one and from two. It's not possible. And therefore, we formulated this. The point of why it is reasonable is just because it's just because if you If you have a weak Lorehop solution corresponding to the given initial data, there is at least one having these properties to be a suitable weak solution in any subdomain. And therefore, if you think about that such a solution should be unique, you should first study this. But if you have, in order to prove non-uniqueness, you need to find, for example, Need to find, for example, you need to find the solution that doesn't satisfy local energy inequality. And typical results in the Kafar Elekton-Nurenberg series, so-called Epsom regularity results. And here is this proposition proved by Kaffar Elekon-Nurenberg, saying if you have these functionals and they are small enough. And they are small enough, less than some universal constant. Here is this expression for these functionals. Then any spatial derivative of u-Hilder continues in the half of the parabolic cylinder. So this is everything is considered in this parabolic ball, a cylinder, as you wish. Ball, a cylinder, as you wish. And any spatial derivative is held or continuous in space and time in the half of the cylinder. And you have the right estimate for the supremum with a constant which is universal constant again. This is one type of epsilon regularity theory where this condition is Condition is stated at one scale. But there is another way of doing epsilon regularity theories. Again, there is a universal constant epsilon such that if this functional here, this is a minimum of three limits, for example, three limits less than epsilon, then z. An epsilon, then z naught, the origin of this parabolic sign is a regular point. That is, there exists a positive r small such that V is bounded in this neighborhood, parabolic neighborhood of this point Z naught. And here is this functionals, which are this is a scaled kinetic energy, and this is. kinetic energy and this is scaled dissipation. So the question now what happens now you know that if this guy is sufficiently small then you have regularity. The next question is what happens if this guy is finite or it is equal to infinity. Then if you answer both questions then you know about regularity everything. So but the nature But the nature, sorry, I forgot to say that the nature of these functionals are that they are energetic and scale invariant. So essentially, any statement of epsilon regularity theory saying that if your energy scale invariant, some scale invariant quantities. Variant quantity is sufficiently small, then you have regularity. So now in this way, we define the following thing, that Z naught is assume that Z naught is a singular point. Then, of course, this value mean of these three limits should be positive. Otherwise, Should be positive. Otherwise, it's partial regularity works and solution is smooth in the neighborhood of this point. So it is very reasonable to define type 1 blow-up, type 1 if this quantity is finite, and type 2 if this quantity is equal to infinity. So there's two type of Two types of blow-up. And if you look what happens if this G of Z0 is finite, then you will see that all scale invariant quantities are bounded in the neighborhood of such a point. So it means that you put such an assumption. You put such an assumption on the solutions so that Navier-Stokes anthesis assumption is critical. So, this is, of course, the point where you have to say something. Clearly, that Navier-Stokes is super critical, but you still don't know what happens if you put this additional assumption and Navier-Stokes. Assumption and Navier-Stokes behaves like a critical equation. Okay, this is the motivation. This is a kind of definition which I want to use in what follows. Now let's go to axial symmetry, and this is axial symmetry. We use this silly. We use this cylindrical cardinal, and the cylindrical cardinal has a polar angle. And since we can see the axiom symmetric solution, this polar angle should not, this thing is independent of the polar angle. And we also, it is quite convenient to replace all the ball by the right right circle cylinders. Circle cylinders like this here. And the question is: assume that we incue suitable V solution with axial symmetry in some canonical domain. This is canonical domain. That means you have a cylinder in space and time interval from minus one to zero. And the question whether this origin here is regular point. That is. Here is regular point that is velocity is bounded in the neighborhood, in the parabolic neighborhood of this point. And in the case of axial symmetry, there are in this local setting, the answer is yes, if you have no swirl. If you have no swirl, then solution. world then solution is going to be a regular z naught is going to be a regular point which which has been proved on the local level by kank and vladimir shwira for the for the cashy problem it was proved many many more or less about 60 years ago by ladrizinski and uhovsky and you dovich in a very strong competition door reaching a very strong competition between those two two two groups of peoples right so the the the the point which which i am going to uh to to prove and this is like a conjecture is assume that z is a single point single point of this axis axis symmetric solution then symmetric solution then z is equal to zero must be type type two so again i want to to recall you that if this quantity is bounded that means that all these energy quantities scale scale invariant quantities are abounded that's that's important point Important point, and there are plenty of results about regularity of axial symmetric solution. And if I started to list them, I would say that it would take all my time. And therefore, I'm very sorry if I forgot to mention some names. Some names. But if we go back to the non-epsilon regularity results, so the non-interest cases was proved by Chen, Strain, Tsai, Yao, and Kochnetashvili myself, Svirak, around 2009, 2009. This results saying the This results saying the following. Assume that you have this type of assumption near the origin, right? And C is a constant, which is not necessary to be small, and alpha is from zero to one, anyone. So this is the this is the this is the Cannot be proved by epsilon regularity because it's C is not small. But if C is small, then it follows from epsilon regularity. So the first the first from from now on, from twenty twenty one, the proof of course of those uh statements is not very complicated. Statement is not very complicated. And based on the observations, that once you have these assumptions, then zero is going to be a type one if it is a singular point. And moreover, the corresponding The corresponding scale invariant quantities are bounded in some neighborhood of this point zero. But it's even not necessary to have this in the whole neighborhood, but it's enough to perturb a little bit in the direction of axis of symmetry and in time. Then, then, then, once you have it, Once you have it, then you first you can reduce everything to a certain behavior of solution near the axis of symmetry. So if you use the scaling and the regularity theory for axiosymmetric solution in analus, where analus doesn't contain axis of symmetry, and this is like 2D, 2d, 2d. 2D parabolic equations, then you will have this estimate and plus scaling, of course, and you have this estimate which is exactly corresponds to the case when alpha is equal to one. So every, you know, by this, everything can be, any type of estimate can be reduced to the particular one when alpha is equal to one. one when alpha is equal to one and um and if you look on the on the major rand major rand depends exactly on the on the quantities of which are scale invariant and therefore if you consider type one they should be they should be abounded and then what you have is this and this behavior of v near the axis of symmetry and all this Axis of symmetry and all this estimates are scale invariant and also important value for the axisymmetric case rho times V phi. I don't know how what kind of physical meaning of this. It is also bounded. And once it is bounded and all of them are scale invariant, you can look at this problem using. This problem using zoom and reduce, make this neighborhood bigger and bigger with respect to the scale with the help of the scaling. And you can reduce your problem to a Louville type theorem for bound detention solution. Actually, symmetric. So if z is equal to zero is a singular point, then after zooming Zooming after zooming, we can get non-trivial axiosymmetric bounded engine solution. Here is this bounded, this is the enchanted solution that that is simply a backward solution. So time looking in the opposite direction. And it is bounded and it has a decay at infinity, decay at infinity exactly. Indicate infinity exactly is what happens after scaling because of this assumption. And this guy is also bound. And it is known from 2000. From 2008, it was exactly our way to prove this irregularity: that such a solution must be trivial, that u must be equal to zero. This is Liouville-type theorem, and therefore it is in contradiction that Z is equal to zero is that Z is single-in-point. Because if it is single-in-point, solution must be non-trivial. Solution must be non-trivial. And from this, you can get immediately a statement like this. If you have bounded in time of norm in the critical space where the norm is invalid with respect to Zenobial stock scaling, for example, For example, this is typical critical spaces. Then, in all these critical spaces, you have an axial symmetric solution that must be regular. So, in the first two, you don't need to assume axial symmetry, but for this 3, 1, V kerry 3, B M o minus 1 and best of space minus 1, infinity, infinity. space minus one infinity infinity it it is proved under assumption that that it is axial symmetry and the proof is is maybe very easy or maybe slightly slightly more complicated but the proof is based once you have a critical norm is bounded then then it Norm is bounded, then it should be type one. You need to check that all these energy scale invariant quantities are bounded by your normal, your critical space. And this is, in some cases, it's trivial, in some cases it's not completely trivial, but this is the works like that. So now let's go to a general To a general case, so we assume that V and Q is actually symmetric suitable weak solution and the origin is a singular point. Then Z is equal to zero must be a type 2 blower. So remember that the definition of Definition of type one is completely completely point definition, pointwise definition. So it's just you need just to check things at a given point. That's why this problem is more complicated than we discussed recently. But again, so we use this same fact that it is type 2. That it is type type two and boundness of boundness of this functional is a kind of critical condition. Exactly, the critical condition. About supercritical, slightly supercritical condition, I'm going to talk at the end of this lecture. So, here again, if you have type one, then Type one, then scale invariant quantities, energy scale invariant quantities, all are bounded. So this is singularity. This G is positive and bounded with type 1. And also we have again this very nice quantity of the axisymmetric solution is also going to be bounded. Solution is also going to be bounded, and boundedness of this quantity is a kind of application of the Mosle iteration procedure. It is quite a well-known thing. And again, this guy is scale invariant. So once everything is scale invariant, you can again do zoom and zoom is a parameter. Assume with parameter lambda k which going to zero, and this is like rescaling your solution exactly at the origin, rescale solution exactly at the origin. And then when k goes to infinity, you will get something in the limit, which is a limit of rescale solution. And the properties of the limit of rescale solution, u. Solution, U is going to be a local energy engine solution. That is, a pair U and Q is a suitable weak solution in any cylinder, QR, so with any R centered at the origin. U, of course, and P, actually symmetric solution. In this domain, that means that they are backward tangent solution because time is time is directed in opposite direct in opposite way. And now this all this scaled scaled energy and they are globally bounded. And we also have a boundary Boundedness of this value for X in the semantic solution. And the solution is non-trivial. Moreover, it's not just non-trivial, it has a singularity at the origin. So once we have a singularity at the origin, then this type of zooming keeps the singularity, and you still have singularity. And you still have singularity at zero, saying that this functional is strictly positive for any a for any a between zero and one. So again, you have a question about whether such a solution must be equal to zero or not. Because if it is zero, then you have a contradiction. You have a contradiction. So this solution has nice, since the point that we have energy locally bound, it means that you can apply Kefarelikon-Nirenberg to such type of To such type of solution. In particular, that means that you have partial regularity, that this set of singular points as gamma is one deep rabbit measure in R3 times R is equal to zero. And moreover, all the points, singular points, must be on the axis of symmetries. They cannot be. Axis of symmetries, they cannot be outside of this. And if you subtract this set of singular points, then solution would be good. I mean, this all the spatial derivative of u and therefore of gamma helder continues in this domain. And moreover, gamma is zero. Zero almost everywhere on the axis obsidity. Right. So the gamma itself satisfies this equation here. And this equation is nothing but the scalar equation, heat equation is. equation, heat equation with drift. And what I call this equation governing scalar equation. And the first part of the drift is equal to zero. The divergence of the first part of this is equal to zero. And it was a great interest of study. Study regularity of the heat equation with divergence-free drift because divergence-free drift gives you some additional regularity. And there are plenty of papers on this. But unfortunately, in the axial symmetry, this guy is not, he has divergence. It has a divergence which is not zero. Divergence of this guy is a delta function and also with bed psi. So and but this is guy we are going to look at this guy carefully and we also know from this from the fact that type one you have a type one then all this many many of of Mori norms with the right factor here make it scale invariant. They are bounded just because of these simple embedding theorems. So we first of all we are thinking about the new Will type theorem for this Enshin solution. Ancient solution with The action solution for this equation is drift, and drift has a delta function, and we need to prove this theorem. This type of theorem has been proved by Nazareth Uraliz, but under assumptions that gamma is Lipschitz, Lipschitz continues. The story of this paper is when I thought about When I thought about this heat equation with drift, I asked Professor Orights what she knows about this and she didn't answer me, but they bring a paper on this topic and they include this as some kind of application to the liquid, to the fluids, but they didn't. But they didn't, since they were not experts in this, they put on this function assumptions which are typical for the general theory of partial differential equation. So, our task is essentially to extend their results that this That this alluvial type theorem is true for wider class, which I already tried to explain because this class is motivated by partial regularity theory, by Caffarino-Cohn-Dirinbeck theorem. And solution outside of the axis of symmetry of this equation, of course, should be not so bad. It is bad as. As bad as u is not because this guy is good, and this is everything depends on how u is smooth. So this is the point to define this class where you are going to prove Lew Willtide theorem for this governing scholar. Scholar equation like this here. And this class consists of, it's exactly follows partial regularity. So we're just saying that this function is good enough, except closed set of one depot parabolic measure zero, and this set is exactly. And this set is exactly on the axis of symmetry and all the spatial derivative of u is good and continues outside of the set and you have this estimate. This solution is also bound. This not solution, this is bounded and having this second derivative in space, fifth derivative in time in outside of the axis of symmetry. Okay, so the main this series usual contains some kind of equation, some kind of trick which is which is which is works for this particular equation. This Islama here is describing this and then there is a general scheme which General scheme, which includes some algebraical and some functional, like the Georgian equality, things like that. And then there is a scheme which makes this working. You need just to check that all these points are working for this by the class and just the Lipschitz continuity. And one of these One of these crucial statements, which is maybe, I mean, if you are not expert in this de Georgi and other things, expert then says you nothing, just kind of statement saying that if you have the function satisfying this equation and on the axis of the symmetry it's satisfying The axis of the symmetry satisfied for this inequality for some positive R and it is a bounded, then in smaller ball, it's still be bigger than, but here it is bigger than only an axis of the symmetry, but it is going to be bigger on the whole, maybe half of the ball, but on the whole ball, maybe with small coefficient, but this small coefficient depends. But this small coefficient depends only on the data of the problem. So, if this lemma is proved, then the rest is typical. So, you can take this parameter k as a one-half oscillation of this gamma in this ball, and then all the conditions. All the conditions of lemma hold if you for one of this function, either for this function or for this function, and this m0 is equal to two. And here the gamma, why it is true, because one of the important things is the gamma is zero almost everywhere on the axis of CMT Z, you can get this. You can get this decay for oscillations, and you may iterate this in the direction of increasing the radius, and then you get immediately that gamma is equal to zero. So the main step in the proving of this lemma, which is exactly some kind of specific specific reflects the Reflects the specifics of our situation, which is not, you cannot take this from the general theory. And this type of actually identity for the function p satisfying this type of equation, this bad drift. And you will see the gamma, this p is on the P is on the axis of the symmetry, which is reflection, reflects the fact that the divergence of this bad guy is delta function. So then you can, from this lemma, you can, from this identity, you can get existence of some number between these two values. these two values satisfying this that that this this is going to be a bigger than kappa kr on the fat set and this kappa and delta are just a function of what what we have in assumption and then step two is this how to to get how to get How to get from this final estimate. And this is a long story, but this is more or less based on the two estimates and the general Georgia ticket. So the first estimate is this kind of most Moser estimate for the maximum, and the second one is the energy inequalities. Then, if you can extend this two facts to the new class, then the general theory works for you and finish the proof of Louisville-type theorem. Once you can prove Liouville-type theorem, then government. Then gamma is zero. Therefore, u swirl is zero, but once swirl, if you don't have swirl, you must be smooth, according to Kank's Virac result, you must be a shoulder continuous. And this, of course, contradicts the fact that you have a singularity at the origin. That's how you. At the origin. That's how you can prove you have a contradiction and you are done. But we also can, I would like to mention some slightly supercritical result, where you have regularity and they are in terms of the supercritical functionals. The supercritical functionals, which are, of course, couldn't survive when you do zooming. And the first result in this direction was obtained by PAN in 2016, saying that if this functional, again, scale invariant functional, growing slightly as log, log, then As log, log, then the models of continuity, you have logarithmic models of continuity for the gamma. And this, if you have good properties of the gamma, then you can prove that the solution is going to be a smooth. Whole solution of the Navier stocks is going to be a smooth. I also look at this. I also look at this with the help of technique which I use for the proving glue type theorem and also prove something with different functionals. But I think that this is now going to be some kind of technique producing new and new papers and writing the new and new functionals which are slightly growing. Growing to when r goes to zero and goes to infinity. But in my case, alpha is less than very small as well. But you have a full, full, you have a real Hilder continuity. Maybe for sufficiently small constant, but full full full Hilda continuity. Held the continuity. And from this, one should get the regularity for WS talks in the neighborhood of this origin. It should work. So that's it. Thank you very much for your attention. And so I'm ready to.
