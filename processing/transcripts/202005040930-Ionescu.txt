With his quiet voice and his great results, I'm going to be fascinated to see how it will work on Zoom as well. So, Alex, it's all yours. Thank you, Jalalo. Thank you. Thank you very much for the introduction. Also, thank you for I actually really wanted to thank you and the rest of the organizers for organizing the conference. I think it's a great I think actually I was very happy when I talked to you on the phone about the fact that you're gonna keep the conference. The fact that you're going to keep the conference and the smaller, like maybe not as many talks, but still, I think it's very important that we have this conference here. And also, I'd like to thank you for inviting me to speak in this conference. Now, all of my talk is going to be about work with my collaborator, Hawajia from the University of Minnesota. And so we are talking, I'm going to talk about non-linear stability of certain stationary states. So we are looking at incompressible Euler equation in two dimensions. Most of the talk is going to be about the very simple looking compressible Euler equation in two dimensions. dtu plus u grade u plus gradient of the pressure is equal to zero with the incompressibility condition now the efficient way to look at this Now, the efficient way to look at this equation you all know is through the vorticity formulation. So dt omega plus u grade omega is equal to zero, and u can be recovered as the gradient perpendicular of a stream function. So this is all very standard. u is the gradient perpendicular of psi, where psi is the stream function associated connected to vorticity. Now, of course, it's a very, very classical equation, and there's been a lot of work. Small solutions. And there's been a lot of work. Smooth solutions exist, so they remain smooth and exist globally in time. And this goes back to work of Wolbner and then Judovich for more restricted classes. The vorticity is transported, so the vorticity into the EU conserves all the LP norms, but if it conserves the L infinity norm, it cannot decay, among other things. Now, what is very challenging. Now, what is very challenging, however, and there is a lot of open problems there, is the long-time behavior of smooth solutions. So we know that the solutions exist forever and they stay smooth, but the behavior is very hard to understand, basically because there's no relaxation mechanism in the equations. So the equations, at best, we know the vortices transport. Of course, the LP norms, they stay conserved. What could happen is that the derivatives of the vortices, they get much worse. Of the vortices, they get much worse. So, that's a general conjecture that I'm going to discuss at the very end about what should happen for general kind of vorticities. But a more realistic goal that is going to be the subject of my talk is to study the non-dynamics of solutions that are close to certain steady states. So, one in principle thinks that we start near a steady state and in Steady state. And in that case, we would like to really understand what's happening with the vorticity and with the entire flow, so the velocity as the time goes to infinity. Now, one thing about 2D Euler, you cannot perturb around the zero solution. The solution omega or u is equal to zero, of course, a solution, but one cannot perturb around it. There is nothing to keep it stable. So, what we perturb around is the coherent structures, and they are. They're coherent structures, and there are two very important types of coherent structures for the 2D Euler: the shear flows and the vortices. And they're important because a 2D Euler is a very simple equation to simulate numerically. And it turns out that they become, the physical experiments and the numerical simulation show that they become the dominant feature, dynamically they become the dominant feature of the Dynamically, they become the dominant feature of the flow. And I will have a little movie at some point showing that basically these vortices, in particular the vortices, they tend to form dynamically, and it's so the coherent structures tend to form dynamically. It's as if it was dynamically, and eventually, I mean, you'll see a movie at some point about how this vortices form. This vortices for. Now, this is a very classical subject, the study of stability properties of these steady states, a very classical subject and one of the most important problems in hydrodynamics. And it goes back a long time. It goes back to the 19th century. There are two papers that are usually referenced as the starting point of this field. There are papers of Raleigh and Kelvin. The paper of Raleigh is on the stability or instability of certain... Is on the stability or instability of certain fluid motions. In the paper of Kelvin, the stability of fluid motion, rectilinear motions of viscous fluid between two plates. These are two very classical papers. One of them actually refers to some earlier work of Stokes that presumably asked the question that was answered in this the second paper, the paper of Kelvin. Now I couldn't find this other paper of Stokes, it goes too far back. In any case, so the focus in this So the focus in these papers is to understand mode stability, which means linear stability. So the flow is linearized around what is the coherent state, and then one tries to understand what would be the linear stability of the flow. Now, to get some idea of how it works, so what's involved, I'm going to start the simplest example, which is explicit. One example is explicit, and that can be used to understand how things work. And how things work. Now, the explicit example: so, the shear flows, these are functions defined on a cylinder. So, one takes a cylinder, the cylinder is the torus in one dimension, and an interval could be finite or infinite. And so, the cylinder, the shear flows are defined on the cylinders, and their solutions of the form B of y. The form b of y, so y is the variable in the interval, not on the torus, so they don't depend on the variable on the torus, b of y, zero. So these are the shear flows, and it turns out that they are solutions of the 2D Euler. And one can look at the stability of when we write, so when we look at the stability of the shear flow, so we look at the solution of the form b of y, zero plus a perturbation, is written as u of x, Here is written as u of x, y. So u is not the same u is in the phrase. Capital U is the full velocity field. Little u becomes the perturbation. And if we write, so then the vorticity is also, the vorticity is minus, the vorticity is omega, which is the perturbation of the full vorticity. And the Euler equation, after we do all of these transformations, becomes dt omega plus b of y dx omega minus b double prime of y dx psi plus cube red omega is equal to zero, where it's psi. is equal to zero, where psi is recovered from omega through the elliptic equation, delta psi is equal to omega. And the u is also then recovered from psi is the gradient perpendicular psi. So this is the equation for the for the for the the difference between the flow and the shear flow. Shear flow. And now, just to see the mechanism that we like to establish, the simplest case which is explicit is when B of Y is equal to Y, the quad flow. And I, so the interval on which everything is defined, is the real line, so this becomes the infinite cylinder. Now, in that case, the linearized equation, the linear level, the point is that b double prime is equal to zero. The worst term is this non-local term, b double prime of y dx. This non-local term, B double prime of y dx psi. If B of y is linear, so B of y is equal to y, then this term disappears. And at the linear level, we simply have the equation dt omega plus y times dx omega is equal to 0. One can solve this explicitly starting with initial data, and the solution is omega of t comma x comma y is omega 0 of x minus y t comma y. Now we can move this to we can move this. To we can move this to the Fourier space, and we get in the Fourier space that omega k, so k is the kth mode taken in the variable, in the periodic variable, so the kth mode in the periodic variable. And it turns out that this entire equation is decoupled, so everything decouples in the modes in the periodic variable. So, omega k of ty is equal to each. k of Ty is equal to e to the minus I k Ty times the initial data omega 0 or the kth mod omega 0 k of y. And if we just look at this equation, what happens is the following. When k is equal to 0, so there are two basic cases. When k is equal to 0, the mode doesn't change. So the omega k because the exponential e to the ikty, this exponential here, that's equal to 1. That's equal to 1. So the solution doesn't change. So the mode k is equal to 0 simply stays constant. Now, all the other modes, let's say k is equal to 1, all the other modes, as the time goes to infinity, oscillate faster and faster. So for example, if, let's say the k is equal to 1, then the solution is going to be e to the minus ity times a small function of y. Now, as the time goes to infinity, it oscillates faster and faster. So all the atoms, they converge. So, all the other models they converge weakly to zero as the time goes to infinity. Notice they don't converge strongly. So, if we compare, this is actually one of the critical difficulties. The converts are not strong. If we compare this with example, for example, with dispersive equations, then we do have some convergence to zero of all the other modes, but in a weak sense, there is no strong convergence, not like one over Tka in the decay. There's no strong convergence in the problem. That's what is the fact that. That's what's due to the fact that this is a transport equation. So this is kind of like the best picture we can hope: that the zero mode does not, the zero mode doesn't increase. Of course, it's not going to decrease, but doesn't increase. And the other modes go to zero because of oscillation. Now, there are some things that decrease, which is at the level of the stream function, at the level of the velocity fields. So the stream function. Velocity fields. So the stream function you can also calculate explicitly again, it splits in modes. So you have psi, psi is the stream function, is omega 0 c plus k t divided by k squared plus c squared. Now if we look at this expression, if we pretend that omega 0 was a smooth function, then this should be the numerator is okay is more is big and is big only if is big only if t is equal, only if c is equal to minus kt, in which case the denominator becomes small as the time goes to infinity. So either way, this expression is going to become small as the time goes to infinity. And it turns out that one can get the rate, so psi k this decay is quality like 1 over k squared times t to the minus 2 for any k different from 0. Again, for k is equal to 0, this doesn't happen, but for any k different from 0, we have decay. And once we have the decay of the stream function, we can Of the stream function, we can track the decay of the velocity fields and we get that qx decay. So they have different rates of decay, the two components. And it turns out that it's important that the rate of decay of the component qy is 1 over t squared. It's not 1 over t. So ux decays only like 1 over t, but uy actually decays a little bit better. It decays like 1 over t squared, and that's an important part of the proof. So at the end of the day, the velocity field is going to converge to The data velocity field is going to converge to another shear field. So, this is the picture that one sees from this explicit example. I want to read very slowly just to understand the various pieces. Even in this very trivial, in this very simple, explicit example, one can see that the mechanism is not the same as you take, for example, for wave equations or for Schrodinger equations, because there is no, it's a transport equation. There's no real decay in the equation. It's all at the weak level. And this is what's called the mechanism of. And this is what's called the mechanism of in V C damping. So I summarize it here. The non-zero modes of the vorticity, they oscillate faster and faster as the time goes to infinity. This means that the corresponding modes of the velocity, they go to zero in a qualitative sense. And because what transports the flow is the velocity, in principle, if one can make this whole scheme work, in principle, this could lead to convergence both in the linearized Convergence both in the linearized and the nonlinear problem. Now, to prove asymptotic stability, there are major, I mean, of course, this is very much of a just at the intuitive level. To really prove things, there are several things we need to be aware of. And one of them is the presence of non-decaying solutions. So if you have some other shield, of course, for the Some other shear flow, of course, for the quad flow, that is not the case, but for other shear flows, you can very well have solutions that don't decay. And then for those, if you have those, then which would be corresponding to eigenfunctions. And if you have those, of course, there is no, the whole scheme breaks down. So that's something that we need to be aware of if we want to think of more general problems, even at the linear level. If we want to think, that happens at the linear level. Linear level. And you need to be aware of those if you want to prove anything about the non-linear equations. Now, so here I wrote all the formulas in the case where we don't have boundary, so we don't have, so the torus an infinite torus, it's an infinite cylinder, so it's the circle times an infinite interval. It turns out that if we want to get finite energy solutions, which is what I like to get, then To get, then one has to work. This doesn't have finite energy, so you can work in finite channels. Now, the finite channels have boundaries, and the boundaries have a tendency to disrupt this mechanism. So, this mechanism that's based on weak convergence, this gets disrupted by the boundaries. Now, also in the nonlinear problem, so just looking forward to what we want to understand, in the nonlinear problem, there's one other critical issue, which is that the final state that we expect. Which is that the final state that we expect to converge to is going to be a different shear flow. We are not going to converge to the same shear flow. We know that for sure. So it's going to be a different shear flow. And in fact, if you picture any nearby, any flow that's, shear flow that's close to the original could be a candidate for the final state. And that's an infinite family of possible final states. Even the infinite dimensional family, any function that's smooth and depends just on white counts as a possible final state. And somehow the Final state. And somehow the evolution itself needs to detect the non-linear evolution, to figure out which one to go to. And that's usually a pretty... It turns out that in this point it's not too bad. This would have been a much worse issue of finding the, how does the solution find the final state? It turns out that in this case it's possible. It's a non-linear mechanism, but one has to keep it in mind. So the proof is has to be arranged in order to go. Has to be arranged in order to go to understand this issue. Now, so as I want to move towards the main theorem that we have, I'm going to start with the linear stability. So, as I said, the linear stability is a problem that's very much studied. I think that at least for both Euler and for Navier-Stokes equations, there are at least, I would say, at least 100 papers going back to the papers from the 19th century of Radley and Kelvin and their class. Century of Raleigh and Kelvin, then there are classical papers of Orr, Taylor, Fadev, McWilliams. And then there are lots of decades in between those papers and the last papers that are all in the last five years. The list of papers, the recent papers are these papers by Drossian, Cotizelativicol, Zielinger, Guenier, Nguyen, Rosé Soffer, and Wei Zhang Zhao. So these are some of the recent papers. There are more. I just put here some of the recent papers we looked at. They all at the So, the question is to understand the linear stability of these flows, of other coherent states, not just shear flows, both for Euler and for Navier-Stokes, and to understand, starting from old stability, to understand the decay. Now, there's also a general result on orbital stability of Arnold, and it uses the energy method, the energy Casimir method. Now, this result is an orbital stability result. It does not give information on the global dynamics, but it doesn't say that the vortice is going to converge, that the flow is going to converge to another shear flow. It says more like it stays in the neighborhood of that. So these are the results of the linear stability. There are lots of results. I'm not going to talk more about them because I want to move to the non-linear stability. And at the level of the Of the non-linear stability, non-linear symptotic stability, the only three results. So it's much easier to discuss all of them here. So there are only three results, starting with the results, the remarkable work of Bedross and Elmas Mouli from 2015. They're all very recent on the quad flow in the infinite cylinder domain T cross R, which is the problem that I discussed the linear flow for. Now, this was extended by how. Was extended by Haoji and myself to the finite channel. Our point was to demonstrate that one can actually produce finite energy solutions by this mechanism. So the solutions, if you work on the entirely aligned, the problem is a little easier because one doesn't have the effect of the boundary, but the solutions are not going to be finite energy. And we show that if we work on the finite channel, so the channel t times the interval 0, 1, then we do end up, we can extend the Up, we can extend the UVC damping mechanism and we end up with finite energy solutions. So, this is one topic: the quad flow. Point vortices, which is, I'm going to describe them at the end, and geon-monotonic shear flow satisfying a suitable spectral assumption in the finite channel. And this is recent work from January of Hauji and myself, and it's independent by Mass Moudin Shaw. By Mass Moudin Shaw. So, this is all very recent. The theorems are almost the same. So, the theorems that Hao and I have, and Mass Moudin and Shaw, they're almost the same, except for the topology. But otherwise, at the core issue, the assumptions, they are the same. So, it's the same spectral assumption that one needs to make in order to get MVC damping. So, that's the and my plan. So, the plan for the talk is to describe the last two results. So, I'm going to start with the germ monotonic shear flows. With the germ monotonic shear flows, and then I'm going to talk about point vortices. So, I'm going to start by stating the theorem. The theorem is the following. So assume that we start with initial data. So, we are on the, so we work in the torus in the channel, which is the circle times the interval from zero to one. And assume that the start initial data has compact support. Initial data that has compact support strictly inside, so that's an important assumption. The initial data has to have compact support strictly inside the channel, and it has to be small. So, I'm only stating the equation at the level of the difference between the vorticities. So, we start with data that's small, and the smallness here is measured in a certain Gevre class. I'm going to explain on the next slide what this class is. And then we are looking, omega of D is the solutions, they are looking at omega of D. They're looking at omega of t is the solution of this of the 2D Euler, the full non-linear 2D Euler. It's the same equation they had a little bit earlier. So dt omega plus b of y dx omega minus the non-local term b double prime of y dx psi plus u, this is the non-linear term, u times grade omega, that's equal to zero. And with the same u and psi, they are derived out of omega. And then the conclusions, and then the important, so this there's an important side. So, there's an important assumption you make on the shear flow B, which I'm going to have it on the next slide. It's a little longer, so I'm going to describe it on the next slide. So it's this condition capital B that I wrote here. So if we have these assumptions, then we have asymptotic stability in the following very precise sense. That omega, after you renormalize omega of t and then you renormalize the variables, we have to take back the linear flow. The linear flow, so it's omega of t plus x plus t times b of y, so you have to unwind the linear flow, and then you have to make a non-linear perturbation. So the phi is given as the integral. So this is what I was saying, that one has to understand the final, to understand the final state, one has to, it has to form dynamically. So this function phi describes how it forms. So if we look at omega and then we take this transformation. and when we take this transformation in the x is in the periodic variable then that converges to a final state f infinity of x y in a certain norm and with a certain speed so that's so this is the symptomic stability we can also see this in a slightly less precise way the level of the velocity field so you can calculate if we write the velocity fields in terms of the final vorticity in the natural way so you can calculate So he can calculate q as ux and uy. Then the zero mode, this is the average of ux, the zero mode of ux will converge to this final state, u infinity of y, in this norm, and at a certain speed, epsilon times t to the minus two. While all the higher modes of ux, they go to zero at the speed epsilon times t to the minus one. And the other component of the velocity field, uy, that also goes to zero. That also goes to zero at a better speed, epsilon times t to the minus two. So we have, so this is the precise description. This is what I mean by asymptotic stability. We have the vorticity, we show how it converges after we make suitable changes of variables, we show how it converges, and we say that the velocity field associated to this vorticity, it wants to converge to a new shear flow, which is described by the function u infinity. function u infinity. Okay, so that's the so this is the the m. Now I have some remarks. The Gevrein ones. So the spaces where we run the scheme, it has to be the whole scheme works only Javre norms. So these are the Gervre norms are defined in the following way in which we take the Fourier transform and then we multiply by e to the lambda times the size of the Fourier transform times the size of the frequency to a certain power s and that s is important so that's the that's the that's the Gerris class. The S is more important than the lambda. In our case s is equal to one half so we need to so we need to have a certain strong smoothness in order to be able to prove asymptotic stability. And that's something that's not just in our proof. That's needed in all the cases including the Including the quet flow. And even going back to slightly simpler equations like the plus of Poisson, in order to have this kind of convergence, it's the classical theorem of Mouhaudani. One needs to work in geovic classes. Now, there's a recent result of Daniel Massmoudi, who showed that in fact there is a good reason to work. In fact, you need to if you want to run the same scheme, then you have to work in a Juray class, otherwise there's a certain cascade. Otherwise, there's a certain cascade. It's a non-linear cascade that leads to instability. Now, I'm going to describe the main function B. So, the main function B has to satisfy some assumptions. So, in order to have the stability, we need to know a few things about the function B. First of all, it has to be very smooth, a little bit smooth, it has to be very smooth, relative to the same class GV1 half. Now, it also has to be monotonic. has to be monotonic. So the only way I can prove in VC damping so far is if we look at monotonic shear flows. So this is the B prime is between a small constant and the B constant. And it has to be linear around the boundaries. This is because the boundaries would otherwise the boundaries would change, would not allow for the invisible. The boundaries have the so-called boundary effect that prevents MVC damping if the boundary If the boundary effect comes in. Now, being linear means that the non-local term does not come in near the boundaries, because the non-local term was b double prime of y times psi, and if b double prime of y is equal to zero near the boundaries, then it doesn't come in. And so these are the assumptions. Now, there's also the spectral assumption. So the spectral assumption says that if we look at the associated linearized docker, and here I wrote it on every mode at a time, at the linearized level, At a time. At the linearized level, the problem splits. So every mode they only interact with the same mode, so the problem splits in modes. And the linear operator is LKF is B of Y times F minus B double prime minus B double prime of Y times Phi K, where phi K is calculated as the Laplacian, as the solution of the Laplace equation, dy2 minus k square phi k is equal to f. And the assumption is that there are no discrete eigenvalues. Doppler doesn't have any. Discrete eigenvalues. Dopwer doesn't have any discrete eigenvalues. This is an assumption that's needed in order to have the linear damping. So, in some sense, our theorem says that under these assumptions that are needed just to have the linear damping, we actually prove full non-linear damping, at least as long as we look at small Gervais pertotations. So, that's the final conclusion. Now, I wanted to. I wanted to give some ideas about the proof. So I wanted to give some ideas about the proof. Now, one thing that we have to be aware, I mentioned it earlier, we really need to be aware of the fact that we need to find the final state. The only way you can prove that it will converge to something is if we find a mechanism to discover the final state. Discover the final state as we move non-linearly through the evolution. And that, in general, in many of these soliton stability problems, that becomes a big issue because you can have a family of solitons and you need to converge to another soliton. In this case, we actually have an infinite family of solitons. We have lots of an infinite dimensional family of solitons. So that would be very bad. Thankfully, there is a very simple change of variables. It turns out that what makes it work is the fact that you're in a low dimension here. You're in a low dimension here, so there are not that many degrees of freedom. And it's a very simple change of variables that takes care of this. And I wanted to write it here because it's really very simple. And without this type of, it would be much harder to prove anything if we didn't have this type of change of variables to deal with the issue of what is the final state. This already goes back to the work of Bedros and Mass Modi. That's the same. The analogous change of variable is also needed in the case of the coet flow. So the change of variable is that one makes the change of variable v is equal to b of y, and then there's this non-linear term, the average 1 over t times the interval from 0 to t of one of the velocity components, ux. And yeah, so this is just the zero mode of that velocity component. And then the change of variable in the periodic variable is x is z is equal to x minus tv. Z is equal to X minus Tv. And afterwards, we can construct the natural variables F and Phi. These are the variables that are obtained by using the change of variable on the vorticity and also on the stream function. And then we have some functions V prime, V double prime, and V dot, which have to do the change of variable itself. And the profile F, so F now is going to be the profile that we want to show it converges. Going to be the profile that we want to show it from. We're just going to satisfy an equation, and I wrote it down. So it's dtf minus b double prime dz phi is equal to v prime times dv phi times dzf plus another term of dz phi times dvf. And the stream function normalized after this change of variable satisfies an elliptic looking equation of the form dz2 phi plus dv minus d dz phi squared times v phi square phi plus another term is equal to f. plus another term is equal to f. And one can also write one can also write equations for the variables v prime and v dot, which are which are needed in order, because at the end of the day we need to run a big bootstrap that controls both the function capital F and phi. So we want to control the functions capital F and phi. And we also want at the same time to control the change of variables because they come in. So if you look at the main equation, the only way to control F is if The only way control F is if we know something about V prime and about V dot. So we need to have equations for them as well. I didn't write them here because they get too long. Now, in our case, we cannot do this directly because this is not quite a profile. It's not quite a profile as we think about it, for example, in dispersive equations. It turns out that we need to use an auxiliary profile. So the auxiliary profile is F star. It's a very important object. starts a very important object is f minus the contribution of the non-local term, which is frozen at time t is equal to zero, which is b double prime of v times the interval of from zero to t of dz phi prime. And phi prime, so we also need to change the stream function by freezing the coefficients at time t is equal to zero. So we have an equation for phi prime, which is the same as the equation for phi, but with the coefficients v prime being frozen at time t. V prime being frozen at M P is equal to zero. Okay, so these are the basic equations we are looking at. So we have a profile for the vorticity, we have the stream function, and we have some variables that have to do with the change of variables. Now, the proof proceeds by looking by considering time-dependent energy functionals, and all of the energy functions of the same of this form. We are looking This form, we are looking, so this would be a generic one. So you are looking to define a weight. Everything is in the Fourier space. So all the energies that are measured in the Fourier space, there's a very good reason for that, which becomes clear at the end of the slide. So all the energy functions there of the form a k of, so we have a k of t x c times integral times the Fourier transform of f at t kc, and then that's the L2 norm of that, so the L2 norm squared. The L2 norm of that, so the L2 norm squared, and then we have to take so the F's, they are going to be all these objects that we need to measure. We need to measure the vorticity, we need to measure the vorticity, the profile F, and then we need to measure the auxiliary profile, and then we need to measure the stream function. So, we need energy functions for all of them. So, we have energy functions for all of them, and then they so then we have to run a big bootstrap involving all of these energy functions. Now, there's one. Now, there's one critical issue here, which again goes back to the work to the great flow, the work of Budros and Masmuri, namely, which we need to deal with anyway, namely is the issue of resonance. So, what complicates the problem a lot, makes it much harder, for example, than Blasso-Poisson, is that there are these resonances. So, the resonances come in the following way. If we think in a best case scenario, you could think that the The stream function, normalized stream function phi, would be obtained by taking by looking at the Fourier transform of f and dividing by the factor k squared plus c minus k d square. This factor comes in if we look at the equation for phi. The equation for phi at best dv prime was equal to 1. This would be dz2 phi plus dv minus d dz to phi. So that's so this is this is how you can think of the stream function. Of the stream function. And then the worst contribution is coming from what's called the reaction term, in which we have dv of phi times dz of f. So this is this term, pretending even that v prime is equal to 1. And now this was the derivative because in the case when the time, so if you think that k squared plus c minus kt squared is very small relative to c, then this will lose the derivative. Because dv will still count as a derivative, while the denominator doesn't help in that case. Doesn't help in that case. So, in that case, when it's to, so that's that's what's called the resonant case. So, the resonant case when t is the time is equal to the frequency divided by the frequency divided by the eta over L, where L is the periodic frequency. And in that case, one needs to arrange the weights in a very special way. So, there's a certain form, there's a certain, and so these weights need to be arranged in a special way around this critical time. Way around this critical time. And in fact, in order to be able to construct such weights, one needs to start with the Jevre regularity because you keep losing regularity as you move up in time. And the only way to keep something at the end is if we start with Jevre regularity. So that's the... So these are the argument that works. This is the argument we do to prove the energy estimates. Now, there's a quick Now, there is a critical difficulty in the case of general shear flows, which is not in the case of the quad flow, and that comes from the non-local term B double prime times DC phi. So here I rewrote the equation for the profile, dtf minus b double prime times dc phi is equal to the nonlinearity. Now this cannot be if unless we assume that if we if we don't assume that b double prime is small, which would have meant original assumption. Which would have meant originally assuming that B double prime is small. This is not perturbative. You want to think about this perturbative. So then, what do we do? As I said, we have this auxiliary profile, which we define as if this term was not here. So we subtract it. And then the auxiliary profile, we can bound it using the energy estimates. Now, the main step afterwards is we have to understand the difference. So what did we So, what did we lose when we moved from the real profile to the auxiliary profile? And we know this cannot be too trivial because so far we haven't used the spectral assumption on B. So, we have to remember that. And it's at this stage that we need to use the spectral assumption on B. So, the picture is the following. So, we can think of this as so we can start the DML formula, and after we start the DML formula, we have to study. We have to study a homogeneous linear problem. And the homogeneous linear problem is the following: we can also, everything can be decomposed in modes here. So it's dtgk plus ikvgk minus ikb double prime times phi k is equal to zero. And the initial data we have to introduce. So the initial data is some kind of a smooth data xk or v, but you also need to introduce this general oscillation. This general oscillation, the minus Ikv, in order to be able to use the DMF. And then the phi k is obtained out of GK using this elliptic-looking equation. And that's basically, so we need to understand the solutions of this problem. We also need to understand them with respect to the complicated ways that we had to work with anyway, because all of these other issues that have to do with the critical times, they're also going to be there anyway. And for this, what we use is a spectral. And for this, what we use is a spectral we use the spectral representation formula. So you basically prove a representation, almost an explicit representation. Of course, not explicit, but it's a representation of the function gk in terms of xk. So it's this integral formula, gk of dx, the Fourier transform g k of dxi, is this integral, and here we have this kernel pi k. Now pi k is not an explicit kernel because this is a general This general, so use the spectral is used, it can be, it's not explicit, can be written in terms of generalized eigenfunctions. So basically, we have this formula, this is a kind of a general formula one can get, and the point is to be able to show, that is, to prove general, good enough estimates on this kernel. Now, the main difficulty is we have to prove estimates relative to the weights you're going to use. And those weights were pretty complicated to begin with because you have to deal with other things. Have to deal with other things and that required actually to modify all the weights because they required to be a little bit more smooth in some of the variables. So this kernel is not explicit, so in order to be able to analyze it relative to the weights in which we need to prove estimates, that's the main part of the paper. But okay, so it can be done, and at the end, we are able to control this, so able to control. So, able to control the flow. Okay, so this is basically the theorem about general shear flows. It's in many ways it's optimal. And in fact, we worked independently from Smoli and Shaw and somehow, but at the end of the day, the theorem was the same. There's no real room there to change in the case of shear flows. Okay, now in the last 10 or 15 minutes or so, I'm going to talk about a different topic, very closely related, but a different type of coherent state, which are the vortices. As I said, Euler equations in 2D, they have lots of coherent states, lots of stationary solutions, and vortices are what I think are the most important ones. Vortices in the plane. Vortices are just a radial function. So any radial function, any radial function is a stationary solution. Any radial function is a stationary solution of the Euler equation. Of course, you cannot hope to prove that they're all going to be stable, so they have to have some conditions. So, most radial functions are not going to be stable, but the hope is that the ones that decrease, so they start at the largest point and eventually decrease, the hope is that those might be stable. And in fact, words are extremely important because they are forming dynamically. So, I wanted to show you a video. Let's see if I can do this. Let's see if I can do this. So, this video now. Let's see. Can you see the video? Let's see. New share. Let's see. I still don't see the video, Alex. Okay, maybe that works now. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so this is a V. Okay, so this is a video that shows what happens with the general vorticity starting on the torus. It's not exactly in the planes on the torus because the picture is pretty on the torus. So this is this way general vorticity is positive and negative. It's transported, so it's going to stay positive and negative. The two colors are positive and negative. And as we see, the picture gets cleaner and cleaner. So the vortices, we started out in very Is we started out with very small, very small, like kind of a general vorticity, but let's see what happens in just a few seconds. All of this starts interacting with each other. At the end of the day, you're only going to have two vortices, one positive and one negative. So that's why the vortices are an important solution of the vortices are important. That's why the vortex are an important solution of the Euler equations because, in fact, they are the solution that forms most naturally in evolutions. Now, the picture is a little bit, so basically I wanted to make this point that vortex are important. The picture is a little bit held by two factors. So the picture in general is a little bit more complicated. First of all, all these vortices find each other and collide and form a bigger vortex. And form a bigger vortex because they are in a periodic case. Otherwise, they could also go to infinity at different rates and not collide. So, you'd have at the end in the plane, you'd expect to have a picture in which the vortex would also separate from each other. So, that's one thing. And the other thing is this is actually for the Navier Stokes, which makes the picture cleaner. So, it's Navier Stokes with a very high Reynolds number, which makes the picture cleaner. It eliminates quickly the Quickly, the small scales. So, the scales under the squirrel of the Reynolds number, they get eliminated very quickly. Now, vortices are a very beautiful problem. I think this would be to show that, in fact, I mean, of course, it'd be very hard to show that vortices form dynamically in this way, that's like a solid or resolution. It would be very complicated to show that they actually form dynamically. But at the very least, we need to show that they are stable. That in principle, if one starts with the vortex, starts with a vortex. A vortex from now on I'm gonna when I say vortex I'm gonna mean a solution that's radial but there's not enough has to be radial decreasing. So the only ones that can be stable are the ones that are radially decreasing. And one could at least hope to understand the stability of these vortices. And at the linearized level, this was done very recently by Bedrossi and Cortizalati and Vico. And they have exactly the theorem that, the expected theorem, that if we start, if you start at the Theorem that if we start, if you start the linear, if you start the linearized equation around the vortex, the solution is going to converge to a slightly different vortex. Now, we like to prove this at the non-linear level, but this is pretty hard to do. We started with the simplest case of vortices, which is what's called point vortices. So, point vortices is a delta mass. You can think of delta mass as a radial function. And the vorticity, so it starts. And the vorticity, so it starts out as the radial function, the delta function, multiplied by kappa. Kappa has to be non-zero. Any kappa would be, any non-zero kappa would be good. So the vorticity starts out as a delta mass plus some smooth function. And then what we would like to do is to understand what happens as the time goes as the time flows, what happens with this picture dynamically. And so the vorticity is kappa times delta. It turns out that the vortex surface to move. So the vortex cannot stay at zero. It's moved by the vorticity. So the correct picture is to think that the vorticity that we are looking at is delta at the point P of t, where p of t is obtained as part of the equations, plus the perturbation, the smooth function omega. Then we can calculate the velocity field, of course. And then we can look at the equations. And I'm going to describe here the main theorem. So the perturbation omega of the point vortex satisfies this equation, dt omega plus u grade omega plus the non-linear term little u grade omega. So this is the perturbation is equal to zero. Capital U is obtained in this way. It corresponds to the contribution of the vortex. And little u is obtained through the Through the stream function in the same way as before. And the center P of t also has to satisfy an R D. The center is moved by the flow. So basically P of T, P prime of T is the gradient perpendicular of psi at the point T, P of T. This is in order to preserve the condition that the vortex itself is moved by the flow. So these are the two, the coupled equations. So you have an equation for omega and we have an equation for P. And the theorem that we have, it's the first kind of theorem for vortices. And the theorem says that the first non-linear kind of theorem for vortices, the theorem says that if we start with a smooth function omega, smooth again, smooth as in a Girvere space, then the solution is going to be global. And also an important feature not only has to be smooth, but it has to be supported away from the center of the vortex. The center of the vortex. The equations are not well posed, they don't work properly, they're not well posed properly if the center touches the delta mass, if the other function touches the delta mass. So it has to be supported away. So then the conclusion is that starting with this initial setting, then this initial setting is going to be preserved in the way it can be done. So the vortex itself moves according to a trajectory P of P. Trajectory P of T and the function omega of T and it's stabilized, so it moves and goes towards a point, stabilized rapid to a certain to a final point. And the vorticity omega of t is going to converge weakly to a smooth function omega infinity, which is radial with respect to the center of the vortex. So the final picture, of course, is to be stable, in which the vorticity is radial, and the whole function counts is radial. Counts as radial, so it doesn't move anymore. So we have this kind of convergence in which the vortexes of the center moves, and the vortex becomes radial around the new center. Okay, so I'm going to, this is also a problem that can be solved by NDC damping, and it has a certain types of difficulties. Now it can be done in the following way. Um now it can it can be done in the following way. So we can work everything has to be um everything has to be measured relative to the center. So the the the system is when we have to look at the dynamical system because there's a big difference when you're talking about radial functions. So the final state can only be a radial function. You're talking about radial functions, the question becomes relative to what point. And so it's very important to determine at every time how we measure radiality. How we measure radiality. And so we have to use a polar system of polar coordinates around the center of the entire picture. And then we write equations, so we have dt omega prime, and then we have some contributions here coming from the vortex, and then we have some non-linear contribution. And then we have an equation calculating the stream functions in terms of omega prime. And there's a very important equation. important equation that's mainly the new thing relative to the shear flows is that the vortex itself moves so you have an equation P prime of P is equal to something times of omega prime now the main decaying mechanism so what makes the decay mechanism so the the invasive damping mechanism is due to this factor kappa this linear factor kappa divided by 2 pi r squared d dzeta omega prime and if we were to look at the linearized problem And if we were to look at the linearized problem just with that, corresponding just to that factor, then we'd have a simple solution, an explicit solution, just like in the quet flow. And we also can write, at the linear level, we can write the formula for the stream function. And then given that formula for the stream function, we could derive all the natural you could derive all natural bounds on the velocity fields at the linear level. Velocity fields at the linear level. So, as a result, one can, at the linear level, one can derive, one can find all the, one can prove the theorem at the linear level. Now, there's a critical difficulty that has to do with the movement of the vortex. Namely, this vortex has to move very, very, it has to get very quickly. That's the main thing that has to happen, that the vortex has to get very quickly to its final state. If it was traveling kind of slowly and taking a long time, then this would disrupt this, it wouldn't be. Disrupt this, it wouldn't be, it would this concept of radiality becomes too weak if the vortex keeps moving, keeps moving slowly. It has to get very quickly to the final state. In fact, it has to get there in an exponential time in order to have a chance to close the estimates. It's the motion of the vortex that could upset this mechanism. Thankfully, at least in this case, we are able to show that we are able to solve the the full nonlinear problem. Solve the full non-linear problem. And so that's the way I see this, this kind of like a step towards the general, all of these difficulties, they will have to be there in the general vortex problem as well, because the vortex is expected to move. Of course, one has to understand where the center is. So all of these tissues have to be there as well in the general vortex problem. Also, one One issue that I can discuss here is that one has to look at all of these, all of these become variable coefficient equations. In the case when we have these functions, the general functions depend on R, for example, all of these become variable coefficient equations, and we still need to see the resonant times, which you can only do in the Fourier space. So one has to find a way to properly work in the Fourier space with equations that have the available coefficient equations. Okay, so that's these are. Okay, so these are basically the two theorems I want to talk about. Now I just have some conclusions I wanted to go through as a summary of what I said. Now, at the nonlinear level, the invisible damping is a very, very delicate global stability mechanism. It's a lot more delicate than what we see, for example, in dispersive equation or wave equations. The only way this can work is that the vorticity, the whole vorticity has to go in a very controlled way to higher and higher frequency. In a very controlled way to higher and higher frequencies, it has to leave almost nothing behind, and so this whole transfer has to happen in a very controlled way. And because of this, this so far has only been improved for 2D Euler type of evolutions. Now, there's another direction that I didn't talk about here because I haven't done work in it, which is to look, instead of looking at NVC damping, to look at the corresponding problem for the For the Navier stocks. And in that case, the whole thing can be done a lot more robustly if you allow for the perturbations to also depend on the viscosity parameter. So if the perturbation allows usually like a power of the viscosity parameter, then the whole picture is much more robust. So it's much more likely to be able to get theorems. Now, the theorems that we proved are consistent with what is a general, I call it conjectural though. A general, I call it conjecture, although there's no way to prove something like this. So it's a general conjecture that says that basically for generic initial data, the vorticity omega of t will converge weakly, but not strongly as the time t goes to infinity. So this is a very general conjecture. I don't see how one, of course, in our case it holds. So in our case, we're looking at perturbations of shear flows or at perturbations of vortices. The convergence is weak, but it's not strong. Is weak but is not strong. Now, in general, of course, there are initial data for which that's not true because you can have time-periodic solutions or things like that. So, it's not always true. Of course, the expectation is that that will be true for generic. And I wrote here some natural problems that some of them we are working on and some of them some. So, as I said, this has only been done in 2D. I don't know of any results in 3D that go. Know of any results in 3D that go for the Euler equation that go in this way. There's also the problem that the hardest problem of described, the non-linear stability of radially decreasing vortices. And also one could see this as a possible mechanism for other equations. There's this other equation, the SQG, the generalized SQG, which is kind of a more difficult version of the Euler equations for which it's not known to construct any global. For which it's not known to construct any global solutions. So, for example, for the generalized SQG, it's not known to construct any smooth global solutions in part because it's a little bit less smooth than the Euler equations. One cannot perturb around zero, of course, just like in the Euler equation. So, because of that, it's not known how to construct any global solutions for that. But one can hope that this kind of mechanism might work in that type of problem. Okay, so I'm going to stop here. Thank you. Okay, so I'm going to stop here. Thank you. Thanks, Alex. That's a great talk, as usual. It's really very nice. Unfortunately, I lost you for a couple of minutes. I lost the internet connection, not you, but I lost the internet connection for two minutes when you're talking about the point vortices. But I have also noticed, and with it, I lost a question that was posted by someone, and I cannot. By someone, and I cannot find it anymore. But I think the question was: is this, can you say something about the condition for the absence of eigenvalues? I think that was the question. If somebody who asked the question can post it again, that would be great. Is there any criterion for the eigenvalue condition? Okay, thank you. And then there's another. It's pretty easy to check. It's pretty easy to check. Yeah, it can have various criterias like. Yeah, it can have various criterians, like if it's convex, things like that. If it's convex, it's definitely true. But it's pretty easy to check because this is, if you look at how the condition is. Yeah, so convex, things like that, it's like if you look at the condition, it's written here. So LK of F is B of Y. B of Y is just a function. It's basically a multiplication operator. And here we have a compact perturbation. So it's actually pretty easy to check. There are many, in many cases, In many cases, it's possible to show that there are no eigenvalues. B double prime having the science of convexity, I'm sure it's a good one. In our case, it's not quite possible because the B double prime has to vanish on the boundary. Yes, indeed. So there are the conditions one can write if you just want to check, like if you look at the function b and you want to say whether that satisfies or not. There's also the condition that b has to be increasing, so you cannot say that b is equal to y squared. equal to y squared. So the problem where b of y will be equal to y squared, that's not covered in this case. B has to be increasing, strictly increasing. Okay, I must say that the condition that P double prime is zero outside this small interval is I don't see Is I don't see where the smallness. I mean, can you elaborate a little bit about this condition? I was confused by it. So B double prime is equal to zero near the boundary. The thing that Vargas is. But you are on the real line, no? I'm on the interval zero, one. On the real line, you don't need it. On the real line, you don't need it. So you are really getting, okay, so you are in the case where Y, okay. Y is in between zero and one. For me, it's more important to have finite energies. For me, it's more important to have finite energy solutions than to have fewer conditions. So, if you think that it has to be finite energy to count as a physical solution, then this is in a finite channel in order to have finite energy. And then we have to assume that the boundary does not does not, the effect of the boundary. So, if you look at the equation, V double prime of y being equal to. B double prime of y being equal to zero means that this term disappears. And so near the boundary, we don't otherwise, otherwise, the boundary contributes not be consistent to the mechanism. It's also an interesting problem to see, but it's known that it's not possible to have this in VC damping if you have contributions of the boundary. It's not compatible. On the other hand, if you're on the real line, that was the. So if you're on the real line, you don't need to assume that. I think you can just assume. Right, that's what I was thinking of. Can just right, that's what I was thinking of. Okay, so that's fine. Somebody, I think Zehab, you said someone else has a question because I can't see all the questions. Oh, question. Can we get a similar control to the continuous spectral part of the solution omega in case of presence of discrete eigenvalues? No. No, no, we need to assume that there are no discrete eigenvalues. Otherwise, there's a problem at the linear level. This is a linear condition. But if you put a projection on the equation to the continuous eigenvalue part of the operator, I think the linear operator will behave better. Yes, but the projection, the non-linear flow is not going to respect the projection. not going to respect the projection the projection is not going to respect the it's not going to want to it's going to develop this kind of modes that don't decay the the non-linear is not going to respect the projection so yeah the answer is the answer is no if you want to have it has to be like that it has to be a strong strong condition on the absence of the absence of eigenfunctions Alex, there is another question that is about if the vortices would combine in Euler. That's an interesting problem. So I don't know what the answer is. One has to find the right combination. I don't think if you just have a random combination, it's going to stay stable. But I think it might be possible that if you have point vortices that are combined, some combinations of point vortices and the right kind of combination. Combination, it might be possible. We haven't looked at it. So in my mind, this was basically a step towards solving the smooth vortex, the small vortex problem. But I think there might be an interesting question if you have combinations of vortices. If you can have combinations that are stable. I don't know. If you can have combinations that are non-linearly stable. Linearly, I'm pretty sure. Linearly stable. Linearly, I'm pretty sure it can be done, but non-linearly, I don't know. But so it was my question. So in the movie, you have vortices coming and then forming a new vortex. Yes. So my question was also, is it something due to the vorticity or to the viscosity or is it something? No, I think the viscosity cleans it up in the sense that you eliminate the small scales. But there is some. But there is some, it it's harder to see. It's harder to see that So of course you could say that this all of this program you could say is in it's it's an inviscid limit program as well. So once once one proves these things about if one proves a statement about a statement like that about vortices for Euler, one could in principle prove the same thing about vortices for Navier. Same thing about volts for Navier stocks with small perturbations, one could hope to prove. So, the picture is so the simulation is done for Navier stocks because it's simple. I think it's the kind of thing that one can hope to have something like this for without any viscosity. It's harder to see because you have small scales, so you don't kill the small scales. kill the small scales. But at the same time, you know, if one could prove the, if one can basically prove the stability of vortices or the formation of vortices for any small for any small viscosity like that, I think that would be very interesting too. Okay, Alex, there is a question for you, and now I see the questions again. So it's Michael Weinstein. Michael, do you want to ask the question? Sure. Just do you have any speculation? Do you have any speculation about what the dynamics actually are if the discrete spectral condition is violated? No. No, I have no, I don't think one can raise the question of non-linear stability. You need to have linear stability in order to be able to talk about the non-linear stability. So, um, but isn't it possible that you will have that? Sorry, go ahead, Michael. Yeah, could. Yeah, could the say nonlinear harmonics that come from these additional spectral components actually destroy the stability? I think so, yeah. I think you could you'd expect that there is no non-linear stability if there is no good linear stability. That's the only way you can hope to prove non-linear stability. Prove for the non-linear stabilities if we have a very good picture of linear stability. So, there isn't something like a resonant radiation damping or anything like that that can happen? I don't think there's, you know, it's a little bit speculative because I haven't thought about it, but no, I don't think there is. I think basically it's a transport equations. No, I think once you start getting to solutions that don't decay, That don't decay, you don't really expect nonlinear stability. Already, the whole mechanism is extremely delicate the way it works. To make it work, it's quite delicate. So if I'm not, I don't think any work has been done if you don't have linear stability, to prove non-linear stability. Thank you. Okay. Any further questions? Questions okay, Alex, thanks again. It was truly a very, very nice talk. Thanks a lot, Jacob and Alex. It's been a great day so far. And anyone who would like to chat, feel free. The video, the first one, has been posted, and I presume the second one will be posted very soon. So enjoy.
