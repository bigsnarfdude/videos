My name is Ashley Cooper. I work for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in Ottawa, Canada, and I did my PhD at Carleton University here in Ottawa. So I'm going to speak today about investigating the limits of detection of AMR in agri-food metagenomics. Everybody can see my screen okay? Just a brief, perfect. Perfect. So, just briefly, my work focuses mainly on foodborne bacteria. Obviously, we monitor food products in Canada for these foodborne pathogens, and food products may contain bacteria, and many often require bacteria for production. Foodborne infection or infectious diarrhea or gastroenteritis may be caused by these bacteria in food products, and symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and dehydration. And they can be caused by different. Hydration. And they can be caused by different microorganisms. The main focus of our work here is on V-tex, so varatoxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella. We also do some work looking at Listeria monocytogenes. And at present, although gastroenteritis is unpleasant, many people do not consider it life-threatening. So most people won't actually seek treatment unless they've had these symptoms for a few days and they're really starting to see effects. Sorry, it's not letting me. Not letting me move to the next slide. Okay, so this is a figure from a CDC article in 1999. My pointer isn't letting me, there we go, move. Just to kind of highlight the importance of antimicrobials. So before antibiotics, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and gastroentritis were actually among the leading causes of death. Were actually among the leading causes of death among humans. But after the introduction of antibiotics, the discovery of penicillin in 1928, and the purification and use in the 1940s, we saw a shift in the leading causes of death from these communicable bacterial infections to non-communicable diseases. And although there are probably some other reasons that this could have occurred, including better food and hygienic practices, obviously antibiotics played a Obviously, antibiotics played a major role in this shift. If you look at this diagram here at the top, we have when the antibiotic ornament proba was discovered or deployed for clinical use, and below is when the antibiotic resistance was first observed along this timeline. And as you can see, unfortunately, often very soon after the discovery of an antimicrobial, we've observed resistance to that antimicrobial. To that antimicrobial. Monitoring AMR occurs in many countries. They've developed different programs for surveillance and identification of emerging AMR threats, and these programs often monitor use and AMR in select bacteria. So some of the major pathogens, such as E. coli and salmonella. CPARS is the Canadian version, NARMS is the US FDA equivalent, and then we have EarsNet in Europe. Equivalent, and then we have ears net in Europe. But it's important to note that not any not all antimicrobials are considered equal among these departments. They're prioritized based on their importance in human medicine. So, for example, the carpapenems are considered critically important. They're last resort antibiotics that are used to treat infections where other antimicrobials have not worked. And both Health Canada and the World Health Organization have different criteria to categorize which antimicrobials. To categorize which antimicrobial is the most important. So, this also affects which AMR genes or AMR we consider to be most important. Unfortunately, antimicrobial resistance has been on the rise, not only in Canada, but around the world. You can see these graphs here from one of the Canadian antimicrobial resistance surveillance system reports that there's been a steady increase in healthcare-associated or hospital-associated carbapenem nase-producing enterobacteria ACA in Canada. As well, here the graph on the Canada. As well, here the graph on the left is showing the number of isolates with these critically important or these highly important carbapenamase genes that we monitor. So one of the questions we've been addressing with the research and development division here is why is this AMR increasing? Currently, blame is misuse and overprescription in both medicine and agriculture and subsequent dissemination into the environment. However, there are still some conflicting reports. However, there are still some conflicting reports linking antimicrobial use to agriculture and spread of resistance throughout the food chain. But if agricultural use of antimicrobials is a driver of AMR, should we be monitoring AMR in foods? The food production is conducted along a continuum. Anthropogenic activities connect all of these different environments. The amount of processing of the food product obviously depends on the product. The food product obviously depends on the product. So, yogurt, dairy might have more food processing than, say, fruit and vegetable products. But bacteria can still spread between these environments, not only just within the food products, but also in these processing activities. So our food testing practices currently monitor products for select pathogenic bacteria, Listeria, VTech, Salmonella. But should we be looking at other organisms? Should we be looking at other organisms as well for monitoring AMR? How do we fill in these gaps in AMR surveillance and food testing? Current methods include isolation and phenotyping. However, these are very time consuming. But food inspection activities already target specific pathogenic bacteria. And do we see AMR in these? Do we see AMR and critically important AMR in salmonella? And can we just leverage these current food testing activities and use this data to monitor AMR in foods? Foods. So, we did an analysis and we're redoing this analysis of the NCBI pathogen detection database, which is basically just large metadata tables from these different organisms to see what sources we were seeing AMR in based on data submitted from around the world. This graph here is split into two genes. This is looking at the analysis by gene. On the left, we have the organism. Sometimes it's just the genus, sometimes it's genus. The genus, sometimes it's genus species. And the x-axis here is the percentage of resistance isolates. The size of the bubble is the number of isolates that were included in that metadata. And then the color of the bubbles is the isolation source. So what's important to note here is Salmonella, which is one of the organisms that we are constantly monitoring foods for, we actually don't see really elevated levels of particular AMR genes or AMR in Salmonella. However, when we look at other Enterobacteriaceae, which we also encounter in foods, but we don't currently Encounter in foods, but we don't currently monitor for. We do see elevated levels of AMR in some of these critically important resistance genes in these other entrobacteria ACA. So to answer the question of do we see AMR in all of these food inspection activity bacteria, can we leverage this data? Not really. We're going to have to either use other methods to select and isolate other foodborne bacteria if we want to monitor AMR, or find other high-throughput. AMR or find other high-throughput methods. So one of the options for high-throughput methods was using metagenomics. Two or three of the objectives of my PhD work was looking at the concordance between the genotype and phenotype in predicting resistance, investigating resistance transmission, and then also determining suitable high-throughput methods, so metagenomics, to monitor resistance in agri-food production. And I'll speak briefly about the first objective and the last objective today. So objective one. So objective one, we looked at whether sequence coverage or format, so raw versus assembled in isolate whole genome sequences affected AMR predictions. We have a baseline survey here in Canada where we survey certain products. So back in 2011 to 2013, I believe we were doing surveillance of chicken and isolated thousands of salmonella. So we took 111 of these salmonella, some of which had AM resistance. Which had AM resistance, some of which didn't, did phenotyping and sequencing. And then we also conducted sub-sampling of these isolates after we knew what the phenotype was supposed to be in vitro. For these sub-sampled isolates, we assembled a few of them. We also looked at the detection of AMR genes in raw reads and assemblies using a variety of tools. And these are publicly available bioinformatic tools. So ResFind. Informatic tools. So, ResFinder by the Center for Genomic Epidemiology, you can analyze FASTA files, KMA, which is one of my new favorite tools, you can do both FASTA and raw read data, SRSC2, and CARD RGI. And overall, we found that there actually wasn't a difference in isolate whole genome sequences. Really, it comes down to what your database is, but all of these tools perform equally well. What was important is that we determined that approximately 10 to 15-fold coverage is required in order to. 15-fold coverage is required in order to reliably detect your antimicrobial resistance gene. And by reliably detect, we mean 100% of the time. If you look here, the graph on the right, the full genome coverage is on the x-axis. And if we're using a gene identity cutoff, so your target gene, for example, CMY, BLAC CMY, of 90%, you need this 10 to 15-fold genome coverage. However, if you use a lower gene identity cutoff, you can sometimes get away with detecting the gene at five-fold genome coverage, which will be important. Five-fold because genome coverage, which will be important for metagenomics. We also looked at assembled versus raw data. So, a subset of these genomes are sub-sampled and assembled using two different tools, SCISA and SPADES. Schiza is slightly more conservative, so it produces assemblies with high base-level accuracy and is more likely to toss out fragments that it's unsure of compared to spades. Overall, we found that there were minimal differences between the raw, between the assemblies and raw data at the higher coverage levels, especially. Higher coverage levels, especially. However, these differences were gene and coverage dependent. So we moved on to looking at high-throughput methods and metagenomics in particular. Can metagenomics be used to detect ARGs in agri-food samples? And if so, what is the limit of detection of metagenomics for detecting genes of interest? Metagenomics has the potential to bypass enrichment and isolation of individual organisms. It's important to note that some of our current isolation techniques require Isolation techniques require days, if not a full week. For example, salmonella, you have to do a non-selective pre-enrichment and buffered peptone water, followed by two different selective enrichments, plating and confirmation by PCR. And for food inspection, where we're going to potentially recall a product, you have to have a live isolate. These methods, though, the methods that are good and work well, so for Salmonella and VTEC, can often detect one colony format unit in a sample in a 20. Colony forming unit in a sample, in a 25-gram sample. But what is the limit of detection for antimicrobial resistance genes and these isolates and metagenomic sequences? Does an organism need to be present above a certain threshold in order to be detected in this sequence? We determined in objective one that 10 to 15-fold coverage was needed for consistent IRG detection. And what's the likelihood that you're going to have an organism that's present at a high enough abundance with this coverage to obtain this coverage level in metagenomics? So, again, we sub-sampled. So again, we subsampled foodborne pathogen holding sequences and mixed them together. Then we did taxonomic assignments with Kraken 2, BRCAN, Metaflan 3, again, all publicly available tools, and antimicrobial resistance detection with two different tools because these allow us to investigate raw REIT data instead of assembling. The first thing we noted was the accuracy of organism detection in metagenomes depends on the tool you used. So Kraken 2, a recent publication found Kraken 2, a recent publication found that Kraken 2 reported what they called phantom taxa. So on the right here, I've subsampled a pure E. coli whole genome sequence. And you can see that as the genome coverage increases, the assigned OTUs also increases. What's concerning is closely related organisms such as Salmonella and Shigella also follow a similar pattern of increased assigned OTUs. And when we looked at whether these And when we looked at whether these were significantly different or not, there was no significant difference between the slope of these regression lines between the isolate that I know is in this culture versus these other closely related organisms. This is important for food inspection activities because we're looking for a single CFU, a single colony forming unit in a sample. So if you're looking at this data, are you going to assume that you do have a salmonella present when actually, in fact, A salmonella present when actually, in fact, you just had E. coli present in your sample, you can't really recall a product with that information. However, results are method-dependent. We didn't see the same results with MetaFlan3. However, MetaFlan3 did report fewer taxa overall and classified fewer reads, and it really struggled to assign reads for very low abundance taxa. We then looked at We then looked at detection of antimicrobial resistance genes in these different mock metagenomes that we created. So the graph on the right here, I've just included the two-fold coverage and the ten-fold coverage. The top panel is the target gene. So that's the specific allele that I know I included in my mock metagenome. The middle is a target CLAID, so it's closely related to approximately 90% identical to, for example, the CMY2. To, for example, the CMY2. So CMY44 is within the same family as CMY2, so it confers very similar resistance patterns. And then non-target are these other genes, are there other alleles that aren't as closely related to the target gene, but may confer resistance to lower-level antimicrobials? For example, a non-target CMY would be the chromosomal CMY78, since found in Citrobacter, which might confer resistance to penicillins and first and second generation cephalos. And first and second generation cephalosporins in some cases, but not necessarily the third and fourth generation cephalosporins like CMY2 might. The x-axis has the different target template identities. So because we were looking at metagenomes, instead of just giving a strict cutoff of 80% or 90%, which is typically done for whole genome sequences, I looked at the different levels. If I lower my target identity, can I detect the gene in these lower abundance organisms that I've included? And then on the y-axis, we have whether... And then on the y-axis, we have how often the gene was detected. So, when we hit 10-fold coverage, you can see that we're detecting the gene almost all of the time using both tools. So, KMA and SRST2. And one thing I forgot to mention is KMA will only allow the best mapped gene or allele to be reported, whereas SRSC2 allows your reads to map to multiple genes. SRSC2 is the Xs. So, using both tools, So, using both tools with the target gene at 10-fold coverage present in the sample, we're detecting the gene pretty much all the time. What's concerning is using SRST2, which allows your reads to be mapping to multiple targets, you're also having detection in some of your metagenomes of these other non-target alleles, which are not present in the sample. So, if you were looking at this metagenome from a food inspection perspective or from an animal resistance perspective, and you had used SRSC2, you might actually think that you had a multi- Think that you had a multi-metagenome or a sample that had a lot of different resistances when, in fact, you just had that one CMY2 gene and your reader mapping to other alleles. Another important thing we found was at lower coverage levels, sometimes you are detecting your AMR gene at these lower target template identities. So it's possible that when using metagenomes, instead of having that strict cutoff of 80 to 90%, we could You know, 80 to 90 percent, we could look at these other different template identities and determine and suggest that maybe those were present at a lower abundance. But is that a slippery slope? Is that appropriate for metagenomics and for reporting? So some things to consider, especially in the food inspection context, is a metagenome of about approximately 40 million reads where all reads are bacterial. So it's a very clean sample. You have a So, it's a very clean sample. You have an expert technician who's able to just get bacterial reads. A 5 million basic organisms such as Salmonella would need to constitute about 0.8% of the metagenome in order to be present at that 10-fold coverage, which isn't too bad. But in complex matrices like we see in agri-foods, so lettuce samples, meat samples, feed samples, often only 10% of your sequencing reads are going to map to bacteria. So your salmonella is going to need to be approximately 8% of the reads in that metagenome. And what's the likelihood that And what's the likelihood that in a rinsed sample or even in an enriched sample, your target organism encoding that antimicrobial resistance gene is going to be present at such a high abundance? And the fewer the number of bacterial reads in your metagenome, the higher the proportion that target you're looking for must constitute in order to accurately detect erges. So overall, we know WGS is advantageous where many genes can confer a phenotype, and it's actually extremely advantageous when you're looking at individual genes. Advantageous when you're looking at individual isolates because where you as you would have to use multiple multiplex PCRs or key PCRs to determine which genes were present sequencing you can get your answer in one shot. We also know that commensal foodborne bacteria facilitate transfer of AMR plasmids and AMR genes and that we actually see elevated levels of resistance in these commensal foodborne bacteria in comparison to the current target pathogens. But currently, But currently, our opinion is that metagenomics methods may not yet be sensitive enough for ARG surveillance in these complex samples from a food surveillance context. Because again, we're not going to recall a product unless we can detect that one colony forming unit of salmonella in that sample. However, if the goal is just to detect the loud, highly abundant signals, you just want to know what genes are present at a really high level, then metagenomics is fine. But techniques that are currently being developed to remove eukaryotic DHS. Are currently being developed to remove eukaryotic DNA or selectively enrich, such as bait capture methods, will significantly improve detection of AMR in metagenomic samples. And I went very quickly, but that's the end of my talk if anybody has questions. Hey, thanks for a great talk. Ashley, I was just curious if you can touch on the number of different genes that are known to be involved with resistance in these different foodborne pathogens because it looked like. Pathogens because it looked like you were focusing on a couple of very specific ones in this talk. We focus a lot on ESBLs because the project this work is a part of, the GRDI AMR, from a public health perspective, the ESBL genes are what we're seeing in clinic more often and they're more important. We do see a lot of tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance as well in foodborne bacteria, but from a public but from a public health perspective again they're just not super interesting to us and as for the actual number of genes and alleles i mean they're definitely in the hundreds or thousands but i don't know specifically however there's also things we don't we haven't really talked about um snips so you know nucleotide porphisms and the resistance those confer um but again you need to know the actual But again, you need to know the actual isolate and the context of that isolate if you were going to report on that resistance. So for metagenomics, it's probably not useful. Okay, thank you. Hi, Ashley. Can you hear me? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, this is Sam in Waxaka. Thank you for a great presentation. I was just wondering, and forgive me if I've misinterpreted this. It looked like certain genes were harder to detect, even if you had the same level of coverage. Had the same level of coverage, just one certain AMR genes. I'm just wondering why that might be if you were, if you have the same level of coverage, you're trying to detect two different genes. Why would it be more difficult to detect one than the other? It's likely some genes are, I mean, I haven't actually found any publications on this, but I've noticed that some genes are more likely to be present in multiple copies or on multiple plasmids. So, again, those tetracycline genes, often if I have an organism with multiple plasmids, for example, a Klebsiella, I might see A Klebsiella, I might see TET A on two of the plasmids. So I think that, you know, even though I'm sub-sampling, because it's already present at a higher coverage electrical, there's more reads mapping to those genes. That's why we're detecting it more often. Okay, thank you. Oh, sorry. No, no, no, you go, go. Okay, go ahead. Okay, go ahead. Hey, I was wondering, I was interested in your analysis using Kraken, where you saw an increase in assignments to the non-target bacterial species. I was wondering if you have at all looked into which genes get misassigned by Creighton? No, I have not. We do have a collaborator. So we did a large. So, we did a large project where we actually have done the in-lab in vitro method alongside metagenomics and QPCR as well. And she has a method where she basically has taken out all of the reads that are mapping to Salmonella before doing the assignment in the samples that we know we spiked with Salmonella. But I don't really have data on that yet. So, it is in the works, and someone is looking at it. She's also using some. Looking at it. She's also using some specific salmonella marker genes to see if maybe that helps with limited detection, but I don't know much about the differences in the database between metaflanthri and kraken. Hi, Ashley. It's Jesse in Oaxaca. Thanks for a great talk. Very clear and succinct as well. So we have time for questions. So yeah. As you said, you know, you're for food inspection, you're never going to recall a product without, I guess, you know, a culture positive, a colony culture-positive salmonella or E. coli or something like that, right? So it seems unlikely that you would actually recall something based on metagenome sequencing. So I guess I'm wondering, like, how, you know, how, is there a place for this in the pipeline? And could you do sort of general metagenomic screening? General metagenomic screening as a first step of many, many samples and even shallow sequencing, where you might have a lot of false negative detections, but then occasionally you basically see some kind of outlier, whether it's in terms of pathogen taxa or in terms of AMR genes. And that would just be a signal to follow up and actually do some culturing. So I guess is, I don't know, that's just off the top of my head, but is. I don't know. That's just off the top of my head. But how are you thinking of this sort of maybe fitting into a broader kind of pipeline? Yeah, I mean, it would have to be done, like you said, in parallel. So do you rinse the sample or do you do the pre-enrichment and you sequence it using metagenomics? And if it's a positive, continue on with the selective steps. But then the other issue becomes how long does it take to get your metagenome? Because how long can the broth survive in the fridge before Pseudomonas takes over your culture? Pseudomonas takes over your culture and you lose your salmonella altogether. We are working on a project using a new sequencing technology called TELSEQ, which is basically there's some kind of enzyme linking using beads. So you get long read-like data from short-read sequencing. So that's another possibility to help with screening. So you're not just looking for the needle in the haystack. Hopefully, you know, your reads are kind of mapping together and you can actually assemble it and assign it. But currently, they do do a QPCR screening step of their selective enrichment broths, and then they'll continue on with the method if they get a positive. However, that's still a couple days into the method. So there is potential that as metagenomics advances, they'll use it as a pre-screening, but I'm not sure that it's there quite yet. Right. Yeah. Thank you.
